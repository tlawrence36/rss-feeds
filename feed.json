      "Female racing pioneer Mary McGee has died at the age of 87",
      "GARDNERVILLE, Nev. -- Mary McGee, a female racing pioneer and subject profiled in an Oscar-contending documentary \u201cMotorcycle Mary,\u201d has died, her family said. She was 87.",
      "\u201cMcGee\u2019s unparalleled achievements in off-road racing and motorcycle racing have inspired generations of athletes that followed in her footsteps,\u201d her family said in a statement.",
      "The family said McGee died of complications from a stroke at her home in Gardnerville, Nevada, on Wednesday, the day before the release of the short documentary \u201cMotorcycle Mary\u201d on ESPN\u2019s YouTube channel. Seven-time Formula 1 champion Lewis Hamilton was an executive producer on the film, which became available globally on Thursday. Its premiere was at the Tribeca Festival in June.",
      "\u201cMary embodied resilience, grace, and optimism,\u201d McGee\u2019s family wrote on social media. \u201cShe was a historic athlete and a motorsports pioneer who embraced life\u2019s challenges, cared deeply for others, and made time to brighten the lives of those around her. While we are deeply saddened by this loss, we are comforted knowing that her light will continue to shine in everyone she touched.\u201d",
      "McGee had an accomplished racing resume, first in auto racing and later in motorcycle racing. She became the first person \u2014 man or woman \u2014 to complete the grueling Baja 500 off-road race in Mexico solo, which she did in 1975.",
      "The film about her was directed by Haley Watson. Two-time Oscar winner Ben Proudfoot also was an executive producer.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m deeply saddened by this news, but I am comforted to know that Mary was surrounded by friends and family at the time of her passing,\" Watson said. \u201cIn early 2022, I was researching stories when I came across Mary\u2019s. That discovery marked the tipping point into uncovering a much larger and truly incredible career in motorsports and life journey.\u201d",
      "Shortly after her family announced her death, Hamilton paid tribute on his Instagram account: \u201cI\u2019m deeply saddened to hear that Mary McGee, the first woman to road race motorcycles in the U.S and the first person to solo the Baja 500 has passed on,\" Hamilton wrote. \u201cMy condolences to her family and everyone who she\u2019s inspired. Her legacy will live on as a trailblazer in the world of motorsports and beyond.\u201d",
      "Born in Juneau, Alaska, during World War II, McGee and her older brother were sent to Iowa to live with their grandparents. Her brother became a race car driver and encouraged his sister to take up the sport, even though it was almost unprecedented for women at that time.",
      "Racing team owner Vasek Polak persuaded McGee to drive a Porsche Spyder, and she won races. Polak later persuaded her to try motorcycle racing and she also excelled.",
      "Steve McQueen, the late actor and racing enthusiast, was the one who persuaded McGee to take part in the Baja 500.",
      "McGee was the first woman to race motocross in the United States, the first to compete in an international motocross competition and the first to receive sponsorships from major brands.",
      "She was one of the most influential women in the history of motorsports and known for her mentorship of other women in racing.",
      "McGee was inducted into the AMA Motorcycle Hall of Fame in 2018.",

      "\u201cBut they don\u2019t have to be the voice of their country. They have the need to have the freedom to express their own personal vision,\u201d he added.",
      "Among the themes that Bonhomme is excited about in this year's films is family. Filmmakers, including \u201cThe Seed of the Sacred Fig\u201d director Mohammad Rasoulof, are \u201cexploring social and political impact through the scale of a family,\u201d Bonhomme said.",

      "The festival \u2014 founded by Morocco's King Mohammed VI and is presided over by his brother Prince Moulay Rachid \u2014 plays a major role in showcasing and promoting Moroccan films and directors.",
      "It has rarely shied away from diverse subject matter and this year will screen Moroccan films about immigration, homosexuality, bar performers and Moroccan communist Jews."

      "Former TV host Charlie Rose has resolved a sexual harassment lawsuit brought by three women in the wake of his #MeToo-era ouster from CBS News in 2017 and the cancellation of his long-running, eponymous PBS talk show",
      "NEW YORK -- Former TV host Charlie Rose has resolved a sexual harassment lawsuit brought by three women in the wake of his #MeToo-era ouster from CBS News in 2017 and the cancellation of his long-running, eponymous PBS talk show.",
      "In settling, the plaintiffs said they assign no \u201cill intent\u201d to Rose and realize now that his conduct could be subject to interpretation.",
      "Lawyers for Rose and the women \u2014 younger employees who accused him of \u201cpredatory behavior\u201d and \u201cblatant and repeated sexual harassment\u201d \u2014 filed court papers this week confirming that the lawsuit has been resolved. An online court docket listed the case as settled. The terms were not disclosed.",
      "The lawsuit had been set to go to trial Monday in Manhattan after years of sparring over the women's allegations and the dismissal of their retaliation claims against Rose.",
      "Plaintiffs Katherine Brooks Harris, Sydney McNeal and Yuqing Wei said in a statement that the litigation process and the required pretrial exchange of evidence known as discovery had enabled both sides to \"better understand each others\u2019 points of view.\"",
      "\u201cOn reflection, and after having the benefit of discovery, we realize that different people could interpret the conduct in different ways, and therefore we have resolved the claims,\u201d the women said. \"We do not assign any bad motive or ill intent to Charlie Rose.\u201d",
      "A lawyer for Rose, 82, and his production company, Charlie Rose Inc., declined comment.",
      "The veteran TV host has apologized in the past for his behavior, including in a statement on the eve of his November 2017 firing after at least eight women had come forward to accuse him of misconduct.",
      "\u201cIt is essential that these women know I hear them and I deeply apologize for my inappropriate behavior,\" Rose said. \"I am greatly embarrassed. I have behaved insensitively at times, and I accept responsibility for that, though I do not believe that all of these allegations are accurate. I always felt that I was pursuing shared feelings, even though I now realize I was mistaken.\u201d",
      "Rose\u2019s downfall was part of America\u2019s #MeToo reckoning with sexual misconduct by powerful figures \u2014 a social media-fueled movement that also took down \u201cToday\u201d host Matt Lauer and movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, among others.",
      "Rose is now hosting an interview show on YouTube where his recent guests have included author Michael Lewis and broadcaster Bob Costas.",
      "Harris, McNeal and Wei sued Rose and CBS in state court in New York in May 2018, about six months after CBS fired him as an anchor on its morning show, then called \u201cCBS This Morning,\u201d and PBS and Bloomberg Television dropped his nightly \u201cCharlie Rose Show.\u201d",
      "Harris was a broadcast associate at \u201cCBS This Morning,\u201d and she later worked as an associate producer for Rose's PBS show. McNeal was Rose's executive assistant. Wei was a news associate and later an anchor assistant for Rose at \u201cCBS This Morning.\u201d",
      "The women, all in their early 20s when they were hired, accused the much older Rose of subjecting them to repeated physical and verbal sexual harassment, including inquires about their sex lives and boasts about his own. They accused CBS of knowingly failing to prevent Rose's harassment.",
      "CBS settled in December 2018 for an undisclosed sum. The network said at the time that the women had requested the terms be kept confidential.",
      "Had the lawsuit gone to trial, Rose's lawyer said in court papers that he would challenge the credibility of Harris, McNeal and Wei's claims with evidence showing they had previously expressed little or no concern about the ex-anchor.",
      "Among the evidence, lawyer Jonathan Bach wrote in a Nov. 13 filing, were documents showing that Wei told a CBS human resources officer that she experienced nothing \u201csexually inappropriate\u201d while working for Rose and that McNeal confided in her therapist at the time that she had no personal experience of sexual harassment by Rose.",
      "Other evidence cited by Bach showed that Harris had told her therapist that any harassment by Rose was \u201cvery subtle\u201d and that she wrote to Rose two months after working for him that his interactions with her were \u201calways professional and respectful.\u201d"

      "VIENNA -- The Vienna sausage stand is a place where the street sweeper, the manager, the tourist and the celebrity converge for the same tasty snack. Now it also has the official stamp of approval as part of Austria's heritage.",
      "The culture of the humble \u201cW\u00fcrstelstand\u201d became this week one of the latest additions to the national list of intangible cultural heritage, overseen by the Austrian UNESCO Commission. It joins the Austrian capital's distinctive wine taverns, or \u201cHeurigen,\u201d which have been listed since 2019, and the city's famous coffee house culture, which was honored in 2011.",
      "The W\u00fcrstelstand, which can now point to a history going back generations, is more than just a source of greasy gastronomic satisfaction.",

      "\u201cOriginally it was just a bucket with hot water in which the sausages used to swim,\" he said. They were sold from \"small carriages drawn by dogs and bigger ones drawn by horses, later by a VW bus or a tractor to their spot.\u201d",
      "The tradition goes back to the pre-World War I days of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, when former soldiers set up mobile cookshops to make a living. The city\u2019s longest-lived stall in a fixed location, W\u00fcrstelstand Leo, has been serving up sausages since 1928. The stands developed into a bigger institution after wider-ranging permission for fixed stalls was granted in 1969.",
      "It was then that the griddle was introduced and the cheesy K\u00e4sekrainer invented, Bitzinger said. \"Today that\u2019s already a classic.\u201d",
      "The UNESCO designation \u201chonors the tradition, the hospitality and the diversity of our city,\u201d Mayor Michael Ludwig said in a statement.",
      "\u201cThis title is a recognition for all those Viennese who, with their warmth and their charm, make the sausage stands more than just a snack place \u2014 a meeting place where joie de vivre and culture come together.\u201d",
      "Bitzinger said that \u201cwe have been fighting a long time for this.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe special thing about it is that it\u2019s a form of gastronomy everybody can afford,\" he said. \"Here the general director and, during the opera ball, a celebrity stands next to a worker and the street sweeper who just finished cleaning the street. That unites people.\u201d",

      "NBC\u2019s Al Roker walked part of the route before joining co-hosts Savannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb outside the store for the remainder of the live TV coverage. \"Wicked\" film star Cynthia Erivo presented the retiring Kotb with flowers to commemorate what could be her last parade broadcast.",
      "The rain didn't stop anything \u2014 the parade has only been canceled three times, from 1942 to 1944 during World War II \u2014 but organizers monitored wind speeds to make sure the big balloons were safe to fly.",
      "Temperatures hovered near 50 degrees F (10 degrees C), with rain throughout the morning and winds around 10 mph (16 kph), well within the acceptable range for letting Snoopy, Bluey and their friends soar. City law prohibits Macy\u2019s from flying full-size balloons if sustained winds exceed 23 mph (37 kph) or wind gusts are over 35 mph (56 kph)."

    "story": [
      "Donald Trump is coming back to the White House, but don't expect another \u201cFire and Fury,\u201d or much fire and fury in book publishing in general",
      "NEW YORK -- As she anticipates her estranged uncle's return to the White House, Mary Trump isn't expecting any future book to catch on like such first-term tell-alls as Michael Wolff's million-selling \u201cFire and Fury\u201d or her own blockbuster, \u201cToo Much and Never Enough.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat else is there to learn?\u201d she says. \u201cAnd for people who don't know, the books have been written. It's all really out in the open now.\u201d",
      "For publishers, Donald Trump's presidential years were a time of extraordinary sales in political books, helped in part by Trump's legal threats and angered tweets. According to Circana, which tracks around 85% of the hardcover and paperback market, the genre's sales nearly doubled from 2015 to 2020, from around 5 million copies to around 10 million.",
      "Besides books by Wolff and Trump, other bestsellers included former FBI Director James Comey's \u201cA Higher Loyalty,\u201d former national security adviser John Bolton's \u201cThe Room Where it Happened\u201d and Bob Woodward's \u201cFear.\u201d Meanwhile, sales for dystopian fiction also jumped, led by Margaret Atwood's \u201cA Handmaid's Tale,\u201d which was adapted into an award-winning Hulu series.",
      "But interest has dropped back to 2015 levels since Trump left office, according to Circana, and publishers doubt it will again peak so highly. Readers not only showed little interest in books by or about President Joe Biden and his family \u2014 they even seemed less excited about Trump-related releases. Mary Trump's \u201cWho Could Ever Love You\u201d and Woodward's \u201cWar\u201d were both popular this fall, but neither has matched the sales of their books written during the first Trump administration.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been there many times, with all those books,\u201d HarperCollins publisher Jonathan Burnham says of the various Trump tell-alls. He added that he still sees a market for at least some Trump books \u2014 perhaps analyzing the recent election \u2014 because \u201cthere's a general, serious smart audience, not politically aligned in a hard way,\u201d one that would welcome \u201can intelligent voice.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like the reboot of any hit TV show,\u201d says Eric Nelson, publisher and vice president of Broadside Books, a conservative imprint of HarperCollins that's released books by Jared Kushner, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Trump Cabinet nominees Pete Hegseth and Sen. Marco Rubio. \u201cYou\u2019re not hoping for ratings like last time, just better ratings than the boring show it\u2019s replacing.\u201d",
      "In the days following Trump's victory, \u201cThe Handmaid's Tale\u201d and George Orwell's \u201c1984\u201d returned to bestseller lists, along with more contemporary works such as Timothy Snyder's \u201cOn Tyranny,\" a 2017 bestseller that expanded upon a Facebook post Snyder wrote soon after Trump defeated Hillary Clinton. Books appealing to pro-Trump readers also surged, including those written by Cabinet picks \u2014 Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s \u201cThe Real Anthony Fauci\u201d and Hegseth's \u201cThe War on Warriors\u201d \u2014 and Vice President-elect J.D. Vance's \u201cHillbilly Elegy,\u201d his 2016 memoir that's sold hundreds of thousands of copies since Trump selected him as his running mate.",
      "First lady Melania Trump's memoir, \u201cMelania,\u201d came out in October and has been high on Amazon.com bestseller lists for weeks, even as critics found it contained little newsworthy information. According to Circana, it has sold more than 200,000 copies, a figure that does not include books sold directly through her website.",
      "\u201cThe Melania book has done extraordinarily well, better than we thought,\u201d says Barnes & Noble CEO James Daunt. \u201cAfter Election Day, we sold everything we had of it.\u201d",
      "Conservative books have sold steadily over the years, and several publishers \u2014 most recently Hachette Book Group \u2014 have imprints dedicated to those readers. Publishers expect at least some critical books to reach bestseller lists \u2014 if only because of the tradition of the publishing market favoring the party out of power. But the nature of what those books would look like is uncertain. Perhaps a onetime insider will have a falling out with Trump and write a memoir, like Bolton or former Trump attorney Michael Cohen, or maybe some of his planned initiatives, whether mass deportation or the prosecution of his political foes, will lead to investigative works.",
      "A new \u201cFire and Fury\u201d is doubtful, with the originally only possible because Wolff enjoyed extraordinary access, spending months around Trump and his White House staff. Members of the president-elect's current team have already issued a statement saying they have refused to speak with Wolff, calling the author a \u201cknown peddler of fake news who routinely concocts situations, conversations, and conclusions that never happened.\u201d",
      "A publicist for Wolff said he was declining comment.",
      "Woodward, who interviewed Trump at length for the 2020 bestseller \u201cRage,\u201d told The Associated Press that he had written so much about Trump and other presidents that he wasn't sure what he'd take on next. He doesn't rule out another Trump book, but that will depend in part on the president-elect, how \u201cout of control he gets,\u201d Woodward said, and how far he is able to go.",
      "\u201cHe wants to be the imperial president, where he gets to decide everything and no one's going to get in his way,\u201d Woodward said. \u201cHe's run into some brick walls in the past and there may be more brick walls. I don't know what will happen. I'll be watching and doing some reporting, but I'm still undecided.\u201d",
      "___",
      "1. \u201cToo Much and Never Enough,\u201d by Mary Trump: 1,248,212 copies",

      "Thirty years after his death in a high-speed crash viewed by millions around the world, Formula One champion Ayrton Senna\u2019s high-octane life is also about to play out in front of a global audience",
      "SAO PAULO -- Thirty years after his death in a high-speed crash viewed by millions around the world, Formula One champion Ayrton Senna's high-octane life is also about to play out in front of a global audience.",
      "The legendary Brazilian driver \u2014 who was killed when his car hit a concrete wall at the San Marino Grand Prix in 1994 \u2014 is the subject of a six-episode Netflix series that debuts on Nov. 29 and follows him from his early go-kart days to that fatal Sunday afternoon at the Imola track in Italy.",
      "Even three decades after that accident, few F1 figures evoke as much emotion and passion among fans and fellow drivers as Senna, who won three championship titles before his death at the age of 34.",
      "Senna\u2019s complex personality \u2014 he was a saint to his millions of Brazilian fans and a sinner to some critics who deemed his driving style too aggressive \u2014 comes to life through Brazilian actor Gabriel Leone, who embraced the challenge of portraying such a popular figure.",
      "\u201cHe was much more than an F1 driver for us, he became an icon, much beyond his technique and his driving,\u201d Leone told The Associated Press in an interview in Sao Paulo. \u201cHe had this humanity, this honesty. The things he said, his values, it all made him closer to people.\u201d",
      "Senna's life and career had no shortage of made-for-TV moments.",
      "This was a driver who once won a race with his car stuck in sixth gear in front of thousands of raucous fans at the Interlagos track. And who went from fifth position to first in one lap at the 1993 European Grand Prix. And who jumped out of his car during a training session to save the life of a French driver who had crashed.",
      "On the track, his rivalry with French driver Alain Prost was one of the most intense that F1 has ever seen. Off the track, he had some high-profile relationships as well and dated several models, including Elle Macpherson.",
      "\u201cFor me as an actor, the more complex the character is, the better. It is more interesting to build him and live him. And this is quite a character, the biggest hero in Brazil, not only in sport,\u201d Leone said. \u201cAyrton was transcendent, he was more than an F1 driver. That\u2019s a guy who is the hero of great drivers in history, like (Michael) Schumacher and (Lewis) Hamilton.\u201d",
      "Senna won the drivers\u2019 championship in 1988, 1990 and 1991 with the McLaren team and moved to Williams in the year he died as the favorite to lift the title again.",
      "For Leone, though, it was also important to portray him as a person who understood his role as a national hero, who advocated for the poor and proudly waved a Brazilian flag from his cockpit during every victory lap.",
      "\u201cHe was not distant, he was close,\" said Leone, who attended a red carpet premiere in Sao Paulo on Tuesday with several other cast members and director Vicente Amorim. \"That\u2019s for Brazilians and non-Brazilians. It was like this, and it still is like this.\u201d",
      "To many international fans, Senna was simply an exceptional talent who was born to be a driver. Even former rival Martin Brundle, now a TV pundit, once likened Senna's ability to find grip on some corners to a dance seemingly innate to a Brazilian.",
      "\u201cIt is a different kind of samba that I could not do,\u201d Brundle has said.",
      "The Netflix series, however, shows some of the hard work and attention to detail that went into Senna becoming a wet-weather master.",
      "The streaming giant \u2014 which reportedly invested more than $170 million in its production \u2014 also takes a bit of liberty with the truth when it comes to building up the animosity between Senna and one of his other real-life antagonists, Jean-Marie Balestre, the French former president of F1's governing body FIA.",
      "Balestre is often accused by fans of aiding his countryman Prost in his rivalry with Senna, including at the 1984 Monaco Grand Prix by stopping the race early before the Brazilian driver could overtake his French rival in the heavy rain. And at the 1989 Japanese Grand Prix, when Senna was disqualified in a decision that handed the championship title to Prost.",
      "The Netflix series goes a step further by making Balestre (played by Arnaud Viard) the man responsible for Senna also losing a go-kart title as a youngster, long before he even entered F1.",
      "\u201cIf that was true it would be news to every reporter covering Senna\u2019s story over the last decades,\u201d said Ernesto Rodrigues, who wrote a biography on the three-time F1 champion. \u201cYes, Senna had Balestre working against him many times. But Balestre was an autocrat with other drivers, too. It wasn\u2019t exclusive.\u201d",
      "Prost, played by Matt Mella, goes from being a racing foe to a friend after his retirement in the series just like in real life. The friction between the two as McLaren teammates and then in the title-deciding races in the 1989 and 1990 seasons create some of the best moments of the series for racing fans.",
      "Three of the women in Senna\u2019s life also appear in the series.",
      "Scenes with L\u00edlian de Vasconcellos Souza, who married Senna in 1981 and divorced him the next year, help show how the Brazilian was driven to go into F1 early in his career. Xuxa Meneghel, a wildly popular TV host, is featured for a full episode as the driver\u2019s most important girlfriend. Adriane Galisteu, who was the champion\u2019s girlfriend when he died, appears for less than three minutes.",
      "Senna's importance to today's F1 drivers was on full display at the Brazilian Grand Prix this month, when Hamilton \u2014 the British seven-time F1 champion \u2014 drove one of Senna's old cars around the track as part of the tributes marking the 30th anniversary of his death.",
      "\u201cThis is the greatest honor of my life,\u201d Hamilton said on Nov. 3. \u201cI hope I made Senna proud.\u201d",

    "published": "Thu, 28 Nov 2024 01:38:17 -0500",

    "story": [
      "Police in Boulder, Colorado, are refuting assertions that there is viable evidence and leads about the 1996 killing of JonBenet Ramsey that they are not pursuing",
      "DENVER -- Amid renewed interest in the killing of JonBenet Ramsey triggered in part by a new Netflix documentary, police in Boulder, Colorado, refuted assertions this week that there is viable evidence and leads about the 1996 killing of the 6-year-old girl that they are not pursuing.",
      "JonBenet Ramsey, who competed in beauty pageants, was found dead in the basement of her family\u2019s home in the college town of Boulder the day after Christmas in 1996. Her body was found several hours after her mother called 911 to say her daughter was missing and a ransom note had been left behind. The details of the crime and video footage of JonBenet competing in pageants propelled the case into one of the highest-profile mysteries in the United States.",
      "The police comments came as part of their annual update on the investigation, a month before the 28th anniversary of JonBenet\u2019s killing. Police said they released it a little earlier because of the increased attention on the case, apparently referring to the three-part Netflix series \u201cCold Case: Who Killed JonBenet Ramsey.\u201d",
      "In a video statement, Boulder Police Chief Steve Redfearn said the department welcomes news coverage and documentaries about the killing of JonBenet, who would have been 34 this year, as a way to generate possible new leads. He said the department is committed to solving the case but needs to be careful about what it shares about the investigation to protect a possible future prosecution.",
      "\u201cWhat I can tell you though, is we have thoroughly investigated multiple people as suspects throughout the years and we continue to be open-minded about what occurred as we investigate the tips that come into detectives,\" he said.",
      "The Netflix documentary focuses on the mistakes made by police and the \u201cmedia circus\u201d surrounding the case.",
      "JonBenet was bludgeoned and strangled. Her death was ruled a homicide, but nobody was ever prosecuted.",
      "Police were widely criticized for mishandling the early investigation into her death amid speculation that her family was responsible. However, a prosecutor cleared her parents, John and Patsy Ramsey, and brother Burke in 2008 based on new DNA evidence from JonBenet's clothing that pointed to the involvement of an \u201cunexplained third party\u201d in her slaying.",
      "The announcement by former district attorney Mary Lacy came two years after Patsy Ramsey died of cancer. Lacy called the Ramseys \u201cvictims of this crime.\u201d",
      "John Ramsey has continued to speak out for the case to be solved. In 2022, he supported an online petition asking Colorado\u2019s governor to intervene in the investigation by putting an outside agency in charge of DNA testing in the case. In the Netflix documentary, he said he has been advocating for several items that have not been prepared for DNA testing to be tested and for other items to be retested. He said the results should be put through a genealogy database.",
      "In recent years, investigators have identified suspects in unsolved cases by comparing DNA profiles from crime scenes and to DNA testing results shared online by people researching their family trees.",
      "In 2021, police said in their annual update that DNA hadn\u2019t been ruled out to help solve the case, and in 2022 noted that some evidence could be \u201cconsumed\u201d if DNA testing is done on it.",
      "Last year, police said they convened a panel of outside experts to review the investigation to give recommendations and determine if updated technologies or forensic testing might produce new leads. In the latest update, Redfearn said that review had ended but that police continue to work through and evaluate a \u201clengthy list of recommendations\u201d from the panel.",

      "The warm Polynesian spirit and open-sea sense of adventure is back in \u201cMoana 2,\u201d but little of the original\u2019s humor or catchy songs finds its way into this heartfelt but lackluster sequel set three years after the original, writes Associated Press Film...",
      "The warm Polynesian spirit and open-sea sense of adventure is back in \u201cMoana 2,\u201d but little of the original\u2019s humor or catchy songs finds its way into this heartfelt but lackluster sequel set three years after the original.",
      "\u201cMoana 2,\u201d which opens in theaters Wednesday, was originally put into development as a streaming series before it was rerouted the big screen. Curiously, though, it\u2019s not scale or spectacle lacking here. Directors David Derrick Jr., Jason Hand and Dana Ledoux Miller have made an often dazzlingly animated film that is, visually, a step up from 2016\u2019s \u201cMoana.\u201d",
      "But in a story that brings in a literal boatload of new characters, it\u2019s hard to shake the feeling that \u201cMoana 2\u201d got caught in the crosswinds \u2014 too blown between shifting studio imperatives to really find its own way.",
      "That\u2019s a shame because the original \u201cMoana\u201d is about the lightest, most joyful animated movie Disney has made in a decade \u2013 with the possible exception of \u201cEncanto,\u201d which likewise bounced to the buoyant rhythms of songs by Lin-Manuel Miranda. (Miranda is crucially absent in \u201cMoana 2,\u201d though \u201cHamilton\u201d director Thomas Kail is currently developing a live-action \u201cMoana.\u201d)",
      "Photorealistic remakes have been the more dominant providence of the Magic Kingdom in recent years, a trend that\u2019s made more whimsical, imagination-filled animations like \u201cMoana\u201d all the more exceptional. Here was a movie that somehow balanced Pacific Island cultural authenticity with the cartoony delights of a demigod turned accidental shark and Jemaine Clement as a singing, flaunting giant crab. Talk about win win.",
      "Such inventiveness is harder to come by in the perfectly earnest but not especially inspired \u201cMoana.\u201d It opens with a visibly grown Moana (Auli\u2019i Cravalho, returning) engaged in a search for evidence of Pacific Islanders beyond her home island. She is by now a mythic figure, herself, to her people, idolized by youngsters for her courage and for being \u201csuper-besties\u201d with the demigod Maui (Dwayne Johnson, also back).",
      "When Moana turns up an artifact with evidence of a two-peaked island, Motufetu, fabled as the once binding center of their ancestors, she sets out to find the cursed island and reunite the disparate people of Oceania. This time, though, Moana is sailing with a more crowded boat.",
      "Some of the old sidekicks \u2014 the rooster Heihei (with noises courtesy of Alan Tudyk) and the pig Pua \u2014 are back. But Moana decides she needs human help this time, and brings along a crew featuring the uber Maui fan Moni (Hual\u0101lai Chung), the engineer Loto (Rose Matefeo) and the curmudgeonly older farmer Kele (David Fane).",
      "Each of these characters has one generic note to play, and while you could see the need to add in more personalities for a series (Moana also now has a cute little sister, voiced by Khaleesi Lambert-Tsuda), they are effectively dead weight in \u201cMoana 2.\u201d",
      "To me, the iconic image of these films is Moana as a solo adventurer, leaning against the wind in her camakau and setting an unknown course. Sure, Maui is inevitably her buddy-comedy partner in adventure, but Moana and her canoe should permit passengers no more than John Wayne did on his horse.",
      "After an encounter with the coconut brigade of the Kakamora, Moana and Maui eventually reunite via a giant clam, where Maui has been trapped by Matangai (Awhimai Fraser, having fun), a mysterious, bat-adorned figure who\u2019s a kind of villain for the movie. She\u2019s more interesting than some recent Disney antagonists and gets probably the best song (\u201cGet Lost\u201d) in a movie that mightily misses Miranda\u2019s touch. (The songs are by Abigail Barlow and Emily Bear.)",
      "That scene and the climactic one, with a sea of tornadoes spinning across stormy waters, are vividly drawn \u2014 enough, surely, to delight younger moviegoers. Coming fast on the heels of \u201cWicked,\u201d one of the most salient selling points of \u201cMoana 2\u201d may be its comparatively nimble running time. At 100 minutes, it\u2019s a full hour shorter than \u201cWicked.\u201d",
      "Ironically, \u201cMoana 2\u201d \u2014 beefed up from a would-be series \u2014 has brevity in its favor. But the hopes for \u201cMoana 2\u201d should go beyond mere placeholder. Only a few times does the banter between Moana and Maui really remind you of the fun that characterized the original. In one such moment, Moana corrects Maui after he calls her \u2014 perhaps confusing Moana for many other Disney protagonists \u2014 a princess. His comeback? \u201cWell, a lot of people think you are.\u201d",
      "\u201cMoana 2,\u201d a Walt Disney Co. release is rated PG by the Motion Picture Association for action/peril. Running time: 100 minutes. Two stars out of four."

    "summary": "After almost a year of testimony, closing statements began in the YSL gang and racketeering trial that included rapper Young Thug",
    "story": [
      "After almost a year of testimony, closing statements began in the YSL gang and racketeering trial that included rapper Young Thug",
      "ATLANTA -- Prosecutors said Monday that the last two defendants in a long-running gang and racketeering trial committed murder on behalf of an Atlanta street gang co-founded by rapper Young Thug.",
      "But defense attorneys said the state slapped together cherry-picked social media posts and song lyrics with unreliable witness testimony to paint a misleading narrative about young men from tough upbringings who tried to escape poverty through music.",
      "It\u2019s now up to a jury to decide whether to convict Shannon Stillwell and Deamonte Kendrick, who raps as Yak Gotti, on gang, murder, drug and gun charges. The original indictment charged 28 people with conspiring to violate Georgia\u2019s Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act.",
      "The trial for six of those defendants began a year ago. Four of them, including Young Thug, pleaded guilty last month. Stillwell and Kendrick rejected plea deals after weeks of negotiations, and their lawyers chose not to present evidence or witnesses.",
      "The trial has been plagued by problems and delays. Judge Paige Reese Whitaker, who took over the case in July after the original judge was recused, often lost patience with prosecutors.",
      "Kendrick and Stillwell were charged in the 2015 killing of Donovan Thomas Jr., also known as \u201cBig Nut,\u201d in an Atlanta barbershop. Prosecutors say Thomas was in a rival gang. Stillwell was also charged with the 2022 murder of Shymel Drinks in retaliation for the murders of two YSL associates days earlier, prosecutors said.",
      "Prosecutors alleged that Young Thug, whose real name is Jeffery Williams, co-founded a criminal street gang in 2012 called Young Slime Life, or YSL, which they said was associated with the national Bloods gang. Young Thug's record label is also known as YSL, for Young Stoner Life. Kendrick was featured on two popular songs from the label\u2019s compilation album Slime Language 2, \u201cTake It to Trial\u201d and \u201cSlatty,\u201d and another Young Thug song that prosecutors played during their closing.",
      "Doug Weinstein, Kendrick's defense attorney, said it was wrong for prosecutors to target the defendants \u2014 all Black \u2014 for their music and lyrics.",
      "Prosecutor Simone Hylton said the case was about \u201creal bodies,\u201d not a \u201csong over a beat.\u201d",
      "\"We are targeting gang members who decided to wreak havoc on communities in Fulton County,\" Hylton said. \u201cAnd those communities that they violated, those communities were communities of color.\u201d",
      "Prosecutor Christian Adkins said YSL was a violent gang that operated through \u201cdeception, intimidation, destruction and death.\u201d",
      "He pointed to social media posts in which he said showed members admittedly killed people in rival gangs and said their clothes and tattoos were \u201cwalking billboards\u201d for YSL.",
      "Weinstein and Stillwell's defense attorney, Max Schardt, said prosecutors threw a bunch of separate alleged crimes, many from around a decade ago, into an indictment without showing that they were connected to a criminal enterprise.",
      "\"The state has spent the past year with a hammer in their hand banging on a square peg that they call evidence,\" Schardt said.",
      "But \u201cthat square peg does not fit in that round hole,\u201d he said.",
      "Alleged YSL affiliates said during the trial they lied to police to avoid long prison sentences. Schardt theorized one of those witnesses killed Thomas. He framed Stillwell, Kendrick and others as a part of his string of lies to avoid the threat of prison, Schardt said.",
      "But Hylton said that witnesses and others lied on the stand when they were in front of the people \u201cthey snitched on,\u201d not to the police.",
      "Before he got \u201csucked up in this targeting of Jeffery Williams,\u201d Weinstein said Kendrick was focused on the rap career that helped him move on from his troubled past after plans to play football at the University of Georgia fell through.",
      "His client wasn\u2019t even in the car used in the drive-by shooting that killed Thomas, Weinstein said. But prosecutors said Kendrick was the one who alerted his counterparts about Thomas' whereabouts before he was murdered.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s just as guilty as the ones who pulled the trigger,\u201d Hylton said.",
      "Schardt said surveillance footage showed Stillwell drove away from Drinks' car before he was shot, and there was no gunshot residue found in Stillwell's vehicle. Hylton said the footage proved Stillwell fled the scene at 90 miles per hour through a red light after shooting at least three rounds into Drinks' Nissan.",
      "Nine people charged in the indictment, including rapper Gunna, accepted plea deals before the trial began. Charges against 12 others remain pending. Prosecutors dropped charges against one defendant after he was convicted of murder in an unrelated case.",
      "Jurors are expected to begin deliberations Tuesday. If they do not reach a verdict Wednesday, they will return after Thanksgiving.",

      "Spotify has been giving its listeners breakdowns of their data since 2016. And each year, it\u2019s become a bigger production \u2014 and internet sensation. Spotify said its 2023 Wrapped was the \u201cbiggest ever created,\u201d in terms of audience reach and the kind of data it provided.",
      "So, what will 2024 have in store? Here\u2019s a look at what to know ahead of this year\u2019s Spotify Wrapped.",

      "The campaign has become a social media sensation, as people share and compare their Wrapped data with their friends and followers online.",
      "Past iterations have provided users with all kinds of breakdowns and facts, including whether they\u2019re among an artist\u2019s top listeners, as well as a personalized playlist of their top 100 songs of that year to save, share and listen to whenever they\u2019re feeling nostalgic.",
      "Spotify also creates a series of playlists that reflect national and global listening trends, featuring the top streamed artists and songs. In 2023, Taylor Swift was Spotify's most streamed artist, unseating Bad Bunny who had held the title for three years in a row.",
      "Each year has something new in store. In 2019, Wrapped included a summary of users\u2019 streaming trends for the entire decade. Last year, Spotify matched listeners to a Sound Town based on their artist affinities and how it lined up with those in other parts of the world.",
      "So far, the streaming platform has kept the highly anticipated release date of Wrapped under \u2026 er, wraps.",
      "In past years, it\u2019s been released after Thanksgiving, between Nov. 30 and Dec. 6.",
      "Each year, rumors tend to swell on social media around when Spotify stops collecting data in order to prepare their Wrapped results, and this year was no exception. Spotify quickly squashed those presumptions, assuring on social media that \u201cSpotify Wrapped doesn\u2019t stop counting on October 31st.\u201d",
      "A representative for Spotify did not respond to a request for comment on when the company stops tracking data for Wrapped.",
      "When Wrapped is released, each user's Spotify account will prompt them to view their interactive data roundup. It can be accessed through the Spotify smartphone app, or by logging on to the Spotify website. Wrapped is available to users with and without Premium subscriptions.",
      "There are a handful of third-party sites that you can connect your Spotify account to that will analyze your Wrapped data.",
      "How Bad is Your Spotify is an AI bot that judges your music taste. Receiptify gives you your top songs on a sharable graphic that looks like, yes, a receipt. Instafest gives you your own personal music festival-style lineup based on your top artists. How NPRCore Are You assesses how similar your music taste is to NPR Music's.",
      "Other major streaming platforms such as Apple Music and YouTube Music have developed their own versions of Wrapped in recent years.",
      "Apple Music\u2019s Replay not only gives its subscribers a year-end digest of their listening habits but monthly summaries as well \u2014 a feature that helps differentiate itself from the one-time Spotify recap. That's released at the end of the calendar year.",
      "YouTube Music, meanwhile, has a similar end-of-the-year release for its listeners, as well as periodic seasonal releases throughout the year. It released its annual Recap for users earlier this month."

      "Bravo said in a press release Tuesday that the upcoming season would feature \u201ca new group of close-knit SUR-vers who are as complicatedly involved with one another as their iconic predecessors.\u201d",
      "The series debuted in 2013 as a spinoff to \u201cThe Real Housewives of Beverly Hills,\u201d executive produced and starring Vanderpump, a restaurateur. It focused on the personal lives of select staff at her West Hollywood restaurant, SUR, with Vanderpump in the role of both boss and maternal figure.",
      "With in-fighting, cheating scandals, changing alliances and non-stop drama, the cast seemed destined to be followed by reality TV cameras.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re 20-something and they\u2019re young and they\u2019re hot,\u201d said Vanderpump of the cast in an interview ahead of the series premiere. \u201cThey want to play and they\u2019re waiting for their dream and unfortunately their dream isn\u2019t really to work at my restaurant.\u201d",
      "Bravo did not elaborate on its decision to cast a new group, but said the cast would be announced later and the new season would go into production next year.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t thank enough those who have shared their lives. How I love you all,\u201d Vanderpump said in the statement. \u201cIn the restaurant business, one shift always gives way to another.\u201d",
      "As the original cast became more famous, they stopped working at SUR and launched their own ventures (and podcasts): Tom Schwartz and Tom Sandoval opened a restaurant and bar called TomTom with Vanderpump as a majority owner. The Toms, as they're known, branched off with different owners for a second bar called Schwartz & Sandy's \u2014 on Monday, they announced that venture would be closing its doors.",
      "In 2023, the show reached a different level of attention and wider audience with the revelation of what became known as \u201cScandoval\u201d: It was revealed that Sandoval, who lived with his longtime partner and co-star, Ariana Madix, had been having an affair with another cast member, Rachel \u201cRaquel\u201d Leviss. News broke after filming wrapped on Season 10, but cameras were picked back up to film the aftermath for an additional episode. It was followed by a three-part reunion that took place weeks after the discovery.",
      "The cast, sans Leviss, returned to filming for Season 11 with Sandoval attempting to make amends with the others. Madix would film in group scenes with Sandoval but refused to interact with him 1:1, leading to friction within the group. During this year's reunion, Madix tearfully said to Sandoval, \u201cI just want you away from me.\u201d Shortly after, it was revealed the show was \u201con pause.\u201d",

      "The scandal and its fallout, though, made Madix America\u2019s sweetheart. She received a plethora of endorsement deals, was cast on \u201cDancing with the Stars\u201d and on Broadway as Roxie Hart in \u201cChicago.\u201d She also was named the new host of \u201cLove Island USA.\u201d Earlier this year, Madix opened a sandwich shop in Los Angeles called Something About Her with another \u201cVanderpump\u201d star, Katie Maloney.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a mixed bag. But I wouldn\u2019t change a thing,\u201d said Maloney, whose rocky relationship with now-ex-husband Tom Schwartz was chronicled in the series, in an Instagram story. \u201cThank you for the memories and the love the last 11 years.\u201d",
      "\"I have such mixed feelings right now. It\u2019s no secret I do not like change. This is the exception,\u201d Lala Kent posted on Instagram. Kent previously told The Associated Press she benefited from Scandoval with the sale of merch. She \u2014 along with current and former cast members \u2014 also devoted episodes of their individual podcasts to dissecting the drama.",
      "Kent, Shay and Schwartz will make appearances on the second season of the successful \u201cVanderpump\u201d spin-off, \u201cThe Valley,\u201d which will air next year.

      "Angelina Jolie glides through the final days of Maria Callas' short life in Pablo Larra\u00edn\u2019s \u201cMaria,\u201d a dramatic, evocative elegy to the famed soprano. It\u2019s an affair that\u2019s at turns melancholy, biting and grandly theatrical, an aria for a once in a generation star.",
      "Reality is of little consequence on the stage and in \u201cMaria.\u201d It\u2019s all about the raw feeling, which serves the movie well, more dream than history lesson about La Callas. Early on, she pops some Mandrax and tells her devoted butler Ferruccio (a simply wonderful Pierfrancesco Favino) that a television crew is on the way. Are they real, he wonders.",
      "\u201cAs of this morning, what is real and what is not real is my business,\u201d she says calmly and definitively, making a feast out of Steven Knight\u2019s sharp script. It\u2019s one of many great lines and moments for Jolie, whose intensity and resolve belie her fragile appearance. And it\u2019s a signal to the audience as well: Don\u2019t fret about dull facts or that Jolie doesn\u2019t really resemble Callas all that much. This is a biopic as opera \u2014 an emotional journey fitting of the great diva, full of flair, beauty, betrayal, revelations and sorrow.",
      "In \u201cMaria,\u201d we are the companion to a protagonist with an ever-loosening grip on reality, walking with her through Paris, and her life, for one week in September 1977.",
      "The images from cinematographer Ed Lachman, playfully shifting in form and style, take us on a scattershot journey through her triumphs on stage, her scandalous romance with Aristotle Onassis (Haluk Bilginer) and her traumatic youth. In the present, at age 53, she sleeps till midday, drinks the minimal calories she ingests, goes to restaurants where the waiters know her name looking for adulation and has visions of performances staged just for her all around the city.",
      "Callas is always immaculately dressed and assured, whether reflecting to the imagined news crew (led by Kodi Smit-McPhee) or attempting to find her voice again. Her instrument had famously diminished, leaving her wondering what\u2019s left to live for. The only consistent praise she gets is from her obedient housemaid Bruna (Alba Rohrwacher). It\u2019s no secret that the destination is death. And you suspect that she knows quite well that everything will be a big dimmer when her spotlight is turned off.",
      "Larra\u00edn has made a lasting mark on cinema with his unofficial trilogy about these famous women with tragic narratives. With \u201cJackie,\u201d\u201cSpencer\u201d and now \u201cMaria,\u201d his films are also an unintentional antidote to Ryan Murphy\u2019s stranglehold of the grand dames of recent history, which are all style and scandal and little substance. And yet Larra\u00edn's films are not for everyone. If \u201cJackie\u201d and \u201cSpencer\u201d did not speak to you, did not show those women as you hoped they would, \u201cMaria\u201d will not turn you into a believer. Three movies in, it seems that audiences are either very on board with his vision or not. There is little room for an in between.",
      "And yet it's hard to deny that his films are incredible showcases for actors. Jolie as a movie star is somehow both omnipresent and elusive, and lately she chooses to step in front of the camera all too infrequently. Sometimes you wish she could just follow in Nicole Kidman\u2019s footsteps, for whom quantity does not seem to ever jeopardize quality, and she seems to be having fun doing it all, all the time. Perhaps it\u2019s because performances like Jolie\u2019s in \u201cMaria\u201d look so all-consuming.",
      "In the film, Maria scolds a fan for daring to question that she faked sickness to miss a performance. He doesn\u2019t understand the total commitment of body and soul required to make it look effortless, which is probably true. Jolie is not so dramatic, at least publicly, about what it takes to create art. But here the lines blur: Character and actor blend so seamlessly, so ferociously, that you leave not just with heightened empathy for La Callas but Jolie as well.",
      "In one of the film\u2019s few regrettable scenes, she\u2019s put face to face with John F. Kennedy (no fault of Caspar Phillipson), whose wife has caught the greedy eye of Onassis. As a testament to the power of Jolie and the script, you almost forgive yet another JFK impersonation for giving her one of the great brushoffs to utter, romantic and withering all at once. Is it all a little much? Of course, but that\u2019s kind of the point of Maria.",
      "\u201cMaria,\u201d a Netflix release in select theaters now and streaming Dec. 11, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for \u201ca sexual reference, some language.\u201d Running time: 122 minutes. Three stars out of four."

      "The move comes 18 months after a Los Angeles County judge threw out much of the 2022 suit in which Manson, whose legal name is Brian Warner, claimed Wood had fabricated public allegations that he sexually and physically abused her during their relationship and encouraged other women to fabricate their own allegations.",
      "\u201cAfter four years of fighting a battle where he was able to tell the truth, Brian is pleased to dismiss his still-pending claims and appeal in order to close the door on this chapter of his life,\" Manson attorney Howard King said in a statement.",
      "Manson had been appealing the judge's decision but his attorneys reached out to Wood's seeking a settlement in the spring. Wood's attorneys said Tuesday that she rejected requests that the terms be kept confidential.",

      "Manson agreed to pay nearly $327,000 in attorney fees for Wood.",
      "The settlement comes nearly four years into a criminal investigation of the 55-year-old Manson involving multiple women that remains unresolved. Outgoing LA County District Attorney George Gasc\u00f3n said in October that his office's sex crimes division had just discovered new evidence and that a decision on whether to file charges would be made when the picture was more complete.",
      "The women involved in the criminal case have not been identified, but \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d actor Esme Bianco has said she was among them, and criticized the district attorney for taking so long to investigate. Bianco settled her own lawsuit against Manson last year.",
      "The Associated Press does not typically name people who say they have been sexually abused unless they come forward publicly as Wood and Bianco have.",
      "Manson has denied engaging in any non-consensual sexual acts.",
      "In 2017, with the #MeToo movement gaining momentum, Wood said publicly that she had been raped and abused, and gave testimony on the subject to a Congressional committee in 2018, but did not name anyone in either instance.",
      "Then in a 2020 Instagram post, Wood said it was Manson who had \u201chorrifically abused me for years.\u201d The two revealed they were a couple in 2007, and were briefly engaged in 2010 before breaking up.",
      "Manson's original lawsuit alleged that Wood and another woman, Ashley Gore, also known as Illma Gore in court papers, defamed him, intentionally caused him emotional distress and derailed his career in music, TV and film. It says they used false pretenses, including a phony letter from the FBI, to convince other women to come forward with sexual abuse allegations and coached them on what to say. The suit said Wood had only glowing things to say about Manson during their relationship.",
      "Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Teresa A. Beaudet dismissed the part of the suit dealing with the disputed FBI letter, which Wood denied forging. Beaudet also tossed out a section that alleges Wood and Gore used a checklist found on an iPad for other women to use to make abuse claims about Manson.",
      "Other parts of the lawsuit had remained because they were not subject to Wood\u2019s motion, including allegations that Gore hacked Manson\u2019s email, phone and social media accounts, created a phony email to manufacture evidence that he was sending illegal pornography, and \u201cswatted\u201d him, using a prank call to send authorities to his home.",
      "Gore's part of the lawsuit was dismissed and Manson paid $130,000 in her attorney fees."

      "MEXICO CITY -- Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum said Monday she has a plan to reduce the popularity of \u201cnarco corridos,\u201d a musical genre often linked to drug cartel violence.",
      "Sheinbaum vowed to launch a campaign to promote other, less violent musical styles that aren\u2019t as linked to drug traffickers in an effort to stop glorifying them.",
      "The campaign includes \u201ca competition among corrido bands that have some other kind of lyrics, that glorify other behaviors, other cultural visions,\u201d Sheinbaum said, noting that \u201dprohibiting them is not an option.\" Instead, she said, \"it's about promoting another vision.\"",
      "Her secret weapon is a 47-year-old northern governor who occasionally sings more traditional \u201cbanda\u201d songs.",
      "\u201cOne of the ideas we came up with was in Durango,\u201d said Sheinbaum. \"We talked about it with the governor, I don\u2019t know if you knew, but he is a \u2018banda\u2019 singer.\u201d",
      "Gov. Esteban Villegas has taken a few turns on stage singing banda music, which while it is also driven by horns and bass, is more likely to praise cowboys and poor working people.",
      "Peso Pluma, one of the biggest names in regional Mexican music, on the other hand, prides himself on signing \u201cbelicon\" or aggressive \u201dtumbado\" songs sprinkled with references to trafficking drugs.",
      "At varying times, some Mexican cities have tried to ban live performance by singers of narco corridos, with mixed success.",
      "Marco Antonio Gordoa Obeso, the leader of a musicians' union in the northern city of Mazatlan, said he would like to see other types of music succeed, but some audiences prefer narco corridos.",
      "\u201cPeople ask for it,\u201d Gordoa Obeso said. \u201cWho am I to deny somebody their preference?\u201d",

      "Creel died Sept. 30 at the age of 48.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- If artists want to launch an album with a bang, \u201c Amazon Music Live\u201d could be the end zone to score big.",
      "Some of the biggest performers in music \u2014 including Jelly Roll, Megan Thee Stallion, Ed Sheeran, Kane Brown, Peso Pluma and Lil Baby \u2014 have graced the live stage during the weekly concert series in Los Angeles that airs after the NFL's \u201cThursday Night Football\u201d game on Prime Video. Each show is a unique experience with artists debuting new music on bespoke sets created to bring their vision and style to life.",
      "This season's highlights have included J Balvin 's Latin vibe, Halsey 's Halloween circus intro and Gunna's big money talk. Big Sean was joined onstage by North Carolina A&T State University\u2019s marching band, and Jhene Aiko, YG and E-40 made guest appearances.",
      "Now, it's Snoop Dogg 's turn to take the mic for \u201cAML's\u201d season finale this week, just ahead of his highly anticipated 20th album, \u201cMissionary,\u201d dropping next month. The performances are filmed live in front of more than a thousand audience members and streamed on Prime Video and Amazon's streaming platform, Twitch.",
      "Jelly Roll, a Grammy-nominated country singer, was the \u201cAML\u201d season opener in October just days after the release of his 10th studio album, \u201cBeautifully Broken.\u201d His special guests included Keith Urban, Skylar Grey and Machine Gun Kelly.",
      "\u201cWe could have planned our whole rollout around this,\u201d Jelly Roll said. \u201cI\u2019m always excited to try to share what I do in front of new audiences or hope a new audience sees it or maybe the people at home who couldn\u2019t see the tour or people who bought the album and see what it\u2019s all about.\u201d",
      "Last week, TWICE expanded their brand beyond their usual K-pop fandom after the Cleveland Browns upset the Pittsburgh Steelers. The nine-member group made Amazon Music history. The concert livestream earned the most unique viewers of any production \u2014 including Kendrick Lamar's \u201cPop Out\u201d concert in June, and the Ye and Drake \u201cFree Larry Hoover\u201d show in 2021.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re normally used to performing just for our fans who are purposely coming to see us \u2014 especially in the U.S. where we are used to doing that,\u201d said singer Nayeon, who was accompanied by group members Momo, Tzuyu, Mina, Minatozaki Sana, Dahyun, Jihyo, Jeongyeon and Chaeyoung.",
      "TWICE has performed inside major stadiums like MetLife and SoFi Stadium. But \u201cAML\u201d helped introduce them to first-time listeners, while also promoting their upcoming 14th mini-album \u201cStrategy,\u201d releasing Dec. 6.",
      "\u201cFor \u2018Amazon Music Live,\u2019 it\u2019s not just about our fans, but it\u2019s rather related to football,\u201d Nayeon said. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of football fans to see us. To be invited here to perform is such an honor. We need to keep our game card for people to know who TWICE is.\u201d",
      "Here's a behind-the-scenes look at how the concert series comes to life and those who play a key role.",
      "When Jelly Roll first entered the \u201cAML\u201d set, the singer thought it was just another rehearsal \u2014 until he found himself immersed in an unexpected interactive experience before stepping on the main stage.",
      "\u201cI was overwhelmed. Got nervous,\u201d said Jelly Roll, who was floored after he initially walked through the Tailgate Experience at the East End Studios in Glendale, California, where \u201cAML\u201d films season three.",
      "The experience offers a variety of attractions including flat-screen TVs above a massive circular bar, a spacious VIP section, photo booth, themed locker room, digital bonfire, featured vehicle, jersey patch station and a towering football toss game. All of this is set to the music of the week's concert series performer blasted through loudspeakers.",
      "\u201cI wanted a space that was intentional and inclusive to everybody,\u201d said Jameka Pankey, the head of events and experiential for artists at Amazon Music. She and her team wanted to make a concerted effort to pay homage to performers and the fans who enjoy their work.",
      "\u201cWe thought about all aspects of football and tailgating from fellowship, food and even how we were naming the drinks,\u201d Pankey said. \u201cWhen we were giving away gifts to fans. ... We had to do jerseys. I wanted this to be a fan experience that was out of mind.\u201d",
      "Mission accomplished.",
      "At Amazon Music, collaboration has fueled success with departments joining forces to lock in the hottest talent of the week.",
      "But predicting a year out? That's a tough play when album releases are anyone's guess. They use their label connections and instincts to keep them ahead of the game and ready to pivot and lockdown the artist with the next big release.",
      "\u201cWe try to really be as genre agnostic and diverse as possible,\u201d said Kirdis Postelle, global head of content and artist marketing at Amazon Music. She works with Andrew Sexton, who handles booking for \u201cAML.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur team, along with myself, are active in conversations about this program,\u201d said Sexton, who is considered a label relations guru. Some of the selling points to attract artists have been to capitalize off the NFL's huge viewership, promote their project and perform with top-notch production.",
      "\u201cWe're very active,\" he said. \"We're always in communications with artist's teams and people are reaching out to us too. ... We're in constant conversations with the industry.\"",
      "Following a high-stakes \u201cThursday Night Football\u201d matchup is plenty of pressure. But pulling off a live major concert after a big NFL showdown? That\u2019s next-level intensity.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the challenge which is fungible start time,\u201d said Ed Walker, the head of video studios at Amazon Music. He played an integral role in the concert series moving from a shared studio lot in Hollywood to now filming at East End Studios \u2014 a complex with more than 96,000-square-feet of space, including two soundstages, a rooftop terrace, green rooms and three stories of office space.",
      "After the game wraps, there\u2019s an hour preshow on Twitch and a top-of-show segment that takes audiences into the artist\u2019s world. The hope is to create a \u201ccloser connection\u201d before their performance, introducing more insight into the artist\u2019s project. There are sweepstakes and competitions to maintain intrigue.",
      "\u201cWe immerse them into what they are about to see,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is a moving target. You have a very large audience watching football, and then we have direct communications to the control room broadcasting that and they are giving us real time updates.\u201d",
      "Walker admits it\u2019s a tough balancing act, keeping the football audience engaged while also entertaining \u201cAML\u201d viewers before the show kicks off.",
      "\u201cWe got to meet in the middle, entertain them all, give them context and start the show,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile all that\u2019s happening, we have to make sure the artist is on the stage and hits the cue on time.\u201d",
      "While artists are rehearsing, Postelle wants to make sure they\u2019re comfortable and don't leave. That led to the idea of an artist experience with food, games, drinks and privacy.",
      "\u201cWe do that to make artists feel good about spending so much time here,\u201d Postelle said. \u201cThe last thing you want is for somebody to be like \u2018I\u2019m going back to the hotel to take a shower\u2019 and they fall asleep. Then we\u2019ll have a big problem.\u201d",
      "Each week, select customers in the Los Angeles area are invited to purchase $15 tickets for that week's performance during an exclusive superfan presale or general onsale. Live events company DICE tracks upcoming events and uses audience targeting based on fan interests to notify potential attendees."

      "After almost a year of testimony, jurors finally began deliberating in the YSL gang and racketeering trial that originally included the rapper Young Thug",
      "ATLANTA -- Deliberations are underway in Atlanta after a year of testimony in the gang and racketeering trial that originally included the rapper Young Thug.",
      "Jurors are considering whether to convict Shannon Stillwell and Deamonte Kendrick, who raps as Yak Gotti, on gang, murder, drug and gun charges. The original indictment charged 28 people with conspiring to violate Georgia\u2019s Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act.",
      "Opening statements in the trial for six of those defendants happened a year ago. Four of them, including Young Thug, pleaded guilty last month. The rapper was freed on probation. Stillwell and Kendrick rejected plea deals after more than a week of negotiations, and their lawyers chose not to present evidence or witnesses.",
      "Both seemed to be in good spirits Tuesday morning after closings wrapped the previous night. Kendrick was chatting and laughing with Stillwell and his lawyers before the jury arrived for instructions.",
      "The jury started deliberating Tuesday afternoon and was dismissed at 5 p.m. Jurors are expected to resume deliberations Wednesday morning. If they don\u2019t reach a verdict by 3 p.m. Wednesday, the judge will send them home for the Thanksgiving weekend and they will return Monday morning.",
      "Kendrick and Stillwell were charged in the 2015 killing of Donovan Thomas Jr., also known as \u201cBig Nut,\u201d in an Atlanta barbershop.",
      "Prosecutors painted Stillwell and Kendrick as members of a violent street gang called Young Slime Life, or YSL, co-founded in 2012 by Young Thug, whose real name is Jeffery Williams. During closings on Monday, they pointed to tattoos, song lyrics and social media posts they said proved members, including Stillwell, admitted to killing people in rival gangs.",
      "Prosecutors say Thomas was in a rival gang. Stillwell was also charged in the 2022 killing of Shymel Drinks, which prosecutors said was in retaliation for the killing of two YSL associates days earlier.",
      "Defense attorneys Doug Weinstein and Max Schardt said the state presented unreliable witnesses, weak evidence and cherry-picked lyrics and social media posts to push a false narrative about Stillwell, Kendrick and the members of YSL.",
      "Schardt, Stillwell's attorney, reminded the jury that alleged YSL affiliates said during the trial that they had lied to police. Law enforcement played a \u201csick game\u201d by promising they would escape long prison sentences if they said what police wanted them to say, Schardt said. He theorized that one of those witnesses could have killed Thomas.",
      "The truth is that their clients were just trying to escape poverty through music, Schardt said.",
      "\u201cAs a whole, we know the struggles that these communities have had,\u201d Schardt said. \u201cA sad, tacit acceptance that it\u2019s either rap, prison or death.\u201d",
      "Young Thug\u2019s record label is also known as YSL, an acronym of Young Stoner Life. Kendrick was featured on two popular songs from the label\u2019s compilation album Slime Language 2, \u201cTake It to Trial\" and \u201cSlatty,\" which prosecutors presented as evidence in the trial.",
      "Weinstein, Kendrick\u2019s defense attorney, said during closings it was wrong for prosecutors to target the defendants for their music and lyrics. Prosecutor Simone Hylton disagreed, and said surveillance footage and phone evidence supported her case.",
      "\u201cThey have the audacity to think they can just brag about killing somebody and nobody\u2019s gonna hold them accountable,\u201d Hylton said.",
      "The trial had more than its fair share of delays. Jury selection took nearly 10 months, and Stillwell was stabbed last year at the Fulton County jail, which paused trial proceedings.",
      "Judge Paige Reese Whitaker took over after Fulton County Superior Court Chief Judge Ural Glanville was removed from the case in July because he had a meeting with prosecutors and a state witness without defense attorneys present.",
      "Whitaker often lost patience with prosecutors over moves such as not sharing evidence with defense attorneys, once accusing them of \u201cpoor lawyering.\u201d But the trial sped up under her watch.",
      "In October, four defendants, including Young Thug, pleaded guilty, with the rapper entering a non-negotiated or \u201cblind\u201d plea, meaning he didn't have a deal worked out with prosecutors.",
      "Nine people charged in the indictment, including rapper Gunna, accepted plea deals before the trial began. Charges against 12 others are pending. Prosecutors dropped charges against one defendant after he was convicted of murder in an unrelated case.",

      "Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs has been denied bail as he awaits a May sex trafficking trial",
      "NEW YORK -- Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs was denied bail on Wednesday as he awaits a May sex trafficking trial by a judge who cited evidence showing him to be a \u201cserious risk\u201d of witness tampering and proof he has tried to hide prohibited communications with third parties while incarcerated.",
      "U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian ruled in a five-page order following a bail hearing last week. At the hearing, lawyers for the hip-hop mogul argued that a $50 million bail package they proposed would be sufficient to ensure Combs doesn\u2019t flee and doesn\u2019t try to intimidate prospective trial witnesses.",
      "Two other judges previously had agreed with prosecutors that the Bad Boy Records founder was a danger to the community if he is not behind bars. Subramanian concurred.",
      "\u201cThere is compelling evidence of Combs's propensity for violence,\u201d Subramanian wrote.",
      "Lawyers for Combs did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment on the decision. Nicholas Biase, a spokesperson for prosecutors, declined comment.",
      "Combs, 55, has pleaded not guilty to charges that he coerced and abused women for years, aided by associates and employees. An indictment alleges that he silenced victims through blackmail and violence, including kidnapping, arson and physical beatings.",
      "A federal appeals court judge last month denied Combs\u2019 immediate release while a three-judge panel of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan considers his bail request. That appeal was put on hold while Subramanian, newly appointed to the case after an earlier judge stepped aside, considered the bail request for the first time.",
      "Subramanian said he took a fresh look at all the bail arguments and the evidence supporting them to make his decision.",
      "Prosecutors have insisted that no bail conditions would be sufficient to protect the public and prevent the \u201cI'll Be Missing You\u201d singer from fleeing.",
      "They say that even in a federal lockup in Brooklyn, Combs has orchestrated social media campaigns designed to influence prospective jurors and tried to publicly leak materials he thinks can help his case. They say he also has contacted potential witnesses through third parties.",
      "Lawyers for Combs say any alleged sexual abuse described in the indictment occurred during consensual relations between adults and that new evidence refutes allegations that Combs used his \u201cpower and prestige\u201d to induce female victims into drugged-up, elaborately produced sexual performances with male sex workers known as \u201cFreak Offs.\u201d",
      "Subramanian said evidence shows Combs to be a \u201cserious risk of witness tampering,\u201d particularly after he communicated over the summer with a grand jury witness and deleted some of his texts with the witness.",
      "The judge also cited evidence showing that Combs violated Bureau of Prisons regulations during pretrial detention at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn when he paid other inmates to use their phone code numbers so he could make calls to individuals who were not on his approved contact list.",
      "He said there was also evidence that he told family members and defense counsel to add other people to three-way calls so their communications would be more difficult to trace and that he made efforts to influence his trial's jury pool or to reach potential witnesses.",
      "Subramanian said his \u201cwillingness to skirt\u201d jailhouse rules to conceal communications was \u201cstrong evidence\u201d that any conditions of release would not prevent similar behavior.",
      "The judge said defense claims that Combs stopped using one particular phone technique criticized by prosecutors was belied by the fact that Combs apparently used it again on Sunday, two days after his bail hearing last week.",
      "Even a bail proposal that would include the strictest form of home confinement seemed insufficient, the judge said.",
      "\u201cGiven the nature of the allegations in this case and the information provided by the government, the Court doubts the sufficiency of any conditions that place trust in Combs and individuals in his employ \u2014 like a private security detail \u2014 to follow those conditions,\u201d Subramanian wrote."

      "Many older Chinese are looking beyond traditional care homes, worried about abandonment and quality issues",
      "HONG KONG -- Every Wednesday, retiree Zhang Zhili travels an hour by bus to an education center, drawn by the pulsing rhythms of the African drum she plays there in a classroom filled with fellow retirees whose hands move in unison, every beat lifting her spirits.",
      "Zhang, 71, has found joy and new friends at the \u201celderly university\u201d in Beijing. Besides African drums, the former primary school teacher joins social dance classes, paying about 2,000 yuan ($280) for two courses this semester. Seeing herself standing tall in dance class boosts her confidence. After class, she hangs out with her friends.",
      "\u201cWhen we get old, what do we need?\" she said. \u201cTo love ourselves.\u201d",
      "Many older Chinese are looking beyond traditional nursing homes, afraid of abandonment by their families and quality issues. That's driving a boom in universities, home care services, and communities catering to older adults. Though some providers struggle to turn a profit, they persist because they see promise in the growing market.",
      "China has a rapidly aging population. Last year, about 297 million people were aged 60 or above, over one-fifth of the population. By 2035, this number is forecast to exceed 400 million, or over 30% of all Chinese.",
      "That's fueling growth in services and products aimed at older adults in what Beijing calls the silver economy, which is projected to balloon from about 7 trillion yuan (about $982 billion) currently to approximately 30 trillion yuan (about $4.2 trillion) in 2035, raising its share in the economy from about 6% to roughly 10%, Hu Zuquan, a researcher at the State Information Center, a public institution affiliated with China's main planning agency, told state media.",
      "Du Peng, dean of the school of population and health at Beijing's Renmin University, said the government is expanding basic care services to all older people who need them, moving beyond its traditional focus on those without family support. Last year, officials compiled a list of basic care services they aim to make available nationwide, including providing ability assessments for those over 65 and care training subsidies for family members of those who are disabled.",
      "Filial piety runs deep in China and most older people prefer aging at home with family after they retire, typically when they're 50 to 60 years old, one of the youngest retirement ages among the world\u2019s major economies. Many help care for their grandchildren, and for some, nursing homes are seen as a kind of abandonment, except in cases of serious disability.",
      "In January, Beijing issued new guidelines calling for expanding home care services and meal deliveries and more clothing, food and tech products tailored for older adults. They include enriching their lives through education.",
      "Home-based services offer a more affordable alternative to nursing homes, alleviating accommodation costs, Du said. Most older Chinese are relatively healthy, and these able people perhaps need richer cultural lives rather than disability care, he said.",
      "Cai Guixia, 60, said she has found fulfillment in African drumming and modeling classes. She thinks she would feel \u201cforsaken\u201d in a conventional nursing home, preferring to hire a domestic helper.",
      "Liu Xiuqin, an owner of two care homes, saw business opportunities in meeting those needs.",
      "She invested more than 800,000 yuan (about $112,000) to open a school in Beijing. Cai and Zhang are among its 150 students attending classes in dance, singing, yoga and modeling training for about 1,000 yuan ($140) per course each semester.

      "Liu expects to break even in another year and is prepared for the wait. She believes in the market's future, given that the generation born in the 1960s and later values quality of life and health more than their parents did.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not about making quick money,\u201d she said. \u201cIt requires persistence.\u201d",
      "Turning a profit is proving challenging for some silver economy businesses.",
      "In the southern city of Guangzhou, Wu Tang co-founded a school last year after his geotechnical investigation and surveying business was hit by the downturn in China\u2019s property market. His school offers courses to help people achieve some of their childhood dreams, but he has yet to cover his costs. He also faces competition from cheaper government-run courses.",
      "And there's Cui Yang, who runs a care station in Beijing, sending helpers zigzagging across the district to provide 30 yuan ($4.20) haircuts at home; accompanying people on hospital visits for 50 yuan ($7) per hour and other services. Even with government subsidies including free rent, Cui is losing money. Without the subsidies, the business would fail, she said.",
      "The struggles aren\u2019t limited to small operators.",
      "Wu Wenjing heads the home care department of a healthcare subsidiary of state-owned financial conglomerate China Everbright Group in southwest China's Chongqing. It has been in the red for 13 straight years, spending 5 million yuan (about $702,000) annually and still losing 1 million (about $140,000) a year, she said.",
      "Wu's business employs 70 workers who visit homes as caregivers, rehabilitation therapists and psychotherapists. The industry is competitive and it has a high turnover rate given the difficulties of working alone in clients\u2019 homes. Wu hopes to break even in five years, and is delighted about the government's efforts to grow the silver economy.",
      "\"The spring of China\u2019s elderly care business has finally come,\u201d she said.",
      "Various companies are looking to grab a slice of this government-backed market. Property developers like Vanke Co. and Sino-Ocean Group and insurance companies such as Taikang Insurance Group have built high-end communities for older adults with amenities such as movie-screening and mahjong rooms and dining services.",

      "Some vacant schools and kindergartens -- casualties of the country\u2019s declining birthrate -- are meanwhile being transformed into care facilities for older people.",
      "Government efforts to back the silver economy are paying off: official data showed the country had 410,000 care facilities by June, double the number in 2019.",
      "Still, questions remain about the spending power of many older Chinese.",
      "A 2021 national survey co-conducted by China's Civil Affairs Ministry found older adults had a median annual income of 11,400 yuan ($1,574). In rural areas it was less than half of that. More than one in 10 older Chinese are living in poverty, with living standards much lower in rural areas and western China, according to data from surveys conducted by Peking University.",
      "China's silver economy is still in its infancy, said Gary Ng, a senior economist at Natixis Corporate and Investment Banking.",
      "If they lack enough insurance to cover medical and other expenses, many older Chinese must set aside funds for such costs, limiting their spending capacity, he said, and it takes time to build industries producing senior-focused products and people trained to provide such services. Tax incentives and investments in training a skilled workforce would help, he said.",

      "British lawmakers are expected to vote on a law proposed to help terminally ill adults end their lives",
      "LONDON -- British lawmakers are expected to vote Friday on a law proposed to help terminally ill adults end their lives.",
      "The contentious bill would allow adults expected to have fewer than six months to live to request and be provided with help to end their life, subject to safeguards and protections.",
      "Members of Parliament (MPs), who have been holding emotional meetings with constituents and searching their souls, are due to debate the issue that crosses political lines.",
      "Supporters say the law would provide dignity to the dying and prevent unnecessary suffering. Opponents say it would put vulnerable people at risk, fearing that some would be coerced to end their lives and that some elderly or disabled people may opt for death so they don't become a burden.",
      "A vote in favor of the bill would send it to another round of hearings. A vote against it would kill it.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at what\u2019s in the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill and the next steps:",
      "The House of Commons hasn't debated an assisted dying bill since 2015 when a similar measure failed.",
      "Debate is scheduled for five hours and more than 150 members have reportedly signed up to speak. It is expected to be followed by a close vote.",
      "Although the current bill was proposed by a member of the ruling center-left Labour Party, it is an open vote with no pressure from the government on supporting it.",
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who has previously supported assisted dying, said the government will remain neutral and he wouldn't reveal how he would vote. Some members of his cabinet have said they will support the bill, while others are against it.",
      "Former Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown, along with three former Conservative prime ministers \u2014 Boris Johnson, Liz Truss, and Theresa May \u2014 have publicly opposed the bill, though they are no longer in the House of Commons and can't vote. Former Tory Prime Minister David Cameron supports it.",
      "If the bill passes the first stage in the House of Commons, it will face further scrutiny and votes in both Houses of Parliament.",
      "If ultimately approved, any new law is unlikely to come into effect within the next two to three years, supporters say.",
      "Under the proposed legislation, only those over 18 years old in England and Wales and who are expected to die within six months can request assisted dying. They must have the mental capacity to make a choice about the end of their life and will be required to make two separate declarations about their wish to die.",
      "Labour lawmaker Kim Leadbeater, who proposed the bill, said the law has robust safeguards built in and contains \u201cthree layers of scrutiny\u201d \u2014 two independent doctors and a High Court judge will have to sign off on any decision.",
      "Anyone found guilty of pressuring, coercing or dishonestly getting someone to make a declaration that they wish to die will face up to 14 years in prison.",
      "Assisted suicide is currently banned in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Someone who helps a person end their life can be prosecuted and face up to 14 years in prison.",
      "The patient must self-administer the life-ending medication. No doctor or anyone else can give the medication.",
      "No health professional is under any obligation to provide assistance to the patient.",
      "Doctors who do take part would have to be satisfied the person making their declaration to die has done so voluntarily. They also must ensure the person is making an informed choice.",
      "One argument supporting the bill is that wealthy individuals can travel to Switzerland, which allows foreigners to go there to legally end their lives, while others have to face possible prosecution for helping their loves ones to die.",
      "Esther Rantzen, 84, a broadcaster dying of lung cancer, has urged passage of the bill so others don\u2019t have to do what she plans to do by traveling to Switzerland to legally end her life. She urged all 650 MPs to attend the hearing.",
      "\u201cThis is such a vital life and death issue, one that we the public care desperately about,\u201d Rantzen said in a public letter. \u201cIt is only right that as many MPs as possible listen to the arguments for and against, and make up your own minds, according to your own conscience, your personal thoughts and feelings.\u201d",
      "Other countries that have legalized assisted suicide include Australia, Belgium, Canada and parts of the United States, with regulations on who is eligible varying by jurisdiction.",
      "Assisted suicide is different from euthanasia, allowed in the Netherlands and Canada, which involves healthcare practitioners administering a lethal injection at the patient's request in specific circumstances."

      "A handful of Massachusetts lawmakers are hoping to persuade their colleagues to support a proposal that would make the state the first to adopt a ban meant to eliminate the use of tobacco products over time",
      "BOSTON -- A handful of Massachusetts lawmakers are hoping to persuade their colleagues to support a proposal that would make the state the first to adopt a ban meant to eliminate the use of tobacco products over time.",
      "Other locations have weighed similar \u201cgenerational tobacco bans,\u201d which phase out the use of tobacco products based not just on a person's age but on birth year.",
      "Under a Massachusetts law signed in 2018, the age to buy any tobacco product \u2014 including cigarettes, cigars and e-cigarettes \u2014 was raised to 21. Massachusetts also has banned the sale of all flavored tobacco products in an effort to reduce youth interest in nicotine.",
      "The new proposal, which lawmakers plan to file next year, would expand the effort to curb smoking by gradually ending all sales of nicotine and tobacco products. If the bill is approved, young people not old enough to legally purchase nicotine and tobacco would never be lawfully able to purchase them in Massachusetts, thereby creating no more new users.",
      "It would not apply to marijuana, and the cutoff date would be adjusted when passed to ensure everyone age 21 and above at that time would not be affected.",
      "Brookline, a town of about 63,000 neighboring Boston, was the first municipality in the country to adopt such a ban in 2020. Instead of raising the age for purchasing cigarettes, the bylaw blocks the sale of tobacco to anyone born on or after Jan. 1, 2000. The rule went into effect in 2021.",
      "That would mean at some point in the future no one would be allowed to buy any tobacco products in the town. The measure was challenged, but the state's highest court weighed in earlier this year, upholding the ban.",
      "Other Massachusetts cities and towns already have approved similar tobacco bans, including Malden, Melrose, Reading, Stoneham, Wakefield, and Winchester.",
      "Democratic state Sen. Jason Lewis, one of the backers of the statewide proposal, said the bill would \"save countless lives and create a healthier world for the next generation.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe all know the devastating health effects of nicotine and tobacco products, especially on our youth,\" he said.",
      "Nicotine and tobacco products are addictive and can increase the risk of lung cancer, heart disease, stroke and other illnesses.",
      "Nearly 9 out of 10 adults who smoke cigarettes daily first tried smoking by age 18, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which also found that in 2024 about 2 in 5 students who had ever used a tobacco product currently used them.",
      "Peter Brennan, executive director of the New England Convenience Store and Energy Marketers Association, said the proposal would undercut small mom and pop shops that rely on cigarettes for a significant portion of their sales.",
      "It also would put stores located near neighboring states that allow the sale of cigarettes to all adults at a competitive disadvantage.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a terrible idea,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re really just taking away adults\u2019 right to purchase a legal, age-restricted product.\u201d",
      "Taking certain rights away from some adults and not others is likely unconstitutional, he said, adding that other prohibition efforts haven\u2019t worked, like past bans on alcohol, marijuana and gambling.",
      "It's unclear how much support the proposal has in the Legislature.",
      "Massachusetts has taken other steps in recent decades to curb smoking, including raising taxes on cigarettes. Those taxes would presumably be reduced and ultimately eliminated by an incremental statewide smoking ban.",
      "Any reduction in cigarette tax revenue would be more than offset by reduced healthcare costs and other savings, Lewis said.",
      "In 2022, 10.4% of adults in Massachusetts reported smoking cigarettes, according to the state Department of Public Health.",
      "Some California lawmakers have pushed to ban all tobacco sales, filing legislation last year to make it illegal to sell cigarettes and other products to anyone born after Jan. 1, 2007.",
      "In 2022, New Zealand became the first nation to pass a law intended to impose a lifetime ban on young people buying cigarettes by mandating that tobacco can\u2019t ever be sold to anybody born on or after Jan. 1, 2009. The law was later axed.",
      "In the U.K., Prime Minister Rishi Sunak proposed raising the legal age that people in England can buy cigarettes by one year, every year until it is eventually illegal for the whole population. The proposal failed to win approval earlier this year."

      "While talking politics with colleagues can be fortifying, the opposite also can be true when we disagree. Being exposed to strongly held beliefs that run counter to one\u2019s own values can lead to people feeling mistreated or unsafe. This month's U.S. presidential election heightened those tensions.",
      "\u201cThere was a lot of anxiety during this election, and in times of anxiety you need to create psychological safety in people,\u201d said Ron Gutman, an adjunct professor of leadership at Stanford University and the co-founder and co-CEO of health technology company Intrivo. \u201cYou need to create trust in people, to bring back the trust in each other.\u201d",
      "Here are some tips from business leaders, psychologists and communication experts on how to navigate political conflicts in the workplace.",
      "To cultivate a more peaceful working environment, executives, managers and employees can practice humility. That means seeing ourselves as equal and not superior to our colleagues and subordinates, and recognizing that no one has all the right answers.",
      "When we listen to others thoughtfully and relinquish a reflexive belief in our own infallibility, it allows us to remain open to new ideas and perspectives, said Inclusivv CEO Jenn Graham, whose organization creates structured dialogues around social and political issues for corporate clients.",
      "\u201cWe can say something like, \u2018I haven\u2019t heard of that or thought of that before. Thank you for sharing,\u2019\u201d Graham said. \u201cAnd that simple act of \u2018thank you for sharing,\u2019 with gratitude and humility combined, creates a reciprocity for that brave space, for that psychological safety. And that\u2019s what we need to foster more than ever.\u201d",
      "To cultivate a humble mindset, think about why you might be wrong, and consider that the opposite of what you believe might be true, said Jake Telkamp, an assistant professor at Augusta University in Georgia. \u201cWe are really good at seeking out information that supports our beliefs, and then we scrutinize evidence that challenges our beliefs,\u201d he said.",
      "In some situations, a more guarded approach is warranted. If political talk feels like a personal attack, you may need to find allies who can help you process what you\u2019re hearing and feeling.",
      "For example, when a comedian opened a campaign rally for President-elect Donald Trump last month by referring to Puerto Rico as a \u201cfloating island of garbage,\u201d many people were deeply upset, said psychologist Alfiee Breland-Noble, founder of The AAKOMA Project, a nonprofit organization focused on empowering youth and young adults of color and people who face sexism and homophobia.",
      "The same was true after Black teenagers and adults received text messages this month telling them they were \u201cselected to pick cotton,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of sadness around, why isn\u2019t anybody publicly telling these people, 'You can\u2019t say these things about people who come from my community?\u2019\u201d Breland-Noble said.",
      "People feel like their lives are on the line, and are asking, \u201cWhere do I go with this struggle that I\u2019m having? Because people who look like me nationally, we all feel like we\u2019re under attack,\u201d she said.",
      "Breland-Noble encourages employees who feel marginalized by political discourse to identify colleagues to confide in, to check workplace policies for any rules on unacceptable speech and behavior, and to consider speaking with a trusted supervisor about what they\u2019re experiencing.",
      "\u201cThere is a lot that we can learn from how people have over time managed having a marginalized identity and being in the workplace because you have a plethora of people around you who are dealing with this stuff literally every day,\u201d Breland-Noble said.",
      "Also check your employer\u2019s social media policy. In many states, workers can be fired for posting political beliefs online, said Brad Kelley, a shareholder who represents employers at the law firm Littler.",
      "When attempting to resolve discord, one way to foster a peaceful resolution is to seek common ground.",
      "In the structured conversations she leads, Graham encourages participants to begin by listening to and acknowledging what the other person is saying. Repeat it back. Honor their emotions. Then you can share your perspective, and in the process you may find similarities, she said.",
      "\u201cWhen you\u2019re looking for common ground, you\u2019re ideally looking for a shared value,\" Graham said. It could be as simple as recognizing \u201cwe both have a need for and a desire for (fill in the) blank.\u201d",
      "Most people want a happier, healthier, more prosperous country, but the disagreement often lies in how to best get there, Telkamp said. Acknowledging shared goals can help de-escalate tension.",
      "\u201cPeople on the left and the right are disliking, distrusting, and generally they think people on the other side are unintelligent and immoral,\u201d Telkamp said. \u201cI\u2019m interested in how we can kind of get off the ledge a little bit and come back to a better understanding of each other.\u201d",
      "One way managers can try to bridge divides is to create rituals for employees to share what\u2019s important to them, Gutman said. This can help build a baseline of trust within an organization.",
      "Every Friday at Intrivo, the staff gathers for an hour and one person presents on a topic they\u2019re passionate about. It could be a hobby, an idea, a family experience or a skill. Political topics are fine as long as no one is putting anyone down, he said.",
      "\u201cIt can be super technical or super silly,\u201d Gutman said. The conversations build trust, and a sense of safety and community, he said.",
      "In circumstances where a discussion is getting heated, sometimes the best way to handle it is to remove ourselves from the conflict or to keep our views to ourselves.",
      "Leaders may want to consider abstaining from sharing their political views, which may alienate some workers, Telkamp said. \u201cThat\u2019s not about silencing your beliefs,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s more about keeping the workplace focused on the work.\u201d",

      "The war has not only deepened the struggles of young patients.",
      "\u201cMany physicians have had to relocate,\u201d Noun said. \u201cI know physicians, who work here, who haven\u2019t seen their parents in like six weeks because the roads are very dangerous.\u201d",
      "Since 2019, Lebanon has been battered by cascading crises \u2014 economic collapse, the devastating Beirut port explosion in 2020, and now a relentless war \u2014 leaving institutions like the cancer center struggling to secure the funds needed to save lives.",
      "\u201cCancer waits for no one,\u201d Chami said. The crises have affected the center\u2019s ability to hold fundraising events in recent years, leaving it in urgent need of donations, she added.",
      "The facility is currently treating more than 400 patients aged from few days to 18 years old, Chami said. It treats around 60% of children with cancer in Lebanon.",
      "For Carol, the war is sometimes a topic of conversation with her friends at the cancer center. Her mother hears her recount hearing the booms and how the house shook.",
      "For others, the moments with their friends in the center's playroom provide a brief escape from the grim reality outside.",
      "Eight-year-old Mohammad Mousawi darts around the playroom, giggling as he hides objects and books for his playmate to find. Too absorbed by the game, he barely answers questions, before the nurse calls him for his weekly chemotherapy treatment.",
      "His family lived in Ghobeiry, a neighborhood in Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs. Their house was marked for destruction in an Israeli evacuation warning weeks ago, his mother said.",
      "\u201cBut till now, they haven\u2019t struck it,\u201d said his mother, Suzan Mousawi. \u201cThey have hit (buildings) around it \u2014 two behind it and two in front of it.\u201d",
      "The family has relocated three times. They first moved to the mountains, but the bitter cold weakened Mohammad\u2019s already fragile immune system.",
      "Now they\u2019ve settled in Ain el-Rummaneh, not far from their home in the southern Beirut suburbs known as Dahiyeh, which has come under significant bombardment. As the Israeli military widened the radius of its bombardment, some buildings hit were less than 500 meters (yards) from their current home.",
      "The Mousawis have lived their entire lives in Dahiyeh, Suzan Mousawi said, until the war uprooted them. Her parents\u2019 home was bombed. \u201cAll our memories are gone,\u201d she said.",
      "Mohammad has 15 weeks of treatment left, and his family is praying it will be successful. But the war has stolen some of their dreams.",
      "\u201cWhen Mohammad fell ill, we bought a house,\u201d she said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t big, but it was something. I bought him an electric scooter and set up a pool, telling myself we\u2019d take him there once he finishes treatment.\u201d",
      "She fears the house, bought with every penny she had saved, could be lost at any moment.",
      "For some families, this kind of conflict is not new. Asinat Al Lahham, a 9-year-old patient of the cancer center, is a refugee whose family fled Syria.",
      "\u201cWe escaped one war to another,\u201d Asinat\u2019s mother, Fatima, added.",
      "As her father, Aouni, drove home from her chemotherapy treatment weeks ago, an airstrike happened. He cranked up the music in the car, trying to drown out the deafening sound of the attack.",
      "Asinat sat in the back seat, clutching her favorite toy. \u201cI wanted to distract her, to make her hear less of it,\u201d he said.",
      "In the medical ward on a recent day, Asinat sat in a chair hooked to an IV drip, negotiating with her doctor. \u201cJust two or three small pinches,\u201d she pleaded, asking for flavoring for her instant noodles that she is not supposed to have.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t feel safe \u2026 nowhere is safe \u2026 not Lebanon, not Syria, not Palestine,\u201d Asinat said. \u201cThe sonic booms are scary, but the noodles make it better,\u201d she added with a mischievous grin.",
      "The family has no choice but to stay in Lebanon. Returning to Syria, where their home is gone, would mean giving up Asinat\u2019s treatment.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t leave here,\u201d her mother said. \u201cThis war, her illness \u2026 it\u2019s like there\u2019s no escape.\u201d"

      "Millions of obese Americans would be eligible to have popular weight-loss drugs like Wegovy or Zepbound covered by Medicare or Medicaid under a new rule the Biden administration proposed Tuesday morning",
      "WASHINGTON -- Millions of Americans with obesity would be eligible to have popular weight-loss drugs like Wegovy or Zepbound covered by Medicare or Medicaid under a new rule the Biden administration proposed Tuesday morning.",
      "The costly proposal from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services immediately sets the stage for a showdown between the powerful pharmaceutical industry and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an outspoken opponent of the weight-loss drugs who, as President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s nominee to lead the agency, could block the measure.",
      "While the rule would give millions of people access to weekly injectables that have helped people shed pounds so quickly that some have labeled them miracle drugs, it would cost taxpayers as much as $35 billion over the next decade.",
      "\u201cIt's a good day for anyone who suffers from obesity,\u201d U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra told The Associated Press in an interview. \u201cIt's a game changer for Americans who can't afford these drugs otherwise.\u201d",
      "The rule would not be finalized until January, days after Trump takes office. A bipartisan coalition of congressional members has lobbied for the drugs to be covered by Medicare, saying it could save the government from spending billions of dollars on treating chronic ailments that stem from obesity. While it's unclear where Trump himself stands on coverage of the weight-loss drugs, his allies and Cabinet picks who have vowed to cut government spending could balk at the upfront price tag.",
      "Under the proposal, only those who are considered obese \u2014 someone who has a body mass index of 30 or higher \u2014 would qualify for coverage. Some people may already get coverage of the drugs through Medicare or Medicaid, if they have diabetes or are at risk for stroke or heart disease.",
      "Becerra estimated that an additional 3.5 million people on Medicare and 4 million on Medicaid could qualify for coverage of the drugs. But research suggests far more people might qualify, with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services estimating roughly 28 million people on Medicaid are considered obese.",
      "Medicare has been barred from offering the drugs under a decades-old law that prohibits the government-backed insurance program from covering weight-loss products. The rule proposed by the Biden administration, however, would recognize obesity as a disease that can be treated with the help of the drugs.",
      "The anti-obesity drug market has expanded significantly in recent years, with the Food and Drug Administration approving a new class of weekly injectables like Novo Nordisk\u2019s Wegovy and Eli Lilly\u2019s Zepbound to treat obesity.",
      "People can lose as much as 15% to 25% of their body weight on the drugs, which imitate the hormones that regulate appetites by communicating fullness between the gut and brain when people eat.",
      "The cost of the drugs has largely limited them to the wealthy, including celebrities who boast of their benefits. A monthly supply of Wegovy rings up at $1,300 and Zepbound will put you out $1,000. Shortages of the drugs have also limited the supplies.",
      "Kennedy, who as Trump's nominee for HHS secretary is subject to Senate confirmation, has railed against the drugs' popularity. In speeches and on social media, he's said the U.S. should not cover the drugs through Medicaid or Medicare. Instead, he supports a broad expansion of coverage for healthier foods and gym memberships.",
      "\u201cFor half the price of Ozempic, we could purchase regeneratively raised, organic food for every American, three meals a day and a gym membership, for every obese American,\u201d Kennedy said to a group of federal lawmakers during a roundtable earlier this year. Ozempic is a diabetes drug that can stimulate weight loss."

      "President-elect Donald Trump has chosen health economist Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, a critic of pandemic lockdowns and vaccine mandates, to lead the National Institutes of Health, the nation's leading medical research agency.",
      "Trump, in a statement Tuesday evening, said Bhattacharya, a 56-year-old physician and professor at Stanford University School of Medicine, will work in cooperation with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., his pick to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, \"to direct the Nation\u2019s Medical Research, and to make important discoveries that will improve Health, and save lives.\u201d",
      "\u201cTogether, Jay and RFK Jr. will restore the NIH to a Gold Standard of Medical Research as they examine the underlying causes of, and solutions to, America\u2019s biggest Health challenges, including our Crisis of Chronic Illness and Disease,\" he wrote.",
      "The decision to choose Bhattacharya for the post is yet another reminder of the ongoing impact of the COVID pandemic on the politics on public health.",
      "Bhattacharya was one of three authors of the Great Barrington Declaration, an October 2020 open letter maintaining that lockdowns were causing irreparable harm.",
      "The document \u2014 which came before the availability of COVID-19 vaccines and during the first Trump administration \u2014 promoted \u201cherd immunity,\u201d the idea that people at low risk should live normally while building up immunity to COVID-19 through infection. Protection should focus instead on people at higher risk, the document said.",
      "\u201cI think the lockdowns were the single biggest public health mistake,\u201d Bhattacharya said in March 2021 during a panel discussion convened by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.",
      "The Great Barrington Declaration was embraced by some in the first Trump administration, even as it was widely denounced by disease experts. Then- NIH director Dr. Francis Collins called it dangerous and \u201cnot mainstream science.\u201d",
      "His nomination would need to be approved by the Senate.",
      "Trump on Tuesday also announced that Jim O\u2019Neill, a former HHS official and Silicon Valley investor, will serve as deputy secretary of the sprawling agency. Trump said O\u2019Neill \u201cwill oversee all operations and improve Management, Transparency, and Accountability to, Make America Healthy Again,\u201d the president-elect announced.",
      "O\u2019Neill is a longtime associate of billionaire entrepreneur Peter Thiel, one of Trump's leading backers from the tech industry. Thiel and O'Neill co-founded Mithril Capital Management, a venture fund that invests in medical technology and other startup companies. O\u2019Neill previously served in HHS under George W. Bush and was considered to head the Food and Drug Administration during Trump's first term. He has expressed disdain for federal regulation, including FDA's approach to regulating emerging drugs and other technologies.",
      "O\u2019Neill also worked on some of Thiel\u2019s signature projects, often reflecting his libertarian philosophy.",
      "He served on the board of a Thiel-funded nonprofit that aimed to develop man-made islands that would float outside U.S. territory, allowing them to experiment with new forms of government. He also helped form and run the Thiel Fellowship, which awards $100,000 to young entrepreneurs who want to leave school to pursue a business or scientific venture.",
      "O\u2019Neill is the only one of Trump\u2019s health picks so far who brings previous experience working inside the HHS bureaucracy. Trump\u2019s previous choices to lead public health agencies \u2014 including Kennedy, Dr. Mehmet Oz for Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services administrator and Dr. Marty Makary for FDA commissioner \u2014 have all been Washington outsiders who are vowing to shake up the agencies.",
      "Bhattacharya, who faced restrictions on social media platforms because of his views, was also a plaintiff in Murthy v. Missouri, a Supreme Court case contending that federal officials improperly suppressed conservative views on social media as part of their efforts to combat misinformation. The Supreme Court sided with the Biden administration in that case.",
      "After Elon Musk acquired Twitter in 2022, he invited Bhattacharya to the company's headquarters to learn more about how his views had been restricted on the platform, which Musk renamed X. More recently, Bhattacharya has posted on X about scientists leaving the site and joining the alternative site Bluesky, mocking Bluesky as \"their own little echo chamber.\u201d",
      "Bhattacharya has argued that vaccine mandates that barred unvaccinated people from activities and workplaces undermined Americans' trust in the public health system.",
      "He is a former research fellow at the Hoover Institution and an economist at the RAND Corporation.",
      "The National Institutes of Health falls under HHS, which Trump has nominated Kennedy to oversee. The NIH's $48 billion budget funds medical research on vaccines, cancer and other diseases through competitive grants to researchers at institutions across the nation. The agency also conducts its own research with thousands of scientists working at NIH labs in Bethesda, Maryland.",
      "Among advances that were supported by NIH money are a medication for opioid addiction, a vaccine to prevent cervical cancer, many new cancer drugs and the speedy development of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines.",

      "The victory for reproductive rights groups sets the stage for their next battle: challenging other laws on the books in Arizona they say are too restrictive. The 15-week cutoff, for example, allows exceptions only when the mother's life is at risk.",

Nevada voters also approved an amendment, but they'll need to pass it again in 2026 for it to take effect. Another that bans discrimination on the basis of \u201cpregnancy outcomes\u201d prevailed in New York.",

      "The detection of bird flu virus this week in a batch of unpasteurized milk sold in California underscores what health experts say are the known and potential risks of the products",
      "President-elect Donald Trump's nominee for the nation's top health job, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has vowed to allow wider distribution of raw milk across America. But the detection of bird flu virus in unpasteurized milk sold in California stores underscores what health experts say are the known and potential risks.",
      "\u201cYou have to assume that raw milk, unpasteurized milk, has potential infectious agents that can cause serious illness in the people who drink it,\" said Michael Osterholm, a University of Minnesota infectious disease researcher who has investigated foodborne illness outbreaks.",
      "Raw Farm LLC, of Fresno, California, voluntarily recalled one lot of \u201ccream top\u201d whole raw milk after Santa Clara County health officials found the bird flu virus in a sample last week. State health officials said the county has been testing raw milk sold in stores as \u201ca second line of consumer protection.\u201d",
      "No illnesses have been traced to Raw Farm products, which have a lot code of 20241109 and a best-by date of Nov. 27. But officials with California's health department warned consumers not to drink the milk and said retailers should remove it from their shelves. On Tuesday, Los Angeles County health officials warned that \u201cmany retailers\u201d there may have sold recalled raw milk contaminated with the virus.",
      "Here's what else you need to know about raw milk and bird flu:",
      "It\u2019s not a surprise that the virus was found in raw milk sold in stores, Osterholm said.",
      "Bird flu, also known as Type A H5N1 influenza, was first confirmed in U.S. dairy cattle in March and has been spreading widely. In California, more than 435 dairy herds have seen infections \u2014 more than all other U.S. states combined. And high levels of the virus have been found in the milk of infected cows.",
      "About 20% of samples of pasteurized milk sold in stores were found to contain viral remnants of the virus, according to tests conducted earlier this year by government scientists. Pasteurization, or heat treatment, kills the bird flu virus and also bacteria such as E. coli, listeria and salmonella, which are known to make people sick.",
      "Officials with California's Department of Food and Agriculture have been conducting weekly tests of raw milk in bulk tanks from the state's dairies. Additional tests conducted at Raw Farm sites in California were negative for the virus, but officials said they would begin testing for bird flu twice a week.",
      "Few tests of unpasteurized milk products from stores have been conducted, so it's possible that other raw dairy products may contain the virus, Osterholm said.",
      "\u201cIt is still really unclear how much testing is going on,\u201d said Osterholm. \u201cWe're flying blind.\u201d",
      "To date, there's no evidence that people have been infected with the bird flu virus by drinking raw milk. At least 55 people in the U.S. are known to have been infected by the virus this year, but nearly all were dairy or poultry workers who developed mild illness after close contact with infected animals.",
      "Tests have shown that mice fed raw milk contaminated with bird flu became very sick and barn cats on farms that drank milk from infected cows suffered brain damage and died, noted Nicole Martin, a microbiologist and associate director of the Milk Quality Improvement Program at Cornell University,",
      "\u201cI don't think we know yet whether people can contract H5N1 from consumption of raw milk, but we have enough evidence that would suggest that folks need to be a little more cautious right now,\u201d Martin said.",
      "Nearly 4.4% of U.S. adults, or about 11 million people, report that they drink raw milk at least once each year. About 1% of adults say they consume raw milk each week, according to a 2022 FDA study.",
      "Proponents of raw milk cite perceived health benefits and better taste as key reasons for consumption. Raw Farm advertises its products as \u201cunprocessed and complete\u201d with vitamins, minerals, enzymes and beneficial bacteria.",
      "Fans include Kennedy, who has said he only drinks raw milk. Kennedy has criticized agriculture departments for cracking down on raw milk and promised that the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s \u201c aggressive suppression \u201d of unpasteurized milk would end under Trump.",
      "Mark McAfee, owner of Raw Farm, has appeared several times on podcasts hosted by Nicole Shanahan, Kennedy's former running mate. Both Kennedy and Shanahan are customers, McAfee told the Associated Press.",
      "\u201cThey want that same level of differentiating, wonderful, tested, gorgeous, safe, delicious raw milk for everybody,\" McAfee said.",
      "Health officials have warned for years that raw milk can cause illnesses that range from mild to life-threatening. Between 1998 and 2018, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention documented more than 200 illness outbreaks traced to raw milk, which sickened more than 2,600 people and hospitalized more than 225.",
      "Before the U.S. adopted safety standards in 1924 under what was called the Pasteurized Milk Ordinance, about 25% of foodborne illnesses were related to dairy consumption, according to the Center for Dairy Research. Now, dairy products account for about 1% of such illnesses.",

      "Medical marijuana supporters didn't immediately respond to calls or emails seeking comment Tuesday after the ruling was released.",
      "More than two-thirds of Nebraska voters supported legalization at the polls Nov. 5. The results are scheduled to be certified Dec. 2.",
      "Secretary of State Bob Evnen and Attorney General Mike Hilgers argued that problems with the way thousands of signatures were gathered meant the ballot initiatives shouldn\u2019t have been put to voters. One person who circulated petitions in Grand Island was criminally charged with falsifying at least 164 signatures. Evnen, Hilgers and former state Sen. John Kuehn also raised questions about whether other signatures were properly notarized.",
      "Nebraskans for Medical Marijuana argued in court that even if some of the signatures gathered were flawed, the group still had well over the 86,499 needed. The Secretary of State's office certified nearly 90,000 signatures on both the petition to allow marijuana for medical use and the one to set up a commission to regulate it.",
      "The judge agreed that the state wasn't able to show any widespread fraud. Instead the ruling pointed primarily to the one petition circulator who was charged and raised questions about whether some other signatures were properly notarized.",
      "Strong said she reviewed thousands of messages that top two organizers of the petition campaign exchanged that filled more than 800 pages and only found one mention of notarizing petitions outside of the petition circulator's presence.",
      "This year marked the third time Nebraskans for Medical Marijuana tried to get the issue on the ballot and the first time it made it there.",
      "In 2020, the group came close after meeting signature requirements. But opponents sued, arguing that advocates violated state rules requiring ballot measures to focus on a single question. Instead, the measure posed two separate questions: whether residents should have the right to use marijuana for medical purposes, and whether private companies should be allowed to grow and sell it.",
      "The state Supreme Court prevented the questions from going to voters.",
      "In 2022, organizers failed to collect enough signatures in time to get the question on the November ballot.",
      "Voters in North Dakota, South Dakota and Florida all rejected measures to legalize recreational marijuana use this year. But dozens of states have previously legalized it for either medical or recreational use, most recently in Ohio last year. In May, the federal government also began a process to reclassify marijuana as a less dangerous drug."

      "Millions of obese Americans would get access to popular weekly injectables that would help them shed pounds quickly if a $35 billion proposal from the Biden administration is blessed by President-elect Donald Trump",
      "WASHINGTON -- Millions of obese Americans would get access to popular weekly injectables that would help them shed pounds quickly if a $ 35 billion proposal  from the Biden administration is blessed by President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "The rule, unveiled Tuesday by the Health and Human Services Department, would require Medicare and Medicaid to cover weight-loss drugs like Wegovy or Zepbound for a large segment of Americans who are obese.",
      "But it's unclear if the proposal, which would not go into effect until after Trump takes office, will have support from his new administration \u2014 including from Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an opponent of the drugs whom the president-elect has tapped to serve as head of HHS.",
      "Here's what to know about the drugs and the Biden administration's proposal:",
      "The weight-loss drugs, also called anti-obesity medications or GLP-1s, mimic the hormone known as glucagon-like peptide 1, which regulates appetites by communicating fullness between the gut and brain when people eat.",
      "The drugs include Novo Nordisk\u2019s Wegovy and Ozempic as well as Eli Lilly\u2019s Zepbound and Mounjaro.",
      "In clinical trials, most participants taking Wegovy or Mounjaro to treat obesity lost an average of 15% to 22% of their body weight \u2014 up to 50 pounds or more in many cases. But a slice of \u201cnonresponders\u201d did not lose significant body weight.",
      "Private health insurers have limited coverage of the drugs. Medicare has been barred from covering them under a law that says the program cannot pay for weight-loss products. Coverage through Medicaid, meanwhile, has varied from state to state.",
      "That's meant the drugs \u2014 which can cost upwards of $1,000 monthly \u2014 have been largely unaffordable for many.",
      "The rule announced Tuesday affects Medicaid, which provides health care coverage for roughly 70 million of the nation\u2019s poorest people, and Medicare, the health insurance program for about 67 million older Americans.",
      "Under the proposal, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, would reinterpret the federal law, to consider the drugs as a treatment for obesity diseases.",
      "The nation's top health agency estimates as many as 3.5 million people on Medicare and 4 million on Medicaid could qualify for coverage of the drugs. But research suggests far more people might qualify, with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services estimating roughly 28 million people on Medicaid are considered obese.",
      "And the proposal would cost a lot of money \u2014 at least $35 billion over the next decade.",
      "The drugs are popular \u2014 with a majority of Americans telling health firm KFF in a poll earlier this year that Medicare should cover the drugs. A bipartisan coalition of lawmakers, too, has lobbied for coverage of the drugs.",
      "But support is mixed in Trump\u2019s inner circle.",
      "Kennedy has railed against the idea of Medicare or Medicaid covering the drugs. Instead, he's told Congress that they should expand coverage of healthier foods and gym memberships through the government-sponsored health care programs.",
      "Meanwhile Dr. Mehmet Oz, who is poised to take the helm of CMS, has said the drugs can be a helpful tool. In a video posted to Instagram last year, Oz praised some of the benefits of the drugs, but said the long-term effects should be further studied.",
      "\u201cI think these new generation of medications offer us a huge opportunity,\u201d Oz said.",
      "Trump or Kennedy could ultimately ignore Biden's proposal and not implement it.",
      "Some lawmakers praised the move on Tuesday, while others expressed skepticism.",
      "Rep. Brad Wenstrup, a Republican who sponsored a bill to have Medicare cover the weight-loss drugs, has argued that covering the drugs and other obesity treatments could save taxpayers in the long run.",
      "\u201cI am encouraged to see the Administration support our efforts to help make Americans healthier by allowing Medicare coverage of new, physician prescribed and FDA approved anti-obesity medications,\" Wenstrup said in a statement.",
      "He called for the Congress to pass a law that would help pay for dietitians, nutritionists and behavioral therapy to treat obesity.",
      "Sen. Bernie Sanders, however, warned that unless the government required drugmakers to lower the price of the medications Medicare premiums would \u201cskyrocket\" under the plan.",
      "It's good for more Americans to have access to these drugs, which have proven effective, but Dr. David Ludwig, a nutrition and obesity expert at Harvard University, hopes that it doesn't become the primary way obesity is treated in America.",
      "He worries that not enough investment is being made to figure out what is driving climbing obesity rates across the U.S., and the role that healthy foods and exercise might play in solving that epidemic.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s appropriate to treat the problems that we now face with drugs, but let\u2019s not stop there,\u201d Ludwig said. \u201cLet\u2019s identify what\u2019s causing the problem, and ultimately rely on these drugs \u2014 which have side effects \u2014 less and less over time.\u201d",
      "Dr. Andrew Kraftson, who treats obese patients at the University of Michigan, is happy that more of his patients might be able to afford these drugs, which he has prescribed for patients and has had successful results. But he, too, would like to see more research and guidance from the government on prescribing the medications.",
      "Kraftson also worries about some of the side effects for elderly patients. The drugs, he points out, can lead to muscle loss, which is a bigger problem for older Americans who are at risk of falling, for example.",
      "\u201cI'm advocating for their thoughtful use,\u201d Kraftson said. \"Because if you have a senior and you just write a prescription and the visit takes five minutes, is that an appropriate level of care? Have we defined that well?",

The total number of Maine children in residential treatment has lowered from 290 to 192 for in-state care and 250 to 69 for out-of-state care, she said."

      "FRANKFORT, Ky. -- Kentucky's attorney general has expanded an opioid-related lawsuit to target another big pharmacy benefit manager that he claims contributed to the state's deadly addiction crisis.",
      "OptumRx has been added as a new defendant in the suit that was filed two months ago, Attorney General Russell Coleman said Tuesday. His claims against Optum and its affiliated organizations are similar to those initially made against Express Scripts, which remains a defendant in the case.",
      "The Republican attorney general accused Optum of playing a central role in what he called the reckless promotion, dispensing and oversupply of opioids. OptumRx controls a pharmacy network consisting of about 67,000 retail pharmacy locations nationwide, the suit said.",
      "Kentucky was ravaged by the addiction crisis, resulting in some of the nation\u2019s highest overdose death rates.",
      "\u201cThese groups pushed a profit-fueled agenda at the expense of Kentucky families, who are left with empty seats at the dinner table,\u201d Coleman said in a release.",
      "Optum did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment Tuesday. When it was sued in September, Express Scripts responded that it has long worked to combat opioid overuse and abuse and would \u201cvigorously contest these baseless allegations in court.\u201d",
      "Coleman initially filed the legal action in a state court, but the two sides are wrangling over whether it should be in state or federal court, his office said. He wants the case heard in state court.",
      "Coleman has accused the defendants of using deceptive marketing to boost sales of highly addictive drugs. They also dispensed opioids through mail-order pharmacies without effective controls in violation of Kentucky and federal law, he said.",
      "He is seeking, among other things, civil penalties for each willful violation of the Kentucky Consumer Protection Act, plus any other relief deemed appropriate by the court.",
      "\u201cDefendants have hidden their conduct through non-transparent business practices and by requiring each entity with whom they conduct business, such as opioid manufacturers, to enter into confidentiality agreements or otherwise keep their agreements confidential,\u201d the lawsuit says.",
      "Pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, run prescription drug coverage for health insurers and employers that provide coverage. They help decide which drugs make a plan\u2019s formulary, or list of covered medications. They also can determine where patients go to fill their prescriptions.",
      "PBMs have drawn the ire of politicians, patients and others for years. PBMs say they play an important role in controlling drug costs and pass along most of the discounts they negotiate to their clients.",
      "Government lawsuits against pharmacy benefit managers are the latest frontier \u2013 and maybe the last big one \u2013 in years of litigation over the opioid-related drug epidemic in the U.S.",
      "Drugmakers, wholesalers and pharmacy chains have already faced stacks of lawsuits and settled many of them, with most of the money required to be used to fight the overdose and addiction crisis.",
      "Overdose death rates began steadily climbing in the 1990s because of opioid painkillers, followed by waves of deaths led by other opioids like heroin and \u2014 more recently \u2014 illicit fentanyl. A decline in U.S. drug overdose deaths appears to have continued this year, giving experts hope the nation is seeing sustained improvement in the persistent epidemic.",
      "Drug overdose deaths in Kentucky fell nearly 10% in 2023, marking a second straight annual decline, but state leaders say fatalities remain tragically high and the fight against the drug epidemic is far from over. Nearly 2,000 Kentuckians died last year from drug overdoses."

They said the punitive and compensatory damages total the largest amount to ever be awarded by a jury in a medical malpractice case in the U.S.",

      "Donald Trump's health team picks includes outspoken critics of the medical establishment and COVID-19 health measures",
      "WASHINGTON -- President-elect Donald Trump has assembled a team of medical contrarians and health care critics to fulfill an agenda aimed at remaking how the federal government oversees medicines, health programs and nutrition.",
      "On Tuesday night, Trump nominated Dr. Jay Bhattacharya to lead the National Institutes of Health, tapping an opponent of pandemic lockdowns and vaccine mandates to lead the nation's top medical research agency. He is the latest in a string of Trump nominees who were critics of COVID-19 health measures.",
      "Bhattacharya and the other nominees are expected to play pivotal roles in implementing Robert F. Kennedy Jr's sprawling \u201cMake America Healthy Again,\u201d agenda, which calls for removing thousands of additives from U.S. foods, rooting out conflicts of interest at agencies and incentivizing healthier foods in school lunches and other nutrition programs. Trump nominated Kennedy to head the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees NIH and other federal health agencies.",
      "The new health priorities bear little resemblance to those of Trump\u2019s first term, which focused on cutting regulations for food, drug and agriculture companies.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re hearing a very different tune as we head into this new Trump administration,\u201d said Gabby Headrick, a nutrition researcher at George Washington University\u2019s school of public health. \u201cIt\u2019s important that we all proceed with caution and remember some of the public health losses we saw the first time.\u201d",
      "Trump's nominees don't have experience running large bureaucratic agencies, but they know how to talk about health on TV.",
      "Centers for Medicare and Medicaid pick Dr. Mehmet Oz hosted a talk show for 13 years and is a well-known wellness and lifestyle influencer. The pick for the Food and Drug Administration, Dr. Marty Makary, and for surgeon general, Dr. Janette Nesheiwat, had been frequent Fox News contributors.",
      "Some of them have ties to Florida like many of Trump's other Cabinet nominees: Dave Weldon, the pick for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, represented the state in Congress for 14 years.",
      "Here's a look at how the nominees may carry out Kennedy's plans to \u201creorganize\u201d agencies, which have an overall $1.7 trillion budget, employ 80,000 scientists, researchers, doctors and other officials:",
      "The National Institutes of Health, with a $48 billion budget, funds medical research through grants to scientists across the nation and conducts its own research.",
      "Bhattacharya, a health economist and physician at Stanford University, was one of three authors of the Great Barrington Declaration, an October 2020 letter maintaining that lockdowns were causing irreparable harm.",
      "The document \u2014 which came before the availability of COVID-19 vaccines \u2014 promoted \u201cherd immunity,\u201d the idea that people at low risk should live normally while building up immunity to COVID-19 through infection. Protection should focus instead on people at higher risk, the document said.",
      "\u201cI think the lockdowns were the single biggest public health mistake,\u201d Bhattacharya said in March 2021 during a panel discussion convened by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.",
      "The Great Barrington Declaration was embraced by some in the first Trump administration, even as it was widely denounced by disease experts. Then- NIH director Dr. Francis Collins called it dangerous and \u201cnot mainstream science.\u201d",
      "His nomination would need to be approved by the Senate.",
      "Kennedy has said he would pause NIH's drug development and infectious disease research and shift its focus to chronic diseases. He also would like to keep NIH funding from researchers with conflicts of interest. In 2017, he said the agency wasn't doing enough research into the role of vaccines in autism \u2014 an idea that has long been debunked.",
      "The Atlanta-based CDC, with a $9.2 billion core budget, is charged with protecting Americans from disease outbreaks and other public health threats.",
      "Kennedy has long attacked vaccines and criticized the CDC, repeatedly alleging corruption at the agency. He said on a 2023 podcast that there is \"no vaccine that is safe and effective,\u201d and urged people to resist the CDC's guidelines about if and when kids should get vaccinated. The World Health Organization estimates that vaccines have saved more than 150 million lives over the past 50 years, and that 100 million of them were infants.",
      "Decades ago, Kennedy found common ground with Weldon, who served in the Army and worked as an internal medicine doctor before he represented a central Florida congressional district from 1995 to 2009.",
      "Starting in the early 2000s, Weldon had a prominent part in a debate about whether there was a relationship between a vaccine preservative called thimerosal and autism. He was a founding member of the Congressional Autism Caucus and tried to ban thimerosal from all vaccines.",
      "Since 2001, all vaccines manufactured for the U.S. market and routinely recommended for children 6 years or younger have contained no thimerosal or only trace amounts, with the exception of inactivated flu vaccine.

      "Extreme weather is making power outages longer and more frequent across the U.S. People with health conditions who depend on medical devices powered by electricity are particularly vulnerable",
      "HOUSTON -- Kimberly Rubit had one priority in mind as Hurricane Beryl ripped through Houston this summer: her severely disabled daughter.",
      "The 63-year-old worked nonstop to prevent Mary, 42, from overheating without air conditioning, water or lights after Beryl knocked out power to their home for 10 days. At least three dozen other people suffered heat-related deaths during the extended outage.",
      "\u201cIt was miserable,\u201d Rubit said. \u201cI\u2019m sick of it.\u201d",
      "Electric grids have buckled more frequently and outages have become longer across the U.S. as the warming atmosphere carries more water and stirs up more destructive storms, according to an AP analysis of government data. In the Pacific Northwest this week, a \u201c bomb cyclone \u201d caused roughly half a million outages.",
      "People with disabilities and chronic health conditions are particularly at risk when the power goes out, and many live in homes that lack the weatherizing and backup power supplies needed to better handle high temperatures and cold freezes, or can't pay their electricity bills, said Columbia University sociomedical sciences professor Diana Hernandez, who studies energy instability in U.S. homes.",
      "At any given time, 1 in 3 households in the U.S. is \"actively trying to avoid a disconnection or contending with the aftermath of it,\u201d Hernandez said.",
      "In Texas, as another winter approaches, people can't shake fears of another blackout like the one during a cold freeze in 2021 that left millions without power for days and killed more than 200 people. Despite efforts to create more resilience, a winter storm that powerful could still lead to rolling blackouts, according to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which manages most of the state's power grid.",
      "Beryl also knocked out power to millions for days, sickening many in the sweltering July heat. Local and state officials showered criticism on CenterPoint Energy, Houston\u2019s power utility, saying it should have communicated more clearly, taken more preventive measures such as tree trimming before the storm hit and repaired downed power lines more quickly. The utility's response remains under investigation by the Texas attorney general.",
      "CenterPoint says it is focused now on improving resiliency, customer communications and community partnerships with the one defining goal: \u201cto build the most resilient coastal grid in the country that can better withstand the extreme weather of the future.\u201d",
      "Texas lawmakers, meanwhile, are debating whether assisted living facilities need more regulation. One suggestion: requiring them to have enough emergency generator fuel to power lifesaving equipment and keep indoor temperatures safe during an extended blackout, as Florida did after a scandal over hurricane-related nursing home deaths.",
      "The legislative panel also reviewed emergency responses this month. Regulated facilities and nursing centers fared better than places such as senior communities that aren't subject to strict oversight, according to city and state officials. This meant hundreds of apartment complexes catering to older adults, as well as private homes, were likely more susceptible to losing power and going without food.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got to find a way to mark these facilities or get it entered into the computer dispatch systems,\u201d said Nim Kidd, chief of the Texas Division of Emergency Management. \u201cThere are so many places in our own city that we have no idea until that 911 call comes into that facility,\u201d he said.",
      "Texas energy companies have been required since 2003 to provide advance notice of scheduled outages to medically vulnerable households that submit a form with physician approval. But that law didn't require the utilities to share these lists with state or local emergency management agencies.",
      "Numerous states have similar regulatory requirements and 38 have policies aimed at preventing disconnections during extreme weather, according to the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program. In Colorado, medically vulnerable residents are protected from disconnection for up to 90 days. In Arkansas, utilities can\u2019t disconnect power to people who are 65 or older if temperatures are forecast to reach above 94 degrees Fahrenheit (34 Celsius).",
      "In Houston, Rubit and her daughter share one of the roughly 3,000 households where unreliable power can quickly spiral into a life-and-death issue because at least one person requires a medical device powered by electricity, according to public filings from CenterPoint. The utility offers such households payment plans to keep the electricity on when they fall behind on their bills.",
      "The utility's efforts bring little solace to community members at a Houston living center for seniors, Commons of Grace, where outages have become a haunting facet of life for more than 100 residents, said Belinda Taylor, who runs a nonprofit partnered with the managing company.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just frustrated that we didn\u2019t get the services that we needed,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous that we have had to suffer.\u201d",
      "Sharon Burks, who lives at Commons of Grace, said it became unbearable when the power went out. She is 63 and uses a breathing machine for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which causes shortness of breath. She had to resort to her battery-powered breathing pump, which isn\u2019t meant to be used for long periods.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t expect anything from CenterPoint,\" Burks said. \"We\u2019re always the last to get it.\u201d"

      "A federal appeals court says medical marijuana businesses in Mississippi don\u2019t have the right to advertise on billboards or other places because marijuana itself remains illegal under federal law",
      "JACKSON, Miss. -- JACKSON, Miss. (AP) \u2014 Medical marijuana businesses in Mississippi don't have the right to advertise on billboards or other places because marijuana itself remains illegal under federal law, an appeals court says.",
      "The owner of a medical marijuana dispensary argued that the First Amendment protects the right to advertise because Mississippi law permits the sale of cannabis products to people with debilitating medical conditions. The state enacted its law in 2022.",
      "A three-judge panel of 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Friday rejected the arguments about advertising. They cited the federal Controlled Substances Act, which since 1970 has prohibited the manufacture, distribution, dispensing and possession of marijuana.",
      "The federal law applies in all states, and Mississippi \u201cfaces no constitutional obstacle to restricting commercial speech relating to unlawful transactions,\u201d the judges wrote.",
      "The Mississippi attorney general's office praised the court decision for upholding \"Mississippi\u2019s reasonable restrictions on advertising for medical marijuana dispensaries by print, broadcast, and other mass communications,\u201d said the office spokesperson, MaryAsa Lee.",
      "Clarence Cocroft II operates Tru Source Medical Cannabis in the northern Mississippi city of Olive Branch. He sued the state in 2023 to challenge its ban on medical marijuana advertising on billboards or in print, broadcast or social media or via mass email or text messaging.",
      "\u201cUpholding this ban makes it incredibly difficult for me to find potential customers and to educate people about Mississippi\u2019s medical marijuana program,\u201d Cocroft said in a statement Monday. \u201cI remain committed to continuing this fight so my business can be treated the same as any other legal business in Mississippi.\u201d",
      "The state allows medical marijuana businesses to have websites or social media accounts that provide information about their retail dispensing locations and a list of products available. It allows them to be listed in phone books or business directories and to display cannabis in company logos. The businesses can also sponsor not-for-profit charity or advocacy events.",
      "Cocroft is represented by the Institute for Justice, a nonprofit libertarian law firm. The firm said Monday that it is considering its next steps in the lawsuit, including possibly asking the entire appeals court to reconsider the case or an appeal to the Supreme Court.",
      "\u201cMississippi cannot on the one hand create an entire marketplace for the sale of medical marijuana, and on the other hand rely on an unenforced federal law to prohibit buyers and sellers from talking about it,\u201d said Ari Bargil, an Institute for Justice attorney."

      "A week before you leave, write down things you need to bring and tasks you need to do before the trip.",
      "\u201cThis can include essential packing items, as well as simple tasks like cleaning out old food from the fridge or watering the plants,\u201d says Jess Feldman, special projects editor at Travel and Leisure magazine. \u201cThe key is to leave the list out for the entire week before you go. I cross the to-dos off throughout the week, and it helps me feel extremely prepared, lessening the stress every time.\u201d",

      "Bringing along some snacks or a sandwich from home can feel comforting and be a great alternative to pricey airport offerings.",
      "\u201cI tend to pack for worst-case scenarios, such as flight delays and cancellations. This includes bringing things to do of course, like more than one book, knitting materials, or a few extra downloaded movies,\u201d Feldman says. For longer journeys, she might bring a meal in a Tupperware container.",
      "To counter the dry air on flights, bring along an empty water bottle (fill it after you go through security ) and a small pouch with lip balm and travel-size moisturizers.",
      "Hallie Gould, editor in chief of Byrdie, a digital site for beauty care, recommends \u201cloading up on skin hydration before your flight. That means drinking extra fluids and applying moisturizing skin products to boost hydration, so you\u2019re covering your bases inside and out.\u201d",
      "And don\u2019t forget your hair.",
      "\u201cJust as the low humidity on the airplane is dehydrating for your skin, it can also dry out your hair. If possible, use a deep conditioner before your trip,\u201d Gould says.",
      "\u201cEvery airline has different requirements when it comes to the boarding process, paying for perks in advance, or seat upgrades,\u201d Feldman says. \u201cIt\u2019s best to understand all of the above before getting to the airport so that you are not taken off guard.\u201d",
      "Having the airline's app lets you know about gate changes, flight delays or cancellations sooner and allows you to more quickly find alternative flights or connections if needed.",
      "Security lines can be much longer \u2014 and slower \u2014 than expected, and so can the walk through a large airport. So giving yourself plenty of extra time can reduce stress. The general rule of thumb is to arrive at the airport two hours before departure for domestic flights and three hours before international flights.",
      "If you\u2019re too early, you can always explore the airport shops and lounges or settle in with a good book somewhere.",
      "\u201cI always confirm whether or not there is a lounge I have access to in my departing gate ahead of time,\u201d Feldman says. But even without lounge access, she says, \"I like to know what the restaurants and waiting areas (near) the gate are like.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you have a sense of why you are feeling stressed, it can help to figure out ways to reduce that stress,\" says Lynn F.

Is there someone in your family who can help with parts of the planning?\u201d",
      "Recognize that crowds, bad weather and canceled flights are beyond your control.",
      "And some people just don't like to travel far or to fly.",
      "\u201cIf it\u2019s fear, like fear of flying, it\u2019s important to know that it can be treated, and that treatment can really improve the quality of your life,\u201d Bufka says.",
      "A little extra time tidying your home and making sure you have some easy-to-prepare food ready in the freezer or pantry will make for a much more welcoming return.",
      "\u201cAlways, always, always clean your space before leaving for a trip. You are inevitably going to feel a bit off after a long travel day, and coming home to an unorganized space will make it so much worse,\u201d Feldman says.",

      "Russia's second major aerial attack on Ukraine's power grid in less than two weeks amplified fears that the Kremlin aims to cripple the country's power generation capacity before winter.",
      "\u201cAttacks on energy facilities are happening all over Ukraine,\u201d Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko said in a post on Facebook. He added that emergency power outages were implemented nationwide.",
      "Russia in previous years has targeted Ukraine\u2019s electricity generation, aiming to deny civilians critical heating and drinking water supplies during the bitter winter months and break Ukrainian spirits. The attacks also seek to hobble Ukraine\u2019s defense industry that is now producing missiles, drones and armored vehicles, among other military assets.",
      "In some regions on Thursday, Kalibr cruise missiles with cluster munitions smashed into civilian targets, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said, calling it \u201can insidious escalation.\u201d Cluster munitions release numerous small bombs over a wide area, making them dangerous to civilians both during and after an attack.",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed his forces struck 17 Ukrainian targets Thursday, including military facilities and their \u201csupport systems,\u201d with 100 drones and 90 missiles.",
      "It was the 11th massive combined attack by Russia on Ukraine's energy infrastructure this year.",
      "But the Ukrainian air force claimed to have shot down 76 cruise missiles and three other types of missile as well as 32 drones. It added that it lost track of 62 Russian drones, which most likely were jammed by electronic warfare.",
      "Neither side's claims could be independently verified.",
      "Ukrainian officials have warned recently that Russia was stockpiling cruise and ballistic missiles, presumably for another pre-winter aerial campaign against Ukraine\u2019s power grid. Ukrainian officials have in the past accused Russia of \u201cweaponizing winter.\u201d Such massive attacks have been a regular feature of the war.",
      "Around half of Ukraine\u2019s energy infrastructure has been destroyed during the almost three years of war with Russia, and rolling electricity blackouts are common. Kyiv's Western allies have sought to help Ukraine protect power generation with air defense systems and funds for rebuilding.",
      "Last March, the International Criminal Court in The Hague issued arrest warrants for two high-ranking Russian military officers on war crimes charges linked to attacks on Ukraine\u2019s civilian infrastructure, including power plants and electricity sub-stations.",
      "The war has been going in Russia's favor in recent months as its bigger army uses its advantages in manpower and equipment to push Ukrainian forces backward in eastern areas, though its offensive has been slow and costly.",
      "Putin said that over the past two days Russia had fired 100 missiles and 466 drones at Ukraine, saying they were a response to Ukraine using American-made missiles to hit targets on Russian soil after gaining permission to do so from President Joe Biden.",
      "Speaking at a summit in Kazakhstan of a security alliance of former Soviet nations, Putin threatened to use a new intermediate-range ballistic missile, called Oreshnik, against \u201cdecision-making centers\u201d in Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital.",
      "The missile launched for the first time at Ukraine last week has six warheads and flies at 10 times the speed of sound, according to Putin, who declared that it can't be intercepted by any modern air defense systems.",
      "Oreshnik can penetrate underground bunkers and releases dozens of submunitions that \u201cturn everything to dust,\u201d Putin said. The use of several Oreshnik missiles in one strike would be comparable in its devastating power to a nuclear weapon, he claimed.",

      "A former British soldier who claimed he was trying to work as a double agent has been convicted of spying for Iran",
      "LONDON -- A former British soldier whose audacious escape from a London prison spurred a dayslong search was convicted on Thursday of spying for Iran.",
      "Daniel Khalife, 23, was found guilty by a jury in Woolwich Crown Court on violations of Britain's Official Secrets Act and Terrorism Act by collecting information useful to an enemy \u2014 Iran. He was cleared of a charge of planting fake bombs in his military barracks.",
      "Prosecutors said Khalife played a \u201ccynical game\u201d by claiming he wanted to be a spy after he had delivered a large amount of restricted and classified material to the Iranian intelligence service, including the names of special forces officers.",
      "Khalife testified that he had been in touch with people in the Iranian government but that it was all part of a ploy to ultimately work as a double agent for Britain, a scheme he developed from watching the TV show \u201cHomeland.\u201d",
      "\u201cI wanted to utilize my background to further our national security,\u201d he told jurors.",
      "Defense lawyer Gul Nawaz Hussein said Khalife\u2019s aspirations to be a James Bond figure were na\u00efve, stupid and bordered on slapstick. He said his client was more \u201cScooby Doo\u201d than \u201c007.\u201d",
      "Despite what seemed like amateurish bumbling, Cmdr. Dominic Murphy, head of counter terrorism at the Metropolitan Police, said Khalife presented a danger.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s the ultimate Walter Mitty character who was having a significant impact in the real world,\u201d Murphy said, referring to the fictional character in a James Thurber short story about a meek proofreader who daydreams of daring escapades.",
      "\u201cWe know very well the threat that Iranians pose to the U.K.'s national security\u201d Murphy said, noting that 20 plots, including assassination plans, had been disrupted by U.K. authorities.",
      "Khalife\u2019s court case had not received much attention until he escaped from a London prison in September 2023 and went on the run for three days.",
      "Khalife was working in the kitchen in Wandsworth Prison, in south London, when he strapped himself to the bottom of a delivery truck and got a lift to freedom. He was ultimately nabbed on a canal path after a massive search.",
      "The escape from the Victorian-era prison exposed much broader weaknesses with the nation\u2019s aging and overcrowded correctional system. An inquiry is currently underway into how Khalife was able to escape and whether others helped.",
      "During his trial, Khalife pleaded guilty to the escape, but continued to contest the spying charges.",
      "Justice Bobbie Cheema-Grubb said Khalife faces \u201ca long custodial sentence\u201d when he is sentenced after the New Year.",
      "Khalife joined the Army at 16 and was assigned to the Royal Corps of Signals, a communications unit that is deployed with battlefield troops, as well as special forces and intelligence squads.",
      "He was told he could not join the intelligence service because his mother is from Iran.",
      "At 17, he reached out to a man connected with Iranian intelligence and began passing along information, prosecutors said. He was given NATO secret security clearance when he took part in a joint exercise at Fort Cavazos in Texas in early 2021.",
      "British security officials were not aware of Khalife\u2019s contacts with the Iranians until he contacted MI6, the U.K.\u2019s foreign intelligence service, to offer to work as a double agent.",
      "He reached out to MI6 anonymously, saying he had earned the trust of his Iranian handlers and that they had rewarded him by leaving $2,000 cash ($1,578 pounds) in a dog poo bag in a north London park.",

      "Greek officials say that four migrants, including two children, died when a boat struck rocks near the Greek island of Samos",
      "ATHENS, Greece -- Four people, including two children, died after a boat carrying migrants ran aground on a rocky shoreline of Samos, the second shipwreck this week on the eastern Greek island, officials said Thursday.",
      "Sixteen people were rescued, but it remained unclear how many were aboard the boat. The Greek coast guard launched a search-and-rescue operation involving patrol vessels, lifeboats, and land teams to locate any potential missing passengers.",
      "A Greek government official said he expected the risk facing migrants to rise over the winter months, and blamed conflicts in the Middle East for a swell in illegal crossings this year.",
      "On Monday, eight migrants \u2014 six children and two women \u2014 died in a shipwreck off Samos.",
      "Samos and other Greek islands in the eastern Aegean Sea are key transit points for migrants crossing from Turkey to the European Union, with a rise in arrivals in recent months that Greek authorities say is linked to ongoing wars in the Middle East and parts of Africa.",
      "\u201cThe conditions are certainly not favorable,\u201d Migration Minister Nikos Panagiotopoulos told private Skai television Thursday.",
      "\u201cThey do not tend towards reducing the flow of migrants, but rather increasing them \u2014 with all the geopolitical turmoil, especially in the Middle East, with ongoing wars and other issues,\u201d he said.",
      "Panagiotopoulos said he expected the risk of tragedies in the eastern Aegean to increase in the coming weeks as weather conditions worsen, and added that Greece will renew efforts to seek European Union funding for border wall construction under the next Polish presidency of the EU, which starts on Jan. 1.",
      "Separately, police announced on Thursday the arrest of nine people accused of operating a smuggling ring that allegedly provided migrants with false and illegally used documents to travel to western European cities.",
      "The group, active since July, provided migrants with safe housing, clothing, and travel documents before escorting them to Athens International Airport, police said. Fees for those services ranged from 3,000 to 5,000 euros ($3,150 to 5,250).",
      "Also on Thursday, the Greek coast guard said it had arrested a Syrian man on suspicion of ferrying 5 adults and 13 children by speedboat from Turkey to Samos. The boat was intercepted just off the island on Wednesday, a coast guard statement said, and its occupants were taken to the port of Karlovassi on Samos.",
      "According to United Nations data, some 56,000 migrants have illegally entered Greece so far this year \u2014 mostly in small boats from Turkey \u2014 compared to roughly 48,000 for the whole of 2023.",

      "The proposed breakup, floated in a 23-page document filed this month by the U.S. Department of Justice, calls for sweeping punishments that would include a sale of Google\u2019s industry-leading Chrome web browser and impose restrictions to prevent Android from favoring its own search engine."

      "SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador -- El Salvador President Nayib Bukele proclaimed himself in favor of mining gold in the Central America country Wednesday and called his nation\u2019s 7-year-old ban on metals mining \u201cabsurd,\u201d immediately putting in jeopardy the historic prohibition.",
      "The unmined gold would be \u201cwealth that could transform El Salvador,\u201d he wrote on the social platform X. Bukele's party controls El Salvador's Congress by a wide margin and his political opposition has been devastated, so a formal proposal to end the ban is unlikely to meet much resistance.",
      "In 2017, El Salvador banned all metals mining above ground and below. A broad coalition of sectors, including the Catholic church, supported the prohibition in order to protect the small country\u2019s water resources from contamination.",
      "At that point, exploration had revealed deposits of gold and silver, but there was no large-scale metal mining. It's unclear what its gold reserves could be.",
      "Bukele on Wednesday proposed \u201cmodern and sustainable\u201d mining that would care for the environment.",
      "Environmentalists quickly criticized the president\u2019s boosterism.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not true that there\u2019s green mining, it\u2019s paid for with lives, kidney, respiratory problems and leukemia that aren\u2019t immediate,\u201d said Amalia L\u00f3pez with the Alliance Against the Privatization of Water.",
      "Their concerns include the amount of water needed for mining operations and the storage of water contaminated with heavy metals.",
      "Having achieved what he calls a \u201csecurity miracle\u201d in weakening El Salvador\u2019s powerful street gangs by locking up more than 80,000 Salvadorans accused of gang affiliation since March 2022, Bukele has said he is looking to bring a similar turnaround to the economy.",
      "It is a reversal for the highly popular and recently reelected Bukele, who during his first campaign for the presidency in 2019 said he supported the mining ban.",
      "In 2021, Bukele proposed using El Salvador\u2019s geothermal power to mine the cryptocurrency bitcoin, which requires tremendous amounts of electricity \u2014 but not real mining \u2014 to power computers that make complex mathematical calculations day and night that verify transactions."

    "story": [
      "The Australian Parliament has passed a social media ban for young children in a world-first law",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- A social media ban for children under 16 passed the Australian Parliament on Friday in a world-first law.",
      "The law will make platforms including TikTok, Facebook, Snapchat, Reddit, X and Instagram liable for fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars ($33 million) for systemic failures to prevent children younger than 16 from holding accounts.",
      "The Senate passed the bill on Thursday 34 votes to 19. The House of Representatives on Wednesday overwhelmingly approved the legislation by 102 votes to 13.",
      "The House on Friday endorsed opposition amendments made in the Senate, making the bill law.",
      "Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the law supported parents concerned by online harms to their children.",
      "\u201cPlatforms now have a social responsibility to ensure the safety of our kids is a priority for them,\u201d Albanese told reporters.",
      "The platforms have one year to work out how they could implement the ban before penalties are enforced.",
      "Meta Platforms, which owns Facebook and Instagram, said the legislation had been \u201crushed.\u201d",
      "Digital Industry Group Inc., an advocate for the platforms in Australia, said questions remain about the law\u2019s impact on children, its technical foundations and scope.",
      "\u201cThe social media ban legislation has been released and passed within a week and, as a result, no one can confidently explain how it will work in practice \u2013 the community and platforms are in the dark about what exactly is required of them,\u201d DIGI managing director Sunita Bose said.",
      "The amendments passed on Friday bolster privacy protections. Platforms would not be allowed to compel users to provide government-issued identity documents including passports or driver\u2019s licenses, nor could they demand digital identification through a government system.",
      "Critics of the legislation fear that banning young children from social media will impact the privacy of all users who must establish they are older than 16.",
      "While the major parties support the ban, many child welfare and mental health advocates are concerned about unintended consequences.",
      "Sen. David Shoebridge, from the minority Greens party, said mental health experts agreed that the ban could dangerously isolate many children who used social media to find support.",
      "\u201cThis policy will hurt vulnerable young people the most, especially in regional communities and especially the LGBTQI community, by cutting them off,\u201d Shoebridge told the Senate.",
      "Exemptions will apply for health and education services including YouTube, Messenger Kids, WhatsApp, Kids Helpline and Google Classroom.",
      "Opposition Sen. Maria Kovacic said the bill was not radical but necessary. \u201cThe core focus of this legislation is simple: It demands that social media companies take reasonable steps to identify and remove underage users from their platforms,\u201d Kovacic told the Senate.",
      "\u201cThis is a responsibility these companies should have been fulfilling long ago, but for too long they have shirked these responsibilities in favor of profit,\u201d she added.",
      "Online safety campaigner Sonya Ryan, whose 15-year-old daughter Carly was murdered by a 50-year-old pedophile who pretended to be a teenager online, described the Senate vote as a \u201cmonumental moment in protecting our children from horrendous harms online.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s too late for my daughter, Carly, and the many other children who have suffered terribly and those who have lost their lives in Australia, but let us stand together on their behalf and embrace this together,\u201d she said.",
      "Wayne Holdsworth, whose teenage son Mac took his own life after falling victim to an online sextortion scam, had advocated for the age restriction and took pride in its passage.",
      "\u201cI have always been a proud Australian, but for me subsequent to today\u2019s Senate decision, I am bursting with pride,\u201d Holdsworth said.",
      "Christopher Stone, executive director of Suicide Prevention Australia, the governing body for the suicide prevention sector, said the legislation failed to consider positive aspects of social media in supporting young people\u2019s mental health and sense of connection.",
      "\u201cThe government is running blindfolded into a brick wall by rushing this legislation. Young Australians deserve evidence-based policies, not decisions made in haste,\u201d Stone said.",
      "The platforms had complained that the law would be unworkable and had urged the Senate to delay the vote until at least June 2025 when a government-commissioned evaluation of age assurance technologies will report on how young children could be excluded.",
      "\u201cNaturally, we respect the laws decided by the Australian Parliament,\" Facebook and Instagram owner Meta Platforms said. \u201cHowever, we are concerned about the process which rushed the legislation through while failing to properly consider the evidence, what industry already does to ensure age-appropriate experiences, and the voices of young people.\u201d",
      "Snapchat said it was also concerned by the law and would cooperate with the government regulator, the eSafety Commissioner.",
      "\"While there are many unanswered questions about how this law will be implemented in practice, we will engage closely with the Government and the eSafety Commissioner during the 12-month implementation period to help develop an approach that balances privacy, safety and practicality. As always, Snap will comply with any applicable laws and regulations in Australia,\u201d Snapchat said in a statement.",
      "Critics argue the government is attempting to convince parents it is protecting their children ahead of a general election due by May. The government hopes that voters will reward it for responding to parents\u2019 concerns about their children\u2019s addiction to social media. Some argue the legislation could cause more harm than it prevents.",
      "Criticisms include that the legislation was rushed through Parliament without adequate scrutiny, is ineffective, poses privacy risks for all users, and undermines the authority of parents to make decisions for their children.",
      "Opponents also argue the ban would isolate children, deprive them of the positive aspects of social media, drive them to the dark web, discourage children too young for social media to report harm, and reduce incentives for platforms to improve online safety.",

      "Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos says impeaching the vice president, who is facing a legal storm after publicly threatening to have him killed, would be a waste of time for Congress",
      "MANILA, Philippines -- Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said Friday that filing impeachment complaints against the vice president, who is facing a legal storm after publicly threatening to have him killed, would be a waste of time for Congress.",
      "It was unclear whether Marcos\u2019 remark would stop plans by several groups to file impeachment complaints against Duterte over a number of criminal allegations, including her alleged misuse of confidential government funds and her recent public threat to have the president, his wife and the speaker of the House of Representatives killed if she herself were killed in a plot she has not detailed.",
      "The legal troubles facing the vice president and her father, former President Rodrigo Duterte, are unfolding in the backdrop of their worsening feud with Marcos. It's the latest battle between the country's most powerful families in a long-unwieldy democracy that has been dominated for decades by political dynasties.",
      "But Marcos played down the political showdown.",
      "\"It\u2019s a storm in a teacup,\u201d he told reporters.",
      "\"This is not important. This will not make any difference to even one single Filipino life, so, why waste time on it?\u201d he said of an impeachment. Impeachment complaints are being prepared for filing before the House, which is led by Marcos\u2019 cousin and political ally, Martin Romualdez.",
      "Duterte regards Romualdez as a bitter opponent. Both are seen as potential presidential candidates in 2028.",
      "Duterte has ruled out a political reconciliation with Marcos. They were running mates in 2022 and won by landslides in a campaign of national unity but later had a falling out on several issues, including over their support for China or the Unites States.",
      "Marcos has strengthened a defense alliance with the U.S. as the Philippines faces an increasingly aggressive China in the disputed South China Sea.",
      "The vice president has refused to condemn China\u2019s assertive actions and her father nurtured close ties as president with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, and Russian leader Vladimir Putin while criticizing U.S. and Western security policies.",
      "Marcos has also opposed the former president\u2019s anti-drug crackdown that left thousands of mostly poor suspects dead and sparked an ongoing investigation by the International Criminal Court as a possible crime against humanity.",
      "When asked about the vice president\u2019s remark that their estranged political alliance \u201chas reached a point of return,\u201d the president said, \u201cNever say never.\"",
      "Duterte, a 46-year-old lawyer, failed to appear on Friday before investigators at the National Bureau of Investigation, which issued a subpoena for her to explain her threats against the president, his wife and Romualdez, which were made in an online news conference over the weekend.",
      "She said she needed to see the questions she would face, and her appearance before the investigators was reset to Dec. 11. The vice president has said her remarks were not actual threats and were made to highlight an unspecified danger she was facing.",
      "Marcos has said her remarks were a criminal plot and added he would fight back.",
      "Under Philippine law, such public remarks may constitute a crime of threatening to inflict a wrong on a person or their family and are punishable by a prison term and fine.",
      "Separately, the Department of Justice has said investigators are looking into potentially seditious remarks by the vice president\u2019s father, former President Rodrigo Duterte, who said in a news conference on Monday that the government would only seriously listen to allegations of government corruption if the military speaks up.",
      "\u201cThere is a fractured governance,\u201d the former president said. \u201cIt is only the military who can correct it.\u201d",
      "He clarified that he was not calling on the military to stage an uprising. He also asked how long the military could still serve under a commander in chief \u201cwho is a drug addict\u201d \u2014 an accusation he has made often and Marcos has repeatedly denied.",

      "Syria's opposition groups say armed forces launched a large-scale attack on areas controlled by government forces and seized territory in northwestern Syria",
      "Syrian armed groups launched a large-scale attack on areas controlled by government forces and seized territory in northwestern Syria, opposition groups said Thursday. The government and its allies responded with airstrikes and shelling to ward off the insurgent advances, activists said.",
      "The violence has displaced thousands of families, and forced aid groups to suspend some of their services. Volunteers with the Syrian Civil Defense, known as the White Helmets, said at least 18 people, including three children and two women, were killed in two different villages in western Aleppo following airstrikes. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a war monitor, said the airstrikes were from Russian warplanes.",
      "Syria\u2019s armed forces said Thursday the offensive was led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, which controls much of northwest Syria and is a violation of a de-escalation agreement. It said the attacks are ongoing and have targeted a number of villages and military bases.",
      "Turkey, which backs Syrian opposition factions, and Russia and Iran, which have backed government forces, reached an agreement in late 2019 that effectively froze the line of the conflict and prevented government advances in Idlib province, which has been the last stronghold for a mix of radical groups and Turkey-backed Syrian forces.",
      "\u201cOur forces are confronting the terrorist organizations with different power and in collaboration with friendly forces to ensure the situation returns to how it was,\" the army statement said.",
      "Opposition factions launched the offensive early Wednesday and claimed in a series of statements on social media that they have wrestled control of over 15 villages from government forces in northwestern Aleppo, capturing a military base and hardware, and taking a number of soldiers hostage.",
      "The offensive expanded Thursday to reach the countryside of Idlib province, where government forces control a major highway and a strategic town that was previously held by the insurgents, the armed groups and the Syrian Observatory said. The Associated Press could not independently verify those claims.",
      "The opposition fighters said their offensive will allow the return of thousands of displaced people who were forced to flee government bombardment in recent weeks.",
      "The offensive follows weeks of simmering violence in the area, where activists said government and allied Russian forces have stepped up their bombardment of parts of the last remaining stronghold of the opposition.",
      "The International Rescue Committee said at least 7,000 families have been newly displaced by the escalating hostilities and some schools and health facilities have been forced to suspend services, including IRC's own field operations.",
      "The offensive also came as Iran-linked groups, who had backed Syrian government forces since 2015, have been preoccupied with their own battle at home.",
      "Israel and Hezbollah, the lead group in the Iran-backed alliance, have been locked in a war that escalated since September. A cease-fire was announced Wednesday, the day the Syrian opposition factions announced their offensive. Israel has also escalated its attacks against Hezbollah and Iran-linked targets in Syria during the last 70 days.",
      "Formerly known as the Nusra Front, the Syrian branch of al-Qaida, HTS later changed its name several times and distanced itself from al-Qaida.",
      "Russia, along with Iran, backed Syrian government forces soon after the anti-government protests in 2011 turned into a war. Turkey has backed an array of opposition forces and established military presence in parts of northwestern Syria. Meanwhile, the United States has supported Syrian Kurdish forces fighting Islamic State militants largely in the east of the country.",
      "Turkey said Thursday it was closely monitoring the offensive launched by the opposition groups in northern Syria. Unnamed defense ministry officials quoted in the state-run Anadolu Agency said Thursday the Turkish military had taken \u201call kinds of measures\u201d to protect its troops in Syria.",
      "Turkish security officials said on Thursday that Syrian opposition groups initially launched a \u201climited\u201d offensive towards Aleppo, from where attacks targeting civilians originated. However, the offensive expanded as Syrian government forces began to retreat from their positions.",
      "The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations, said opposition groups in Idlib had long planned an offensive to expel Syrian government forces and militias from the area to protect civilians. Turkey had previously prevented these operations to avoid escalating tensions in the region, especially amid Israel\u2019s military actions in Gaza and Lebanon.",
      "The officials indicated that the offensive proceeded after Turkish diplomatic efforts to prevent government attacks were unsuccessful.",

      "Researchers and religious leaders have released findings from an intriguing two-month experiment through art in a Catholic chapel in Switzerland",
      "LUCERNE, Switzerland -- Would you trust an \u201cAI Jesus\u201d with your innermost thoughts and troubles?",
      "Researchers and religious leaders on Wednesday released findings from a two-month experiment through art in a Catholic chapel in Switzerland, where an avatar of \u201cJesus\u201d on a computer screen \u2014 tucked into a confessional \u2014 took questions by visitors on faith, morality and modern-day woes, and offered responses based on Scripture.",
      "The idea, said the chapel\u2019s theological assistant, was to recognize the growing importance of artificial intelligence in human lives, even when it comes to religion, and explore the limits of human trust in a machine.",
      "After the two-month run of the \u201cDeus in Machina\u201d exhibit at Peter\u2019s Chapel starting in late August, some 900 conversations from visitors \u2013- some came more than once \u2013- were transcribed anonymously. Those behind the project said it was largely a success: Visitors often came out moved or deep in thought, and found it easy to use.",
      "A small sign invited visitors to enter a confessional -\u2013 chosen for its intimacy \u2013- and below a lattice screen across which penitent believers would usually speak with a priest, a green light signaled the visitor's turn to speak, and a red one came on when \u201cAI Jesus\u201d on a computer screen on the other side was responding.",
      "Often, a lag time was needed to wait for the response \u2013 a testament to the technical complexities. After exiting, nearly 300 visitors filled out questionnaires that informed the report released Wednesday.",
      "Philipp Haslbauer, an IT specialist at the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts who pulled together the technical side of the project, said the AI responsible for taking the role of \u201cAI Jesus\u201d and generating responses was GPT-4o by OpenAI, and an open-source version of the company\u2019s Whisper was used for speech comprehension.",
      "An AI video generator from Heygen was used to produce voice and video from a real person, he said. Haslbauer said no specific safeguards were used \u201cbecause we observed GPT-4o to respond fairly well to controversial topics.\u201d",
      "Visitors broached many topics, including true love, the afterlife, feelings of solitude, war and suffering in the world, the existence of God, plus issues like sexual abuse cases in the Catholic Church or its position on homosexuality.",
      "Most visitors described themselves as Christians, though agnostics, atheists, Muslims, Buddhists and Taoists took part too, according to a recap of the project released by the Catholic parish of Lucerne.",
      "About one-third were German speakers, but \u201cAI Jesus\u201d \u2014 which is conversant in about 100 languages \u2014 also had conversations in languages like Chinese, English, French, Hungarian, Italian, Russian and Spanish.",
      "\u201cWhat was really interesting (was) to see that the people really talked with him in a serious way. They didn\u2019t come to make jokes,\u201d said chapel theologian Marco Schmid, who spearheaded the project. Most visitors were aged 40 to 70, and more Catholics respondents found the experience stimulating than did Protestants, the report showed.",
      "Schmid was quick to point out that the \u201cAI Jesus\u201d \u2013 billed as a \u201cJesus-like\u201d persona \u2013 was an artistic experiment to get people thinking about the intersection between the digital and the divine, not substitute for human interaction or sacramental confessions with a priest, nor was it intended to save pastoral resources.",
      "\u201cFor the people it was clear that it was a computer ... It was clear it was not a confession,\u201d Schmid said. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t programmed to give absolutions or prayers. At the end, it was more summary of the conversation.\u201d",
      "The Catholic Church from the Vatican on down has been wrestling with the challenges \u2013- and possible opportunities -\u2013 presented by the explosion in public interest in AI since generative artificial intelligence captured the world\u2019s attention two years ago when OpenAI's ChatGPT made its debut.",
      "The Vatican has appointed a friar from a medieval Franciscan order as its top expert on AI, and a Lutheran church in Bavaria served up sermons delivered by a chatbot last year. Pope Francis, in his annual peace message for this year, pushed for an international treaty to ensure the ethical use of AI technology.",
      "Chatbots like ChatGPT are powered by algorithmic models trained on vast pools of text and other data to mimic speech and generate seemingly unique and human-like responses.",
      "Haslbauer is sensitive to public reaction and has noted chatter on social media saying the project is \u201cblasphemous\u201d or the \u201cwork of the devil.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you read comments on the internet about it, some are very negative \u2014 which is scary,\u201d Haslbauer, whose long-haired look featured as a basis for the image of the virtual Jesus.",
      "In a demonstration of the technology in the chapel, Haslbauer queried \u201cAI Jesus\u201d about its message for a troubled world, and about whether AI could be helpful as a way for people to find God.",
      "\u201cAll knowledge and wisdom ultimately come from God,\" the chatbot said in a soothing voice, after a pause to respond, and the image briefly crackled. \u201cIf used wisely, AI can indeed be a tool to explore the wonders of creation, deepen our understanding of Scripture, and foster connections among people.\u201d",
      "\"Yet it remains essential to seek God with all your heart and soul beyond any technology,\u201d it added.",
      "Kenneth Cukier, a journalist, author and expert with the U.S.-based nonprofit group called \u201cAI and Faith,\u201d said if \u201cAI Jesus\u201d helps people connect deeper to themselves and the world, it \u201chas to be a good thing.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt will lead to better individuals and a better world,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever \u2014 and there\u2019s a big however \u2014 this does feel a little bit infantile, and pardon my pun, machine-like.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe risk is that it pulls people, ultimately, farther away from that which is more meaningful, deeper and authentic in spirituality,\u201d said Cukier, co-author of \u201cBig Data: A Revolution that Will Transform How We Work, Live and Think.\u201d",
      "For Schmid, the exhibit was a pilot project \u2014 and he doesn't foresee a second coming of \u201cAI Jesus\u201d anytime soon.",
      "\u201cFor us, it was also clear it was just a limited time that we will expose this Jesus,\" he said, adding that any return would need to be done after deeper thought.",
      "\u201cWe are discussing ... how we could revive him again,\" he said, noting interest from parishes, schoolteachers, researchers and others as the project got media attention in Switzerland and beyond. \u201cThey all are interested and would like to have this \u2018AI Jesus\u2019. So we have now a little bit to reflect on how we want to continue.\"",

Many couldn\u2019t afford the $35 charged by stores for a 50-kilogram (about 110-pound) bag of poultry feed, said Francis Makura, a specialist with a USAID program aimed at broadening revenue streams for farmers affected by climate change.",
      "But maggot farming reduces production costs by about 40%, he said.",
      "The maggots are offspring of the black soldier fly, which originates in tropical South America. Unlike the house fly, it is not known to spread disease.",
      "Their life cycle lasts just weeks, and they lay between 500 and 900 eggs. The larvae devour decaying organic items \u2014 from rotting fruit and vegetables to kitchen scraps and animal manure \u2014 and turn them into a rich protein source for livestock.",
      "\u201cIt is even better than the crude protein we get from soya,\u201d said Robert Musundire, a professor specializing in agricultural science and entomology at Chinhoyi University of Technology in Zimbabwe, which breeds the insects and helps farmers with breeding skills.",
      "Donors and governments have pushed for more black soldier fly maggot farming in Africa because of its low labor and production costs and huge benefits to agriculture, the continent\u2019s mainstay that is under pressure from climate change and Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine.",
      "In Uganda, the maggots helped plug a fertilizer crisis caused by the war in Ukraine. In Nigeria and Kenya, they are becoming a commercial success.",
      "In Zimbabwe, the government and partners piloted it among farmers struggling with securing soya meal for their animals. A World Bank-led project later used it as a recovery effort for communities affected by a devastating 2019 cyclone.",
      "Now it is becoming a lifesaver for some communities in the country of 15 million people where repeated droughts make it difficult to grow corn. It's not clear how many people across the country are involved in maggot-farming projects.",
      "At first, \u201ca mere 5%\u201d of farmers that Musundire, the professor, approached agreed to venture into maggot farming. Now that\u2019s up to \u201cabout 50%,\u201d he said, after people understood the protein benefits and the lack of disease transmission.",
      "The \u201cyuck factor\u201d was an issue. But necessity triumphed, he said.",
      "With the drought decimating crops and big livestock such as cattle \u2014 a traditional symbol of wealth and status and a source of labor \u2014 small livestock like chickens are helping communities recover more quickly.",
      "\u201cThey can fairly raise a decent livelihood out of the resources they have within a short period of time,\u201d Musundire said.",
      "It also helps the environment. Zimbabwe produces about 1.6 million tons of waste annually, 90% of which can be recycled or composted, according to the country\u2019s Environmental Management Agency. Experts say feeding it to maggots can help reduce greenhouse emissions in a country where garbage collection is erratic.",
      "At a plot near the university, Musundire and his students run a maggot breeding center in the city of 100,000 people. The project collects over 35 metric tons a month in food waste from the university\u2019s canteens as well as vegetable markets, supermarkets, abattoirs, food processing companies and beer brewers.",
      "\u201cFood waste is living, it respires and it contributes to the generation of greenhouse gases,\u201d Musundire said.",
      "According to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization, food loss \u2014 which occurs in the stages before reaching the consumer \u2014 and food waste after sale account for 8% to 10% of greenhouse gas emissions globally, or about five times that of the aviation sector.",
      "The university project converts about 20-30 metric tons of the waste into livestock protein or garden manure in about two weeks.",
      "Choumambo said people often sneer as she goes around her own community collecting banana peels and other waste that people toss out at the market and bus station.",
      "\u201cI tell them we have good use for it, it is food for our maggots,\u201d she said. She still has to contend with \u201cignorant\u201d people who accuse maggot farmers of \u201cbreeding cholera.\u201d",
      "But she cares little about that as her farm begins to thrive.",
      "From bare survival, it is becoming a profitable venture. She can harvest up to 15 kilograms (about 33 pounds) of maggots in 21 days, turning out 375 kilograms (826.7 pounds) of chicken feed after mixing it with drought-tolerant crops such as millets, cowpeas and sunflower and a bit of salt.",
      "Choumambo sells some of the feed to fellow villagers at a fraction of the cost charged by stores for traditional animal feed. She also sells eggs and free-range chickens, a delicacy in Zimbabwe, to restaurants. She's one of 14 women in her village taking up the project.",
      "\u201cI never imagined keeping and surviving on maggots,\u201d she said, taking turns with a neighbor to mix rotting vegetables, corn meal and other waste in a tank using a shovel.",
      "\u201cMany people would puke at the sight and the stench. But this is the sweet smell of food for the maggots, and for us, the farmers.\u201d",

      "Following a policy meeting, the Bank of Korea cut its benchmark interest rate by a quarter percentage point to 3%. The bank lowered its outlook for the country\u2019s economic growth to 2.2% from 2.4% for this year and to 1.9% from 2.1% for 2025.",
      "The bank is taking steps to lower borrowing costs despite the lingering effects of high inflation and alarming levels of household debt, as the economy falters.",
      "The bank cut its policy rate by a quarter percentage point to 3.25% in October in its first rate cut since May 2020 in the depths of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

      "KYIV, Ukraine -- Desertion is starving the Ukrainian army of desperately needed manpower and crippling its battle plans at a crucial time in its war with Russia, which could put Kyiv at a clear disadvantage in future ceasefire talks.",
      "Facing every imaginable shortage, tens of thousands of Ukrainian troops, tired and bereft, have walked away from combat and front-line positions to slide into anonymity, according to soldiers, lawyers and Ukrainian officials. Entire units have abandoned their posts, leaving defensive lines vulnerable and accelerating territorial losses, according to military commanders and soldiers.",
      "Some take medical leave and never return, haunted by the traumas of war and demoralized by bleak prospects for victory. Others clash with commanders and refuse to carry out orders, sometimes in the middle of firefights.",
      "\u201cThis problem is critical,\u201d said Oleksandr Kovalenko, a Kyiv-based military analyst. \u201cThis is the third year of war, and this problem will only grow.\u201d",
      "Although Moscow has also been dealing with desertions, Ukrainians going AWOL have laid bare deeply rooted problems bedeviling their military and how Kyiv is managing the war, from the flawed mobilization drive to the overstretching and hollowing out of front-line units. It comes as the U.S. urges Ukraine to draft more troops, and allow for the conscription of those as young as 18.",
      "The Associated Press spoke to two deserters, three lawyers, and a dozen Ukrainian officials and military commanders. Officials and commanders spoke on condition of anonymity to divulge classified information, while one deserter did so because he feared prosecution.",
      "\u201cIt is clear that now, frankly speaking, we have already squeezed the maximum out of our people,\u201d said an officer with the 72nd Brigade, who noted that desertion was one of the main reasons Ukraine lost the town of Vuhledar in October.",
      "More than 100,000 soldiers have been charged under Ukraine\u2019s desertion laws since Russia invaded in February 2022, according to the country\u2019s General Prosecutor\u2019s Office.",
      "Nearly half have gone AWOL in the last year alone, after Kyiv launched an aggressive and controversial mobilization drive that government officials and military commanders concede has largely failed.",
      "It's a staggeringly high number by any measure, as there were an estimated 300,000 Ukrainian soldiers engaged in combat before the mobilization drive began. And the actual number of deserters may be much higher. One lawmaker with knowledge of military matters estimated it could be as high as 200,000.",
      "Many deserters don't return after being granted medical leave. Bone-tired by the constancy of war, they are psychologically and emotionally scarred. They feel guilt about being unable to summon the will to fight, anger over how the war effort is being led, and frustration that it seems unwinnable.",
      "\u201cBeing quiet about a huge problem only harms our country,\u201d said Serhii Hnezdilov, one of few soldiers to speak publicly about his choice to desert. He was charged shortly after the AP interviewed him in September.",
      "Another deserter said he initially left his infantry unit with permission because he needed surgery. By the time his leave was up, he couldn\u2019t bring himself to return.",
      "He still has nightmares about the comrades he saw get killed.",
      "\u201cThe best way to explain it is imagining you are sitting under incoming fire and from their (Russian) side, it\u2019s 50 shells coming toward you, while from our side, it\u2019s just one. Then you see how your friends are getting torn to pieces, and you realize that any second, it can happen to you,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cMeanwhile guys (Ukrainian soldiers) 10 kilometers (6 miles) away order you on the radio: \u2018Go on, brace yourselves. Everything will be fine,\u2019\u201d he said.",
      "Hnezdilov also left to seek medical help. Before undergoing surgery, he announced he was deserting. He said after five years of military service, he saw no hope of ever being demobilized, despite earlier promises by the country\u2019s leadership.",
      "\u201cIf there\u2019s no end term (to military service), it turns into a prison \u2013 it becomes psychologically hard to find reasons to defend this country,\u201d Hnezdilov said.",
      "Desertion has turned battle plans into sand that slips through military commanders' fingertips.",
      "The AP learned of cases in which defensive lines were severely compromised because entire units defied orders and abandoned their positions.",
      "\u201cBecause of a lack of political will and poor management of troops, especially in the infantry, we certainly are not moving in a direction to properly defend the territories that we control now,\u201d Hnezdilov said.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s military recorded a deficit of 4,000 troops on the front in September owing largely to deaths, injuries and desertions, according to a lawmaker. Most deserters were among recent recruits.",
      "The head of one brigade\u2019s legal service who is in charge of processing desertion cases and forwarding them to law enforcement said he's had many of them.",
      "\u201cThe main thing is that they leave combat positions during hostilities and their comrades die because of it. We had several situations when units fled, small or large. They exposed their flanks, and the enemy came to these flanks and killed their brothers in arms, because those who stood on the positions did not know that there was no one else around,\u201d the official said.",
      "That is how Vuhledar, a hilltop town that Ukraine defended for two years, was lost in a matter of weeks in October, said the 72nd Brigade officer, who was among the very last to withdraw.",
      "The 72nd was already stretched thin in the weeks before Vuhledar fell. Only one line battalion and two rifle battalions held the town near the end, and military leaders even began pulling units from them to support the flanks, the officer said. There should have been 120 men in each of the battalion\u2019s companies, but some companies' ranks dropped to only 10 due to deaths, injuries and desertions, he said. About 20% of the soldiers missing from those companies had gone AWOL.",
      "\u201cThe percentage has grown exponentially every month,\u201d he added.",
      "Reinforcements were sent once Russia wised up to Ukraine's weakened position and attacked. But then the reinforcements also left, the officer said. Because of this, when one of the 72nd Brigade battalions withdrew, its members were gunned down because they didn't know no one was covering them, he said.",
      "Still, the officer harbors no ill will toward deserters.",
      "\u201cAt this stage, I do not condemn any of the soldiers from my battalion and others. \u2026 Because everyone is just really tired,\u201d he said.",
      "Prosecutors and the military would rather not press charges against AWOL soldiers and do so only if they fail to persuade them to return, according to three military officers and a spokesperson for Ukraine\u2019s State Investigative Bureau. Some deserters return, only to leave again.",
      "Ukraine's General Staff said soldiers are given psychological support, but it didn't respond to emailed questions about the toll desertions are having on the battlefield.",
      "Once soldiers are charged, defending them is tricky, said two lawyers who take such cases. They focus on their clients' psychological state when they left.",
      "\u201cPeople cannot psychologically cope with the situation they are in, and they are not provided with psychological help,\u201d said attorney Tetyana Ivanova.",
      "Soldiers acquitted of desertion due to psychological reasons set a dangerous precedent because \u201cthen almost everyone is justified (to leave), because there are almost no healthy people left (in the infantry),\u201d she said.",
      "Soldiers considering deserting have sought her advice. Several were being sent to fight near Vuhledar.",
      "\u201cThey would not have taken the territory, they would not have conquered anything, but no one would have returned,\u201d she said."

      "The Egypt-born businessman moved to Britain in the 1960s and bought Harrods in the mid-1980s. Al Fayed sold Harrods in 2010 to a company owned by the state of Qatar through its sovereign wealth fund, the Qatar Investment Authority.",
      "The current managing director of Harrods, Michael Ward, has apologized to former employees who said they were sexually assaulted by Al Fayed. Ward said it is clear Al Fayed \u201cpresided over a toxic culture of secrecy, intimidation, fear of repercussion and sexual misconduct.\u201d"

      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum says she is confident that a tariff war with the United States can be averted",
      "MEXICO CITY -- Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Thursday she is confident that a tariff war with the United States can be averted.",
      "But her statement \u2014 the day after she held a phone call with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump \u2014 did not make clear who had offered what.",
      "\u201cThere will be no potential tariff war,\u201d Sheinbaum said flatly when asked about the issue at her daily morning news briefing.",
      "On Wednesday, Trump wrote that Sheinbaum had agreed to stop unauthorized migration across the border into the United States. She wrote on her social media accounts the same day that \u201cmigrants and caravans are taken care of before they reach the border.\u201d",
      "But whether that constituted a promise, a pledge or a simple statement of reality remains unclear. In recent years, migrants who have been unable to obtain permission to cross Mexico have joined together in caravans to walk or hitchhike north toward the U.S. border, seeking safety in numbers.",
      "In fact, apart from the first caravans in 2018 and 2019 \u2014 which were provided buses to ride part of the way north \u2014 no caravan has ever reached the border walking or hitchhiking in any cohesive way.",
      "For years, migrant caravans have often been blocked, harassed or prevented from hitching rides by Mexican police and migration agents. They have also frequently been rounded up or returned to areas near the Guatemalan border. So, Sheinbaum's statement appears to reflect a reality that has been true for some time.",
      "U.S. President Joe Biden on Thursday said he hoped Trump would rethink his plan to impose tariffs on Mexico and Canada, saying it could \u201cscrew up\u201d relationships with close allies.",
      "\u201cI hope he rethinks it. I think it\u2019s a counterproductive thing to do,\u201d he told reporters in Nantucket, Massachusetts.",
      "Trump had earlier threatened to impose 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada until those countries satisfactorily stop illegal immigration and the flow of illegal drugs such as fentanyl into the United States. He also said Chinese imports would face additional tariffs of 10% until Beijing cracks down on the production of materials used in making fentanyl.",
      "Despite Sheinbaum's confidence \u2014 she described the phone conversation with Trump as \u201cexcellent\" \u2014 many Mexicans worry that U.S. tariffs could affect a wide range of iconic Mexican products and threaten entire regional economies.",
      "In western Mexico, no crop supplies an income for so many small growers as avocados, and Mexico is the main supplier of the fruit for the U.S. market. But avocado growers, pickers and packers worry that U.S. consumers, faced with 25% higher prices, may just skip the guacamole.",
      "And earlier this week, Sheinbaum said Mexico was preparing a list of retaliatory tariffs if Trump went ahead with his plans for import duties.",
      "If Mexico, Canada and China faced the additional tariffs proposed by Trump on all goods imported to the United States, that could be roughly equal to $266 billion in tax collections, a number that does not assume any disruptions in trade or retaliatory moves by other countries.",
      "The cost of those taxes would likely be borne by U.S. families, importers and domestic and foreign companies in the form of higher prices or lower profits.",

    "story": [
      "It was an alarming, even sickening, suggestion: Farmers in Zimbabwe hit hard by drought should farm maggots to feed their animals and boost their household incomes",
      "NYANGAMBE, Zimbabwe -- At first, the suggestion to try farming maggots spooked Mari Choumumba and other farmers in Nyangambe, a region in southeastern Zimbabwe where drought wiped out the staple crop of corn.",
      "After multiple cholera outbreaks in the southern African nation resulting from extreme weather and poor sanitation, flies were largely seen as something to exterminate, not breed.",
      "\u201cWe were alarmed,\u201d Choumumba said, recalling a community meeting where experts from the government and the United States Agency for International Development, or USAID, broached the idea.",
      "People had flocked to the gathering in hope of news about food aid. But many stepped back when told it was about training on farming maggots for animal feed and garden manure.",
      "\u201cPeople were like, \u2018What? These are flies, flies bring cholera\u2019,\u201d Choumumba said.",
      "A year later, the 54-year-old walks with a smile to a smelly cement pit covered by wire mesh where she feeds rotting waste to maggots \u2014 her new meal ticket.",
      "After harvesting the insects about once a month, Choumumba turns them into protein-rich feed for her free-range chickens that she eats and sells.",
      "Up to 80% of chicken production costs were gobbled up by feed for rural farmers before they took up maggot farming. Many couldn\u2019t afford the $35 charged by stores for a 50-kilogram (about 110-pound) bag of poultry feed, said Francis Makura, a specialist with a USAID program aimed at broadening revenue streams for farmers affected by climate change.",
      "But maggot farming reduces production costs by about 40%, he said.",
      "The maggots are offspring of the black soldier fly, which originates in tropical South America. Unlike the house fly, it is not known to spread disease.",
      "Their life cycle lasts just weeks, and they lay between 500 and 900 eggs. The larvae devour decaying organic items \u2014 from rotting fruit and vegetables to kitchen scraps and animal manure \u2014 and turn them into a rich protein source for livestock.",
      "\u201cIt is even better than the crude protein we get from soya,\u201d said Robert Musundire, a professor specializing in agricultural science and entomology at Chinhoyi University of Technology in Zimbabwe, which breeds the insects and helps farmers with breeding skills.",
      "Donors and governments have pushed for more black soldier fly maggot farming in Africa because of its low labor and production costs and huge benefits to agriculture, the continent\u2019s mainstay that is under pressure from climate change and Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine.",
      "In Uganda, the maggots helped plug a fertilizer crisis caused by the war in Ukraine. In Nigeria and Kenya, they are becoming a commercial success.",
      "In Zimbabwe, the government and partners piloted it among farmers struggling with securing soya meal for their animals. A World Bank-led project later used it as a recovery effort for communities affected by a devastating 2019 cyclone.",
      "Now it is becoming a lifesaver for some communities in the country of 15 million people where repeated droughts make it difficult to grow corn. It's not clear how many people across the country are involved in maggot-farming projects.",
      "At first, \u201ca mere 5%\u201d of farmers that Musundire, the professor, approached agreed to venture into maggot farming. Now that\u2019s up to \u201cabout 50%,\u201d he said, after people understood the protein benefits and the lack of disease transmission.",
      "The \u201cyuck factor\u201d was an issue. But necessity triumphed, he said.",
      "With the drought decimating crops and big livestock such as cattle \u2014 a traditional symbol of wealth and status and a source of labor \u2014 small livestock like chickens are helping communities recover more quickly.",
      "\u201cThey can fairly raise a decent livelihood out of the resources they have within a short period of time,\u201d Musundire said.",
      "It also helps the environment. Zimbabwe produces about 1.6 million tons of waste annually, 90% of which can be recycled or composted, according to the country\u2019s Environmental Management Agency. Experts say feeding it to maggots can help reduce greenhouse emissions in a country where garbage collection is erratic.",
      "At a plot near the university, Musundire and his students run a maggot breeding center in the city of 100,000 people. The project collects over 35 metric tons a month in food waste from the university\u2019s canteens as well as vegetable markets, supermarkets, abattoirs, food processing companies and beer brewers.",
      "\u201cFood waste is living, it respires and it contributes to the generation of greenhouse gases,\u201d Musundire said.",
      "According to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization, food loss \u2014 which occurs in the stages before reaching the consumer \u2014 and food waste after sale account for 8% to 10% of greenhouse gas emissions globally, or about five times that of the aviation sector.",
      "The university project converts about 20-30 metric tons of the waste into livestock protein or garden manure in about two weeks.",
      "Choumambo said people often sneer as she goes around her own community collecting banana peels and other waste that people toss out at the market and bus station.",
      "\u201cI tell them we have good use for it, it is food for our maggots,\u201d she said. She still has to contend with \u201cignorant\u201d people who accuse maggot farmers of \u201cbreeding cholera.\u201d",
      "But she cares little about that as her farm begins to thrive.",
      "From bare survival, it is becoming a profitable venture. She can harvest up to 15 kilograms (about 33 pounds) of maggots in 21 days, turning out 375 kilograms (826.7 pounds) of chicken feed after mixing it with drought-tolerant crops such as millets, cowpeas and sunflower and a bit of salt.",
      "Choumambo sells some of the feed to fellow villagers at a fraction of the cost charged by stores for traditional animal feed. She also sells eggs and free-range chickens, a delicacy in Zimbabwe, to restaurants. She's one of 14 women in her village taking up the project.",
      "\u201cI never imagined keeping and surviving on maggots,\u201d she said, taking turns with a neighbor to mix rotting vegetables, corn meal and other waste in a tank using a shovel.",
      "\u201cMany people would puke at the sight and the stench. But this is the sweet smell of food for the maggots, and for us, the farmers.\u201d",

      "The case centered on a rule adopted in 2022 by state regulators that called for curbing the pollutants that chemically react in the presence of sunlight to create ground-level ozone, commonly known as smog. High ozone levels can cause respiratory problems, including asthma and chronic bronchitis.",
      "Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham's administration has long argued that the adoption of the ozone precursor rule along with regulations to limit methane emissions from the industry were necessary to combat climate change and meet federal clean air standards.",

      "NEW YORK -- It's show time.",
      "After weeks of pushing early deals, retailers in the United States and some other countries are promising bigger discounts on Black Friday, the sales event that still reigns as the unofficial kickoff of the holiday shopping season even if it's lost some luster.",
      "Department stores, shopping malls and merchants \u2014 big and small \u2014 see the day after Thanksgiving as a way to energize shoppers and to get them into physical stores at a time when many gift-seekers do the bulk of their browsing and buying online.",
      "Enough traditionalists must still be around, because Black Friday remains the biggest day of the year for retail foot traffic in the U.S., according to retail technology company Sensormatic Solutions.",
      "\u201cBlack Friday is still an incredibly important day for retailers,\u201d Grant Gustafson, head of retail consulting and analytics at Sensormatic, said. \u201cIt\u2019s important for them to be able to get shoppers into their store to show them that experience of what it\u2019s like to browse and touch and feel items. It also can be a bellwether for retailers on what to expect for the rest of the holiday season.\u201d",
      "In the U.S., analysts envision a solid holiday shopping season, though perhaps not as robust as last year\u2019s, with many shoppers under financial pressure and cautious with their discretionary spending despite the easing of inflation.",
      "Retailers will be even more under the gun to get shoppers in to buy early and in bulk since there are five fewer days between Thanksgiving and Christmas this year.",
      "Mall of America, in Bloomington, Minnesota, hopes to surpass the 12,000 shoppers who arrived last year within the first hour of the giant shopping center's 7 a.m. opening. This year, the mall is giving the first 200 people in line at the center's north entrance a $25 gift card.",
      "\u201cPeople come to get the deals, but more importantly, they come for the excitement, the energy, the traditions surrounding Black Friday,\u201d Jill Renslow, Mall of America's chief business development and marketing officer, said.",

      "Best Buy has introduced an extended-release version of the doorbuster, the limited-time daily discounts that for years were all the rage \u2014 and sometimes the spark for actual brawls. The nation\u2019s largest consumer electronics chain has released doorbuster deals every Friday since Nov. 8 and plans to continue the weekly promotion through Dec. 20.",
      "\u201c(Stores) are very hungry for Black Friday to do well,\u201d Marshal Cohen, chief retail advisor at market research firm Circana, said. \u201cThey recognize that they\u2019re not going to clobber and win big growth in online because the pie has gotten so competitive. They have to find a way to win in the stores.\u201d",
      "Impulse purchases and self-gifting are a potential area for big sales growth, and business isn't going to increase without them, Cohen said. Shoppers are three times more likely to buy on impulse at a physical store than online, according to Circana research.",
      "The National Retail Federation predicted that shoppers would increase their spending in November and December by between 2.5% and 3.5% over the same period a year ago. During the 2023 holiday shopping season, spending increased 3.9% over 2022.",
      "So far this holiday season, online sales have beaten expectations, according to Adobe Digital Insights, a division of software company Adobe. U.S. consumers spent \u202f$77.4 billion online from Nov. 1 to Nov. 24, 9.6%\u202f more than during the same period last year. Adobe predicted an 8.4% increase for the full season.",
      "Despite the early sales, better bargains are coming with Black Friday, according to Adobe. Analysts consider the five-day Black Friday weekend, which includes Cyber Monday, a key barometer of shoppers\u2019 willingness to spend for the rest of the season.",
      "Vivek Pandya, the lead analyst at Adobe Digital Insights, said shoppers are paying more attention to discounts than last year, and their focus on bargain-hunting will drive what sells and when.",
      "For example, Thanksgiving Day is the best time to shop online to get the deepest discount on sporting goods, toys, furniture and appliances, according to Adobe's analysis. But Black Friday is the best time to buy TVs online. People shopping for televisions earlier in the season found discounts that averaged 10.8%, while waiting until this Friday is expected to yield 24% discounts, Adobe Digital Insights said.",
      "Cyber Monday, however, is expected to be the best time to buy clothing and gadgets like phones and computers online. Electronics discounts peaked at 10.9% off the suggested manufacturer's price between Nov. 1 and Nov. 24 but are expected to hit 30% off on Cyber Monday, Adobe said.",
      "Across the board, Black Friday weekend discounts should peak at 30% on Cyber Monday and then go down to around 15%, according to Adobe\u2019s research.",

      "\u201cThere was a lot of anxiety during this election, and in times of anxiety you need to create psychological safety in people,\u201d said Ron Gutman, an adjunct professor of leadership at Stanford University and the co-founder and co-CEO of health technology company Intrivo. \u201cYou need to create trust in people, to bring back the trust in each other.\u201d",
      "Here are some tips from business leaders, psychologists and communication experts on how to navigate political conflicts in the workplace.",
      "To cultivate a more peaceful working environment, executives, managers and employees can practice humility. That means seeing ourselves as equal and not superior to our colleagues and subordinates, and recognizing that no one has all the right answers.",
      "When we listen to others thoughtfully and relinquish a reflexive belief in our own infallibility, it allows us to remain open to new ideas and perspectives, said Inclusivv CEO Jenn Graham, whose organization creates structured dialogues around social and political issues for corporate clients.",
      "\u201cWe can say something like, \u2018I haven\u2019t heard of that or thought of that before. Thank you for sharing,\u2019\u201d Graham said. \u201cAnd that simple act of \u2018thank you for sharing,\u2019 with gratitude and humility combined, creates a reciprocity for that brave space, for that psychological safety. And that\u2019s what we need to foster more than ever.\u201d",
      "To cultivate a humble mindset, think about why you might be wrong, and consider that the opposite of what you believe might be true, said Jake Telkamp, an assistant professor at Augusta University in Georgia. \u201cWe are really good at seeking out information that supports our beliefs, and then we scrutinize evidence that challenges our beliefs,\u201d he said.",
      "In some situations, a more guarded approach is warranted. If political talk feels like a personal attack, you may need to find allies who can help you process what you\u2019re hearing and feeling.",
      "For example, when a comedian opened a campaign rally for President-elect Donald Trump last month by referring to Puerto Rico as a \u201cfloating island of garbage,\u201d many people were deeply upset, said psychologist Alfiee Breland-Noble, founder of The AAKOMA Project, a nonprofit organization focused on empowering youth and young adults of color and people who face sexism and homophobia.",
      "The same was true after Black teenagers and adults received text messages this month telling them they were \u201cselected to pick cotton,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of sadness around, why isn\u2019t anybody publicly telling these people, 'You can\u2019t say these things about people who come from my community?\u2019\u201d Breland-Noble said.",
      "People feel like their lives are on the line, and are asking, \u201cWhere do I go with this struggle that I\u2019m having? Because people who look like me nationally, we all feel like we\u2019re under attack,\u201d she said.",
      "Breland-Noble encourages employees who feel marginalized by political discourse to identify colleagues to confide in, to check workplace policies for any rules on unacceptable speech and behavior, and to consider speaking with a trusted supervisor about what they\u2019re experiencing.",
      "\u201cThere is a lot that we can learn from how people have over time managed having a marginalized identity and being in the workplace because you have a plethora of people around you who are dealing with this stuff literally every day,\u201d Breland-Noble said.",
      "Also check your employer\u2019s social media policy. In many states, workers can be fired for posting political beliefs online, said Brad Kelley, a shareholder who represents employers at the law firm Littler.",
      "When attempting to resolve discord, one way to foster a peaceful resolution is to seek common ground.",
      "In the structured conversations she leads, Graham encourages participants to begin by listening to and acknowledging what the other person is saying. Repeat it back. Honor their emotions. Then you can share your perspective, and in the process you may find similarities, she said.",
      "\u201cWhen you\u2019re looking for common ground, you\u2019re ideally looking for a shared value,\" Graham said. It could be as simple as recognizing \u201cwe both have a need for and a desire for (fill in the) blank.\u201d",
      "Most people want a happier, healthier, more prosperous country, but the disagreement often lies in how to best get there, Telkamp said. Acknowledging shared goals can help de-escalate tension.",
      "\u201cPeople on the left and the right are disliking, distrusting, and generally they think people on the other side are unintelligent and immoral,\u201d Telkamp said. \u201cI\u2019m interested in how we can kind of get off the ledge a little bit and come back to a better understanding of each other.\u201d",
      "One way managers can try to bridge divides is to create rituals for employees to share what\u2019s important to them, Gutman said. This can help build a baseline of trust within an organization.",
      "Every Friday at Intrivo, the staff gathers for an hour and one person presents on a topic they\u2019re passionate about. It could be a hobby, an idea, a family experience or a skill. Political topics are fine as long as no one is putting anyone down, he said.",
      "\u201cIt can be super technical or super silly,\u201d Gutman said. The conversations build trust, and a sense of safety and community, he said.",
      "In circumstances where a discussion is getting heated, sometimes the best way to handle it is to remove ourselves from the conflict or to keep our views to ourselves.",
      "Leaders may want to consider abstaining from sharing their political views, which may alienate some workers, Telkamp said. \u201cThat\u2019s not about silencing your beliefs,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s more about keeping the workplace focused on the work.\u201d",

      "LOS ANGELES -- The owner of an oil field in Los Angeles County is suing the state of California over a law that will require it to stop production and plug its wells or face costly fines.",
      "Inglewood Oil Field owner Sentinel Peak argues in the lawsuit, filed this week, that the law, which was signed in September by Gov. Gavin Newsom, is unconstitutional, the Los Angeles Times reported Thursday.",
      "It is was one of several laws aiming to reduce pollution by giving local governments more authority to restrict oil and gas operations by shutting down so-called idle wells, which are not in use but have not been properly sealed and closed, and fining companies for operating low-producing oil wells in the Inglewood field.",
      "The 1,000-acre area southwest of downtown Los Angeles has approximately 820 unplugged wells, including 420 that are actively pumping. Roughly 80% of the operating wells are considered low-producing, meaning they yield less than 15 barrels of oil or 60,000 cubic feet of gas per day, the newspaper reported.",
      "Attorneys for Sentinel Peak argue that the law \u201crepresents an illegal attempt to coerce an individual company to stop operation of its legal business,\u201d according to court documents.

    "summary": "Many older Chinese are looking beyond traditional care homes, worried about abandonment and quality issues",
    "story": [
      "Many older Chinese are looking beyond traditional care homes, worried about abandonment and quality issues",
      "HONG KONG -- Every Wednesday, retiree Zhang Zhili travels an hour by bus to an education center, drawn by the pulsing rhythms of the African drum she plays there in a classroom filled with fellow retirees whose hands move in unison, every beat lifting her spirits.",
      "Zhang, 71, has found joy and new friends at the \u201celderly university\u201d in Beijing. Besides African drums, the former primary school teacher joins social dance classes, paying about 2,000 yuan ($280) for two courses this semester. Seeing herself standing tall in dance class boosts her confidence. After class, she hangs out with her friends.",
      "\u201cWhen we get old, what do we need?\" she said. \u201cTo love ourselves.\u201d",
      "Many older Chinese are looking beyond traditional nursing homes, afraid of abandonment by their families and quality issues. That's driving a boom in universities, home care services, and communities catering to older adults. Though some providers struggle to turn a profit, they persist because they see promise in the growing market.",
      "China has a rapidly aging population. Last year, about 297 million people were aged 60 or above, over one-fifth of the population. By 2035, this number is forecast to exceed 400 million, or over 30% of all Chinese.",
      "That's fueling growth in services and products aimed at older adults in what Beijing calls the silver economy, which is projected to balloon from about 7 trillion yuan (about $982 billion) currently to approximately 30 trillion yuan (about $4.2 trillion) in 2035, raising its share in the economy from about 6% to roughly 10%, Hu Zuquan, a researcher at the State Information Center, a public institution affiliated with China's main planning agency, told state media.",
      "Du Peng, dean of the school of population and health at Beijing's Renmin University, said the government is expanding basic care services to all older people who need them, moving beyond its traditional focus on those without family support. Last year, officials compiled a list of basic care services they aim to make available nationwide, including providing ability assessments for those over 65 and care training subsidies for family members of those who are disabled.",
      "Filial piety runs deep in China and most older people prefer aging at home with family after they retire, typically when they're 50 to 60 years old, one of the youngest retirement ages among the world\u2019s major economies. Many help care for their grandchildren, and for some, nursing homes are seen as a kind of abandonment, except in cases of serious disability.",
      "In January, Beijing issued new guidelines calling for expanding home care services and meal deliveries and more clothing, food and tech products tailored for older adults. They include enriching their lives through education.",
      "Home-based services offer a more affordable alternative to nursing homes, alleviating accommodation costs, Du said. Most older Chinese are relatively healthy, and these able people perhaps need richer cultural lives rather than disability care, he said.",
      "Cai Guixia, 60, said she has found fulfillment in African drumming and modeling classes. She thinks she would feel \u201cforsaken\u201d in a conventional nursing home, preferring to hire a domestic helper.",
      "Liu Xiuqin, an owner of two care homes, saw business opportunities in meeting those needs.",
      "She invested more than 800,000 yuan (about $112,000) to open a school in Beijing. Cai and Zhang are among its 150 students attending classes in dance, singing, yoga and modeling training for about 1,000 yuan ($140) per course each semester. Outside the classroom, her team organizes gatherings where students can socialize.",
      "Liu expects to break even in another year and is prepared for the wait. She believes in the market's future, given that the generation born in the 1960s and later values quality of life and health more than their parents did.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not about making quick money,\u201d she said. \u201cIt requires persistence.\u201d",
      "Turning a profit is proving challenging for some silver economy businesses.",
      "In the southern city of Guangzhou, Wu Tang co-founded a school last year after his geotechnical investigation and surveying business was hit by the downturn in China\u2019s property market. His school offers courses to help people achieve some of their childhood dreams, but he has yet to cover his costs. He also faces competition from cheaper government-run courses.",
      "And there's Cui Yang, who runs a care station in Beijing, sending helpers zigzagging across the district to provide 30 yuan ($4.20) haircuts at home; accompanying people on hospital visits for 50 yuan ($7) per hour and other services. Even with government subsidies including free rent, Cui is losing money. Without the subsidies, the business would fail, she said.",
      "The struggles aren\u2019t limited to small operators.",
      "Wu Wenjing heads the home care department of a healthcare subsidiary of state-owned financial conglomerate China Everbright Group in southwest China's Chongqing. It has been in the red for 13 straight years, spending 5 million yuan (about $702,000) annually and still losing 1 million (about $140,000) a year, she said.",
      "Wu's business employs 70 workers who visit homes as caregivers, rehabilitation therapists and psychotherapists. The industry is competitive and it has a high turnover rate given the difficulties of working alone in clients\u2019 homes. Wu hopes to break even in five years, and is delighted about the government's efforts to grow the silver economy.",
      "\"The spring of China\u2019s elderly care business has finally come,\u201d she said.",
      "Various companies are looking to grab a slice of this government-backed market. Property developers like Vanke Co. and Sino-Ocean Group and insurance companies such as Taikang Insurance Group have built high-end communities for older adults with amenities such as movie-screening and mahjong rooms and dining services.",
      "China's also working to tackle the problem of dementia, providing cognitive screening tests and training staff who work in memory clinics or as social workers. Several Chinese pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are working on drugs targeting Alzheimer\u2019s disease and other forms of dementia.",
      "Some vacant schools and kindergartens -- casualties of the country\u2019s declining birthrate -- are meanwhile being transformed into care facilities for older people.",
      "Government efforts to back the silver economy are paying off: official data showed the country had 410,000 care facilities by June, double the number in 2019.",
      "Still, questions remain about the spending power of many older Chinese.",
      "A 2021 national survey co-conducted by China's Civil Affairs Ministry found older adults had a median annual income of 11,400 yuan ($1,574). In rural areas it was less than half of that. More than one in 10 older Chinese are living in poverty, with living standards much lower in rural areas and western China, according to data from surveys conducted by Peking University.",
      "China's silver economy is still in its infancy, said Gary Ng, a senior economist at Natixis Corporate and Investment Banking.",
      "If they lack enough insurance to cover medical and other expenses, many older Chinese must set aside funds for such costs, limiting their spending capacity, he said, and it takes time to build industries producing senior-focused products and people trained to provide such services. Tax incentives and investments in training a skilled workforce would help, he said.",

      "After weeks of plugging increasingly inviting discounts, retailers in the United States and several other countries are preparing for prime time",
      "NEW YORK -- After weeks of plugging increasingly inviting discounts, retailers in the United States and several other countries are preparing for prime time: Black Friday, the bargain bonanza that still reigns as the unofficial kickoff of the holiday shopping season even if it's lost some luster.",
      "Department stores, shopping malls and merchants \u2014 big and small \u2014 see the day after Thanksgiving as a way to energize shoppers and to get them into physical stores at a time when many gift-seekers are content to do their browsing online. There are enough traditionalists that Black Friday remains the biggest day of the year for retail foot traffic.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m excited about it,\u201d Texas resident Emily Phillips said while visiting the Galleria Dallas last week. \u201cI save up all the things that I want all year and usually try and get them around Black Friday. I prefer to shop in person because then I can try stuff on. It\u2019s a better experience.\u201d",
      "In the U.S., analysts envision a solid holiday shopping season, though perhaps not as robust as last year\u2019s, with many shoppers under financial pressure and cautious with their discretionary spending despite the easing of inflation.",
      "Retailers will be even more under the gun to get shoppers in to buy early and in bulk since there are five fewer days between Thanksgiving and Christmas this year.",
      "Mall of America, in Bloomington, Minnesota, is giving the first 200 people in line at the center's north entrance a $25 gift card. Target is offering an exclusive book devoted to Taylor Swift's Eras Tour and a bonus edition of her \u201cThe Tortured Poets Department: The Anthology\u201d album that only will be available in stores on Black Friday before customers can buy them online starting Saturday.",
      "Best Buy has introduced an extended-release version of the doorbuster, the limited-time daily discounts that for years were all the rage \u2014 and sometimes the spark for actual brawls \u2014 before the coronavirus pandemic. The nation\u2019s largest consumer electronics chain has released doorbuster deals on its app, online and in stores every Friday since Nov. 8 and plans to continue the weekly promotion through Dec. 20.",
      "\u201c(Stores) are very hungry for Black Friday to do well,\u201d Marshal Cohen, chief retail advisor at market research firm Circana, said. \u201cThey recognize that they\u2019re not going to clobber and win big growth in online because the pie has gotten so competitive. They have to find a way to win in the stores.\u201d",
      "Impulse purchases and self-gifting are a potential area for big sales growth, and business isn't going to increase without them, Cohen said. Shoppers are three times more likely to buy on impulse at a physical store than online, according to Circana research.",
      "Shoppers stepped up their spending at American retailers in October, the Commerce Department said. Although sales at auto dealers drove much of the gain, electronics and appliance stores, and bars and restaurants also saw increased purchases, a sign of healthy consumer spending.",
      "The latest quarterly results from Best Buy, Target and other retailers, however, underscored that some will have an easier time than others getting customers to part with their cash.",
      "Walmart, the nation's largest retailer, is heading into the holidays with strong momentum after ratcheting up better-than-expected fiscal third-quarter sales for toys, home goods and groceries. But Target reported sluggish quarterly sales as cautious consumers curtailed their spending on apparel and other non-essential items.",
      "Many retailers pushed holiday sales earlier in October than they did last year to help shoppers spread out their spending.",
      "Shoppers were distracted heading into this month's U.S. presidential election. Sales of general merchandise dropped 9% the two weeks ended Nov. 9, according to Circana, but have been rebounding since the election.",
      "The National Retail Federation predicted that shoppers would increase their spending in November and December by between 2.5% and 3.5% over the same period a year ago. During the 2023 holiday shopping season, spending increased 3.9% over 2022.",
      "So far this holiday season, online sales have beaten expectations, according to Adobe Digital Insights, a division of software company Adobe. U.S. consumers spent \u202f$77.4 billion online from Nov. 1 to Nov. 24, 9.6%\u202f more than during the same period last year. Adobe predicted an 8.4% increase for the full season.",
      "Despite the early sales, better bargains are coming with Black Friday, according to Adobe. Analysts consider the five-day Black Friday weekend, which includes Cyber Monday, a key barometer of shoppers\u2019 willingness to spend for the rest of the season.",
      "Vivek Pandya, the lead analyst at Adobe Digital Insights, said shoppers are paying more attention to discounts than last year, and their focus on bargain-hunting will drive what sells and when.",
      "For example, Thanksgiving Day is the best time to shop online to get the deepest discount on sporting goods, toys, furniture and appliances, according to Adobe's analysis. But Black Friday is the best time to buy TVs online. People shopping for televisions earlier in the season found discounts that averaged 10.8%, while waiting until this Friday is expected to yield 24% discounts, Adobe Digital Insights said.",
      "Cyber Monday, however, is expected to be the best time to buy clothing and gadgets like phones and computers online. Electronics discounts peaked at 10.9% off the suggested manufacturer's price between Nov. 1 and Nov. 24 but are expected to hit 30% off on Cyber Monday, Adobe said.",
      "Across the board, Black Friday weekend discounts should peak at 30% on Cyber Monday and then go down to around 15%, according to Adobe\u2019s research.",
      "For physical stores, the day after Thanksgiving is slated to again mark the busiest single shopping day of the season, according to retail technology company Sensormatic Solutions, which tracks retail foot traffic.",
      "\u201cBlack Friday is still an incredibly important day for retailers,\u201d Grant Gustafson, head of retail consulting and analytics at Sensormatic, said. \u201cIt\u2019s important for them to be able to get shoppers into their store to show them that experience of what it\u2019s like to browse and touch and feel items. It also can be a bellwether for retailers on what to expect for the rest of the holiday season.\u201d",
      "Mall of America hopes to surpass the 12,000 shoppers it saw last year within the first hour of its 7 a.m. opening.",
      "\u201cPeople come to get the deals, but more importantly, they come for the excitement, the energy, the traditions surrounding Black Friday,\u201d Jill Renslow, the mall's chief business development and marketing officer, said.",

      "As the holiday season kicks off, the journey home could also mean that those who are more tech-savvy will be called on to provide a backlog of tech support to parents, grandparents and other family",
      "NEW YORK -- It's time for the holidays, which means robust family conversations and seemingly never-ending courses of food. But for the more tech-savvy among us, the journey home could also mean we'll be called on to provide a backlog of tech support to parents, grandparents and other family members.",
      "And with generative AI being used to supercharge some major cyber scams this year, it's also a good time to teach and not just fix.",
      "Here are some tips on how to manage your tech encounters this holiday season:",
      "Whether it's Windows, macOS, iOS or Android, simply keeping your operating system and apps up-to-date will help protect your family's computers and devices against a surprising number of security threats, such as malware, viruses and exploits.",
      "Most operating systems, especially those for mobile devices and their app stores, typically have auto-updates turned on by default. Be sure to double-check the device to make sure it has enough storage space to carry out the update. (More on this below.)",
      "Keeping apps updated may also reduce the number of \u201cWhy isn't this app working?\u201d type of questions from your relatives.",
      "Chances are someone in your family is going to have a completely full mobile device. So full, in fact, that they can no longer update their phone or tablet without having to purge something first.",
      "There are many approaches to freeing up space. Here are a few you can easily take without having to triage data or apps.",
      "\u2014 Use the cloud to back up media: iPhone users can free up space occupied by songs and pictures by storing them on iCloud. Android users can use the Google Photos app to back up and store their photos on their user space.",
      "\u2014 Clear browsing data: Each major browser has an option to clear its data cache \u2014 cookies, search and download histories, autofill forms, site settings, sign-in data and so on. Over time, these bits take up a significant amount of storage space on mobile devices and home computers. So cleaning caches out periodically helps free up space and, in some cases, improves system performance.",
      "According to some admittedly unscientific studies, the average person has hundreds of passwords. That\u2019s a lot to remember. So as you help your relatives reset some of theirs, you may be tempted to recycle some to keep things simple for them. But that's one of the bad password habits that cybersecurity experts warn against.",
      "Instead, try introducing your forgetful family member to a password manager. They're useful tools for simplifying and keeping track of logins. And if you want to impress a more tech-savvy cousin or auntie, you could suggest switching to a more secure digital authentication method: passkeys.",
      "As scammers find new ways to steal money and personal information, you and your family should be more vigilant about who to trust. Artificial intelligence and other technologies are giving bad actors craftier tools to work with online.",
      "A quick way to remember what to do when you think you\u2019re getting scammed is to think about the three S\u2019s, said Alissa Abdullah, also known as Dr. Jay, Mastercard\u2019s deputy chief security officer",
      "\u201cStay suspicious, stop for a second (and think about it) and stay protected,\u201d she said.",
      "Simply being aware of typical scams can help, experts say. Robocalls frequently target vulnerable individuals like seniors, people with disabilities, and people with debt. So-called romance scams target lonely and isolated individuals. Quiz scams target those who spend a lot of time on social media.",
      "Check our AP guide on the latest scams and what to do when you're victimized.",
      "Home internet speeds are getting faster, so you want to make sure your family members are getting a high-speed connection if they've paid for one. Run a broadband speed test on your home network if they\u2019re still rocking an aging modem and router."

      "Vaping is coming before the Supreme Court next week as federal regulators ask the high court to uphold its block on sweet, flavored products following a spike in youth e-cigarette use",
      "WASHINGTON -- Vaping is coming before the Supreme Court next week as federal regulators ask the high court to uphold its block on sweet, flavored products following a spike in youth e-cigarette use.",
      "The Food and Drug Administration has denied more than a million marketing applications for candy- or fruit-flavored products that appeal to kids, part of a wider crackdown that advocates say helped drive down teen vaping after an \u201cepidemic level\u201d surge in 2019.",
      "Vaping companies, though, said the agency unfairly disregarded arguments that their sweet e-liquid products would help adults quit smoking traditional cigarettes without putting kids at greater risk.",

      "The Supreme Court on Monday is hearing arguments in the FDA\u2019s appeal of a decision from the conservative 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. While other courts upheld FDA refusals, the appeals court sided with the Dallas-based company Triton Distribution.",
      "It tossed out a decision blocking the marketing of nicotine-laced liquids like \u201cJimmy The Juice Man in Peachy Strawberry\" that are heated by an e-cigarette to create an inhalable aerosol.",
      "Triton said the FDA had unfairly changed its requirements without enough warning.",
      "\u201cIt sort of pulls the chair out from the applicants,\u201d said Marc Scheineson, a former FDA associate commissioner and attorney who now represents other small electronic tobacco companies.",
      "The FDA was slow to regulate the now multibillion-dollar vaping market, and even years into the crackdown flavored vapes that are technically illegal nevertheless remain widely available. The agency has approved some tobacco-flavored vapes, and recently allowed its first menthol-flavored electronic cigarettes for adult smokers.",
      "The marketing refusals combined with age-limit enforcement on the federal and state levels have helped drive down youth nicotine use to its lowest level in a decade, said Dennis Henigan, vice president for legal and regulatory affairs at the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids.",
      "He says the FDA was clear in its requirements and fears a court decision that leads to wider availability for flavored vape products, which are the dominant choice among the 1.6 million high school students who still vape. \u201cWe think that would be a real harm to public health,\u201d Henigan said."

      "In western Mexico, no crop supplies an income for so many small growers as avocados. But avocado growers, pickers and packers worry that U.S. consumers, faced with 25% higher prices, may just skip the guacamole.",
      "\u201cI think that when there is an increase in the price for any product, demand declines,\u201d said avocado grower Enrique Espinoza. Orchards like his are the economic lifeblood in the western Mexico state of Michoacan. \u201cIt would be a tragedy if they closed down (the border) on us,\u201d he said.",
      "Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration \u2014 when he said he would impose tariffs \u2014 couldn't come at a worse time: It's around when Mexico starts shipping crates of the green fruit north for Super Bowl Sunday, the annual peak of consumption.",

      "\u201cWork for us could decrease because it won't be quite so attractive to export,\" Arroyo said, \u201cbecause avocados would get expensive, and avocados are already expensive.\u201d",
      "It may not just be Mexican producers who are affected; U.S. consumers may also be howling.",
      "Mexican business leader Gina Diez Barroso told a news conference Tuesday that one U.S. agriculture official told her he had never had as many complaints as when the U.S. government halted import inspections on Mexican avocados in 2022.",

      "Rather, the reverse effect has him worried; if Mexico retaliates with its own tariffs, as President Claudia Sheinbaum has suggested, Mexicans will face not just a drop in income, but high prices for U.S. products like corn, which is a main supply of feed for animals in Mexico.",
      "\u201cThere are more poor people here, so in some ways it is going to hit us,\u201d Espinoza said. \u201cThe United States can pay 25% more for Mexican products, very few of us have enough money to pay 25% more for what we import from the United States.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s not just the guacamole; Mexican tequila producers have seen a bonanza in the U.S. market. In 2023, the U.S. imported $4.6 billion worth of tequila and $108 million worth of mezcal from Mexico.",
      "That has raised cautious concern among tequila producers, including farmers who grow agave on some of the driest, marginal soils that couldn\u2019t support many other crops.",
      "\u201cWe are analyzing the statements by the authorities and their reactions, and in the coming days we will establish a position,\u201d the National Tequila Industry Chamber said in a statement.",
      "And industry representatives say a drop in the consumption of tequila \u2014 America\u2019s third-most popular spirit, behind vodka and pre-mixed cocktails \u2014 could affect U.S. bars, restaurants and clubs.",
      "\u201cAt the end of the day, tariffs on spirits products from our neighbors to the north and south are going to hurt U.S. consumers and lead to job losses across the U.S. hospitality industry just as these businesses continue their long recovery from the pandemic,\u201d the Distilled Spirits Council of the U.S. said in a statement.",
      "The tariffs would probably plunge Mexico into an immediate recession. Mexican financial group Banco Base estimated in a report that for every 1% that Mexican exports increase in price, their volume falls by 1.33%",
      "Supposing that Americans might absorb half the impact of the tariffs and just pay higher prices for Mexican goods, they still might reduce their consumption by 12%, Banco Base estimated.",
      "\u201cThis would be reflected in a 4.4% drop in gross domestic product,\u201d the bank wrote, adding \u201cthe decline would not just occur in 2025, but would get more serious the longer the tariffs last.\u201d",

      "Mexico\u2019s Economy Secretary, Marcelo Ebrard, said Wednesday that 88% percent of all North American pickup trucks come from Mexico, though it was unclear if he meant just parts of the trucks or their final assembly.",

      "President-elect Donald Trump is declaring a win on stopping illegal immigration through Mexico after talking with that country\u2019s leader",
      "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- President-elect Donald Trump declared a win on stopping illegal immigration through Mexico on Wednesday after talking with that country\u2019s leader. But Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum suggested Mexico was already doing its part and had no interest in closing its borders.",
      "The two spoke just days after Trump threatened to impose sweeping new tariffs on Canada and Mexico as part of his effort to crack down on illegal immigration and drugs.",
      "Trump said Sheinbaum \u201cagreed to stop Migration through Mexico.\" Sheinbaum indicated separately on social media that she told Trump that Mexico is already \u201ctaking care of\u201d migrant caravans, calling it an \u201cexcellent conversation.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe reiterate that Mexico\u2019s position is not to close borders but to build bridges between governments and between peoples,\u201d Sheinbaum added.",
      "While the state of the proposed tariffs remained unclear, Trump said in a post on his Truth Social account that this was \u201ceffectively closing our Southern Border.\u201d He called it a \u201cvery productive conversation.\u201d",
      "The exchange between the two leaders appeared to confirm for Trump the value of threatening to disrupt trade with import taxes. His initial social media post moved financial markets and gave him a response he was quick to describe as a win. Even if the proposed tariffs fail to materialize, Trump can tell supporters that the mere possibility of them is an effective policy tool and continue to rely on tariff threats.",
      "Sheinbaum wrote on social media that the leaders \u201cdiscussed Mexico\u2019s strategy on migration issues, and I told him the caravans are not reaching the northern (U.S.) border, because Mexico is taking care of them.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe also talked about reinforcing cooperation on security issues, within the framework of our sovereignty, and the campaign we are carrying out to prevent fentanyl consumption,\" she said.",
      "Illegal migration across the Mexico border is down in part because the Biden administration secured some stepped-up cooperation from Mexico \u2014 the sort Trump seems to be celebrating.",
      "Arrivals at the U.S.-Mexico border have dropped 40% from an all-time high in December. U.S. officials mostly credit Mexican vigilance around rail yards and highway checkpoints.",
      "Driven by mounting pressure from the U.S. to block migrants going north, in the past few years Mexican authorities have turned to rounding them up across the country and sending them to southern Mexico, in a strategy seen by experts as an attempt to wear migrants out until they give up.",
      "Neither side clarified the status of the tariffs. But their implementation could fuel higher prices and slow economic growth, potentially blowing up the trade agreement among the U.S., Canada and Mexico that was finalized in 2020 during Trump's previous time in the White House.",
      "Trump on Monday said he would impose a 25% tax on all products entering the country from Canada and Mexico as one of his first executive orders upon taking office on Jan. 20. He also proposed an additional 10% tariff on China tied to its exporting of materials used in the production of fentanyl.",
      "In announcing his plans, he railed against the flow of fentanyl and migrants crossing into the U.S. illegally, even though southern border apprehensions have been hovering near four-year lows.",
      "On Wednesday, Trump also posted that he plans a large scale ad campaign to explain \u201chow bad Fentanyl is for people to use,\u201d predicting it would educate people on \u201chow really bad the horror of this Drug is.\u201d",
      "The dangerously powerful opioid was developed to treat intense pain from ailments like cancer but has increasingly been mixed with other drugs in the illicit drug supply.",

      "ON BOARD THE SANTA TRAIN -- Since 1943, the people of Appalachian Kentucky, Virginia, and Tennessee have looked forward to Santa's arrival. Not in a sleigh on their rooftops, but on a train.",
      "The Santa Train marks its 82nd running this year, bringing presents and joy to small towns along a 110-mile portion of the CSX rail line tucked into remote coal-country river valleys. Many of the children who line the tracks and wait for Santa on the Saturday before Thanksgiving are the third, fourth or fifth generation to do so.",
      "\u201cI look for it every year. I count the days down,\u201d said Sandra Owens, of Haysi, Virginia, who held a pink pillowcase with a message in black ink, \u201cThank you CSX and volunteers for the Santa Train. 82.\u201d",
      "Owens moved to Kentucky from Delaware 55 years ago when she got married and experienced her first Santa Train a few years later, when her son turned 3. He is 46 now, and these days she brings her grandchildren. In a few more years, she hopes to bring great-grandchildren.",
      "\u201cThe faces of the kids, that\u2019s what makes me happy,\u201d she said. \"You can\u2019t see anything better.\u201d",
      "The train starts out in Shelbiana, Kentucky, where families wait in the pre-dawn. At each stop there are dozens to hundreds of people. Many crowd around the back of the train, where Santa and his helpers toss stuffed animals. Meanwhile, groups of volunteer \u201celves\u201d carrying bags full of gifts fan out, making sure every child goes home with something. Each year they hand out more than 15 tons of gifts that include hats, mittens and fuzzy blankets along with board games, skate boards and teddy bears.",
      "Donna Doughetry from Snowflake, Virginia, remembers coming to see the Santa Train as a child in nearby Fort Blackmore.",
      "\u201cYears back, we didn't get a lot,\u201d she said. \u201cSo back then this was kind of what we got, and we were proud of it. It meant a lot to us.\u201d",
      "Over the years, her kids have at times received handmade gifts from the Santa Train, like crocheted hats, which they still have and cherish.",
      "Even though it is easier for people in these isolated, rural communities to buy Christmas presents these days, Dougherty made the short trek to Fort Blackmore with her niece on Saturday, carrying on the family tradition that she is glad she can still share.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really nice that they do this,\u201d she said. \u201cIt shows the true Christmas spirit.\u201d",
      "CSX employees consider it an honor to be chosen to staff the Santa Train as volunteers. Jesse Hensley had been trying to get a spot for 35 years, ever since he met his wife, Angie, who grew up with the Santa Train in St. Paul, Virginia.",
      "\u201cIt was such a thrill when we heard that whistle blow,\u201d she remembered. \u201cWhen I was a little girl, you know, you have dreams. My dream was to ride that train. Never in my life did I ever think that I would get to.\u201d",
      "The pair was selected to ride the train this year because they volunteered countless hours after the flooding caused by Hurricane Helene devastated their community of Erwin, Tennessee, where Jesse Hensley works as a machinist mechanic for CSX.",
      "The Santa Train doesn't run to Erwin, but CSX added a special event this year to bring cheer to the community. Residents were invited to a holiday party with food, music, and gifts in the Erwin rail yard. Santa paid a visit on train with cars decked out in lights forming the shapes of ornaments, moving jingle bells, marching toy soldiers, and the words \u201cHoliday Express\u201d in giant red letters.",
      "Two days later, Angie Hensley was all smiles on the Santa Train and nearly as excited as the children she helped distribute toys to, including grandnieces and grandnephews in St. Paul. The joy of helping on the Santa Train was even better than she had imagined, she said.",
      "Her fellow volunteers included CSX President and CEO Joe Hinrichs, who got off at every stop, handing out toys and talking to those who had come to see the train. Hinrichs' best memory so far was at a stop a couple of years ago when a family brought a disabled child but were hanging back from the train to avoid the tussle of the crowd. Helpers cleared a path to bring the boy forward and gave him a giant teddy bear they had saved for a special occasion.",
      "\u201cWe brought it out there, and everybody got around it, and we gave it to him. And there wasn\u2019t a dry eye anywhere,\u201d Hinrichs said. \"It was a magical moment.\u201d"

      "Canada\u2019s antitrust watchdog is suing Google over alleged anticompetitive conduct in the tech giant\u2019s online advertising business and wants the company to sell off two of its services and pay a penalty",
      "TORONTO -- Canada's antitrust watchdog said Thursday it is suing Google over alleged anticompetitive conduct in the tech giant\u2019s online advertising business and wants the company to sell off two of its ad tech services and pay a penalty.",
      "The Competition Bureau said that such action is necessary because an investigation into Google found that the company \u201cunlawfully\u201d tied together its ad tech tools to maintain its dominant market position.",
      "The matter is now headed for the Competition Tribunal, a quasi-judicial body that hears cases brought forward by the competition commissioner about non-compliance with the Competition Act.",
      "The bureau is asking the tribunal to order Google to sell its publisher ad server, DoubleClick for Publishers, and its ad exchange, AdX. It estimates Google holds a market share of 90% in publisher ad servers, 70% in advertiser networks, 60% in demand-side platforms and 50% in ad exchanges.",
      "This dominance, the bureau said, has discouraged competition from rivals, inhibited innovation, inflated advertising costs and reduced publisher revenues.",
      "\u201cGoogle has abused its dominant position in online advertising in Canada by engaging in conduct that locks market participants into using its own ad tech tools, excluding competitors, and distorting the competitive process,\" Matthew Boswell, Commissioner of Competition, said in a statement.",
      "Google, however, maintains the online advertising market is a highly competitive sector.",
      "Dan Taylor, Google\u2019s vice president of global ads, said in a statement that the bureau\u2019s complaint \u201cignores the intense competition where ad buyers and sellers have plenty of choice.\u201d",
      "The statement added that Google intends to defend itself against the allegation.",
      "U.S. regulators want a federal judge to break up Google to prevent the company from continuing to squash competition through its dominant search engine after a court found it had maintained an abusive monopoly over the past decade.",
      "The proposed breakup, floated in a 23-page document filed this month by the U.S. Department of Justice, calls for sweeping punishments that would include a sale of Google\u2019s industry-leading Chrome web browser and impose restrictions to prevent Android from favoring its own search engine.",

    "story": [
      "A Vermont family who lost their home, cars, barn and most of their possessions in flooding in July will be getting a new start thanks to scores of donations to an online fundraising effort",
      "PEACHAM, Vt. -- The last thing John and Jenny Mackenzie saw as they fled their Vermont home with their daughters, dog and two guinea pigs last summer was their cars upended and propelled away by rushing flood waters.",
      "Minutes earlier they had abandoned their 19th-century wood-frame house as the remnants of Hurricane Beryl turned it into an island engulfed by surging flood waters, with trees slamming into it and water gushing at colossal speed into the basement and first floor.",
      "\u201cIt was just like it was a horror movie at that point,\u201d John Mackenzie said of the surreal scene on that July 10 night.",
      "\u201cWe lost both of our vehicles, our home and our barn and at least half of our possessions,\u201d Jenny Mackenzie said.",
      "Since that terrifying storm when two people died swept away in vehicles, the Mackenzies, both teachers, and their twin daughters have been living temporarily in a friend's house. They have scrambled to figure out something permanent, a daunting task in a state with a housing shortage and when government programs to buy out flood-destroyed homes can take a year or more and are not guaranteed.",
      "But four months after the devastating loss, the family is writing a new chapter.",
      "Donations from friends, family and others in their community have helped the Mackenzies find a new house in time for Thanksgiving, giving them hope amid ongoing challenges. The Associated Press is following them through their recovery.",
      "The Mackenzies quickly learned how much support they had.",
      "Two days after the storm, dozens of volunteers showed up to help salvage what they could. Floodwaters had reduced the lawn to a muddy chasm; their septic system was destroyed.",
      "In the rain, volunteers carried furniture and other belongings across a gulch to waiting all-terrain vehicles, which drove them on dirt roads to the village where the family is staying.",
      "Friends set up an online fundraising page that has raised over $160,000. Over 950 donations have come in, some from former students, ranging from $5 to $10,000.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable the way that we were supported and we\u2019ve been trying to find ways to communicate that gratitude,\u201d said John Mackenzie, 49.",
      "The donations allowed them to buy used vehicles, keep teaching and carry on with life, his 50-year-old wife said. As much as the money, it means a lot that people were thinking about them, she said.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make them whole, all of the damage that they experienced, but yes that\u2019s an amazing amount and I think it speaks to the community that\u2019s around them and how well loved they are,\u201d said Cara Robechek, who helped start the fundraising effort.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re both teachers. They are sort of deeply embedded in a lot of communities.\u201d",
      "The Mackenzies owned their two-story house, built in 1840 with clapboard siding painted sage green, for 21 years. They raised their 16-year-old daughters, Lila and Kate, there.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re already aware that for us losing the home after 21 years is huge but this is the only home they ever knew,\u201d John Mackenzie said of their girls. \u201cWe want to recreate a new home.\u201d",
      "The Mackenzies applied for a buyout and wanted to stay in Peacham, but housing costs in the town of 700 have soared and are out of reach, they said.",
      "As of this fall, about 250 households have applied for buyouts, most both federally and state funded, from the severe flooding in early July and later that month that hit parts of central and northern Vermont, according to the state.",
      "Once a buyout application is complete, it can sit in review with the Federal Emergency Management Agency for up to a year, said Stephanie Smith, the state hazard mitigation officer with Vermont Emergency Management.",
      "The Mackenzies got another setback last week when they learned their property may not be eligible for a FEMA buyout, although Smith said Monday the state is working to make it eligible. The Mackenzies have to provide more detailed information, including receipts from repair work done after a previous flood. But they lost much of that paperwork in this summer's storm, Jenny Mackenzie said.",
      "If FEMA funding falls through, Smith said the state will review the Mackenzies' case for a state buyout program early next year.",
      "\u201cThe reality is that we won\u2019t be able to afford to stay in this house that we\u2019ve bought unless that buyout goes through,\u201d Jenny Mackenzie said.",
      "The flooding came exactly a year after catastrophic floods hit areas of rural, mountainous Vermont, including the capital, Montpelier. Some northern communities were pummeled twice by the severe flash flooding this July.",
      "Experts say Vermont could see more frequent catastrophic events like these, with climate change fueling stronger storms and striking Vermont villages situated along the Green Mountains' rivers and streams.",
      "Unable to find an affordable house in Peacham, the Mackenzies made the difficult decision to look elsewhere. In late September, they put down an offer on a house in Craftsbury, about 30 miles away. The commute to St. Johnsbury Academy where they both teach English and their daughters go to school is about 50 minutes compared to the 20 minutes they used to drive. They plan to move in mid-winter.",
      "The white clapboard farmhouse with a red door \u2014 also built in 1840 \u2014 reminds them of their Peacham home.",
      "After the sale closed, Jenny Mackenzie bought a trowel \u2014 \u201cI didn't have one anymore,\u201d she said \u2014 and planted about 100 daffodils that a friend rescued from the family's flooded house. Another friend gave her more. Jenny Mackenzie usually plants 500 a year.",
      "\u201cIt felt good to get in a few because that will really make us feel like home,\" she said as their German shorthaired pointer, Hester, ran around her new grounds.",
      "A friend is reupholstering their flood-damaged rocking chairs and couch. The family's antique piano, built in 1895, could not be saved; it's the only thing remaining at the old house.",
      "The Mackenzies would not be where they are without the financial and other support of friends and family.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no way we could have done that prior to a buyout,\" Jenny Mackenzie said of paying off the mortgage on the old house, as well as a government loan from previous flood damage, and then buying a new house. \u201cEven now it\u2019s financially precarious.\u201d",
      "The family has learned through this experience to open themselves up to everything \u2014 to suggestions about where they might relocate, to kindness, to community, John Mackenzie said.",
      "There were moments, initially, when it was hard to accept that kind of generosity and the loss of some privacy around money, he said. But it\u2019s helped to know he would donate if there were another family in need, and he and his wife are incredibly grateful.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s kind of completely broke us open,\u201d he said."

    "summary": "A handful of Massachusetts lawmakers are hoping to persuade their colleagues to support a proposal that would make the state the first to adopt a ban meant to eliminate the use of tobacco products over time",
    "story": [
      "A handful of Massachusetts lawmakers are hoping to persuade their colleagues to support a proposal that would make the state the first to adopt a ban meant to eliminate the use of tobacco products over time",
      "BOSTON -- A handful of Massachusetts lawmakers are hoping to persuade their colleagues to support a proposal that would make the state the first to adopt a ban meant to eliminate the use of tobacco products over time.",
      "Other locations have weighed similar \u201cgenerational tobacco bans,\u201d which phase out the use of tobacco products based not just on a person's age but on birth year.",
      "Under a Massachusetts law signed in 2018, the age to buy any tobacco product \u2014 including cigarettes, cigars and e-cigarettes \u2014 was raised to 21. Massachusetts also has banned the sale of all flavored tobacco products in an effort to reduce youth interest in nicotine.",
      "The new proposal, which lawmakers plan to file next year, would expand the effort to curb smoking by gradually ending all sales of nicotine and tobacco products. If the bill is approved, young people not old enough to legally purchase nicotine and tobacco would never be lawfully able to purchase them in Massachusetts, thereby creating no more new users.",
      "It would not apply to marijuana, and the cutoff date would be adjusted when passed to ensure everyone age 21 and above at that time would not be affected.",
      "Brookline, a town of about 63,000 neighboring Boston, was the first municipality in the country to adopt such a ban in 2020. Instead of raising the age for purchasing cigarettes, the bylaw blocks the sale of tobacco to anyone born on or after Jan. 1, 2000. The rule went into effect in 2021.",
      "That would mean at some point in the future no one would be allowed to buy any tobacco products in the town. The measure was challenged, but the state's highest court weighed in earlier this year, upholding the ban.",
      "Other Massachusetts cities and towns already have approved similar tobacco bans, including Malden, Melrose, Reading, Stoneham, Wakefield, and Winchester.",
      "Democratic state Sen. Jason Lewis, one of the backers of the statewide proposal, said the bill would \"save countless lives and create a healthier world for the next generation.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe all know the devastating health effects of nicotine and tobacco products, especially on our youth,\" he said.",
      "Nicotine and tobacco products are addictive and can increase the risk of lung cancer, heart disease, stroke and other illnesses.",
      "Nearly 9 out of 10 adults who smoke cigarettes daily first tried smoking by age 18, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which also found that in 2024 about 2 in 5 students who had ever used a tobacco product currently used them.",
      "Peter Brennan, executive director of the New England Convenience Store and Energy Marketers Association, said the proposal would undercut small mom and pop shops that rely on cigarettes for a significant portion of their sales.",
      "It also would put stores located near neighboring states that allow the sale of cigarettes to all adults at a competitive disadvantage.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a terrible idea,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re really just taking away adults\u2019 right to purchase a legal, age-restricted product.\u201d",
      "Taking certain rights away from some adults and not others is likely unconstitutional, he said, adding that other prohibition efforts haven\u2019t worked, like past bans on alcohol, marijuana and gambling.",
      "It's unclear how much support the proposal has in the Legislature.",
      "Massachusetts has taken other steps in recent decades to curb smoking, including raising taxes on cigarettes. Those taxes would presumably be reduced and ultimately eliminated by an incremental statewide smoking ban.",
      "Any reduction in cigarette tax revenue would be more than offset by reduced healthcare costs and other savings, Lewis said.",
      "In 2022, 10.4% of adults in Massachusetts reported smoking cigarettes, according to the state Department of Public Health.",
      "Some California lawmakers have pushed to ban all tobacco sales, filing legislation last year to make it illegal to sell cigarettes and other products to anyone born after Jan. 1, 2007.",
      "In 2022, New Zealand became the first nation to pass a law intended to impose a lifetime ban on young people buying cigarettes by mandating that tobacco can\u2019t ever be sold to anybody born on or after Jan. 1, 2009. The law was later axed.",
      "In the U.K., Prime Minister Rishi Sunak proposed raising the legal age that people in England can buy cigarettes by one year, every year until it is eventually illegal for the whole population. The proposal failed to win approval earlier this year."

      "Workers at one of Ukraine's thermal power plants struggle to repair damage and keep electricity flowing as Russia continues its campaign of attacks targeting the country's power grid",
      "On a bright winter day, workers at a Ukrainian thermal power plant repair its heavily damaged equipment as drops of water from melted snow leak through gaping holes in its battered roof.",
      "Several weeks earlier, the facility was targeted by a Russian air attack that left scorch marks, shrapnel scars on the walls, and missile fragments scattered across the production floor.",
      "\u201cThis is our life now. Workers at a thermal power plant that\u2019s supposed to produce electricity are walking on frozen floors and using firewood to keep warm,\u201d Oleksandr, 52, head of the Production Management Department, told The Associated Press. He spoke on condition that only his first name be used citing security concerns.",
      "Repeated Russian strikes on infrastructure have seriously impacted Ukraine's energy sector often resulting in rolling blackouts across the country. On Thursday, Moscow launched another large-scale air attack. Ukrainian authorities said nearly 200 drones and missiles targeted infrastructure, d isrupting power supply to more than a million people.",
      "The scale of the ongoing work to fix the sector is huge. Since the start of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion in 2022, th e G7 and other allied countries have allocated more than $4 billion in energy assistance to Ukraine, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in September.",
      "Oleksandr, who works at the power plant operated by Ukraine\u2019s largest private energy company, DTEK, says since the station was first attacked in November 2022, it has been unable to return to full capacity due to continuous strikes that have left critical equipment in ruins. The exact location of the plant visited by the AP, details on the damage and even workers\u2019 last names cannot be disclosed for fear this information could help Russia coordinate future attacks.",
      "DTEK operated around 20% of Ukraine\u2019s electricity production before the full-scale invasion, but this figure dropped to 12% since the war broke out. The company says its facilities have been attacked by Russia almost 200 times since 2022. They also say nearly 90% of the company\u2019s infrastructure was destroyed or suffered damage and that was before Russia launched its large-scale attack on Nov 17.",
      "Oleksandr says he expects repairs at the station to continue through the winter into next year, and potentially far beyond. Repair efforts at the plant are further complicated by the fact that some critical equipment was manufactured in the Soviet Union and finding parts is now difficult. To mitigate this, some former Soviet countries who are now Ukraine\u2019s allies have helped supply equipment.",
      "\u201cPotentially, Western countries could also help us with equipment, but their power grids have different characteristics,\u201d Oleksandr said.",
      "Only half of DTEK\u2019s generating capacities have been restored since the first attacks on its plants in November 2022 until the latest large-scale strike. Earlier this week, the European Commission and the U.S. government a nnounced a donation of $112 million in equipment and construction materials to help DTEK prepare for the winter.",
      "With the war in its third year, staff at DTEK\u2019s plant have adapted to the grim reality of their day-to-day existence. They know the protocols by heart. Not everyone can take shelter during an air alert. A minimal crew must remain in the control room to oversee operations, putting themselves at risk of a direct strike.",
      "\u201cYou have to sit and wait while monitoring the trajectories of whatever was fired, but the power units keep working so we cannot just leave, we stay in the control room,\u201d said Dmytro, 41, a power unit operator at the plant.",
      "Despite the challenges, Dmytro and his colleagues press on, driven by a mission to keep the lights on in their town and region over the winter months.",
      "\u201cWho\u2019ll do it, if not us? I also have family waiting for me at home, but if we all leave and the equipment breaks down, the responsibility will be on our shoulders, the entire city will lose electricity and heating,\u201d he said.",

      "Following a policy meeting, the Bank of Korea cut its benchmark interest rate by a quarter percentage point to 3%. The bank lowered its outlook for the country\u2019s economic growth to 2.2% from 2.4% for this year and to 1.9% from 2.1% for 2025.",
      "The bank is taking steps to lower borrowing costs despite the lingering effects of high inflation and alarming levels of household debt, as the economy falters.",
      "The bank cut its policy rate by a quarter percentage point to 3.25% in October in its first rate cut since May 2020 in the depths of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "The bank said the country\u2019s trade-dependent economy faces growing uncertainty in global economic trends and inflation that could be impacted by the policies of President-elect Donald Trump and ongoing geopolitical conflicts.",
      "Since winning reelection, Trump has vowed to slap huge new tariffs on foreign products entering the United States, including those from Mexico, Canada and China, which he insists will create more domestic jobs and shrink the federal deficit.",
      "In a news conference, Bank of Korea Governor Rhee Chang Yong said the bank faced a difficult decision over whether to freeze the rate or lower it. But a bigger-than-expected decline in exports during the last quarter and Trump\u2019s election win moved the needle.",
      "\u201cWe had been contemplating the uncertainties that would be brought by the results of the U.S. presidential election, but a \u2018red sweep\u2019 where the House and Senate were all won by one side was something we did not anticipate,\u201d Rhee said.",
      "Rhee said Trump\u2019s win \u201cincreased the uncertainty in policy, not only for us but for the world,\u201d but said it was too early to predict how Trump\u2019s steps on tariffs would impact South Korean exports.",
      "The rate cut could help spur domestic consumption by putting more money into the economy, but is unlikely to reverse the slowdown in exports, which is due to long-term competitiveness issues in key industries that should be addressed through policy changes or restructuring, Rhee said.",
      "Rhee said three of the six monetary policy committee members believe that the bank should lower the rate further within the next three months to help revive the sluggish economy. The bank will closely monitor trends in household debt and property prices before considering another cut, he said.",
      "The bank said in a statement that South Korea\u2019s economy has been losing momentum due to weak domestic spending, slowing exports and rising unemployment.",
      "\u201cGoing forward, domestic consumption will see a mild recovery, but the recovery in exports is likely to be weaker than initially anticipated due to intensifying competition and strengthening of protectionist trade policies in key industries,\u201d it said."

      "The International Tennis Integrity Agency says five-time Grand Slam champion Iga Swiatek has accepted a one-month suspension after testing positive for the banned substance trimetazidine",
      "Five-time Grand Slam champion Iga Swiatek accepted a one-month suspension after testing positive for the banned substance trimetazidine, a heart medication known as TMZ, the International Tennis Integrity Agency announced Thursday.",
      "Swiatek failed an out-of-competition drug test in August, and the ITIA accepted her explanation that the result was unintentional and caused by the contamination of a nonprescription medication, melatonin, that Swiatek was taking for issues with jet lag and sleeping.",
      "It was determined her level of fault was \u201cat the lowest end of the range for no significant fault or negligence,\u201d the ITIA said.",
      "\u201cThis experience, the most difficult in my life so far, taught me a lot,\u201d Swiatek, a 23-year-old from Poland, said in a video she posted on social media.",
      "\u201cThe whole thing will definitely stay with me for the rest of my life. It took a lot to return to training after the situation nearly broke my heart, so there were many tears and lots of sleepless nights,\u201d Swiatek said, speaking in Polish with an English translation scrolling across the top of the post. \u201cThe worst part of it was the uncertainty. I didn\u2019t know what was going to happen with my career, how things would end or if I would be allowed to play tennis at all.\u201d",
      "This is the second recent high-profile doping case in tennis: The top-ranked man, Jannik Sinner, failed two tests for a steroid in March and was cleared in August, right before the start of the U.S. Open, which he went on to win for his second Grand Slam title of the season. Sinner did not miss any competition; the World Anti-Doping Agency has appealed the ruling that exonerated him.",
      "Swiatek reached No. 1 in the WTA rankings for the first time in April 2022, and she remained there much of the time since but is now at No. 2 after being overtaken by Aryna Sabalenka in October.",
      "Swiatek won the French Open in June for her fourth title there and fifth major championship overall, then took home a bronze medal at the Paris Olympics in early August.",
      "\u201cThe WTA fully supports Iga during this difficult time. Iga has consistently demonstrated a strong commitment to fair play and upholding the principles of clean sport, and this unfortunate incident highlights the challenges athletes face in navigating the use of medications and supplements,\u201d the women's tennis tour said in a statement. \u201cThe WTA remains steadfast in our support for a clean sport and the rigorous processes that protect the integrity of competition. We also emphasize that athletes must take every precaution to verify the safety and compliance of all products they use, as even unintentional exposure to prohibited substances can have significant consequences.\u201d",
      "Swiatek formally admitted the anti-doping rule violation on Wednesday and accepted her penalty. TMZ is the drug at the center of the case involving 23 Chinese swimmers who remained eligible despite testing positive for performance enhancers in 2021.",
      "Swiatek said she was \u201cshocked\u201d by her test result and had never heard of TMZ. She said she's been using melatonin \u201cfor a long time,\" adding that \u201call my traveling, jet lag and work-related stress mean that sometimes without it, I couldn\u2019t fall asleep.\u201d",
      "She already was provisionally suspended from Sept. 22 to Oct. 4, missing three tournaments during the post-U.S. Open hard-court swing in Asia \u2014 the Korea Open, the China Open and the Wuhan Open.",
      "That provisional ban was ended after her appeal showed that her test result came inadvertently from contaminated melatonin.",
      "Because the ultimate agreement was for a month suspension, she will serve the remaining eight days now, while there\u2019s no competition, and be cleared to return to play as of Dec. 4.",
      "\u201cI can start my new season with a clean slate, focused on what I've always done \u2014 simply playing tennis,\u201d said Swiatek, who hired Wim Fissette as her coach in October.",
      "Swiatek also was fined the prize money of $158,944 that she earned for her semifinal run at the Cincinnati Open in August, the event immediately following the positive test.",
      "\u201cOnce the source of the TMZ had been established, it became clear that this was a highly unusual instance of a contaminated product, which in Poland is a regulated medicine. However, the product does not have the same designation globally, and the fact that a product is a regulated medication in one country cannot of itself be sufficient to avoid any level of fault,\" ITIA CEO Karen Moorhouse said.",
      "\u201cTaking into account the nature of the medication, and all the circumstances, it does place that fault at the lowest end of the scale,\" Moorhouse said. \"This case is an important reminder for tennis players of the strict liability nature of the World Anti-Doping Code and the importance of players carefully considering the use of supplements and medications.\u201d",

      "Iga Swiatek is the second high-profile tennis player to test positive for a banned substance this year",
      "Iga Swiatek is the second high-profile tennis player to test positive for a banned substance this year, joining Jannik Sinner. While Sinner, currently the No. 1 ranked man, was fully cleared, Swiatek, who slid from No. 1 to No. 2 last month, accepted a one-month suspension that was announced Thursday.",
      "The International Tennis Integrity Agency said it determined that Swiatek's tainted urine sample was because of a contaminated medicine she took and so she bore a low level of responsibility.",
      "\u201cThese are not cases of intentional doping. These are cases \u2014 in Sinner\u2019s case ... no fault or negligence. In (Swiatek's) case, very low end, no significant fault or negligence,\u201d ITIA CEO Karen Moorhouse said in a video call with reporters. \u201cSo I don\u2019t think this is a cause for concern for tennis fans and the like.\u201d",
      "Here is a look at the details of the two cases:",
      "Swiatek is a 23-year-old from Poland with five Grand Slam titles who has been the best player in women's tennis over the past 2 1/2 seasons, particularly on clay courts. She won four of the past five French Open titles, including the last three in a row, plus one U.S. Open championship, and has been ranked No. 1 nearly every week since April 2022. Swiatek also collected a bronze medal at the Paris Olympics in early August.",
      "Swiatek's urine showed low amounts of trimetazidine, a banned heart medication commonly referred to as TMZ, in an out-of-competition test on Aug. 12, 10 days after her last match at the Summer Games and shortly before the start of the Cincinnati Open. She was told she was being provisionally suspended on Sept. 12, eight days after losing to Jessica Pegula in the U.S. Open quarterfinals. It was found that the TMZ had contaminated a sleep aid, melatonin, that Swiatek's psychologist bought for her at a pharmacy in Poland, where it is sold as a medicine. According to the ITIA report, Swiatek listed 14 medications or supplements she was using, although not melatonin.",
      "Trimetazidine is a metabolic agent that can help prevent angina attacks if used as an \u201cadd-on treatment,\u201d according to the European Medicines Agency. It can increase blood flow efficiency and improve endurance \u2014 both crucial to high-end athletic performance. It is on the World Anti-Doping Agency's prohibited list in the category of \u201chormone and metabolic modulators.\u201d The substance was involved in past Olympic athletes' cases involving Russian figure skater Kamila Valieva and 23 Chinese swimmers.",
      "Swiatek was given a provisional ban that began in September, after the U.S. Open, but that was lifted because she quickly offered a believable explanation for the contamination \u2014 one that was backed up by tests, the ITIA said. She missed three tournaments during the Asian swing after the U.S. Open, although at the time, she didn't give the real reason for being sidelined. Eventually, the ITIA and Swiatek agreed she would serve a one-month suspension; because she was credited for the time she already missed, there were eight days remaining in a \u201cone-month\u201d penalty, so she is \u201cserving\u201d those now, even though the season is over. Swiatek was able to play in the WTA Finals and the Billie Jean King Cup. \u201cThe worst part of it was the uncertainty,\u201d she said. \"I didn\u2019t know what was going to happen with my career, how things would end or if I would be allowed to play tennis at all.\u201d",
      "Sinner tested positive for a banned anabolic steroid twice in March, but nothing came to light until August, just before the U.S. Open, which he went on to win for his second Grand Slam title of 2024. As with Swiatek, the cases were kept quiet until they were resolved because both players offered what ITIA found to be plausible explanations. He blamed it on a cream his trainer used before giving Sinner a massage and so was cleared completely \u2014 although WADA has appealed that ruling \u2014 while Swiatek was found to have been \u201cat the lowest end of the range for no significant fault or negligence,\u201d and so was given a light punishment. Asked whether there are specific guidelines that determine the lengths of bans in such instances, Moorhouse said: \u201cNo, there isn\u2019t. This is not where you put these things into machine and it spits you out a number at the end of it. It\u2019s a case of considering everything in the round, take into account all the circumstances and facts in the case to come to the right outcome.\u201d",

      "Greg Desrosiers Jr. caught two scoring passes and ran for a touchdown, and Memphis defeated No. 18 Tulane 34-24 to knock the Green Wave out of contention for a berth in the College Football Playoff",
      "NEW ORLEANS -- When three deep passes by Darian Mensah resulted in turnovers, Tulane's long-shot hopes of sneaking into the College Football Playoff slipped away.",
      "Greg Desrosiers Jr. caught two scoring passes and ran for a touchdown, and Memphis defeated No. 18 Tulane 34-24 on Thursday night to end the Green Wave's eight-game winning streak.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t have the critical mistakes we had,\" said Tulane coach Jon Sumrall, whose team needed to win its regular-season finale and the American Athletic Conference title game to have any realistic chance at making the new 12-team CFP.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of stuff we didn\u2019t execute to our standard that we have for several games in a row now,\" he added. \"It\u2019s very frustrating. We\u2019re all hurting, and it should hurt when you play a game like that.\u201d",
      "Two turnovers by Tulane (9-3, 7-1 AAC, No. 17 CFP) came on fumbles after long receptions at or inside the Memphis 10-yard line. Another came on a long pass by Mensah that was intercepted at the 2-yard line by Davion Ross, and the Tigers responded with a game-sealing drive capped by Mario Anderson Jr.\u2019s 47-yard touchdown run.",
      "\u201cWe could have easily held our heads down,\u201d Desrosiers said, referring to a pair of conference losses that dropped Memphis (10-2, 6-2) out of the AAC title picture. \u201cObviously, the season didn't go as planned ... but we know what we deserve. We know what we're capable of. So, we came out here and we wanted to dominate.\u201d",
      "Tigers defensive back Kourtlan Marsh caused both momentum-turning fumbles, the first when he leveled Yulkeith Brown after the receiver's 40-yard catch. AJ Watts recovered at the 10 and returned it 37 yards, initiating a drive that ended with Desrosiers' 29-yard touchdown run on third-and-4 to give Memphis a 27-10 lead.",
      "In the fourth quarter, with Tulane trailing 27-17, Mario Williams fumbled at the Tigers 9 after hauling in a 55-yard pass. Marsh recovered.",
      "\u201cIf those three turnovers don\u2019t happen, we\u2019re probably talking about a final play to figure out who the winner is,\" Sumrall said.",
      "Seth Henigan completed 22 of 29 passes for 218 yards and two TDs without a turnover for Memphis, which totaled 454 yards against a Tulane defense that had allowed just nine points in its previous three games combined. Anderson rushed for 177 yards on 24 carries.",
      "\u201cWhen you can't win the conference championship, all you can do is win the play that you're in and the game that you're in,\u201d Henigan said. \u201cOur guys came together and played for each other.\u201d",
      "Mensah passed for 317 yards and two TDs, and Arnold Barnes ran for a 2-yard score \u2014 not enough for Tulane to prolong its 17-game streak of regular-season conference wins.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t see that performance coming,\u201d Sumrall said. \u201cI thought we\u2019d play better than we did. Memphis played good, but we didn\u2019t play to our standard. We didn\u2019t help ourselves a whole lot.\u201d",
      "Tulane gave up a touchdown on Memphis' opening drive when Henigan hit Desrosiers for the first of his two touchdown catches \u2014 a leaping 17-yard grab in tight coverage.",
      "\u201cTo come out on the opening possession and score, that was big for our offense and maybe our confidence as well, just to know we could execute on these guys,\u201d Henigan said. \u201cPlaying against a great opponent, that's an opportunity. So we had to make sure that opportunity wasn't wasted.\u201d",
      "Tulane's only lead came when Williams' 7-yard TD catch made it 10-7 late in the first quarter. Desrosier's 25-yard catch and run put the Tigers back in front for good in the second.",
      "Memphis: The Tigers played like a team that felt disrespected as two-touchdown underdogs. They converted 10 of 16 third downs to help them surpass 20 points for a 39th straight game. Their defense was disruptive and opportunistic. Now they have consecutive 10-win seasons for the first time in program history. Henigan also became the AAC's all-time leading passer, now with 13,972 career yards.",
      "Tulane: The Green Wave looked tight early. Receivers dropped several passes and Tulane's normally productive run scheme did not match up well with a Memphis run defense that ranked 18th nationally. Missed tackles on defense and trouble getting third-down stops made for a rough night.",
      "Tulane might drop out of the AP Top 25, lessening the magnitude of next week's AAC championship game.",
      "Memphis: Awaits a bowl bid.",
      "Tulane: Will play Army on Dec. 6 in the American Athletic Conference championship game at a site to be determined.",

      "The federal government is about to transition from one that prioritized safeguards for artificial intelligence to one more focused on eliminating red tape",
      "WASHINGTON -- With artificial intelligence at a pivotal moment of development, the federal government is about to transition from one that prioritized AI safeguards to one more focused on eliminating red tape.",
      "That\u2019s a promising prospect for some investors but creates uncertainty about the future of any guardrails on the technology, especially around the use of AI deepfakes in elections and political campaigns.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to rescind President Joe Biden\u2019s sweeping AI executive order, which sought to protect people\u2019s rights and safety without stifling innovation. He hasn\u2019t specified what he would do in its place, but the platform of the Republican National Committee, which he recently reshaped, said AI development should be \u201crooted in Free Speech and Human Flourishing.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s an open question whether Congress, soon to be fully controlled by Republicans, will be interested in passing any AI-related legislation. Interviews with a dozen lawmakers and industry experts reveal there is still interest in boosting the technology\u2019s use in national security and cracking down on non-consensual explicit images.",
      "Yet the use of AI in elections and in spreading misinformation is likely to take a backseat as GOP lawmakers turn away from anything they view as potentially suppressing innovation or free speech.",
      "\u201cAI has incredible potential to enhance human productivity and positively benefit our economy,\u201d said Rep. Jay Obernolte, a California Republican widely seen as a leader in the evolving technology. \u201cWe need to strike an appropriate balance between putting in place the framework to prevent the harmful things from happening while at the same time enabling innovation.\u201d",
      "Artificial intelligence interests have been expecting sweeping federal legislation for years. But Congress, gridlocked on nearly every issue, failed to pass any artificial intelligence bill, instead producing only a series of proposals and reports.",
      "Some lawmakers believe there is enough bipartisan interest around some AI-related issues to get a bill passed.",
      "\u201cI find there are Republicans that are very interested in this topic,\u201d said Democratic Sen. Gary Peters, singling out national security as one area of potential agreement. \"I am confident I will be able to work with them as I have in the past.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s still unclear how much Republicans want the federal government to intervene in AI development. Few showed interest before this year's election in regulating how the Federal Election Commission or the Federal Communications Commission handled AI-generated content, worrying that it would raise First Amendment issues at the same time that Trump\u2019s campaign and other Republicans were using the technology to create political memes.",
      "The FCC was in the middle of a lengthy process for developing AI-related regulations when Trump won the presidency. That work has since been halted under long-established rules covering a change in administrations.",
      "Trump has expressed both interest and skepticism in artificial intelligence.",
      "During a Fox Business interview earlier this year, he called the technology \u201cvery dangerous\u201d and \u201cso scary\u201d because \u201cthere\u2019s no real solution.\u201d But his campaign and supporters also embraced AI-generated images more than their Democratic opponents. They often used them in social media posts that weren\u2019t meant to mislead, but rather to further entrench Republican political views.",
      "Elon Musk, Trump's close adviser and a founder of several companies that rely on AI, also has shown a mix of concern and excitement about the technology, depending on how it is applied.",
      "Musk used X, the social media platform he owns, to promote AI-generated images and videos throughout the election. Operatives from Americans for Responsible Innovation, a nonprofit focused on artificial intelligence, have publicly been pushing Trump to tap Musk as his top adviser on the technology.",
      "\u201cWe think that Elon has a pretty sophisticated understating of both the opportunities and risks of advanced AI systems,\u201d said Doug Calidas, a top operative from the group.",
      "But Musk advising Trump on artificial intelligence worries others. Peters argued it could undercut the president.",
      "\u201cIt is a concern,\u201d said the Michigan Democrat. \u201cWhenever you have anybody that has a strong financial interest in a particular technology, you should take their advice and counsel with a grain of salt.\u201d",
      "In the run-up to the election, many AI experts expressed concern about an eleventh-hour deepfake \u2014 a lifelike AI image, video or audio clip \u2014 that would sway or confuse voters as they headed to the polls. While those fears were never realized, AI still played a role in the election, said Vivian Schiller, executive director of Aspen Digital, part of the nonpartisan Aspen Institute think tank.",
      "\u201cI would not use the term that I hear a lot of people using, which is it was the dog that didn\u2019t bark,\u201d she said of AI in the 2024 election. \u201cIt was there, just not in the way that we expected.\u201d",
      "Campaigns used AI in algorithms to target messages to voters. AI-generated memes, though not lifelike enough to be mistaken as real, felt true enough to deepen partisan divisions.",
      "A political consultant mimicked Joe Biden\u2019s voice in robocalls that could have dissuaded voters from coming to the polls during New Hampshire's primary if they hadn\u2019t been caught quickly. And foreign actors used AI tools to create and automate fake online profiles and websites that spread disinformation to a U.S. audience.",
      "Even if AI didn\u2019t ultimately influence the election outcome, the technology made political inroads and contributed to an environment where U.S. voters don\u2019t feel confident that what they are seeing is true. That dynamic is part of the reason some in the AI industry want to see regulations that establish guidelines.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump and people on his team have said they don\u2019t want to stifle the technology and they do want to support its development, so that is welcome news,\u201d said Craig Albright, the top lobbyist and senior vice president at The Software Alliance, a trade group whose members include OpenAI, Oracle and IBM. \u201cIt is our view that passing national laws to set the rules of the road will be good for developing markets for the technology.\"",
      "AI safety advocates during a recent meeting in San Francisco made similar arguments, according to Suresh Venkatasubramanian, director of the Center for Tech Responsibility at Brown University.",
      "\u201cBy putting literal guardrails, lanes, road rules, we were able to get cars that could roll a lot faster,\u201d said Venkatasubramanian, a former Biden administration official who helped craft White House principles for approaching AI.",
      "Rob Weissman, co-president of the advocacy group Public Citizen, said he's not hopeful about the prospects for federal legislation and is concerned about Trump\u2019s pledge to rescind Biden\u2019s executive order, which created an initial set of national standards for the industry. His group has advocated for federal regulation of generative AI in elections.",
      "\u201cThe safeguards are themselves ways to promote innovation so that we have AI that\u2019s useful and safe and doesn\u2019t exclude people and promotes the technology in ways that serve the public interest,\u201d he said.",

      "FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. -- Donald Trump dined on Wednesday with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg at the president-elect\u2019s Mar-a-Lago club in Florida, bringing together the Facebook founder and the former president who was once banned from that social network.",
      "Stephen Miller, who has been appointed deputy chief of staff for Trump\u2019s second term, said Zuckerberg, like other business leaders, wants to support Trump\u2019s economic plans. The tech CEO has been seeking to change his company's perception on the right following a rocky relationship with Trump.",
      "\u201cMark, obviously, he has his own interest, and he has his own company and he has his own agenda,\u201d Miller said in an interview on Fox News about the meeting. \u201cBut he\u2019s made clear that he wants to support the national renewal of America under Trump\u2019s leadership.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for Meta confirmed that Zuckerberg and Trump met on Wednesday, saying he was invited for dinner with the president-elect and other members of his team to talk about the incoming administration.",
      "Trump was kicked off Facebook following the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol. The company restored his account in early 2023.",
      "During the 2024 campaign, Zuckerberg did not endorse a candidate for president.",
      "Zuckerberg has since taken a more positive stance toward Trump. Earlier this year, he praised Trump\u2019s response to his first assassination attempt, calling it \u201cbadass.\u201d Zuckerberg also complained that senior Biden administration officials pressured Facebook to \u201ccensor\u201d some COVID-19 content during the pandemic.",
      "Still, Trump in recent months had continued to attack Zuckerberg publicly. In July, he posted a message on his own social network Truth Social threatening to send election fraudsters to prison in part by citing a nickname he used for the Meta CEO. \u201cZUCKERBUCKS, be careful!\u201d Trump wrote.",
      "The Thanksgiving eve visit also comes as tech mogul Elon Musk has become more influential in Trump's Make America Great Again movement, contributing an estimated $200 million through his political action committee to help elect Trump. Musk is the billionaire owner of the X social network, a competitor to Meta.",
      "Musk has spent considerable time at Mar-a-Lago since the election, and Trump selected him to lead an outside advisory panel known as the \u201cDepartment of Government Efficiency \u201d to identify waste with Vivek Ramaswamy, a venture capitalist and former GOP presidential candidate.",

      "NEW YORK -- It's time for the holidays, which means robust family conversations and seemingly never-ending courses of food. But for the more tech-savvy among us, the journey home could also mean we'll be called on to provide a backlog of tech support to parents, grandparents and other family members.",
      "And with generative AI being used to supercharge some major cyber scams this year, it's also a good time to teach and not just fix.",
      "Here are some tips on how to manage your tech encounters this holiday season:",
      "Whether it's Windows, macOS, iOS or Android, simply keeping your operating system and apps up-to-date will help protect your family's computers and devices against a surprising number of security threats, such as malware, viruses and exploits.",
      "Most operating systems, especially those for mobile devices and their app stores, typically have auto-updates turned on by default. Be sure to double-check the device to make sure it has enough storage space to carry out the update. (More on this below.)",
      "Keeping apps updated may also reduce the number of \u201cWhy isn't this app working?\u201d type of questions from your relatives.",
      "Chances are someone in your family is going to have a completely full mobile device. So full, in fact, that they can no longer update their phone or tablet without having to purge something first.",
      "There are many approaches to freeing up space. Here are a few you can easily take without having to triage data or apps.",
      "\u2014 Use the cloud to back up media: iPhone users can free up space occupied by songs and pictures by storing them on iCloud. Android users can use the Google Photos app to back up and store their photos on their user space.",
      "\u2014 Clear browsing data: Each major browser has an option to clear its data cache \u2014 cookies, search and download histories, autofill forms, site settings, sign-in data and so on. Over time, these bits take up a significant amount of storage space on mobile devices and home computers. So cleaning caches out periodically helps free up space and, in some cases, improves system performance.",
      "According to some admittedly unscientific studies, the average person has hundreds of passwords. That\u2019s a lot to remember. So as you help your relatives reset some of theirs, you may be tempted to recycle some to keep things simple for them. But that's one of the bad password habits that cybersecurity experts warn against.",
      "Instead, try introducing your forgetful family member to a password manager. They're useful tools for simplifying and keeping track of logins. And if you want to impress a more tech-savvy cousin or auntie, you could suggest switching to a more secure digital authentication method: passkeys.",
      "As scammers find new ways to steal money and personal information, you and your family should be more vigilant about who to trust. Artificial intelligence and other technologies are giving bad actors craftier tools to work with online.",
      "A quick way to remember what to do when you think you\u2019re getting scammed is to think about the three S\u2019s, said Alissa Abdullah, also known as Dr. Jay, Mastercard\u2019s deputy chief security officer",
      "\u201cStay suspicious, stop for a second (and think about it) and stay protected,\u201d she said.",
      "Simply being aware of typical scams can help, experts say. Robocalls frequently target vulnerable individuals like seniors, people with disabilities, and people with debt. So-called romance scams target lonely and isolated individuals. Quiz scams target those who spend a lot of time on social media.",
      "Check our AP guide on the latest scams and what to do when you're victimized.",
      "Home internet speeds are getting faster, so you want to make sure your family members are getting a high-speed connection if they've paid for one. Run a broadband speed test on your home network if they\u2019re still rocking an aging modem and router."

      "The Australian Parliament has passed a social media ban for young children in a world-first law",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- A social media ban for children under 16 passed the Australian Parliament on Friday in a world-first law.",
      "The law will make platforms including TikTok, Facebook, Snapchat, Reddit, X and Instagram liable for fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars ($33 million) for systemic failures to prevent children younger than 16 from holding accounts.",
      "The Senate passed the bill on Thursday 34 votes to 19. The House of Representatives on Wednesday overwhelmingly approved the legislation by 102 votes to 13.",
      "The House on Friday endorsed opposition amendments made in the Senate, making the bill law.",
      "Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the law supported parents concerned by online harms to their children.",
      "\u201cPlatforms now have a social responsibility to ensure the safety of our kids is a priority for them,\u201d Albanese told reporters.",

      "Meta Platforms, which owns Facebook and Instagram, said the legislation had been \u201crushed.\u201d",
      "Digital Industry Group Inc., an advocate for the platforms in Australia, said questions remain about the law\u2019s impact on children, its technical foundations and scope.",
      "\u201cThe social media ban legislation has been released and passed within a week and, as a result, no one can confidently explain how it will work in practice \u2013 the community and platforms are in the dark about what exactly is required of them,\u201d DIGI managing director Sunita Bose said.",
      "The amendments passed on Friday bolster privacy protections. Platforms would not be allowed to compel users to provide government-issued identity documents including passports or driver\u2019s licenses, nor could they demand digital identification through a government system.",
      "Critics of the legislation fear that banning young children from social media will impact the privacy of all users who must establish they are older than 16.",
      "While the major parties support the ban, many child welfare and mental health advocates are concerned about unintended consequences.",
      "Sen. David Shoebridge, from the minority Greens party, said mental health experts agreed that the ban could dangerously isolate many children who used social media to find support.",
      "\u201cThis policy will hurt vulnerable young people the most, especially in regional communities and especially the LGBTQI community, by cutting them off,\u201d Shoebridge told the Senate.",
      "Exemptions will apply for health and education services including YouTube, Messenger Kids, WhatsApp, Kids Helpline and Google Classroom.",
      "Opposition Sen. Maria Kovacic said the bill was not radical but necessary. \u201cThe core focus of this legislation is simple: It demands that social media companies take reasonable steps to identify and remove underage users from their platforms,\u201d Kovacic told the Senate.",
      "\u201cThis is a responsibility these companies should have been fulfilling long ago, but for too long they have shirked these responsibilities in favor of profit,\u201d she added.",
      "Online safety campaigner Sonya Ryan, whose 15-year-old daughter Carly was murdered by a 50-year-old pedophile who pretended to be a teenager online, described the Senate vote as a \u201cmonumental moment in protecting our children from horrendous harms online.\u201d",

      "\u201cI have always been a proud Australian, but for me subsequent to today\u2019s Senate decision, I am bursting with pride,\u201d Holdsworth said.",
      "Christopher Stone, executive director of Suicide Prevention Australia, the governing body for the suicide prevention sector, said the legislation failed to consider positive aspects of social media in supporting young people\u2019s mental health and sense of connection.",
      "\u201cThe government is running blindfolded into a brick wall by rushing this legislation. Young Australians deserve evidence-based policies, not decisions made in haste,\u201d Stone said.",
      "The platforms had complained that the law would be unworkable and had urged the Senate to delay the vote until at least June 2025 when a government-commissioned evaluation of age assurance technologies will report on how young children could be excluded.",
      "\u201cNaturally, we respect the laws decided by the Australian Parliament,\" Facebook and Instagram owner Meta Platforms said. \u201cHowever, we are concerned about the process which rushed the legislation through while failing to properly consider the evidence, what industry already does to ensure age-appropriate experiences, and the voices of young people.\u201d",
      "Snapchat said it was also concerned by the law and would cooperate with the government regulator, the eSafety Commissioner.",
      "\"While there are many unanswered questions about how this law will be implemented in practice, we will engage closely with the Government and the eSafety Commissioner during the 12-month implementation period to help develop an approach that balances privacy, safety and practicality. As always, Snap will comply with any applicable laws and regulations in Australia,\u201d Snapchat said in a statement.",
      "Critics argue the government is attempting to convince parents it is protecting their children ahead of a general election due by May. The government hopes that voters will reward it for responding to parents\u2019 concerns about their children\u2019s addiction to social media. Some argue the legislation could cause more harm than it prevents.",
      "Criticisms include that the legislation was rushed through Parliament without adequate scrutiny, is ineffective, poses privacy risks for all users, and undermines the authority of parents to make decisions for their children.",
      "Opponents also argue the ban would isolate children, deprive them of the positive aspects of social media, drive them to the dark web, discourage children too young for social media to report harm, and reduce incentives for platforms to improve online safety.",

      "The footprints were left in the mud by two different species \u201cwithin a matter of hours, or at most days,\u201d said paleontologist Louise Leakey, co-author of the research published Thursday in the journal Science.",
      "Scientists previously knew from fossil remains that these two extinct branches of the human evolutionary tree \u2013 called Homo erectus and Paranthropus boisei \u2013 lived about the same time in the Turkana Basin.",
      "But dating fossils is not exact. \u201cIt\u2019s plus or minus a few thousand years,\u201d said paleontologist William Harcourt-Smith of Lehman College and the American Museum of Natural History in New York, who was not involved in the study.",
      "Yet with fossil footprints, \u201cthere\u2019s an actual moment in time preserved,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing discovery.\u201d",
      "The tracks of fossil footprints were uncovered in 2021 in what is today Koobi Fora, Kenya, said Leaky, who is based at New York's Stony Brook University.",
      "Whether the two individuals passed by the eastern side of Lake Turkana at the same time \u2013 or a day or two apart \u2013 they likely knew of each other\u2019s existence, said study co-author Kevin Hatala, a paleoanthropologist at Chatham University in Pittsburgh.",
      "\u201cThey probably saw each other, probably knew each other was there and probably influenced each other in some way,\u201d he said.",
      "Scientists were able to distinguish between the two species because of the shape of the footprints, which holds clues to the anatomy of the foot and how it\u2019s being used.",
      "H. erectus appeared to be walking similar to how modern humans walk \u2013 striking the ground heel first, then rolling weight over the ball of the foot and toes and pushing off again.",
      "The other species, which was also walking upright, was moving \u201cin a different way from anything else we\u2019ve seen before, anywhere else,\u201d said co-author Erin Marie Williams-Hatala, a human evolutionary anatomist at Chatham.",
      "Among other details, the footprints suggest more mobility in their big toe, compared to H. erectus or modern humans, said Hatala.",
      "Our common primate ancestors probably had hands and feet adapted for grasping branches, but over time the feet of human ancestors evolved to enable walking upright, researchers say.",
      "The new study adds to a growing body of research that implies this transformation to bipedalism \u2013 walking on two feet \u2014 didn\u2019t happen at a single moment, in a single way.",
      "Rather, there may have been a variety of ways that early humans learned to walk, run, stumble and slide on prehistoric muddy slopes.",

      "Members of Parliament (MPs), who have been holding emotional meetings with constituents and searching their souls, are due to debate the issue that crosses political lines.",
      "Supporters say the law would provide dignity to the dying and prevent unnecessary suffering. Opponents say it would put vulnerable people at risk, fearing that some would be coerced to end their lives and that some elderly or disabled people may opt for death so they don't become a burden.",
      "A vote in favor of the bill would send it to another round of hearings. A vote against it would kill it.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at what\u2019s in the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill and the next steps:",
      "The House of Commons hasn't debated an assisted dying bill since 2015 when a similar measure failed.",
      "Debate is scheduled for five hours and more than 150 members have reportedly signed up to speak. It is expected to be followed by a close vote.",
      "Although the current bill was proposed by a member of the ruling center-left Labour Party, it is an open vote with no pressure from the government on supporting it.",
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who has previously supported assisted dying, said the government will remain neutral and he wouldn't reveal how he would vote. Some members of his cabinet have said they will support the bill, while others are against it.",
      "Former Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown, along with three former Conservative prime ministers \u2014 Boris Johnson, Liz Truss, and Theresa May \u2014 have publicly opposed the bill, though they are no longer in the House of Commons and can't vote. Former Tory Prime Minister David Cameron supports it.",
      "If the bill passes the first stage in the House of Commons, it will face further scrutiny and votes in both Houses of Parliament.",
      "If ultimately approved, any new law is unlikely to come into effect within the next two to three years, supporters say.",
      "Under the proposed legislation, only those over 18 years old in England and Wales and who are expected to die within six months can request assisted dying. They must have the mental capacity to make a choice about the end of their life and will be required to make two separate declarations about their wish to die.",
      "Labour lawmaker Kim Leadbeater, who proposed the bill, said the law has robust safeguards built in and contains \u201cthree layers of scrutiny\u201d \u2014 two independent doctors and a High Court judge will have to sign off on any decision.",
      "Anyone found guilty of pressuring, coercing or dishonestly getting someone to make a declaration that they wish to die will face up to 14 years in prison.",
      "Assisted suicide is currently banned in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Someone who helps a person end their life can be prosecuted and face up to 14 years in prison.",
      "The patient must self-administer the life-ending medication. No doctor or anyone else can give the medication.",
      "No health professional is under any obligation to provide assistance to the patient.",
      "Doctors who do take part would have to be satisfied the person making their declaration to die has done so voluntarily. They also must ensure the person is making an informed choice.",
      "One argument supporting the bill is that wealthy individuals can travel to Switzerland, which allows foreigners to go there to legally end their lives, while others have to face possible prosecution for helping their loves ones to die.",
      "Esther Rantzen, 84, a broadcaster dying of lung cancer, has urged passage of the bill so others don\u2019t have to do what she plans to do by traveling to Switzerland to legally end her life. She urged all 650 MPs to attend the hearing.",

      "Wayne Holdsworth became an advocate for banning Australian children younger than 16 from social media because his son took his own life after falling victim to an online sextortion scam",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- Wayne Holdsworth became an advocate for banning Australian children younger than 16 from social media because his son took his own life after falling victim to an online sextortion scam.",
      "Mac Holdsworth died last year at his Melbourne family home at the age of 17 after a 47-year-old Sydney man who purported to be an 18-year-old woman demanded money for an intimate image the boy had shared.",
      "Since then, the grieving father has taken his tragic story to around 20 schools to warn students of the risks of social media.",
      "\u201cI saw firsthand the damage that social media could do. I saw Mac, my son, get sexually extorted on social media,\u201d Holdsworth said. \u201cHis mental health deteriorated at a rapid rate.\u201d",
      "Online predators began approaching the teenager before his 16th birthday and his father believes such a ban could have saved his life.",
      "Australia's House of Representatives on Wednesday voted for such a ban and the Senate is expected to make it law soon.",
      "Holdsworth said most of the 3,000 students he\u2019s spoken to, from age 12 to 17, agree with a ban on children under the age of 16.",
      "\u201cThey come up to me and they say, \u2018I\u2019m so glad that this is going to be implemented,\u2019\u201d Holdsworth said. \u201cEven the kids see it now that they\u2019re going to be protected from those predators outside that are preying on them.\u201d",
      "He said three girls approached him after a school address on Monday to tell him that they were being subjected to sextortion. One had already handed over 2,500 Australian dollars ($1,600) of her parents\u2019 money to a blackmailer.",
      "Holdsworth said he was the first adult they had confided in.",
      "\u201cThe parent won\u2019t know until the credit card statement comes out,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cSo it\u2019s prevalent. It happened last night and it\u2019ll happen tonight,\u201d he added.",
      "Holdsworth described the government plan to ban children younger than 16 from social media as \u201cabsolutely essential for the safety of our children.\u201d",
      "But not all parents are convinced that banning young children from social media is the answer.",
      "Critics say the legislation was rushed through Parliament without adequate scrutiny, would not work, would create privacy risks for users of all ages and would take away parents\u2019 authority to decide what\u2019s best for their children.",
      "They also argue the ban would isolate children, deprive them of positive aspects of social media, drive children to the dark web, make children too young for social media reluctant to report harms they encounter, and take away incentives for platforms to make online spaces safer.",
      "Independent Sydney lawmaker Kylea Tink on Tuesday became the first member of the House of Representatives to speak publicly against the bill, which would make platforms including TikTok, Facebook, Snapchat, Reddit, X and Instagram liable for fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars ($33 million) for systemic failures to prevent young children from holding accounts.",
      "\u201cAs a mom of three young adults ... I\u2019m very aware of the negative impacts of social media and the challenges of parenting in this digital world,\u201d Tink told Parliament. \u201cI also recognize, however, that my children are digital natives and are very literate about how these platforms work. For this reason, I encourage everyone involved in this debate to ensure they are listening to the voices of young Australians when it comes to this decision-making process rather than assuming that the grownups in the room know best.\u201d",
      "Tink was among 13 lawmakers who voted against the bill in the House on Wednesday. They were overwhelmed by 102 legislators who voted for it.",
      "The platforms have urged a Senate committee that examined the legislation on Monday to delay a vote until after a government-commissioned evaluation of age assurance technologies is completed next June.",
      "The four-hour committee meeting on Monday attracted 15,000 written submissions.",
      "X Corp. told the committee that billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk's platform had \u201cserious concerns as to the lawfulness of the bill,\" including its compatibility with the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.",
      "\u201cThere is no evidence that banning young people from social media will work and to make it law in the form proposed is highly problematic,\u201d X said.",
      "Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, said the legislation was \u201cinconsistent with what Australian parents have told us that they want, which is a simple and effective way for them to set controls and manage their teens\u2019 online experience.\u201d",
      "Under the bill, parental consent for children to use social media does not override the ban.",
      "Lizzie O\u2019Shea, chair of the Digital Rights Watch charity, which aims to uphold the digital rights of Australians, said she was appalled by the process and limited timeframe the government used to pass such significant and contentious legislation.",
      "She said she was very aware of the serious risks posed by social media platforms, \"but I do not support a ban personally because I understand both the limits of that particular policy and the expert evidence that is coming out from people who work in this space about the problems for young people being excluded from those spaces,\u201d O'Shea said.",
      "Her concerns centered on privacy, negative mental health impacts on excluded children and the possibility that young children would find ways to access social media spaces that would become even less child friendly as a result of the ban.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m profoundly aware of the dangers of large social media platforms running a certain kind of business model that prioritizes data extraction and exploitation of vulnerability over the public interest or the building of community and the protection of democracy,\" she said.",
      "Swinburne University digital media expert Belinda Barnet, who supports the ban, feels she is part of a minority among professionals in the digital field.",
      "\u201cI like it mainly because I think many of the social media platforms as they exist right now are not suitable environments for young children,\u201d she said."

      "NEW YORK -- Using fossilized feces and vomit samples from Poland, scientists have reconstructed how dinosaurs came to dominate the Earth millions of years ago.",
      "Researchers aren't sure whether dinosaurs' rise over the course of 30 million years happened because of luck, skill, climate or some combination. But they came away knowing this: \u201cIt was not a sudden thing,\u201d said study co-author Martin Qvarnstr\u00f6m from Uppsala University.",
      "The new study, published Wednesday in the journal Nature, analyzed hundreds of dino droppings to reconstruct who was eating whom 200 million years ago.",
      "The first dinosaurs were go-getters, Qvarnstr\u00f6m said, eating whatever they could \u2014 including insects, fish and plants.",
      "When climate conditions changed, they were quick to adapt. Plant-eating dinosaurs, for example, ate a greater variety of greens than other vegetarians of the time, so it was easier to expand their palates when wetter conditions gave rise to new plant species.",

      "It's not uncommon for scientists to study ancient fecal matter to understand creatures of the past, said Emma Dunne, a paleobiologist at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg.

      "President Joe Biden\u2019s administration will loan $6.6 billion to electric vehicle maker Rivian Automotive to build a Georgia factory",
      "ATLANTA -- President Joe Biden's administration announced Tuesday that the U.S. Department of Energy will make a $6.6 billion loan to Rivian Automotive to build a factory in Georgia that had stalled as the startup electric vehicle maker struggled to become profitable.",
      "It's unclear whether the administration can complete the loan before Donald Trump becomes president again in less than two months, or whether the Trump administration might try to claw the money back.",
      "Trump previously vowed to end federal electric vehicle tax credits, which are worth up to $7,500 for new zero-emission vehicles and $4,000 for used ones.",
      "Rivian made a splash when it went public and began producing large electric R1 SUVs, pickup trucks and delivery vans at a former Mitsubishi factory in Normal, Illinois, in 2021. Months later, the California-based company announced it would build a second, larger, $5 billion plant about 40 miles (64 kilometers) east of Atlanta, near the town of Social Circle.",
      "The R1 vehicles cost $70,000 or more. The company plans to produce R2 vehicles, a smaller SUV, in Georgia with lower price tags aimed at a mass market. The first phase of Rivian\u2019s Georgia factory is projected to make 200,000 vehicles a year, with a second phase capable of another 200,000 a year. Eventually, the plant is projected to employ 7,500 workers.",
      "But Rivian was unable to meet production and sales targets and rapidly burned through cash. In March, the company said it would pause construction of the Georgia plant. The company said it would begin assembling its R2 SUV in Illinois instead.",
      "CEO RJ Scaringe said the move would allow Rivian to start selling the R2 sooner and save $2.25 billion in capital spending. Since then, German automaker Volkswagen AG said in June it would invest $5 billion in Rivian in a joint venture in which Rivian would share software and electrical technology with Volkswagen. The money eased Rivian's cash crunch.",
      "Tuesday's announcement throws a lifeline to Rivian's grander plans. The company said its plans to make the R2 and the smaller R3 in Georgia are back on and that production will begin in 2028.",
      "\u201cThis loan would enable Rivian to more aggressively scale our U.S. manufacturing footprint for our competitively priced R2 and R3 vehicles that emphasize both capability and affordability,\u201d Scaringe said in a statement.",
      "The Energy Department said the loan would substantially boost electric vehicles made in the United States and support Biden\u2019s goal of having zero-emission vehicles make up half of all new U.S. sales by 2030.",
      "\u201cAs one of a few American EV startups with light duty vehicles already on the road, Rivian\u2019s Georgia facility will allow the company to reach production volumes that make its products more cost competitive and accelerate access to international markets,\u201d the department said in a statement.",
      "The loan includes $6 billion, plus $600 million in interest that will be rolled into the principal. The money would come from the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program, which provides low-interest loans to make fuel-efficient vehicles and components. The program has focused mostly on loans to new battery factories for electric vehicles under Biden, but earlier helped finance initial production of the Tesla Model S and Nissan Leaf, two pioneering electric vehicles.",
      "The loan program, created in 2007, requires a \"reasonable prospect of repayment\" of the loan. Under Biden, the program has announced deals totaling $33.3 billion, including $9.2 billion for massive battery plants in Tennessee and Kentucky for Ford\u2019s electric vehicles.",
      "Democratic U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff, who has been a vocal supporter of electric vehicle and solar manufacturing in Georgia, hailed Tuesday's announcement as \u201cyet another historic federal investment in Georgia electric vehicle manufacturing.\u201d Ossoff had asked Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm to support the loan in July.",
      "\u201cOur federal manufacturing incentives are driving economic development across the state of Georgia,\u201d Ossoff said in a statement.",
      "Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp says his goal is to make Georgia a center of the electric vehicle industry. But the Republican has had a strained relationship with the Biden administration over its industrial policy, even as some studies have found Georgia has netted more electric vehicle investment than any other state.",
      "Kemp has long claimed that manufacturers were picking Georgia before Biden's signature climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act, was passed.",
      "Efforts to bring Rivian to Georgia predated the Biden administration and \"our shared vision to bring opportunity to Georgia will remain no matter who resides in the White House or what party controls Congress,\u201d Kemp spokesperson Garrison Douglas said Tuesday.",
      "The loan to Rivian could rescue one of the Kemp administration's signature economic development projects even as Biden leaves office. That could put Rivian and Kemp in the position of defending the loan if Trump tries to quash it.",
      "State and local governments offered Rivian an incentive package worth an estimated $1.5 billion in 2022. Neighbors opposed to development of the Georgia site mounted legal challenges.",
      "State and local governments spent around $125 million to buy and prepare the nearly 2,000-acre (810-hectare) site. The state also has completed most of $50 million in roadwork that it pledged.",
      "The pause at Rivian contrasts with rapid construction at Hyundai Motor Group\u2019s $7.6 billion electric vehicle and battery complex near Savannah. The Korean automaker said in October that it had begun production in Ellabell, where it plans to eventually employ 8,500.",

      "Jalel Chelba, Afripol\u2019s Executive Director, said in the statement: \u201cThrough Serengeti, Afripol has significantly enhanced support for law enforcement in African Union Member States,\u201d",
      "Serengeti\u2019s results were a \u201cdrastic increase\u201d compared to operations in Africa in previous years, Enrique Hernandez Gonzalez, Interpol\u2019s Assistant Director of Cybercrime Operations, told The Associated Press.",

      "Solar storms may produce faint auroras across the northern rim of the United States this Thanksgiving",
      "NEW YORK -- This Thanksgiving, solar storms may produce faint auroras across the northern rim of the United States.",
      "Pale auroras may be seen across many northern states Thursday and Friday, but they may be brief and and seeing them will depend on how intense the solar storms get, NOAA meteorologist Mike Bettwy said in an email.",
      "Much of the following states are best positioned for potential auroras: Washington, Montana, the Dakotas, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan and Maine. Northern parts of Idaho, Wyoming, New York, Vermont and New Hampshire may also see auroras.",
      "Space weather experts say auroras could be visible from 10 p.m. EST Thursday to 1 a.m. Friday EST, though it's difficult to pin down an exact window. Updated forecasts may be available as the event draws closer on NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center website or an aurora forecasting app.",
      "To spy the spectacle, wait for clear skies to get dark and then go outside, ideally away from bright city lights. Taking a picture with a smartphone camera may also reveal hints of the aurora that aren\u2019t visible to the naked eye.",
      "The sun is currently at the maximum phase of its 11-year cycle, making solar surges and northern lights more frequent. Earlier this week, the sun shot a pulse of high-energy plasma towards Earth.",

      "President-elect Donald Trump will return to power next year with a raft of technological tools at his disposal that would help deliver his campaign promise of cracking down on immigration \u2014 among them, surveillance and artificial intelligence technolog...",
      "President-elect Donald Trump will return to power next year with a raft of technological tools at his disposal that would help deliver his campaign promise of cracking down on immigration \u2014 among them, surveillance and artificial intelligence technology that the Biden administration already uses to help make crucial decisions in tracking, detaining and ultimately deporting immigrants lacking permanent legal status.",
      "While immigration officials have used the tech for years, an October letter from the Department of Homeland Security obtained exclusively by The Associated Press details how those tools \u2014 some of them powered by AI \u2014 help make decisions over whether an immigrant should be detained or surveilled.",
      "One algorithm, for example, ranks immigrants with a \u201cHurricane Score,\u201d ranging from 1-5, to assess whether someone will \u201cabscond\u201d from the agency's supervision.",
      "The letter, sent by DHS Chief Artificial Intelligence Officer Eric Hysen to the immigrant rights group Just Futures Law, revealed that the score calculates the potential risk that an immigrant \u2014 with a pending case \u2014 will fail to check in with Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers. The algorithm relies on several factors, he said, including an immigrant\u2019s number of violations and length of time in the program, and whether the person has a travel document. Hysen wrote that ICE officers consider the score, among other information, when making decisions about an immigrant\u2019s case.",
      "\u201cThe Hurricane Score does not make decisions on detention, deportation, or surveillance; instead, it is used to inform human decision-making,\u201d Hysen wrote.",
      "Also included in the government\u2019s tool kit is a mobile app called SmartLINK that uses facial matching and can track an immigrant\u2019s specific location.",
      "Nearly 200,000 people without legal status who are in removal proceedings are enrolled in the Alternatives to Detention program, under which certain immigrants can live in the U.S. while their immigration cases are pending.",
      "In exchange, SmartLINK and GPS trackers used by ICE rigorously surveil them and their movements. The phone application draws on facial matching technology and geolocation data, which has been used before to find and arrest those using the app.",
      "Just Futures Law wrote to Hysen earlier this year, questioning the fairness of using an algorithm to assess whether someone is a flight risk and raising concerns over how much data SmartLINK collects. Such AI systems, which score or screen people, are used widely but remain largely unregulated even though some have been found to discriminate on race, gender or other protected traits.",
      "DHS said in an email that it is committed to ensuring that its use of AI is transparent and safeguards privacy and civil rights while avoiding biases. The agency said it is working to implement the Biden administration\u2019s requirements on using AI, but Hysen said in his letter that security officials may waive those requirements for certain uses. Trump has publicly vowed to repeal Biden's AI policy when he returns to the White House in January.",
      "\u201cDHS uses AI to assist our personnel in their work, but DHS does not use the outputs of AI systems as the sole basis for any law enforcement action or denial of benefits,\u201d a spokesperson for DHS told the AP.",
      "Trump has not revealed how he plans to carry out his promised deportation of an estimated 11 million people living in the country illegally. Although he has proposed invoking wartime powers, as well as military involvement, the plan would face major logistical challenges \u2014 such as where to keep those who have been detained and how to find people spread across the country \u2014 that AI-powered surveillance tools could potentially address.",
      "Karoline Leavitt, a spokesperson for Trump, did not answer questions about how the incoming administration plans to use DHS\u2019 tech, but said in a statement that \u201cPresident Trump will marshal every federal and state power necessary to institute the largest deportation operation\u201d in American history.",
      "Over 100 civil society groups sent a letter on Friday urging the Office of Management and Budget to require DHS to comply with the Biden administration\u2019s guidelines. A spokesperson for OMB said that agencies must align their AI tools with the guidelines by December 1, and that any extensions or waivers of that deadline will be publicly disclosed next month.",
      "Just Futures Law\u2019s executive director, Paromita Shah, said if immigrants are scored as flight risks, they are more likely to remain in detention, \"limiting their ability to prepare a defense in their case in immigration court, which is already difficult enough as it is.\u201d",
      "SmartLINK, part of the Intensive Supervision Appearance Program, is run by BI Inc., a subsidiary of the private prison company The GEO Group. The GEO Group also contracts with ICE to run detention centers.",
      "ICE is tight-lipped about how it uses SmartLINK\u2019s location feature to find and arrest immigrants. Still, public records show that during Trump\u2019s first term in 2018, Manassas, Virginia-based employees of BI Inc. relayed immigrants\u2019 GPS locations to federal authorities, who then arrested over 40 people.",
      "In a report last year to address privacy issues and concerns, DHS said that the mobile app includes security features that \u201cprohibit access to information on the participant\u2019s mobile device, with the exception of location data points when the app is open.\u201d",
      "But the report notes that there remains a risk that data collected from people \"may be misused for unauthorized persistent monitoring.\u201d",
      "Such information could also be stored in other ICE and DHS databases and used for other DHS mission purposes, the report said.",
      "On investor calls earlier this month, private prison companies were clear-eyed about the opportunities ahead.",
      "The GEO Group\u2019s executive chairman George Christopher Zoley said that he expects the incoming Trump administration to \u201ctake a much more aggressive approach regarding border security as well as interior enforcement and to request additional funding from Congress to achieve these goals.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn GEO\u2019s ISAP program, we can scale up from the present 182,500 participants to several hundreds of thousands, or even millions of participants,\u201d Zoley said.",
      "That same day, the head of another private prison company told investors he would be watching closely to see how the new administration may change immigrant monitoring programs.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity for multiple vendors to engage ICE about the program going forward and think about creative and innovative solutions to not only get better outcomes, but also scale up the program as necessary,\u201d Damon Hininger, CEO of the private prison company CoreCivic Inc. said on an earnings call.",
      "GEO did not respond to requests for comment. In a statement, CoreCivic said that it has played \u201ca valued but limited role in America\u2019s immigration system\u201d for both Democrats and Republicans for over 40 years."

      "The Justice Department and Google made closing arguments Monday in a trial alleging Google's advertising technology constitutes an illegal monopoly.",
      "U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema in Alexandria, Virginia, will decide the case and is expected to issue a written ruling by the end of the year. If Brinkema finds Google has engaged in illegal, monopolistic conduct, she will then hold further hearings to explore what remedies should be imposed.",
      "The Justice Department, along with a coalition of states, has already said it believes Google should be forced to sell off parts of its ad tech business, which generates tens of billions of dollars annually for the Mountain View, California-based company.",
      "After roughly a month of trial testimony earlier this year, the arguments in the case remain the same.",

      "In between is another Google product, AdExchange, that conducts nearly instantaneous auctions matching advertisers to publishers.",
      "In court papers, Justice Department lawyers say Google \u201cis more concerned with acquiring and preserving its trifecta of monopolies than serving its own publisher and advertiser customers or winning on the merits.\u201d",
      "As a result, content providers and news organizations have never been able to generate the online revenue they should due to Google\u2019s excessive fees for brokering transactions between advertisers and publishers, the government says.",

      "Historically, courts have been unwilling to declare an illegal monopoly in markets in which a company holds less than a 70% market share. Google says that when online display advertising is viewed as a whole, it holds only a 10% market share, and dwindling.",
      "The Justice Department contends, though, that when focusing on open-web display advertising, Google controls 91% of the market for publisher ad servers and 87% of the market for advertiser ad networks.",
      "Google says that the \u201copen web display advertising\u201d market is gerrymandered by the Justice Department to make Google look bad, and that nobody in the industry looks at that category of ads without considering the ability of advertisers to switch to other forms of advertising, like in mobile apps.",
      "The Justice Department also contends that the public is harmed by the excessive rates Google charges to facilitate ad purchases, saying the company takes 36 cents on the dollar when it facilitates the transaction end to end.",
      "Google says its \u201ctake rate\u201d has dropped to 31% and continues to decrease, and it says that rate is lower than that of its competitors.",
      "\u201cWhen you have an integrated system, one of the benefits is lower prices,\" Google lawyer Karen Dunn said Monday.",

      "\"There's a lot more to do, but, I hope they reconsider,\" he said on Thursday.",
      "The president noted that with a thin GOP majority in Congress, there may have to be some \"real compromise\" in Trump's agenda.",

      "TORONTO -- Canada's antitrust watchdog said Thursday it is suing Google over alleged anticompetitive conduct in the tech giant\u2019s online advertising business and wants the company to sell off two of its ad tech services and pay a penalty.",
      "The Competition Bureau said that such action is necessary because an investigation into Google found that the company \u201cunlawfully\u201d tied together its ad tech tools to maintain its dominant market position.",
      "The matter is now headed for the Competition Tribunal, a quasi-judicial body that hears cases brought forward by the competition commissioner about non-compliance with the Competition Act.",
      "The bureau is asking the tribunal to order Google to sell its publisher ad server, DoubleClick for Publishers, and its ad exchange, AdX. It estimates Google holds a market share of 90% in publisher ad servers, 70% in advertiser networks, 60% in demand-side platforms and 50% in ad exchanges.",
      "This dominance, the bureau said, has discouraged competition from rivals, inhibited innovation, inflated advertising costs and reduced publisher revenues.",
      "\u201cGoogle has abused its dominant position in online advertising in Canada by engaging in conduct that locks market participants into using its own ad tech tools, excluding competitors, and distorting the competitive process,\" Matthew Boswell, Commissioner of Competition, said in a statement.",
      "Google, however, maintains the online advertising market is a highly competitive sector.",
      "Dan Taylor, Google\u2019s vice president of global ads, said in a statement that the bureau\u2019s complaint \u201cignores the intense competition where ad buyers and sellers have plenty of choice.\u201d",

      "U.S. regulators want a federal judge to break up Google to prevent the company from continuing to squash competition through its dominant search engine after a court found it had maintained an abusive monopoly over the past decade.",
      "The proposed breakup, floated in a 23-page document filed this month by the U.S. Department of Justice, calls for sweeping punishments that would include a sale of Google\u2019s industry-leading Chrome web browser and impose restrictions to prevent Android from favoring its own search engine.",

    "published": "Wed, 27 Nov 2024 14:46:24 -0500",
    "summary": "The dismissal of special counsel Jack Smith's federal election subversion case against Donald Trump leaves key questions about the extent of executive power unanswered.",
    "story": [
      "The Supreme Court's blockbuster ruling on executive power is now left untested.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court in July handed down what one justice called a \"rule for the ages\" on presidential immunity.",
      "But the dismissal of special counsel Jack Smith's federal election subversion case against Donald Trump leaves key questions about the extent of executive power unanswered.",
      "Smith's criminal prosecution was set to be the first major test of the court's blockbuster decision, in which the conservative majority held former presidents are entitled to absolute immunity for \"core\" constitutional functions and presumptive immunity for \"official\" acts but no immunity for \"unofficial\" acts.",
      "What constituted an official or unofficial act raised \"difficult questions\" said Chief Justice John Roberts, and was largely left to lower courts to parse out answers through hearings and appeals about specific facts and actions.",
      "Could Trump be held liable for alleged pressure on then-Vice President Mike Pence to unilaterally reject the 2020 election outcome? What about his false statements to the public about voter fraud?",
      "That's impossible to say for now as Smith moved to have the case dropped in the wake of Trump's 2024 win, citing long-standing Justice Department policy barring the prosecution of a sitting president. He also dropped the classified documents case against Trump.",
      "\"This uncertainty over the scope of presidential immunity raises the specter for both Trump and any future president that they truly are above criminal law,\" said David Schultz, a professor of political science and legal studies at Hamline University in Minnesota.",
      "Trump is already entering office with fewer potential checks than in his first term. Both the House and the Senate will be controlled by Republicans, making congressional oversight and impeachment two tools unlikely to be used should he be accused of crossing a traditional boundary.",
      "He will also not be subject to electoral accountability, given that this is the last term he can serve.",
      "The possibility of criminal prosecution would normally be another check, but experts aren't so sure after the Supreme Court's decision.",
      "Michael Gerhardt, a constitutional law professor at the University of North Carolina, said the immunity ruling \"will undoubtedly ensure that there will be very few, quite limited guardrails against any abuse of power.\"",
      "\"To the extent that one is concerned about that emboldening him to take action without regard to consequences of criminal prosecution, that's a real concern,\" said Jessica Roth, a professor at Cardozo School of Law and a former federal prosecutor.",
      "The Supreme Court's liberal justices raised similar fears in their dissents, but Chief Justice Roberts pushed back that the majority opinion \"does not place him above the law.\"",
      "\"Like everyone else, the President is subject to prosecution in his unofficial capacity,\" he wrote. \"But unlike anyone else, the President is a branch of government, and the Constitution vests in him sweeping powers and duties.\"",
      "U.S. District Court Judge Tanya Chutkan tossed the federal election subversion case without prejudice, meaning, in theory, the charges could be filed again when Trump leaves office. Though experts noted such a scenario is highly improbable and could run up against statute of limitations or other problems.",
      "Some immunity questions could still play out in the state cases against Trump in New York and Georgia -- but those have also stalled in recent weeks.",
      "Trump was convicted by a jury on 34 felony charges in connection to a hush money payments made just before the 2016 election. Now, he's seeking to have the case dismissed based on the U.S. Supreme Court's immunity ruling. The judge has indefinitely postponed sentencing for Trump until the issue is sorted.",
      "\"That's the place where we'd see the Supreme Court decision tested most immediately,\" said Norm Eisen, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who served as special counsel to the House Judiciary Committee during Trump's first impeachment trial.",
      "Still, Eisen said \"we will not get all the answers in the state case because it's a pretty tangential immunity claim.\"",
      "Eisen noted ongoing prosecutions against other figures involved in efforts to overturn the 2020 election could keep at least some of Trump's past behavior in the spotlight.",
      "\"[Trump] may be immune, he may be in office, but all over the country cases have been brought against the false electors,\" Eisen said. \"And those cases will proceed to trial and illuminate Trump's involvement even though he's not a defendant in those cases. That's another place where certainly there's going to be a form of public narrative about what happened, his role in it and whether he should be held accountable.\"",

      "Lawsuit says Democrats tried to scare away donors and potential candidates.",
      "As the bipartisan group No Labels attempted to field a third-party independent bid in the 2024 presidential race, several of its opponents aggressively attempted to sabotage its operations in hopes of preventing the group from moving forward, according to a lawsuit the group has filed.",
      "A lawsuit filed initially against NoLabels.com Inc. in the U.S. District Court of Delaware in December of 2023 alleges that some in the Democratic Party undertook deliberate efforts to undermine the group, ultimately forcing it to halt operations. No Labels is now seeking to recover monetary damages as a result.",
      "NoLabels.com Inc., which was created to mimic the real No Labels website \u2013 NoLabels.org, is believed to be incorporated in Delaware, according to the suit.",
      "Documents unsealed in the case allegedly show how a handful of Democratic strategists operating under the fake NoLabels.com banner attempted to use fear tactics to raise uncertainty among No Labels supporters and donors, drive skepticism in the media, and question the authenticity and scope of the centrist group. At one point, operatives even viciously targeted No Labels founder Nancy Jacobson, as well as candidates interested in serving on its \u201cUnity Ticket.\u201d",
      "One document included a business deck orchestrated by a group of political operatives called the American Patriots Project (APP) to imitate No Labels' website with the purchase of the NoLabels.com domain as well as Google search ads. According to the deck, the operatives attempted to mislead voters and paint the centrist group as Christo-nationalists and featured images of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaking on behalf of the group. The saboteurs' goal was to imply that No Labels was a right-wing shadow effort. Furthermore, the proposal attempted to falsely fixate on \u201cred meat issues\u201d such as immigration and anti-abortion messaging.",
      "U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware Judge Gregory B. Williams issued a court order for the operatives to take down the NoLabels.com website; however, No Labels believes that there were more attempts to disavow their operations.",
      "No Labels subpoenaed APP on Nov. 5 seeking to uncover more information.",
      "Democratic strategists with ties to American Bridge -- which calls itself the largest research, video tracking, and rapid response organization affiliated with the Democratic Party -- also attempted to single out donors, according to a three-step proposal in one email listed in court documents. As donors engaged in conversation, strategists would suggest that their money was being mismanaged with inefficient or wasteful spending. These strategists also attempted to misinform the media about No Labels' goals.",
      "ABC News has reached out for comment to American Bridge but has not gotten a reply.",
      "Earlier this week, No Labels leaders updated supporters on a Zoom call.",
      "\u201cWe believe in democracy in this organization, and obviously some people didn't want us to live democracy out the way we were living it,\u201d Mike Rawlings, the group's national convention chairman, told the call before tossing to Dan Webb, a No Labels board member, who updated supporters on the legal findings.",
      "Webb notified supporters that they called on the Department of Justice to look into any potential illegal conduct.",
      "\u201cI think one of the defining stories will be that it's just wrong for a group of elite donors, party operatives, media mouthpieces to actually decide that the way, the way we should protect democracy is to make sure we have less of it,\u201d Webb said.",
      "Most of the No Labels \"family members\" on the call were infuriated with the allegations and pleaded for national exposure, suggesting outlets like \u201c60 Minutes\u201d or Joe Rogan\u2019s podcast to spread awareness. Overall, the call was an opportunity for supporters to air their grievances.",
      "\u201cI agree wholeheartedly with publicizing this as much as possible, and not making it seem like it's just normal politics,\u201d one supporter said.",
      "\u201cThis is not acceptable; they've interfered with the democratic process here,\u201d another supporter added.",
      "Asked if the efforts were \u201cjust politics\u201d or \u201cdirty politics,\u201d No Labels leaders suggested it went beyond that.",
      "\u201cI'm a strong believer in the First Amendment, and political speech is absolutely protected by the First Amendment, but the law is also clear that you cannot violate the law and claim that even though you violated the law, you were just engaging in politics,\u201d Webb said.",
      "He continued, \u201cI believe we did the right thing by reporting the information to the Department of Justice, and whatever the Department of Justice decides to do, they decide to do.\u201d",
      "One supporter suggested that the scandal sounded like Watergate and questioned whether it was worth pursuing lawsuits. Another supporter told No Labels leaders to focus on the Problem Solvers Caucus in Congress and dismiss the past.",
      "\u201cWe should focus on the fact that no candidate received a majority in this election,\u201d one supporter suggested. \u201cOur need is to focus on fixing Congress. So I think we need to balance this very carefully and not focus on a way that distracts from one main issue, and casts us as being associated with the Trump administration.\u201d",
      "Back in April, the group halted its efforts when it was unable to find a candidate that had a credible path to winning with its bipartisan platform.",
      "No Labels intended to offer a different choice than the presumptive presidential nominees at that time -- incumbent President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump -- to citizens who yearned for something new instead of a repeat of the 2020 election. As they entered the race in March, they suggested their internal polling showed more than 70% of Americans said they'd be open to another option.",

      "Former President George W. Bush, who congratulated Trump a day after the election, has not commented on Trump's remarks, in keeping with a low public profile. As recently as 2021, however, Bush criticized trade barriers, lamenting the GOP under Trump as \"isolationist, protectionist.\"",
      "Trump's support for tariffs and skepticism toward global trade departs from previous Republican presidents spanning the past four decades.",
      "Presidents Ronald Reagan, George W. Bush, and his father, George H.W. Bush, each venerated free trade, though in some cases they put forward policies similar to Trump's protectionist proposals.",
      "\"Trump is not talking about free trade,\" Steve Hanke, a professor of applied economics at Johns Hopkins University and a former senior economist on the Council of Economic Advisers under Reagan. \"Trump's rhetoric is completely different.\"",

      "\"In his first term, President Trump instituted\u00a0tariffs\u00a0against China that created jobs, spurred investment, and resulted in no inflation. President Trump will work quickly to fix and restore an economy that puts American workers by re-shoring American jobs, lowering inflation, raising real wages, lowering taxes, cutting regulations, and unshackling American energy,\" Trump transition spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said.",
      "Trump late Monday said he would charge Mexico and Canada with a 25% tariff on all products coming into the United States until action is taken by those countries to stem illegal immigration and the overflow of drugs across the border.",

      "A judge has upheld a Missouri law requiring voters to show photo identification to cast a regular ballot",
      "COLUMBIA, Mo. -- A law requiring Missouri voters to show government-issued photo identification to cast regular ballots will stand after a lower-court judge found it constitutional Tuesday.",
      "Cole County Circuit Judge Jon Beetem's decision upholds the law, which was made possible by a 2016 voter-approved constitutional amendment allowing lawmakers to enact photo ID requirements.",
      "\u201cTo maintain a secure system for voting, it only stands to reason that a photo ID should be essential,\u201d Missouri Republican Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft said in a statement praising the ruling.",
      "Voter photo ID supporters such as Ashcroft say the practice prevents voter fraud and improves public confidence in election results. Voting rights advocates say getting the records needed to obtain proper photo identification can be challenging, especially for older voters and people with disabilities.",
      "The National Conference of State Legislatures reports 36 states request or require identification to vote, of which at least 21 ask for a photo ID.",
      "Under Missouri\u2019s law, people without government-issued photo identification can cast provisional ballots to be counted if they return later that day with a photo ID or if election officials verify their signatures.",
      "The law also requires the state to provide a free photo identification card to those lacking one to vote.",
      "Missouri's NAACP and League of Women Voters, along with two individual voters, sued to overturn the law in 2022. They argued that some voters faced substantial obstacles getting up-to-date and accurate government-issued photo IDs and worried that casting a provisional ballot could put them at higher risk of having their votes not counted.",
      "Beetem initially dismissed the lawsuit, finding neither of the two individual voters \u201calleged a specific, concrete, non-speculative injury or legally protectable interest in challenging the photo ID requirement.\u201d",
      "The Missouri ACLU and Missouri Voter Protection Coalition, who sued on behalf of the plaintiffs, in response added another voter to the lawsuit and asked Beetem again to find the voter ID requirement unconstitutional.",
      "Beetem noted in his Tuesday ruling that all of the individual plaintiffs have successfully voted since the law took effect.",
      "\u201cTheir claim that their provisional ballots may be rejected is purely speculative,\u201d Beetem wrote. \u201cIn addition, the evidence at trial confirms that rejection rates for provisional ballots are low, and the rates specifically for signature-mismatch are exceedingly low.\u201d",
      "He concluded that the law's rules on photo identification \u201cprotect the fundamental right to vote by deterring difficult to detect forms of voter fraud.\"",
      "Lawyers for the plaintiffs said they will appeal Beetem's ruling.",
      "\u201cThe League believes the state should be making it easier, not harder, for Missourians to exercise their fundamental right to vote,\" Missouri League of Women Voters President Marilyn McLeod said in a statement. \"There\u2019s no evidence of voter impersonation in Missouri, so these restrictions don\u2019t make our elections any safer or more secure.\u201d",

In California's 45th Congressional District, anchored in Orange and Los Angeles Counties, Democrat Derek Tran has a roughly 600-vote lead over Republican Rep. Michelle Steel.",
      "In Iowa, GOP Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks is up by 800 votes in Iowa\u2019s 2nd Congressional District, though a recount is unlikely to change the result in the competitive district. Miller-Meeks first won her seat in 2020 by six votes.",
      "If these results hold, the House will start with a 220-215 GOP majority, even thinner than the current Congress' margin.",
      "Republican ranks, however, drop to 219 with former Rep. Matt Gaetz's resignation. It could fall further to 217 depending on the timing of the resignations of Reps. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., and Mike Waltz, R-Fla., who are set to join the Trump administration as U.S. ambassador to United Nations and national security adviser, respectively.",
      "That would send the chamber to a 217-215 margin -- giving Republicans no room for error, since any tied votes at 216-216 would fail.",
      "Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has pleaded with Trump to avoid taking any more House members for his administration.",
      "\"It's a great problem to have,\" Johnson said on Fox News earlier this month. \"We have an embarrassment of riches in the House Republican Congress. Lots of talented people who are very attuned to the America First agenda, and they can serve the country well in other capacities.\"",
      "\"But I've told President Trump, enough already, give me some relief. I have to maintain this majority. And he understands that, of course, we've been talking about it almost hourly every day,\" he added.",
      "Already, Republicans have dealt with chaos in the current Congress.",
      "Bands of hardline members have grown just large enough to block votes on bills, moves that were once viewed as beyond the pale within the halls of Congress. And, unforgettably, Republican divisions left the House without a speaker for days, both at the beginning when Kevin McCarthy was looking to get the requisite support and again after he gave up the gavel and members were torn for days before coalescing behind Johnson.",
      "Heading into the current Congress, Republicans have sought to grease the skids a little bit more to try to avoid such public brawls from happening in the future.",
      "Republicans agreed to raise the number of lawmakers needed to trigger a vote to oust a speaker from one to nine. In return, lawmakers who oppose proposals to allow votes on bills will not face retaliation.",
      "But with such a narrow margin, any one Republican could and throw the floor into chaos and block the party-line passage of key bills.",
      "One of the largest legislative items up for business is an extension of the 2017 tax cuts that Trump pushed during his first term. They're set to expire next year, and Republicans have hoped to extend them -- but 12 House Republicans voted against the 2017 GOP tax law, which only passed thanks to a larger majority at the time.",
      "In 2017, when Republicans passed a rewrite of the tax code during the first Trump administration, 12 House Republicans -- part of a larger majority at the time -- voted against the bill, but did not prevent its passage.",
      "Republicans began the 118th Congress in 2023 with 222 seats -- a 10-seat margin over 212 Democrats -- a majority that spent weeks in the winter selecting a House speaker, and a chunk of the fall selecting a replacement.",
      "A few illnesses, special election surprises, or absences could also disrupt Republicans' careful balancing act.",
      "In 1917, Republicans held the narrowest majority in history with a 215-213 edge over Democrats. But a group of minor party lawmakers worked with the minority to elect a speaker, delivering the chamber to Democrats, according to Pew.",

      "The man allegedly brandished an AR 15-style rifle in videos posted to Facebook.",
      "Federal authorities have arrested an Arizona man after he allegedly posted videos online threatening to kill President-elect Donald Trump and his family.",
      "In the videos, posted on Facebook in recent months, Manuel Tamayo-Torres issued an array of bizarre and outlandish claims about Trump, but he also apparently brandished an AR 15-style rifle and other weapons in the videos, and in August he recorded his trip to an arena in Glendale, Arizona, as Trump was holding a campaign rally there, according to charging documents filed in the case.",
      "While the charging documents only refer to Trump as \"Individual 1,\" they say Tamayo-Torres made \"vague yet direct threats\" against \"the president-elect,\" and sources familiar with the investigation separately confirmed Tamayo-Torres' alleged threats targeted Trump.",
      "\"[Y]ou're gonna die,\" Tamayo-Torres allegedly said in a video he posted on Thursday. \"[Y]our son's gonna die. Your whole family is going to die. ... I'm going to put a hole in your face.\"",
      "The clip was one of \"numerous\" rambling and curse-laden videos he's posted \"on a near-daily basis\" in recent months claiming that \"Individual 1\" kidnapped and sex-trafficked his children, according to the charging documents.",
      "It's unclear if Tamayo-Torres actually has children.",
      "Earlier in November, Tamayo-Torres allegedly posted a video threatening \"Individual 1\" while holding up \"what appears to be a white AR 15-style rifle with a 30-round magazine inserted into it,\" charging documents said.",
      "In another video, according to the charging documents, Tamayo-Torres said he witnessed \"Individual 1\" and the Secret Service kidnap his daughter. The video was posted Aug. 23 from Desert Diamond Arena in Glendale, Arizona, where Trump was holding a campaign rally that day.",
      "During the rally, Trump noted that he was \"nearly assassinated\" a month earlier, when a Pennsylvania man, Thomas Crooks, opened fire on him with an AR 15-style rifle during a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. Authorities have yet to identify a clear motive in that attack.",
      "Trump told rallygoers there are \"risks incurred by leaders who stand up to the corrupt political establishment.\"",
      "\"When you stand up, you bring on some trouble for yourself, but you have to do what's right,\" Trump said.",
      "While investigating the more recent alleged threats from Tamayo-Torres, an officer from a Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives task force found photos on Facebook that showed Tamayo-Torres holding a bullpup-style shotgun, a rifle, and the AR15-style rifle seen in one of his videos, according to charging documents.",
      "Tamayo-Torres was arrested Monday near San Diego, where he anticipated moving soon, court records indicate.",

    "published": "Wed, 27 Nov 2024 14:09:59 -0500",
    "summary": "An annual abortion surveillance report, published Wednesday by the CDC, found the number of abortions performed in the U.S. fell slightly in 2022.",
    "story": [
      "Women in their 20s accounted for more than half of abortions in 2022.",
      "The number of abortions performed in the U.S. fell slightly in 2022, the year the Supreme Court overruled Roe v. Wade, a new federal report found.",
      "In 2022, a total of 613,383 legal abortions were reported by 48 areas. Among the 47 areas that consistently reported data from 2021 to 2022, there was a decrease of 2% from the 622,108 abortions performed in 2021 to 609,360, according to the annual abortion surveillance report, published Wednesday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "The 48 areas included 46 states, the District of Columbia and New York City, excluding California, Maryland, New Hampshire and New Jersey.",
      "The abortion rate was 11.2 abortions per 1,000 women between ages 15 and 44 in 2022, a decrease of 3% from 11.6 abortions per 1,000 women the prior year, according to data from 46 states and New York City.",
      "Rates were lowest in Missouri and highest New Mexico, respectively, in 2022. After Roe v. Wade was overruled, Missouri passed a near-total abortion ban with limited exceptions while abortions remained unrestricted based on gestational duration in New Mexico. However, in 2024, Missouri voters approved an amendment enshrining the right to reproductive freedom in the state constitution, including abortion care.",
      "Dr. Adam Jacobs, medical director of the division of complex family planning at the Mount Sinai Heath System in New York, said he does not believe Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health -- the Supreme Court decision that led to Roe v. Wade's overruling -- is a major reason why abortion rates dropped between 2021 and 2022.",
      "\"Many of the bans did not go into place or a lot of the structural changes did not go into place in the calendar year of 2022, so I don't think you would see that impact in this report,\" he told ABC News.",
      "Jacobs said abortion numbers and rates have been decreasing for years, and key reasons include the Affordable Care Act. The law gives women more access to preventive services, including long-lasting reversible contraception.",
      "The report found that women in their 20s accounted for more than half of abortions in 2022 and had the highest abortion rates. Comparatively, adolescents under age 15 and women aged 40 or older accounted for the lowest percentages of abortions and had the lowest abortion rates.",
      "Between 2013 and 2022, abortion rates decreased among all age groups except for women between ages 30 and 34, for whom rates increased.",
      "When it came to breaking down the share of abortions based on gestational age, the report found that most abortions, or 78.6%, were performed at 9 weeks gestation and nearly all abortions were performed under 13 weeks gestation.",
      "More than half of abortions were early medication ones performed at or under 9 weeks gestation followed by surgical abortions at or under 13 weeks gestation.",
      "Surgical abortions performed past 13 weeks gestation accounted for just 6.9% of all abortions in 2022 and medication abortion past 9 weeks gestation accounted for 4.3%.",
      "Black women accounted for the highest percentage of abortions at 39.5% followed by white women at 31.9% and Hispanic women at 21.2%, according to the report.",
      "Black women had the highest rate at 24.4 abortions per 1,000 women between ages 15 and 44 and white women had the lowest rate at 5.7 abortions per 1,000 women.",
      "Jacobs said that gains have been made in providing care to marginalized groups, but factors including unequal access to quality family planning services may be why abortion rates are higher for Black women compared to white women.",
      "\"If you have access to highly effective contraception, you end up having [fewer] unintended pregnancies,\" he said.",
      "For 2022, 87.7% of abortions were among unmarried women compared to 12.3% among married women, the report found.",
      "Additionally, a plurality of abortions, or 40.6%, were among women who had never had a previous live birth, and a majority, or 56.1%, were among those who had never received an abortion before.",
      "In 2021, the most recent year for which data from the CDC's Pregnancy Mortality Surveillance System were reviewed, five women died because of complications from legally induced abortions.",
      "As of Wednesday, 13 states have ceased nearly all abortion services and four states have enacted six-week bans, according to an ABC News tally. Meanwhile, nine states and the District of Columbia have no restrictions based on gestational duration.",

    "summary": "Named to lead the nation\u2019s sprawling Department of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has big ideas for busting public health policy norms.",
    "story": [
      "\"Make America Healthy Again\" would collide with Washington bureaucracy.",
      "Named to lead the nation's sprawling Department of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has big ideas for busting public health policy norms.",
      "His Senate confirmation hearings -- should they happen -- will come with lots of questions about what Kennedy's ideas would look like in practice.",
      "His new role would mean relinquishing his outsider critic status and working from within a massive government system, leading an agency of 80,000 employees and dealing with everything from drug approvals to food recalls to the pandemic response.",
      "So, what happens when his motto \"Make America Healthy Again\" collides with one of Washington's largest government bureaucracies?",
      "\"He seems very clear on what it is he wants to get done. I'm just not sure he has an understanding of what it will take to get that done,\" said one former senior HHS official who worked in the Biden administration.",
      "On vaccines, President-elect Donald Trump's picks of Johns Hopkins University professor Marty Makary to lead the Food and Drug Administration, former GOP Rep. Dave Weldon to head the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Dr. Janette Nesheiwat as surgeon general certainly add to Kennedy's ability to make changes -- if they're confirmed by the Senate.",
      "Both Makary and Weldon have raised questions about vaccine side effects, although they've also at times been supportive overall of the role vaccines play in public health. Kennedy himself has falsely claimed that vaccines cause autism, which has been debunked by numerous studies.",
      "In their new positions, Makary, Weldon and Kennedy would have the power to select the experts who sit on important FDA and CDC advisory panels. Those panels play a key role in vaccine recommendations and authorizations for the general public, ultimately creating public health guidance for years to come.",
      "\"I think massively, in large part, the health care community would continue to move forward on vaccines as they do now, as they are considered to be one of the massive successes of public health in the last 100 years. And I don't think that would change,\" said Tom Inglesby, a former senior adviser to HHS and the White House during COVID-19 during the Biden administration.",
      "\"But what could change is potentially the cost of vaccines, the access to vaccines, guidance around new vaccines that might come online, and also confusion around public messaging from the federal government about safety and effectiveness of vaccines,\" Inglesby said.",
      "When it comes to chemicals and the food Americans consume, it's less clear how Kennedy could make changes at HHS, as opposed to the Environmental Protection Agency or the Department of Agriculture, which have more oversight of areas such as water fluoridation, which Kennedy opposes, or school lunches, which he says he wants to make healthier. He has said, however, that he would gut the entire nutrition department at the FDA.",
      "Kennedy could also move around funding -- he's said he'd deprioritize infectious disease research in favor of chronic illness research, for example. As avian flu cases continue to rise -- raising concerns about a new pandemic -- public health experts and former government officials have pushed back strongly on that idea.",
      "But he has also called for restrictions on food additives, dyes and ultra-processed foods, something he could have direct influence over through the FDA, which determines safe thresholds for the \"Acceptable Daily Intake\" on substances.",
      "Kennedy has generally received a more cautious welcome from the public health community regarding his focus on healthy food.",
      "\"There are some things here that are worth working on. You know, if we're looking at the school lunch program in America, 30 million children get more than half of their calories from that program. It would be a wonderful thing to make that the best school lunch program possible,\" said Dr. Richard Besser, former CDC acting director.",
      "But many public health experts are also wary of giving Kennedy credit, for fear it could lend credibility to other false information he promotes. He advocates drinking raw milk, for example, even though the pasteurization process kills off bacteria that can cause serious illness, including the fast-spreading avian flu.",
      "\"One of the dangerous things about RFK Jr. is that there are bits of things he says that are true, and they're mixed in. And it makes it really hard to sort out what things you should follow because they're based on fact, and which things are not,\" Besser told ABC News, where he was former chief health and medical editor.",
      "Experts also question Kennedy's ability to counter powerful Washington lobbies -- one of his stated main goals -- in a Trump administration focused on working with big business on deregulating industries.",
      "Another area where Kennedy could be out of line with the Trump administration is abortion access. Kennedy has said he supports legal abortion access until fetal viability (despite an earlier comment on the campaign trail that he later walked back about supporting a 15-week ban) and that such decisions should be up to women.",
      "Many abortion rights advocates still expect the Trump administration to quickly move to rescind protections and halt legal fights the Biden administration initiated after the fall of Roe v. Wade -- but are hopeful that Kennedy and the broader administration would not attempt sweeping bans.",
      "\"[Trump's] obviously waffled on this and other issues a thousand times so I'm not going to trust every word he says, but I do think there's the possibility that he and his administration has seen that actually, abortion access is very popular,\" said Katie O'Connor, senior director of abortion policy at the National Women's Law Center.",
      "\"We have seen that over the past three elections, and there could be pushback if this administration does something to further restrict abortion access.\"",
      "There are certainly members of Trump's orbit who would support broader restrictions on abortion, but Trump himself has said he would not sign a federal ban if Congress passed one.",
      "Some of the policies O'Connor expects to see rolled back would include the Pentagon paying for service members who need to cross state lines to get an abortion because of where they were stationed, as well as expanded access to abortion pills through telemedicine.",
      "As HHS secretary, Kennedy could undo these rules and also build on the first Trump administration's efforts. He could expand protections for health care providers who don't want to perform abortion procedures, allowing more providers to deny care, and make it more difficult for private insurers to cover abortion, leaving it more expensive for patients, O'Connor said.",
      "Large-scale bans, were they executed, would focus on removing access to the medication abortion pill called mifepristone, either by attempting to take medication abortion off the market by way of the FDA approval process, or employing a very old law called the Comstock Act to prohibit the pills from being mailed.",
      "\"I do hold out hope that this administration doesn't want to expand political capital on abortion,\" O'Connor said.",

      "But it's been making an outsized impression in national politics. Even after its historic flip from blue to red, a century in the making, it's continued to garner headlines.",
      "Last week, Texas Land Commissioner Dawn Buckingham offered up 1,402 acres of Starr County to facilitate President-elect Donald Trump's mass deportation plans.",
      "In a letter to Trump dated Nov. 19, Buckingham said she's offering the land, located along the border of Mexico, \"to be used to construct deportation facilities.\"",
      "She has also proposed alternative uses for it, including as a site for detention centers.",
      "\"Now it's essentially farmland, so it's flat, it's easy to build on. We can very easily put a detention center on there -- a holding place as we get these criminals out of our country,\" Buckingham said in a recent interview with Fox News.",
      "The land, which Buckingham declared property of the state in 2023, adds to another parcel previously owned by the Texas General Land Office, bringing the southern border acreage that it controls in Starr County up to 4,000.",
      "ABC News' Mireya Villarreal visited Starr County to ask residents what issues and values most influenced them to vote for Republican candidates this year, instead of upholding their century-long blue streak.",
      "\"The economy is just driving, I think, everybody crazy,\" said Becky Garza, the owner of Texas Cafe in Rio Grande City, the largest city in Starr County.",
      "She explained that she used to complain about buying a box of eggs for $10, and now they're $20.",
      "\"If things don't get better, I might have to either cut staff, cut hours, or I'm going to start with cutting hours and then from there work it, maybe cut down, maybe cut the menu, you know, to keep the place open, you know, because I don't want to lose my my customers,\" Garza said.",
      "And she doesn't think she's the only one who's making those kinds of hard decisions, she told ABC News.",
      "Jaime Escobar, the mayor of neighboring Roma, another city of Starr County, agrees. He suggested that residents are more influenced by the local economy than what's being said in Washington, D.C.",
      "\"We no longer want to be considered just a poor community because we're rich culturally,\" he told ABC News. \"We're proud of our Mexican-American heritage, but we don't -- no longer want to be dependent just on the government.\"",
      "But with D.C. being invited into their backyard, it's bound to bring the topic of migration and deportation to the forefront -- even for those who may not have prioritized the issue during the election cycle.",
      "Asked about how people might respond to a detention facility in nearby Starr County, Escobar said, \"People don't want families to be torn apart. That's the last thing we want.\"",
      "\"But at the same time,\" he added, \"we hope that Trump and his administration do the right thing and focus on the criminal element first, and then see how in the meantime, we'll see how the policies can be implemented in a better way.\"",
      "Buckingham, on the other hand, believes that \"folks who live down on the border feel really abandoned by those open border policies.\"",
      "She told ABC News, \"They feel like it's directly harming their communities, both their safety and their prosperity.\"",
      "In the same interview this week with ABC News, Buckingham also said that she would \"absolutely\" offer up even more of Texas, the way that she did Starr County.",
      "\"I have 13 million acres. If any of them can be of help in this process, we're happy to have that discussion,\" Buckingham said.",
      "Trump has said he would carry out his mass deportation plans -- a top campaign promise -- by declaring a national emergency and using \"military assets\" to deport migrants currently living in the U.S. without legal permission.",
      "He backed up his commitment with the choice of several immigration hard-liners to join his administration, including South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem for secretary of homeland security and former director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement Tom Homan as \"border czar.\" Both picks require Senate confirmation.",
      "But with an estimated 11 million people presumed to be living in the U.S. without legal immigration status, the promises have raised questions of both feasibility and cost.",
      "Removing them could cost billions of dollars per year, according to estimates from the American Immigration Council.",
      "And while Republican-friendly areas of Texas might feel compelled to support the effort, other southern border states, like Arizona and California, have already expressed their disinterest.",

      "Travel pros say there is plenty you can do ahead of time to make for a happier and less-stressful holiday journey.",
      "A week before you leave, write down things you need to bring and tasks you need to do before the trip.",
      "\u201cThis can include essential packing items, as well as simple tasks like cleaning out old food from the fridge or watering the plants,\u201d says Jess Feldman, special projects editor at Travel and Leisure magazine. \u201cThe key is to leave the list out for the entire week before you go. I cross the to-dos off throughout the week, and it helps me feel extremely prepared, lessening the stress every time.\u201d",
      "Noise-canceling headphones can go a long way toward blocking out annoyances during travel, although if you use them you should keep an eye on display boards or your phone for any flight or gate changes.",
      "Spotify, YouTube and other sites offer music playlists with names like \u201cRelaxing Chill Out Calming Music for Airports\u201d and \u201cPerfect \u2014 Music Travel Relax.\" Or try \u201cMusic for Airports,\u201d a groundbreaking album that launched the ambient music genre in 1978.",
      "It\u2019s also good to carry extra medications, a change of clothes, a toothbrush and a phone-charging cable, just in case.",
      "Bringing along some snacks or a sandwich from home can feel comforting and be a great alternative to pricey airport offerings.",
      "\u201cI tend to pack for worst-case scenarios, such as flight delays and cancellations. This includes bringing things to do of course, like more than one book, knitting materials, or a few extra downloaded movies,\u201d Feldman says. For longer journeys, she might bring a meal in a Tupperware container.",
      "To counter the dry air on flights, bring along an empty water bottle (fill it after you go through security ) and a small pouch with lip balm and travel-size moisturizers.",
      "Hallie Gould, editor in chief of Byrdie, a digital site for beauty care, recommends \u201cloading up on skin hydration before your flight. That means drinking extra fluids and applying moisturizing skin products to boost hydration, so you\u2019re covering your bases inside and out.\u201d",
      "And don\u2019t forget your hair.",
      "\u201cJust as the low humidity on the airplane is dehydrating for your skin, it can also dry out your hair. If possible, use a deep conditioner before your trip,\u201d Gould says.",
      "\u201cEvery airline has different requirements when it comes to the boarding process, paying for perks in advance, or seat upgrades,\u201d Feldman says. \u201cIt\u2019s best to understand all of the above before getting to the airport so that you are not taken off guard.\u201d",
      "Having the airline's app lets you know about gate changes, flight delays or cancellations sooner and allows you to more quickly find alternative flights or connections if needed.",
      "Security lines can be much longer \u2014 and slower \u2014 than expected, and so can the walk through a large airport. So giving yourself plenty of extra time can reduce stress. The general rule of thumb is to arrive at the airport two hours before departure for domestic flights and three hours before international flights.",
      "If you\u2019re too early, you can always explore the airport shops and lounges or settle in with a good book somewhere.",
      "\u201cI always confirm whether or not there is a lounge I have access to in my departing gate ahead of time,\u201d Feldman says. But even without lounge access, she says, \"I like to know what the restaurants and waiting areas (near) the gate are like.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you have a sense of why you are feeling stressed, it can help to figure out ways to reduce that stress,\" says Lynn F. Bufka, head of practice for the American Psychological Association. \"So if you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed, are there things that you can outsource? Is there someone in your family who can help with parts of the planning?\u201d",
      "Recognize that crowds, bad weather and canceled flights are beyond your control.",
      "And some people just don't like to travel far or to fly.",
      "\u201cIf it\u2019s fear, like fear of flying, it\u2019s important to know that it can be treated, and that treatment can really improve the quality of your life,\u201d Bufka says.",
      "A little extra time tidying your home and making sure you have some easy-to-prepare food ready in the freezer or pantry will make for a much more welcoming return.",
      "\u201cAlways, always, always clean your space before leaving for a trip. You are inevitably going to feel a bit off after a long travel day, and coming home to an unorganized space will make it so much worse,\u201d Feldman says.",
      "Wash the sheets, take out the trash, put away clothes, clean the countertops. \u201cArriving home to a neat and tidy space is the best homecoming, especially after a long time away,\u201d she says.",

      "In settling, the plaintiffs said they assign no \u201cill intent\u201d to Rose and realize now that his conduct could be subject to interpretation.",
      "Lawyers for Rose and the women \u2014 younger employees who accused him of \u201cpredatory behavior\u201d and \u201cblatant and repeated sexual harassment\u201d \u2014 filed court papers this week confirming that the lawsuit has been resolved. An online court docket listed the case as settled. The terms were not disclosed.",
      "The lawsuit had been set to go to trial Monday in Manhattan after years of sparring over the women's allegations and the dismissal of their retaliation claims against Rose.",
      "Plaintiffs Katherine Brooks Harris, Sydney McNeal and Yuqing Wei said in a statement that the litigation process and the required pretrial exchange of evidence known as discovery had enabled both sides to \"better understand each others\u2019 points of view.\"",
      "\u201cOn reflection, and after having the benefit of discovery, we realize that different people could interpret the conduct in different ways, and therefore we have resolved the claims,\u201d the women said. \"We do not assign any bad motive or ill intent to Charlie Rose.\u201d",
      "A lawyer for Rose, 82, and his production company, Charlie Rose Inc., declined comment.",
      "The veteran TV host has apologized in the past for his behavior, including in a statement on the eve of his November 2017 firing after at least eight women had come forward to accuse him of misconduct.",
      "\u201cIt is essential that these women know I hear them and I deeply apologize for my inappropriate behavior,\" Rose said. \"I am greatly embarrassed. I have behaved insensitively at times, and I accept responsibility for that, though I do not believe that all of these allegations are accurate. I always felt that I was pursuing shared feelings, even though I now realize I was mistaken.\u201d",
      "Rose\u2019s downfall was part of America\u2019s #MeToo reckoning with sexual misconduct by powerful figures \u2014 a social media-fueled movement that also took down \u201cToday\u201d host Matt Lauer and movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, among others.",
      "Rose is now hosting an interview show on YouTube where his recent guests have included author Michael Lewis and broadcaster Bob Costas.",
      "Harris, McNeal and Wei sued Rose and CBS in state court in New York in May 2018, about six months after CBS fired him as an anchor on its morning show, then called \u201cCBS This Morning,\u201d and PBS and Bloomberg Television dropped his nightly \u201cCharlie Rose Show.\u201d",
      "Harris was a broadcast associate at \u201cCBS This Morning,\u201d and she later worked as an associate producer for Rose's PBS show. McNeal was Rose's executive assistant. Wei was a news associate and later an anchor assistant for Rose at \u201cCBS This Morning.\u201d",
      "The women, all in their early 20s when they were hired, accused the much older Rose of subjecting them to repeated physical and verbal sexual harassment, including inquires about their sex lives and boasts about his own. They accused CBS of knowingly failing to prevent Rose's harassment.",
      "CBS settled in December 2018 for an undisclosed sum. The network said at the time that the women had requested the terms be kept confidential.",
      "Had the lawsuit gone to trial, Rose's lawyer said in court papers that he would challenge the credibility of Harris, McNeal and Wei's claims with evidence showing they had previously expressed little or no concern about the ex-anchor.",
      "Among the evidence, lawyer Jonathan Bach wrote in a Nov. 13 filing, were documents showing that Wei told a CBS human resources officer that she experienced nothing \u201csexually inappropriate\u201d while working for Rose and that McNeal confided in her therapist at the time that she had no personal experience of sexual harassment by Rose.",
      "Other evidence cited by Bach showed that Harris had told her therapist that any harassment by Rose was \u201cvery subtle\u201d and that she wrote to Rose two months after working for him that his interactions with her were \u201calways professional and respectful.\u201d"

      "Bolivia\u2019s highest court has approved the extradition to the United States of a former anti-narcotics chief on charges of conspiring to smuggle cocaine into the U.S. Wednesday's rare ruling, which cannot be appealed, caps the rapid downfall of Maximilia...",
      "LA PAZ, Bolivia -- Bolivia's highest court on Wednesday approved the extradition to the United States of a former anti-narcotics chief on charges of conspiring to smuggle cocaine into the U.S., a rare ruling against a top security official in the Andean nation whose relations with Washington have been strained for decades.",
      "The decision, which cannot be appealed, caps the rapid downfall of Maximiliano D\u00e1vila, 59, Bolivia's top drug cop in 2019 under former leftist President Evo Morales, the first Indigenous president of Bolivia who became a global anti-imperialist icon for kicking out the U.S. ambassador and Drug Enforcement Administration in 2008.",
      "A former police colonel, D\u00e1vila was indicted in 2022 in New York on federal charges of conspiring to import cocaine to the U.S. and possessing machine guns. The indictment accused D\u00e1vila of leveraging his position to provide top-level protection to cargo planes transporting cocaine through third countries for distribution in the U.S.",
      "The Justice and State Departments also offered a reward of up to $5 million for information leading to his conviction. D\u00e1vila official has denied the charges.",
      "Bolivia\u2019s Supreme Court of Justice announced it was granting a formal U.S. request for D\u00e1vila to be extradited on drug conspiracy charges. The U.S. State Department and Department of Justice did not publicly comment on the announcement.",
      "\u201cAfter reviewing the documentation and the corresponding evidence, it has been determined to proceed immediately with D\u00e1vila\u2019s extradition,\u201d said Marco Jaimes, the court's president.",
      "Inside Bolivia, D\u00e1vila is facing money laundering charges. Bolivian authorities arrested him in 2022 as he was allegedly fleeing to Argentina, hauling him to jail in the capital of La Paz where he now remains.",
      "D\u00e1vila led the anti-narcotics agency in Bolivia for the final nine months of Morales\u2019 14-year presidency, which ended abruptly in November 2019. The powerful former coca farmer resigned as street protests erupted after the announcement that he had won re-election to an unprecedented fourth term.",
      "The interim government of Jeanine \u00c1\u00f1ez, which took power following Morales' ouster, sacked D\u00e1vila.",
      "But he returned in 2020 under the government of President Luis Arce, Morales' former economy minister. D\u00e1vila served for a year as police commander in Bolivia's central region of Cochabamba, a key hub of the country's coca-leaf production.",
      "An extradition treaty between Bolivia and the U.S. has been in force since 1995, despite decades of uneasy relations marked by America\u2019s \u201cwar on drugs\u201d and Morales' fierce opposition as a young union leader to U.S. forcible coca eradication policies.",
      "After Morales expelled the U.S. ambassador in 2008, the Bush administration did the same and nothing has changed since.",
      "This is the second time in Bolivian history that authorities have approved the extradition to the U.S. of a senior security officer, said Saul Lara, an opposition lawmaker and ex-foreign minister.",
      "The first was in 1995, when Col. Faustino Rico Toro, a former interior minister and anti-drug chief close to brutal Bolivian dictator Luis Garcia Meza, was handed over to U.S. authorities in Miami on cocaine trafficking charges.",
      "From Bolivia, lawyers for D\u00e1vila vowed to challenge the extradition.",
      "\u201cThis is a serious violation of human rights,\u201d said defense attorney Manolo Rojas, promising that he would raise the case with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, an organ of the Organization of American States, of which the U.S. is a founding member.",
      "Bolivia's court decision comes as a fierce rivalry escalates between current President Arce and former President Morales, tearing apart the ruling Movement Toward Socialism party ahead of 2025 elections.",
      "Although Morales insists he has nothing to do with D\u00e1vila, Arce's supporters have sought to portray Wednesday's ruling against his former minister as a blow to the political career of the ex-president who seeks to run in the presidential elections next year despite a court ban.",
      "\u201cIn the United States, the former anti-drug czar will surely be able to reveal who his accomplices are. Perhaps it is Evo,\u201d said Senator Virginia Velasco, referring to Morales without elaborating."

      "WASHINGTON -- Vaping is coming before the Supreme Court next week as federal regulators ask the high court to uphold its block on sweet, flavored products following a spike in youth e-cigarette use.",
      "The Food and Drug Administration has denied more than a million marketing applications for candy- or fruit-flavored products that appeal to kids, part of a wider crackdown that advocates say helped drive down teen vaping after an \u201cepidemic level\u201d surge in 2019.",

      "Triton said the FDA had unfairly changed its requirements without enough warning.",
      "\u201cIt sort of pulls the chair out from the applicants,\u201d said Marc Scheineson, a former FDA associate commissioner and attorney who now represents other small electronic tobacco companies.",
      "The FDA was slow to regulate the now multibillion-dollar vaping market, and even years into the crackdown flavored vapes that are technically illegal nevertheless remain widely available. The agency has approved some tobacco-flavored vapes, and recently allowed its first menthol-flavored electronic cigarettes for adult smokers.",
      "The marketing refusals combined with age-limit enforcement on the federal and state levels have helped drive down youth nicotine use to its lowest level in a decade, said Dennis Henigan, vice president for legal and regulatory affairs at the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids.",
      "He says the FDA was clear in its requirements and fears a court decision that leads to wider availability for flavored vape products, which are the dominant choice among the 1.6 million high school students who still vape. \u201cWe think that would be a real harm to public health,\u201d Henigan said."

      "After weeks of plugging increasingly inviting discounts, retailers in the United States and several other countries are preparing for prime time",
      "NEW YORK -- After weeks of plugging increasingly inviting discounts, retailers in the United States and several other countries are preparing for prime time: Black Friday, the bargain bonanza that still reigns as the unofficial kickoff of the holiday shopping season even if it's lost some luster.",
      "Department stores, shopping malls and merchants \u2014 big and small \u2014 see the day after Thanksgiving as a way to energize shoppers and to get them into physical stores at a time when many gift-seekers are content to do their browsing online. There are enough traditionalists that Black Friday remains the biggest day of the year for retail foot traffic.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m excited about it,\u201d Texas resident Emily Phillips said while visiting the Galleria Dallas last week. \u201cI save up all the things that I want all year and usually try and get them around Black Friday. I prefer to shop in person because then I can try stuff on. It\u2019s a better experience.\u201d",
      "In the U.S., analysts envision a solid holiday shopping season, though perhaps not as robust as last year\u2019s, with many shoppers under financial pressure and cautious with their discretionary spending despite the easing of inflation.",
      "Retailers will be even more under the gun to get shoppers in to buy early and in bulk since there are five fewer days between Thanksgiving and Christmas this year.",
      "Mall of America, in Bloomington, Minnesota, is giving the first 200 people in line at the center's north entrance a $25 gift card. Target is offering an exclusive book devoted to Taylor Swift's Eras Tour and a bonus edition of her \u201cThe Tortured Poets Department: The Anthology\u201d album that only will be available in stores on Black Friday before customers can buy them online starting Saturday.",
      "Best Buy has introduced an extended-release version of the doorbuster, the limited-time daily discounts that for years were all the rage \u2014 and sometimes the spark for actual brawls \u2014 before the coronavirus pandemic. The nation\u2019s largest consumer electronics chain has released doorbuster deals on its app, online and in stores every Friday since Nov. 8 and plans to continue the weekly promotion through Dec. 20.",
      "\u201c(Stores) are very hungry for Black Friday to do well,\u201d Marshal Cohen, chief retail advisor at market research firm Circana, said. \u201cThey recognize that they\u2019re not going to clobber and win big growth in online because the pie has gotten so competitive. They have to find a way to win in the stores.\u201d",
      "Impulse purchases and self-gifting are a potential area for big sales growth, and business isn't going to increase without them, Cohen said. Shoppers are three times more likely to buy on impulse at a physical store than online, according to Circana research.",
      "Shoppers stepped up their spending at American retailers in October, the Commerce Department said. Although sales at auto dealers drove much of the gain, electronics and appliance stores, and bars and restaurants also saw increased purchases, a sign of healthy consumer spending.",
      "The latest quarterly results from Best Buy, Target and other retailers, however, underscored that some will have an easier time than others getting customers to part with their cash.",
      "Walmart, the nation's largest retailer, is heading into the holidays with strong momentum after ratcheting up better-than-expected fiscal third-quarter sales for toys, home goods and groceries. But Target reported sluggish quarterly sales as cautious consumers curtailed their spending on apparel and other non-essential items.",
      "Many retailers pushed holiday sales earlier in October than they did last year to help shoppers spread out their spending.",
      "Shoppers were distracted heading into this month's U.S. presidential election. Sales of general merchandise dropped 9% the two weeks ended Nov. 9, according to Circana, but have been rebounding since the election.",
      "The National Retail Federation predicted that shoppers would increase their spending in November and December by between 2.5% and 3.5% over the same period a year ago. During the 2023 holiday shopping season, spending increased 3.9% over 2022.",
      "So far this holiday season, online sales have beaten expectations, according to Adobe Digital Insights, a division of software company Adobe. U.S. consumers spent \u202f$77.4 billion online from Nov. 1 to Nov. 24, 9.6%\u202f more than during the same period last year. Adobe predicted an 8.4% increase for the full season.",
      "Despite the early sales, better bargains are coming with Black Friday, according to Adobe. Analysts consider the five-day Black Friday weekend, which includes Cyber Monday, a key barometer of shoppers\u2019 willingness to spend for the rest of the season.",
      "Vivek Pandya, the lead analyst at Adobe Digital Insights, said shoppers are paying more attention to discounts than last year, and their focus on bargain-hunting will drive what sells and when.",
      "For example, Thanksgiving Day is the best time to shop online to get the deepest discount on sporting goods, toys, furniture and appliances, according to Adobe's analysis. But Black Friday is the best time to buy TVs online. People shopping for televisions earlier in the season found discounts that averaged 10.8%, while waiting until this Friday is expected to yield 24% discounts, Adobe Digital Insights said.",
      "Cyber Monday, however, is expected to be the best time to buy clothing and gadgets like phones and computers online. Electronics discounts peaked at 10.9% off the suggested manufacturer's price between Nov. 1 and Nov. 24 but are expected to hit 30% off on Cyber Monday, Adobe said.",
      "Across the board, Black Friday weekend discounts should peak at 30% on Cyber Monday and then go down to around 15%, according to Adobe\u2019s research.",
      "For physical stores, the day after Thanksgiving is slated to again mark the busiest single shopping day of the season, according to retail technology company Sensormatic Solutions, which tracks retail foot traffic.",
      "\u201cBlack Friday is still an incredibly important day for retailers,\u201d Grant Gustafson, head of retail consulting and analytics at Sensormatic, said. \u201cIt\u2019s important for them to be able to get shoppers into their store to show them that experience of what it\u2019s like to browse and touch and feel items. It also can be a bellwether for retailers on what to expect for the rest of the holiday season.\u201d",
      "Mall of America hopes to surpass the 12,000 shoppers it saw last year within the first hour of its 7 a.m. opening.",
      "\u201cPeople come to get the deals, but more importantly, they come for the excitement, the energy, the traditions surrounding Black Friday,\u201d Jill Renslow, the mall's chief business development and marketing officer, said."

      "Online court records did not list a lawyer representing Craig as of Thursday. A judge allowed Craig's latest lawyer, Harvey Steinberg, to withdraw from the case Nov. 21, after he cited a professional conflict, just as Craig was about to stand trial for first-degree murder in the death of Angela Craig.

      "Angela Craig, 43, died in March 2023 of poisoning from cyanide and tetrahydrozoline, the latter a substance found in over-the-counter eye drops, according to the coroner. The couple had been married for 23 years and had six children together.",

Craig's original defense team pointed out that the inmate only contacted authorities after an initial hearing to review the evidence in the case, which was widely covered by the media.",
      "Prosecutors also allege Craig tried a more elaborate and convoluted approach to put the blame on his wife. In court documents, they said he asked another former fellow inmate to find attractive women who would agree to testify at his trial that they had affairs with him and, after Angela Craig found out, they had refused to help her frame him."

      "Inglewood Oil Field owner Sentinel Peak argues in the lawsuit, filed this week, that the law, which was signed in September by Gov. Gavin Newsom, is unconstitutional, the Los Angeles Times reported Thursday.",
      "It is was one of several laws aiming to reduce pollution by giving local governments more authority to restrict oil and gas operations by shutting down so-called idle wells, which are not in use but have not been properly sealed and closed, and fining companies for operating low-producing oil wells in the Inglewood field.",
      "The 1,000-acre area southwest of downtown Los Angeles has approximately 820 unplugged wells, including 420 that are actively pumping. Roughly 80% of the operating wells are considered low-producing, meaning they yield less than 15 barrels of oil or 60,000 cubic feet of gas per day, the newspaper reported.",
      "Attorneys for Sentinel Peak argue that the law \u201crepresents an illegal attempt to coerce an individual company to stop operation of its legal business,\u201d according to court documents. They allege that mandatory fines, in particular, violate federal and state laws forbidding excessive fines.",

      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum says she is confident that a tariff war with the United States can be averted",
      "MEXICO CITY -- Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Thursday she is confident that a tariff war with the United States can be averted.",
      "But her statement \u2014 the day after she held a phone call with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump \u2014 did not make clear who had offered what.",
      "\u201cThere will be no potential tariff war,\u201d Sheinbaum said flatly when asked about the issue at her daily morning news briefing.",
      "On Wednesday, Trump wrote that Sheinbaum had agreed to stop unauthorized migration across the border into the United States. She wrote on her social media accounts the same day that \u201cmigrants and caravans are taken care of before they reach the border.\u201d",
      "But whether that constituted a promise, a pledge or a simple statement of reality remains unclear. In recent years, migrants who have been unable to obtain permission to cross Mexico have joined together in caravans to walk or hitchhike north toward the U.S. border, seeking safety in numbers.",
      "In fact, apart from the first caravans in 2018 and 2019 \u2014 which were provided buses to ride part of the way north \u2014 no caravan has ever reached the border walking or hitchhiking in any cohesive way.",
      "For years, migrant caravans have often been blocked, harassed or prevented from hitching rides by Mexican police and migration agents. They have also frequently been rounded up or returned to areas near the Guatemalan border. So, Sheinbaum's statement appears to reflect a reality that has been true for some time.",
      "U.S. President Joe Biden on Thursday said he hoped Trump would rethink his plan to impose tariffs on Mexico and Canada, saying it could \u201cscrew up\u201d relationships with close allies.",
      "\u201cI hope he rethinks it. I think it\u2019s a counterproductive thing to do,\u201d he told reporters in Nantucket, Massachusetts.",
      "Trump had earlier threatened to impose 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada until those countries satisfactorily stop illegal immigration and the flow of illegal drugs such as fentanyl into the United States. He also said Chinese imports would face additional tariffs of 10% until Beijing cracks down on the production of materials used in making fentanyl.",
      "Despite Sheinbaum's confidence \u2014 she described the phone conversation with Trump as \u201cexcellent\" \u2014 many Mexicans worry that U.S. tariffs could affect a wide range of iconic Mexican products and threaten entire regional economies.",
      "In western Mexico, no crop supplies an income for so many small growers as avocados, and Mexico is the main supplier of the fruit for the U.S. market. But avocado growers, pickers and packers worry that U.S. consumers, faced with 25% higher prices, may just skip the guacamole.",
      "And earlier this week, Sheinbaum said Mexico was preparing a list of retaliatory tariffs if Trump went ahead with his plans for import duties.",
      "If Mexico, Canada and China faced the additional tariffs proposed by Trump on all goods imported to the United States, that could be roughly equal to $266 billion in tax collections, a number that does not assume any disruptions in trade or retaliatory moves by other countries.",
      "The cost of those taxes would likely be borne by U.S. families, importers and domestic and foreign companies in the form of higher prices or lower profits.",

      "Best Buy has introduced an extended-release version of the doorbuster, the limited-time daily discounts that for years were all the rage \u2014 and sometimes the spark for actual brawls. The nation\u2019s largest consumer electronics chain has released doorbuster deals every Friday since Nov. 8 and plans to continue the weekly promotion through Dec. 20.",
      "\u201c(Stores) are very hungry for Black Friday to do well,\u201d Marshal Cohen, chief retail advisor at market research firm Circana, said. \u201cThey recognize that they\u2019re not going to clobber and win big growth in online because the pie has gotten so competitive. They have to find a way to win in the stores.\u201d",
      "Impulse purchases and self-gifting are a potential area for big sales growth, and business isn't going to increase without them, Cohen said. Shoppers are three times more likely to buy on impulse at a physical store than online, according to Circana research.",
      "The National Retail Federation predicted that shoppers would increase their spending in November and December by between 2.5% and 3.5% over the same period a year ago. During the 2023 holiday shopping season, spending increased 3.9% over 2022.",
      "So far this holiday season, online sales have beaten expectations, according to Adobe Digital Insights, a division of software company Adobe. U.S. consumers spent \u202f$77.4 billion online from Nov. 1 to Nov. 24, 9.6%\u202f more than during the same period last year. Adobe predicted an 8.4% increase for the full season.",
      "Despite the early sales, better bargains are coming with Black Friday, according to Adobe. Analysts consider the five-day Black Friday weekend, which includes Cyber Monday, a key barometer of shoppers\u2019 willingness to spend for the rest of the season.",
      "Vivek Pandya, the lead analyst at Adobe Digital Insights, said shoppers are paying more attention to discounts than last year, and their focus on bargain-hunting will drive what sells and when.",
      "For example, Thanksgiving Day is the best time to shop online to get the deepest discount on sporting goods, toys, furniture and appliances, according to Adobe's analysis. But Black Friday is the best time to buy TVs online. People shopping for televisions earlier in the season found discounts that averaged 10.8%, while waiting until this Friday is expected to yield 24% discounts, Adobe Digital Insights said.",
      "Cyber Monday, however, is expected to be the best time to buy clothing and gadgets like phones and computers online. Electronics discounts peaked at 10.9% off the suggested manufacturer's price between Nov. 1 and Nov. 24 but are expected to hit 30% off on Cyber Monday, Adobe said.",
      "Across the board, Black Friday weekend discounts should peak at 30% on Cyber Monday and then go down to around 15%, according to Adobe\u2019s research."

    "story": [
      "When Kamala Harris and Donald Trump campaigned in North Carolina, both candidates courted a state-recognized tribe there whose 55,000 members could have helped tip the swing state",
      "OKLAHOMA CITY -- When Kamala Harris and Donald Trump campaigned in North Carolina, both candidates courted a state-recognized tribe there whose 55,000 members could have helped tip the swing state.",
      "Trump in September promised that he would sign legislation to grant federal recognition to the Lumbee Tribe, a distinction that would unlock access to federal funds. He ultimately won North Carolina by more than 3 percentage points, in part due to continued support from Lumbee voters.",
      "Now, as Trump prepares to return to the White House in January, the promise will be put to the test. He has Republican allies in Congress on the issue, and now the Lumbee, as well as tribal nations across the country, are watching closely to see what comes next.",
      "Tribal nations typically receive federal recognition through an application with the Department of the Interior, but the Lumbee have been trying for many years to circumvent that process by going through Congress. Chairman John Lowery called Interior\u2019s application process \u201cflawed\u201d and overly lengthy and said it should be up to Congress to right what he calls a historic wrong.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just crazy that we\u2019re sitting here fighting this battle, and I have to tell you that I am real in 2024,\u201d Lowery said.",
      "Following the presidential election, the Lumbee hope there will be momentum behind their cause, but they face deep-rooted opposition from tribal nations across the country.",
      "Several tribes, including the only one that is federally recognized in North Carolina, argue that if the Lumbee Tribe wants federal acknowledgment, it should go through the formal process in the Department of the Interior. One person familiar with Trump's thinking said the president-elect will require the Lumbee Tribe to do just that, and he won't sign a Lumbee recognition bill. The person requested anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly speak about Trump's views.",
      "Trump's spokeswoman, Karoline Leavitt, said \"no policy should be deemed official unless it comes directly from President Trump.\u201d",
      "Federal recognition is of enormous importance, as it comes with access to resources like healthcare through Indian Health Services and the ability to create a land base such as reservations through the land-to-trust process. But before that happens, a tribal nation has to file a successful application with the Office of Federal Acknowledgement, a department within the Interior.",
      "The Lumbee Tribe has applied for federal recognition, but that petition was denied in 1985 because it \u201ccould not establish the group\u2019s descendency either culturally, politically, or genealogically from any tribe which existed historically in the area.\u201d",
      "In 2016, the Interior reversed a decision barring the Lumbee Tribe from reapplying, but the Lumbee have opted for the congressional route.",
      "Gaining federal recognition through legislation is a rare but not unheard of path. But the Lumbee's approach has stoked a simmering debate in both Indian Country and Congress about Indigenous identity and tribal nationhood.",
      "Members of Congress from both parties have supported recognizing the Lumbee through legislation, including Oklahoma Republican Sen. Markwayne Mullin, a member of the Cherokee Nation who campaigned for Trump in North Carolina and backed the legislation.",
      "But perhaps the state-recognized tribe\u2019s most ardent ally in Congress is North Carolina Republican Sen. Thom Tillis, who is up for reelection in 2026.",
      "Tillis introduced the Lumbee Fairness Act last year and has been a vocal supporter of the Lumbee. In interviews with The Associated Press, several tribal leaders, lobbyists, and advocates said they were told by Tillis directly or by his staff that the senator is currently and will continue to block certain bills backed by tribal nations unless the leaders of those tribes support the Lumbee.",
      "One of the bills he's promised to block, according to those interviewed by the AP, is a land transfer that would allow the Tennessee Valley Authority to return 70 acres of land to the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, the only federally recognized tribal nation in Tillis\u2019s state. It would allow the tribe to put the land in Monroe County, Tennessee into trust. The plot is part of the tribal nation\u2019s homelands and contains the birthplace of Sequoyah.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s appalling to me. It\u2019s disgraceful,\u201d Principal Chief of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians Michell Hicks said. He said that Tillis told him earlier this year that he would stop any legislation dealing with the Eastern Band unless Hicks pledged his support.",
      "Hicks is among the tribal leaders who question the validity of the Lumbee\u2019s historical claims, and he said that is out of the question. At one point about a century ago, the Lumbee were known as the Cherokee Indians of Robeson County, and for many years now all three Cherokee tribes \u2014 the Eastern Band, the Cherokee Nation, and the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians \u2014 have denounced this and been vocal opponents of granting the Lumbee federal recognition.",
      "Representatives for Tillis declined to comment.",
      "Tillis held up legislation last week that would have allowed for the preservation of the site of the Wounded Knee massacre. While doing so, he singled out the heads of the Oglala Sioux Tribe and the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, who have backed the preservation measure, for not supporting his efforts to federally recognize the Lumbee.",
      "\u201cThis is not about you,\u201d Tillis said to the two tribal nations, who he acknowledged had been trying for a century to preserve the site of the massacre. \u201cBut you need to know that your leadership is playing a game that will ultimately force me to take a position.\u201d",
      "Tillis suggested it was a \u201ccasino cartel\u201d in part driven by the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians and an Osage attorney named Wilson Pipestem working for the tribe, that is trying to keep the Lumbee from gaining recognition, which could one day lead to the Lumbee opening their own casinos. Tillis threatened to continue publicly naming tribal leaders and their employees who he felt were standing in the way of his bill.",
      "In a statement to the AP, Pipestem said Tillis should \u201capologize to the Tribal leaders for his false allegations and unscrupulous tactics.\u201d",
      "Lowery acknowledged that Tillis has held up both pieces of legislation, but he said that Tillis has not done so at the direction of the Lumbee.",
      "\u201cIf he\u2019s put a hold on the bill it\u2019s because he reached out to tribal leaders to see where they stand on his bill, and they apparently have told him that they\u2019re not in support,\u201d Lowery said. \u201cSo, he said \u2018well, if you can\u2019t be supportive of my bill, I can\u2019t be supportive of your bill.\u2019\u201d",

      "Thirty-seven gold coins, stolen by salvagers from a nearly 310-year-old shipwreck off of Florida's coast, have been recovered by authorities, the state's Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission announced this week.",
      "The recovery \"marks a major milestone in a long-standing investigation\u201d into the theft and illegal trafficking of such historical artifacts, the agency said in a news release on Tuesday. The coins have an estimated combined value of more than $1 million.",
      "Authorities say that in 2015, there were 101 gold coins salvaged from the 1715 Fleet \u2014 a collection of Spanish treasure-laden ships that sank during a hurricane off of Florida's central coast.",
      "While 51 of these coins were \u201creported correctly and adjudicated,\u201d 50 coins were not disclosed and were subsequently stolen, Florida authorities say.",
      "Investigations revealed the illegal sale of the coins in 2023 and 2024. Using search warrants, authorities recovered the coins from private residences, safe deposit boxes and auctions.",

      "As required by state and federal law, the recovered artifacts will be returned to their \u201crightful custodians.\u201d Additional information on who the \u201crightful custodian\u201d of the coins is was not immediately available.",

      "President-elect Donald Trump is declaring a win on stopping illegal immigration through Mexico after talking with that country\u2019s leader",
      "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- President-elect Donald Trump declared a win on stopping illegal immigration through Mexico on Wednesday after talking with that country\u2019s leader. But Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum suggested Mexico was already doing its part and had no interest in closing its borders.",
      "The two spoke just days after Trump threatened to impose sweeping new tariffs on Canada and Mexico as part of his effort to crack down on illegal immigration and drugs.",
      "Trump said Sheinbaum \u201cagreed to stop Migration through Mexico.\" Sheinbaum indicated separately on social media that she told Trump that Mexico is already \u201ctaking care of\u201d migrant caravans, calling it an \u201cexcellent conversation.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe reiterate that Mexico\u2019s position is not to close borders but to build bridges between governments and between peoples,\u201d Sheinbaum added.",
      "While the state of the proposed tariffs remained unclear, Trump said in a post on his Truth Social account that this was \u201ceffectively closing our Southern Border.\u201d He called it a \u201cvery productive conversation.\u201d",
      "The exchange between the two leaders appeared to confirm for Trump the value of threatening to disrupt trade with import taxes. His initial social media post moved financial markets and gave him a response he was quick to describe as a win. Even if the proposed tariffs fail to materialize, Trump can tell supporters that the mere possibility of them is an effective policy tool and continue to rely on tariff threats.",
      "Sheinbaum wrote on social media that the leaders \u201cdiscussed Mexico\u2019s strategy on migration issues, and I told him the caravans are not reaching the northern (U.S.) border, because Mexico is taking care of them.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe also talked about reinforcing cooperation on security issues, within the framework of our sovereignty, and the campaign we are carrying out to prevent fentanyl consumption,\" she said.",
      "Illegal migration across the Mexico border is down in part because the Biden administration secured some stepped-up cooperation from Mexico \u2014 the sort Trump seems to be celebrating.",
      "Arrivals at the U.S.-Mexico border have dropped 40% from an all-time high in December. U.S. officials mostly credit Mexican vigilance around rail yards and highway checkpoints.",
      "Driven by mounting pressure from the U.S. to block migrants going north, in the past few years Mexican authorities have turned to rounding them up across the country and sending them to southern Mexico, in a strategy seen by experts as an attempt to wear migrants out until they give up.",
      "Neither side clarified the status of the tariffs. But their implementation could fuel higher prices and slow economic growth, potentially blowing up the trade agreement among the U.S., Canada and Mexico that was finalized in 2020 during Trump's previous time in the White House.",
      "Trump on Monday said he would impose a 25% tax on all products entering the country from Canada and Mexico as one of his first executive orders upon taking office on Jan. 20. He also proposed an additional 10% tariff on China tied to its exporting of materials used in the production of fentanyl.",
      "In announcing his plans, he railed against the flow of fentanyl and migrants crossing into the U.S. illegally, even though southern border apprehensions have been hovering near four-year lows.",
      "On Wednesday, Trump also posted that he plans a large scale ad campaign to explain \u201chow bad Fentanyl is for people to use,\u201d predicting it would educate people on \u201chow really bad the horror of this Drug is.\u201d",
      "The dangerously powerful opioid was developed to treat intense pain from ailments like cancer but has increasingly been mixed with other drugs in the illicit drug supply.",

      "A Vermont family who lost their home, cars, barn and most of their possessions in flooding in July will be getting a new start thanks to scores of donations to an online fundraising effort",
      "PEACHAM, Vt. -- The last thing John and Jenny Mackenzie saw as they fled their Vermont home with their daughters, dog and two guinea pigs last summer was their cars upended and propelled away by rushing flood waters.",
      "Minutes earlier they had abandoned their 19th-century wood-frame house as the remnants of Hurricane Beryl turned it into an island engulfed by surging flood waters, with trees slamming into it and water gushing at colossal speed into the basement and first floor.",
      "\u201cIt was just like it was a horror movie at that point,\u201d John Mackenzie said of the surreal scene on that July 10 night.",
      "\u201cWe lost both of our vehicles, our home and our barn and at least half of our possessions,\u201d Jenny Mackenzie said.",
      "Since that terrifying storm when two people died swept away in vehicles, the Mackenzies, both teachers, and their twin daughters have been living temporarily in a friend's house. They have scrambled to figure out something permanent, a daunting task in a state with a housing shortage and when government programs to buy out flood-destroyed homes can take a year or more and are not guaranteed.",
      "But four months after the devastating loss, the family is writing a new chapter.",
      "Donations from friends, family and others in their community have helped the Mackenzies find a new house in time for Thanksgiving, giving them hope amid ongoing challenges. The Associated Press is following them through their recovery.",
      "The Mackenzies quickly learned how much support they had.",
      "Two days after the storm, dozens of volunteers showed up to help salvage what they could. Floodwaters had reduced the lawn to a muddy chasm; their septic system was destroyed.",
      "In the rain, volunteers carried furniture and other belongings across a gulch to waiting all-terrain vehicles, which drove them on dirt roads to the village where the family is staying.",
      "Friends set up an online fundraising page that has raised over $160,000. Over 950 donations have come in, some from former students, ranging from $5 to $10,000.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable the way that we were supported and we\u2019ve been trying to find ways to communicate that gratitude,\u201d said John Mackenzie, 49.",
      "The donations allowed them to buy used vehicles, keep teaching and carry on with life, his 50-year-old wife said. As much as the money, it means a lot that people were thinking about them, she said.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make them whole, all of the damage that they experienced, but yes that\u2019s an amazing amount and I think it speaks to the community that\u2019s around them and how well loved they are,\u201d said Cara Robechek, who helped start the fundraising effort.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re both teachers. They are sort of deeply embedded in a lot of communities.\u201d",
      "The Mackenzies owned their two-story house, built in 1840 with clapboard siding painted sage green, for 21 years. They raised their 16-year-old daughters, Lila and Kate, there.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re already aware that for us losing the home after 21 years is huge but this is the only home they ever knew,\u201d John Mackenzie said of their girls. \u201cWe want to recreate a new home.\u201d",
      "The Mackenzies applied for a buyout and wanted to stay in Peacham, but housing costs in the town of 700 have soared and are out of reach, they said.",
      "As of this fall, about 250 households have applied for buyouts, most both federally and state funded, from the severe flooding in early July and later that month that hit parts of central and northern Vermont, according to the state.",
      "Once a buyout application is complete, it can sit in review with the Federal Emergency Management Agency for up to a year, said Stephanie Smith, the state hazard mitigation officer with Vermont Emergency Management.",
      "The Mackenzies got another setback last week when they learned their property may not be eligible for a FEMA buyout, although Smith said Monday the state is working to make it eligible. The Mackenzies have to provide more detailed information, including receipts from repair work done after a previous flood. But they lost much of that paperwork in this summer's storm, Jenny Mackenzie said.",
      "If FEMA funding falls through, Smith said the state will review the Mackenzies' case for a state buyout program early next year.",
      "\u201cThe reality is that we won\u2019t be able to afford to stay in this house that we\u2019ve bought unless that buyout goes through,\u201d Jenny Mackenzie said.",
      "The flooding came exactly a year after catastrophic floods hit areas of rural, mountainous Vermont, including the capital, Montpelier. Some northern communities were pummeled twice by the severe flash flooding this July.",
      "Experts say Vermont could see more frequent catastrophic events like these, with climate change fueling stronger storms and striking Vermont villages situated along the Green Mountains' rivers and streams.",
      "Unable to find an affordable house in Peacham, the Mackenzies made the difficult decision to look elsewhere. In late September, they put down an offer on a house in Craftsbury, about 30 miles away. The commute to St. Johnsbury Academy where they both teach English and their daughters go to school is about 50 minutes compared to the 20 minutes they used to drive. They plan to move in mid-winter.",
      "The white clapboard farmhouse with a red door \u2014 also built in 1840 \u2014 reminds them of their Peacham home.",
      "After the sale closed, Jenny Mackenzie bought a trowel \u2014 \u201cI didn't have one anymore,\u201d she said \u2014 and planted about 100 daffodils that a friend rescued from the family's flooded house. Another friend gave her more. Jenny Mackenzie usually plants 500 a year.",
      "\u201cIt felt good to get in a few because that will really make us feel like home,\" she said as their German shorthaired pointer, Hester, ran around her new grounds.",
      "A friend is reupholstering their flood-damaged rocking chairs and couch. The family's antique piano, built in 1895, could not be saved; it's the only thing remaining at the old house.",
      "The Mackenzies would not be where they are without the financial and other support of friends and family.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no way we could have done that prior to a buyout,\" Jenny Mackenzie said of paying off the mortgage on the old house, as well as a government loan from previous flood damage, and then buying a new house. \u201cEven now it\u2019s financially precarious.\u201d",
      "The family has learned through this experience to open themselves up to everything \u2014 to suggestions about where they might relocate, to kindness, to community, John Mackenzie said.",
      "There were moments, initially, when it was hard to accept that kind of generosity and the loss of some privacy around money, he said. But it\u2019s helped to know he would donate if there were another family in need, and he and his wife are incredibly grateful.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s kind of completely broke us open,\u201d he said."

      "\u201cI look for it every year. I count the days down,\u201d said Sandra Owens, of Haysi, Virginia, who held a pink pillowcase with a message in black ink, \u201cThank you CSX and volunteers for the Santa Train. 82.\u201d",
      "Owens moved to Kentucky from Delaware 55 years ago when she got married and experienced her first Santa Train a few years later, when her son turned 3. He is 46 now, and these days she brings her grandchildren. In a few more years, she hopes to bring great-grandchildren.",
      "\u201cThe faces of the kids, that\u2019s what makes me happy,\u201d she said. \"You can\u2019t see anything better.\u201d",
      "The train starts out in Shelbiana, Kentucky, where families wait in the pre-dawn. At each stop there are dozens to hundreds of people. Many crowd around the back of the train, where Santa and his helpers toss stuffed animals. Meanwhile, groups of volunteer \u201celves\u201d carrying bags full of gifts fan out, making sure every child goes home with something. Each year they hand out more than 15 tons of gifts that include hats, mittens and fuzzy blankets along with board games, skate boards and teddy bears.",
      "Donna Doughetry from Snowflake, Virginia, remembers coming to see the Santa Train as a child in nearby Fort Blackmore.",
      "\u201cYears back, we didn't get a lot,\u201d she said. \u201cSo back then this was kind of what we got, and we were proud of it. It meant a lot to us.\u201d",
      "Over the years, her kids have at times received handmade gifts from the Santa Train, like crocheted hats, which they still have and cherish.",
      "Even though it is easier for people in these isolated, rural communities to buy Christmas presents these days, Dougherty made the short trek to Fort Blackmore with her niece on Saturday, carrying on the family tradition that she is glad she can still share.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really nice that they do this,\u201d she said. \u201cIt shows the true Christmas spirit.\u201d",
      "CSX employees consider it an honor to be chosen to staff the Santa Train as volunteers. Jesse Hensley had been trying to get a spot for 35 years, ever since he met his wife, Angie, who grew up with the Santa Train in St. Paul, Virginia.",
      "\u201cIt was such a thrill when we heard that whistle blow,\u201d she remembered. \u201cWhen I was a little girl, you know, you have dreams. My dream was to ride that train. Never in my life did I ever think that I would get to.\u201d",
      "The pair was selected to ride the train this year because they volunteered countless hours after the flooding caused by Hurricane Helene devastated their community of Erwin, Tennessee, where Jesse Hensley works as a machinist mechanic for CSX.",
      "The Santa Train doesn't run to Erwin, but CSX added a special event this year to bring cheer to the community. Residents were invited to a holiday party with food, music, and gifts in the Erwin rail yard. Santa paid a visit on train with cars decked out in lights forming the shapes of ornaments, moving jingle bells, marching toy soldiers, and the words \u201cHoliday Express\u201d in giant red letters.",
      "Two days later, Angie Hensley was all smiles on the Santa Train and nearly as excited as the children she helped distribute toys to, including grandnieces and grandnephews in St. Paul. The joy of helping on the Santa Train was even better than she had imagined, she said.",
      "Her fellow volunteers included CSX President and CEO Joe Hinrichs, who got off at every stop, handing out toys and talking to those who had come to see the train. Hinrichs' best memory so far was at a stop a couple of years ago when a family brought a disabled child but were hanging back from the train to avoid the tussle of the crowd. Helpers cleared a path to bring the boy forward and gave him a giant teddy bear they had saved for a special occasion.",
      "\u201cWe brought it out there, and everybody got around it, and we gave it to him. And there wasn\u2019t a dry eye anywhere,\u201d Hinrichs said. \"It was a magical moment.\u201d"

    "published": "Fri, 29 Nov 2024 01:14:24 -0500",
    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump is creating a National Energy Council that he says will establish U.S. &ldquo;energy dominance&rdquo; around the world",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump is creating a National Energy Council that he says will establish U.S. \u201cenergy dominance\u201d around the world",
      "WASHINGTON -- President-elect Donald Trump is set to create a National Energy Council that he says will establish American \u201cenergy dominance\u201d around the world as he seeks to boost U.S. oil and gas drilling and move away from President Joe Biden\u2019s focus on climate change.",
      "The energy council \u2014 to be led by North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, Trump\u2019s choice to head the Interior Department \u2014 will be key in Trump\u2019s pledge to \u201cdrill, drill, drill\" and sell more oil and other energy sources to allies in Europe and around the globe.",
      "The new council will be granted sweeping authority over federal agencies involved in energy permitting, production, generation, distribution, regulation and transportation, with a mandate to cut bureaucratic red tape, enhance private sector investments and focus on innovation instead of \u201ctotally unnecessary regulation,\u201d Trump said.",
      "But the president-elect's energy wishes are likely to run into real-world limits. For one, U.S. oil production under Biden is already at record levels. The federal government cannot force companies to drill for more oil, and production increases could lower prices and reduce profits.",
      "A call for energy dominance \u2014 a term Trump also used in his first term as president \u2014 \"is an opportunity, not a requirement,'' for the oil industry to move forward on drilling projects under terms that are likely to be more favorable to industry than those offered by Biden, said energy analyst Kevin Book.",
      "Whether Trump achieves energy dominance \u2014 however he defines it \u2014 \"comes down to decisions by private companies, based on how they see supply-demand balances in the global marketplace,'' said Book, managing partner at ClearView Energy Partners, a Washington research firm. Don't expect an immediate influx of new oil rigs dotting the national landscape, he said.",
      "Trump's bid to boost oil supplies \u2014 and lower U.S. prices \u2014 is complicated by his threat this week to impose 25% import tariffs on Canada and Mexico, two of the largest sources of U.S. oil imports. U.S. The oil industry warned the tariffs could raise prices and even harm national security.",
      "\u201cCanada and Mexico are our top energy trading partners, and maintaining the free flow of energy products across our borders is critical for North American energy security and U.S. consumers,\u201d said Scott Lauermann, speaking for the American Petroleum Institute, the oil industry\u2019s top lobbying group.",
      "American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers, which represents U.S. refineries, also opposes potential tariffs, saying in a statement that \u201cAmerican refiners depend on crude oil from Canada and Mexico to produce the affordable, reliable fuels consumers count on every day.\"",
      "Scott Segal, a former Bush administration official, said the idea of centering energy decisions at the White House follows an example set by Biden, who named a trio of White House advisers to lead on climate policy. Segal, a partner at the law and policy law firm Bracewell, called Burgum \u201ca steady hand on the tiller\u201d with experience in fossil fuels and renewables.",
      "And unlike Biden\u2019s climate advisers \u2014 Gina McCarthy, John Podesta and Ali Zaidi \u2014 Burgum will probably take his White House post as a Senate-confirmed Cabinet member, Segal said.",
      "Dustin Meyer, senior vice president of policy, economics and regulatory affairs at the American Petroleum Institute, called the new energy council \u201ca good thing\u201d for the U.S. economy and trade. \u201cConceptually it makes a lot of sense to have as much coordination as possible,\u201d he said.",
      "Still, \u201cmarket dynamics will always be the key'' for any potential increase in energy production, Meyer said.",
      "Jonathan Elkind, a senior research scholar at Columbia University\u2019s Center on Global Energy Policy, called energy dominance a \u201cdeliberately vague concept,\u201d but said, \u201cIt's hard to see how (Trump) can push more oil into an already saturated market.\"",
      "Trump has promised to bring gasoline prices below $2 a gallon, but experts call that highly unlikely, since crude oil prices would need to drop dramatically to achieve that goal. Gas prices averaged $3.07 nationally as of Wednesday, down from $3.25 a year ago.",
      "Elkind and other experts said they hope the new energy council will move beyond oil to focus on renewable energy such as wind, solar and geothermal power, as well as nuclear. None of those energy resources produces greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change.",
      "\"Failure to focus on climate change as an existential threat to our planet is a huge concern and translates to a very significant loss of American property and American lives,'' said Elkind, a former assistant energy secretary in the Obama administration. He cited federal statistics showing two dozen weather disasters this year that caused more than $1 billion in damage each. A total of 418 people were killed.",
      "Trump has played down risks from climate change and pledged to rescind unspent money in the Inflation Reduction Act, Biden\u2019s landmark climate and health care bill. He also said he will stop offshore wind development when he returns to the White House in January.",
      "Even so, his Nov. 15 announcement of the energy council says he will \u201cexpand ALL forms of energy production to grow our Economy and create good-paying jobs.\u201d",
      "That includes renewables, said Safak Yucel, associate professor at Georgetown University\u2019s McDonough School of Business.",
      "\"The mandate for the energy council is U.S. dominance globally, but what's more American than American solar and American wind?'' he asked. A report from Ernst & Young last year showed that solar was the cheapest source of new-build electricity in many markets.",
      "Trump, in his statement, said he wants to dramatically increase baseload power to lower electricity costs, avoid brownouts and \u201cWIN the battle for AI superiority.\"",
      "In comments to reporters before he was named to the energy post, Burgum cited a similar goal, noting increased demand for electricity from artificial intelligence, commonly known as AI, and fast-growing data centers. \u201cThe AI battle affects everything from defense to health care to education to productivity as a country,\u2033 Burgum said.",
      "While Trump mocks the climate law as the \u201cgreen new scam,\u201d he is unlikely to repeal it, Yucel and other experts said. One reason: Most of its investments and jobs are in Republican congressional districts. GOP members of Congress have urged House Speaker Mike Johnson to retain the law, which passed with only Democratic votes.",
      "\u201cA lot of Southern states are telling Trump, \u2018We actually like renewables,'\" Yucel said, noting that Republican-led states have added thousands of jobs in recent years in wind, solar and battery power.",
      "If renewables make economic economic sense, he added, \"they'll continue.''"

      "SANTA FE, N.M. -- The New Mexico Court of Appeals has upheld regulations aimed at cracking down on emissions in one of the nation\u2019s top-producing oil and gas states.",
      "The case centered on a rule adopted in 2022 by state regulators that called for curbing the pollutants that chemically react in the presence of sunlight to create ground-level ozone, commonly known as smog. High ozone levels can cause respiratory problems, including asthma and chronic bronchitis.",
      "Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham's administration has long argued that the adoption of the ozone precursor rule along with regulations to limit methane emissions from the industry were necessary to combat climate change and meet federal clean air standards.",

      "The California Department of Fish and Wildlife has released a new plan to protect the state's iconic Joshua trees, which are imperiled by wildfires, human development and climate change.",
      "The 294-page draft plan includes calls for avoiding or minimizing direct and indirect impacts from overgrazing, pesticide use and unauthorized off-roading; relocating trees when projects require their removal or could harm them; and identifying and protecting lands where they could thrive in a future projected to be drier and hotter.",
      "\u201cIn many ways, it's a good comprehensive plan of the things we need to do if the western Joshua tree is going to survive the very, very difficult decades ahead,\u201d said Brendan Cummings, conservation director with the Center for Biological Diversity, a nonprofit that in 2019 petitioned to list the western Joshua tree as threatened under the state's Endangered Species Act.",
      "The conservation plan is a requirement of the Western Joshua Tree Conservation Act that passed last year, making it the first law in the state to protect a species from the threats of climate change. The law also prohibits anyone from killing, damaging or removing a tree without a state permit.",
      "The plan lists criteria and attributes to help identify land that should be prioritized for conservation, such as large areas with Joshua trees or areas with a high density of healthy and adult trees. It also suggests protecting regions where there is low risk of such threats as fires, invasive species and development, and where pollinators like moths or small mammal seed dispersers exist. It aims to identify these lands by December 2025 and permanently protect 70% of them by 2033.",
      "The plan also calls on land managers and wildfire responders to create procedures to reduce and fight wildfires that threaten the species and their habitat, and develop measures to minimize impacts from rehabilitating burned areas. That includes protecting trees, replanting lost ones and other native species, and controlling invasives.",
      "But as the proposed plan notes, its effectiveness and the survival of the trees will depend largely on whether humanity can limit and reduce the planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions from burning coal, oil and gas that are causing climate change.",
      "Under a business-as-usual scenario, climate change could wipe out most, if not all, of the tree's habitat, Cummings said.",
      "\u201cAssuming we can keep to a mid-level emissions trajectory, we have a very good chance of saving the species if all the things outlined in this plan are carried out,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd primarily that\u2019s doing what we can to protect as many of them as possible.\"",

    "story": [
      "The most popular mobile games in the UK are being advertised without disclosing they contain loot boxes - random in-game purchases which critics say are \"exploitative\" and \"foster addiction\".",
      "The regulator, the Advertising Standards Agency (ASA), says it bans and removes ads which fail to make the clear whether or not a game contains a loot box.",
      "But a BBC investigation found only two of the top 45 highest-grossing games on the Google Play store actually followed those rules.",
      "Dr Jane Rigbye, chief executive of Young Gamers & Gamblers Education Trust (Ygam), called the findings \"deeply concerning\".",
      "\"In the absence of robust regulation in gaming, it is essential for games to provide clear and transparent information about their features, allowing both parents and gamers to make informed decisions,\" she said.",
      "In a statement, the ASA said: \"This is an ongoing area of our work, and we\u2019re closely monitoring the sector to discover the scale of compliance and act accordingly.\"",
      "However, some say the regulator lacks the teeth to deal with the problem.",
      "\"The ASA, although it has upheld some complaints, it takes so long to properly process all of these things - they will go to a company and say, 'you should comply', but they don't comply,\" said Leon Y  Xiao, a video game regulation researcher at the IT University of Copenhagen.",
      "\"People are walking into a video game not knowing the potential risks, and this is assuming that people have even understood the risk of loot boxes to begin with.\"",
      "What is a loot box?",
      "Loot boxes contain random digital items that gamers can only reveal through gameplay or - more controversially - by making a payment.",
      "Game-makers have previously defended them as being akin to a chocolate egg containing a plastic toy, with children not knowing exactly what they are getting until the egg is bought and opened.",
      "But critics say they are in fact a form of gambling, with a report in 2022 by the Norwegian Consumer Council concluding they \"often involve exploiting consumers through predatory mechanisms, fostering addiction, targeting vulnerable consumer groups and more.\"",
      "The same year, the UK government resisted pressure to regulate loot boxes, saying the video game industry could self-regulate instead.",
      "Trade body Ukie published guidance in July 2023, including the requirement to disclose loot boxes prior to games being purchased, which the industry was given a year to comply with.",
      "But, more than 12 months later, the BBC has discovered the vast majority of major mobile games containing loot boxes are still flouting the rules, with most games only disclosing their presence if would-be players tap a small information button on the Play Store.",
      "Adrian Hon, head of game developer Six to Start, said the games industry had a track record of \"conveniently ignoring or forgetting regulations that might interfere with their ability to sell to players\".",
      "\"We know that many people, including children, struggle with overspending on loot boxes,\" he said, adding they were deliberately designed to be \"habit-forming\".",
      "\"The least that games companies could do is disclose the presence of loot boxes, but they won't even do that - it's an indictment of their priorities and lack of care towards vulnerable players.\"",
      "Non-compliance",
      "The BBC checked the adverts for the top 45 highest grossing games on Google's Play Store, which along with Apple's App Store are where the vast majority of people access mobile games.",
      "Of those 45, 26 were labelled as including loot boxes - 22 of which were being actively advertised at the same time.",
      "However, only two of those titles spelt out the presence of the loot boxes in their ads.",
      "The highest-grossing game on the Play Store to contain loot boxes, Monopoly GO, was among those not to mention random in-game purchases in its adverts.",
      "The game has been downloaded more than 50 million times, generating more than $3bn (\u00a32.37bn) in revenue according to the IP's owner Hasbro.",
      "Mr Xiao told the BBC the findings were in line with preliminary results of his own research, which has also found around 90% of games containing loot boxes are not disclosing this in their ads.",
      "The BBC has approached Hasbro, Meta and the ASA for comment.",
      "Zo\u00eb Osmond, CEO of GambleAware, said she was \"extremely concerned\" about \"gambling-like activities\" becoming normalised for children.",

    "published": "Fri, 29 Nov 2024 00:05:12 GMT",
    "summary": "Thermal imaging tech has become cheaper and homeowners are using it to track down heat loss.",
    "story": [
      "It\u2019s like X-ray vision \u2013 for heat loss. Last year, web engineer Jamie Matthews bought a thermal imaging camera. His home, in the southeast of England, was about to give up some of its secrets.",
      "The colourful images on the device\u2019s small screen soon revealed how his loft hatch was letting him down.",
      "\u201cThat was really obvious on the camera,\u201d he says, explaining that he could see cool areas on the hatch, where heat was apparently escaping.",
      "Mr Mathews, who runs a software company that supplies the clean tech industry, also found some other small gaps in external walls and parts of his roof that appeared less well insulated than others.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s good fun and it certainly shows up things that may not be immediately obvious,\u201d he says.",
      "While Mr Matthews was able to draught-proof some areas himself, he says he would take a more methodical approach if he were planning any major changes to his home. The web engineer later had a professional heat loss survey carried out when he installed a heat pump, for example.",
      "That approach is sensible, according to building physics researchers who spoke to the BBC. There are signs that thermal cameras are becoming more popular, as homeowners seek to slash their heating bills and carbon emissions. Local councils are increasingly allowing residents to borrow the devices for free, for example.",
      "But there is no substitute for professional advice if you are planning big works or interventions, experts say.",
      "Thermal cameras work by using a sensor to detect infrared light, which we cannot see, but which we can sometimes feel as heat. Such devices aren\u2019t cheap. Mr Matthews spent roughly \u00a3160 on his, though organisations including local councils and energy supplier Octopus Energy do loan them out to people free of charge so that they can gain a basic understanding of heat loss in their homes.",
      "Wiltshire Council recently made 11 devices available to borrow from local libraries, as well as a brief guide on how to use them. There has been \u201chuge uptake\u201d says Cllr Ian Blair-Pilling, such that the council now has a waiting list for interested residents.",
      "\"Expert advice, combined with a measured approach to the findings from thermal imaging, will give residents the best chance of making informed decisions about energy-saving home improvements,\" says Cllr Blair-Pilling.",
      "Small interventions could help people keep their homes warm and reduce the risk of cold-related health conditions, he adds.",
      "However, Jo Atkinson, senior consultant in buildings decarbonisation at Energy Systems Catapult, a research organisation, expresses concern over the growing availability of thermal cameras: \u201cIn my opinion, the risks are too great for making the wrong choices.\u201d",
      "It is possible to misinterpret thermal camera images, she says, noting that if a wall has been warmed by the sun, an image of that wall taken outside could make it look as though heat is escaping, when it is not. Reflective surfaces can also appear, misleadingly, to be leaking heat.",
      "While using a thermal camera as a starting point for understanding your home is \u201cabsolutely fine\u201d, according to Ronita Bardhan at the University of Cambridge, it is important to ask for independent expert advice when planning any renovation works.",
      "Thermal camera imagery can make it look as though some areas of your home are losing a lot of heat, but this might simply be a result of how the camera has been calibrated, how the user holds it and moves it around, and which colour palette was chosen for the display.",
      "Dr Bardhan adds that there is a risk of triggering \u201cretrofit anxiety\u201d in homeowners.",
      "Plus, if people go on to alter their insulation, for example, such measures should be taken with great care as improper installation can cause damp and mould.",
      "North Somerset Council provides thermal cameras to residents, on loan, and this scheme is also currently operating on a waiting list basis due to its popularity. The Council has published introductory advice on how to use the cameras, including an online video.",
      "The Centre for Sustainable Energy (CSE), a charity, highlights a more detailed guide from the National House-Building Council, which describes how to use thermal cameras. However, a CSE spokeswoman adds that the organisation still recommends people seek expert advice.",
      "Phil Steele, future technologies evangelist at Octopus Energy, agrees: \u201cYou have got to be careful.\u201d Thermal cameras can, for instance, make the corners of rooms look very cold but this is simply a reflection of reduced air circulation in those areas, rather than an insulation problem, he explains.",
      "Octopus Energy has around 500 cameras that it loans out to customers every winter. Last year, the firm distributed the devices roughly 3,800 times.",
      "Thermal camera-wielding homeowners who have spoken to the BBC, such as Mr Matthews, say they have treated the imagery with caution.",
      "Louise Green, a designer in London, says she read online training materials before using a thermal camera to search for points of heat loss in a house shortly after she and her partner moved in.",
      "In her case, Miss Green rented the camera from Library of Things, a community-focused organisation that makes various items available for people to borrow. The device indicated loss of heat around windows and doors in Miss Green\u2019s home. She and her partner were able to compare the results to their neighbour\u2019s better-insulated property.",
      "\u201cIt just confirmed what we knew already, but it was still interesting to see, you know, were there any other areas?\u201d she explains.",
      "Darrell Taylor at Flir, a firm that makes thermal cameras, says that members of the public can access some free training materials on his company\u2019s website.",
      "He adds that Flir aims to make thermal images as clear and easy to interpret as possible \u2013 including by merging optical imagery with thermal imagery, to add more detail to the final picture. And he suggests that, in the future, Flir cameras may offer machine learning-based instructions and advice as people use the devices.",
      "Those who know how best to interpret thermal camera imagery can find extraordinary hidden problems in a building, though.",

    "published": "Thu, 28 Nov 2024 14:37:55 GMT",
    "summary": "The trade body for the sector says these are \"deeply concerning times\" for the UK's car industry.",
    "story": [
      "UK car production fell sharply in October amid industry concerns about \"intense pressure\" on investment in electric vehicle-making.",
      "Output of all cars dropped by more than 15% from a year earlier, mainly due to a fall in exports following weak demand, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said.",
      "Production of electric and hybrid vehicles declined by a third compared with last year, due to flagging European demand and the retooling of factories for new models.",
      "The figures come after Vauxhall maker Stellantis said this week it would close its Luton van-making factory, partly due to rules imposed to speed up the transition to electric vehicles in the UK.",
      "In addition, Ford said last week it would cut 800 jobs in the UK over the next three years because of difficult trading conditions, including intense competition and less demand for electric vehicles (EVs).",
      "Mike Hawes, the SMMT's chief executive, said: \"These are deeply concerning times for the automotive industry, with massive investments in plants and new zero emission products under intense pressure.\"",
      "Globally, demand for EVs has slowed, he said, while in the UK, manufacturers have to contend with \"the toughest targets and most accelerated timeline\" without the incentives necessary for customers to drive demand.",
      "Although production of EVs fell in October, sales of electric cars in the UK have been increasing.",
      "In October, they made up one out of every five cars registered, although industry sources insist this is largely down to unsustainable discounting.",
      "There has been a growing row between the government and the industry over the sale of new petrol and diesel cars being phased out over the next few years.",
      "Under the UK's zero emissions vehicle (ZEV) mandate, manufacturers are currently required to sell a certain percentage of cars and vans that do not emit any emissions ahead of a 2030 ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars.",
      "In 2024, EVs must make up 22% of a carmaker's car sales, and 10% of van sales. This target is set to rise.",
      "For every sale that pushes it outside the mandate, firms must pay a \u00a315,000 fine - but they can also buy \"credits\" from firms that can meet this mandate.",
      "Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds has said there will be a \"fast track\" consultation of how the EV targets are enforced.",
      "However, he also reiterated Labour's commitment to the 2030 phase-out of new petrol and diesel vehicle sales.",
      "A spokesperson for the Department for Business and Trade said the government knew the industry \"needs certainty and stability\" and was investing \u00a32bn in car manufacturing and more than \u00a3300m to support the uptake of electric vehicles.",
      "\"We continue to work closely with the sector to make the transition a success,\" the spokesperson added.",
      "Vauxhall owner to close Luton factory",
      "Ministers told in July of 'likely' Vauxhall closure",
      "Ford calls for incentives to buy electric cars as backlash grows",
      "Luton plant closure",
      "The closure of Stellantis' factory at Luton will put 1,100 jobs at risk.",
      "The former UK manufacturing lead for Stellantis, Mark Noble, told the BBC of his \u201cdisappointment, shock, and anger\u201d about the closure plans.",
      "He said the site was closing \"for a number of reasons that are external to the plant\", including uncertainty over Brexit tariffs and the ZEV mandate.",
      "He said troubles for Stellantis' UK plants at Luton and Ellesmere Port \"started with Brexit\" because it \"caused a lot of uncertainty\".",
      "\"When you've got two UK plants that export 80%+ of their build, with the tariff confusion and no clarity that really hurt the two plants.\"",
      "He added that for the ZEV mandate the government \"has to decide: is this a tax, a \u00a36bn tax on the car companies, or is it their mandate to go green?\"",
      "\"They need to make it possible for the car manufacturers to meet these targets,\" he said.",
      "He added that there were still barriers to mass adoption of EVs, including a lack of charging infrastructure.",
      "\"If everybody bought an electric vehicle tomorrow, I don\u2019t see how we charge them,\" he said.",
      "However, Vicky Read, chief executive of EV charging industry body Charge UK, told the BBC a charger \"is being installed every 25 minutes\".",
      "Charging rollout is reliant on private sector funding, so talk of electric car targets being weakened is \u201cincredibly concerning\u201d, she said.",
      "According to government figures, there are more than 71,000 public charge points in the UK, with 57 added on average each day.",
      "Government adviser James Richardson, the director of analysis for the Climate Change Committee, told the BBC that traditional car companies were at risk of being overtaken by new competitors.",
      "\"Companies don't always see how quickly these markets can change, and then they can get left behind,\" he said.",
      "He said electric sales targets were \"really helping to send that signal to companies that they need to move fast, or competitors will come in and take the market from them\"."

    "story": [
      "Drivers are paying more for fuel than they should because retailers' profit margins remain \"stubbornly high\", the competition watchdog has said.",
      "The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said sellers' margins - the difference between what a retailer pays for its fuel and what it sells at - remained higher than historic levels, although fuel prices have fallen since July.",
      "It said supermarkets' margins had risen to 8.1% in August from 7% in April.",
      "The Petrol Retailers Association (PRA) said sellers were pricing fuel as \u201clow as possible in a highly competitive market\u201d while also grappling with increasing costs.",
      "But the CMA said the \"sustained\" increase in fuel prices was concerning and there was not enough competition in the fuel market, which continued to drive prices up.",
      "Non-supermarket fuel margins had risen to 10.2% in August from 7.8% in April, the watchdog said.",
      "\u201cWhile fuel prices have fallen since July, drivers are paying more for fuel than they should be as they continue to be squeezed by stubbornly high fuel margins,\" said Dan Turnbull, senior director of markets at the CMA.",
      "\"We therefore remain concerned about weak competition in the sector and the impact on pump prices,\" he added, especially while costs of living remain high.",
      "\"The more people save on fuel, the more they have to spend in other areas\", he said.",
      "The average petrol price at the end of October was 134.4p per litre, and for diesel it was 139.7p.",
      "However, the PRA's executive director, Gordon Balmer, said it was crucial that the  increasing costs facing retailers - notably business rates, National Insurance and the minimum wage  - were included in future analysis to \"give a complete picture\".",
      "\"The CMA reporting that retailers continue to pump their fuel margins for extra profit will stir anger once again \u2013 particularly when set against the background of the government continuing the fuel duty freeze,\u201d says Luke Bosdet, the AA\u2019s spokesman on road fuel prices.",
      "He added that as retailers now have to pay increased National Insurance contributions, higher wages and increased energy bills, it was hard to see what a \"reasonable addition\" was to fuel prices, and what counted as \"bloated margins\".",
      "Motoring group RAC said the CMA's findings were \"disappointing\", especially after the regulator said in July that drivers had been overcharged on fuel by \u00a31.6bn in 2023.",
      "\u201cWe hope the introduction of the government-backed fuel finder scheme next year will succeed in driving greater competition and enable drivers all around the UK to benefit from fairer prices\", said the RAC's Simon Williams.",
      "The fuel finder scheme will allow drivers to compare real-time fuel prices and is due to be introduced by the end of 2025.",
      "The government in January said the information, which will be available on online comparison sites and navigation apps, should drive down prices because of the added transparency.",

    "story": [
      "Major sanitary pad makers in China are apologising after being accused of selling pads that are shorter than advertised.",
      "It comes amid a storm of anger after viral social media videos showed Chinese women measuring the lengths of sanitary pads from popular brands - showing that most of them fell short of what was stated on their packaging.",
      "The uproar has extended into broader grievances about women being short-changed by feminine hygiene products, which have a history of safety scandals in China.",
      "Chinese women have taken it upon themselves to call out quality concerns in sanitary pads, the most commonly used feminine hygiene product in the country.",
      "In one of the earliest videos, posted on 3 November, a user on Chinese social media platform Xiaohongshu examined nine brands of sanitary pads with a measuring tape, showing that they all fell short of the length stated on their packaging.",
      "\"Will cutting a few centimetres help you strike it rich?\" the user wrote in her video.",
      "The revelations soon ignited widespread criticism, with consumers accusing sanitary pad makers of being deceitful.",
      "\"The inflated sanitary pad length is just like the insoles under men\u2019s feet,\" reads one popular Weibo post.",
      "Amid the uproar, an investigation of over 20 different sanitary pads by Chinese news outlet The Paper found that nearly 90% of the products were \"shrunken\", measuring at least 10mm shorter than claimed on their packaging. Tucked within most of them were even shorter absorbent layers, which are meant to soak up menstrual flow.",
      "The Paper also reported that while national standards for sanitary pads specify that the products can measure within 4% of advertised lengths, they do not specify the length of the absorbent layer in sanitary pads.",
      "Following a torrent of complaints, authorities said they were revising the current national standard on sanitary pads, according to local media.",
      "Met with enquiries and complaints from customers about the discrepancy in its sanitary pad lengths, the popular Chinese brand ABC further stoked outrage after its customer service reportedly responded to a complaint by saying \"if you cannot accept [the length difference] then you can choose not to buy it\".",
      "ABC said in a statement in mid-November that it was \"deeply sorry\" for the \"inappropriate\" response, and promised to improve its products to achieve \"zero deviation\". Other companies including Shecare and Beishute have also issued apologies.",
      "Chinese state media has also weighed in on the controversy, criticising manufacturers for cutting corners.",
      "\"As a daily necessity for women, quality of sanitary pads is directly related to the health and comfort of the user,\" reads a Xinhua article. \"The problems existing in some products on the market cannot be ignored.\"",
      "Sanitary pads are the most commonly used feminine hygiene product in China, where the market is valued at $13bn (\u00a310bn). However, the products have also made headlines over the years for safety issues.",
      "In 2016, police busted a massive \"fake sanitary towel\" operation in southeast China, where millions of sanitary pads were manufactured in a factory without proper hygiene measures and packaged as popular brands. In 2021, popular feminine hygiene brand Space 7 apologised and vowed an investigation after a woman claimed she found a needle in one of its sanitary pads.",
      "The wave of anger also reflects broader grievances felt by women over the quality of products meant for them.",
      "\"Is it that hard for sanitary pads to tackle women\u2019s needs?\" reads a trending hashtag on Weibo.",
      "Another trending phrase that has caught on amid the blowback encapsulates the outrage: \"Sanitary pads yield a centimetre; women yield for a lifetime.\""

      "The comments add to a growing row between the government and the industry over the sale of new petrol and diesel cars being phased out over the next few years.",
      "On Tuesday, Stellantis, the owner of Vauxhall, said it would close a plant in Luton, putting 1,100 jobs at risk, partly due to the EV targets.",
      "Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds told the House of Commons on Wednesday that Stellantis's decision was \"a dark day for Luton\".",
      "It joins Ford in axing UK jobs. Last week, it announced it will cut 800 jobs in the UK over the next three years, partly due to the EV target but also because of increased competition.",
      "Ms Brankin told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"The one thing that we really need is government-backed incentives to urgently boost the uptake of electric vehicles.\"",
      "She said Ford has invested \"significantly\" in the production and development of EVs, with \"well over\" \u00a3350m put into electrification in the UK.",
      "\"So we kind of need to make it work,\" she said.",
      "Both firms have previously raised doubts about their future in the UK because of other factors, separate to EV targets.",
      "Ford closed its Bridgend factory in 2020, axing 1,644 jobs, citing Covid-19 as one of the reasons while Vauxhall's former owner suggested in 2019 that Brexit threatened its Luton factory.",
      "Meanwhile, some analysts have said a shift towards luxury vehicles and away from cheaper models are also part of the reason for Ford's problems.",
      "Reynolds blamed the previous government for Stellantis' Luton closure, saying Labour had \"inherited a position of extreme frustration\".",
      "He said there would be a \"fast track\" consultation of how the EV targets are enforced, but reiterated Labour's commitment to a 2030 phase-out of new petrol and diesel vehicle sales.",
      "However, shadow business secretary Andrew Griffith said the 2030 target was a \"jobs killer\" and that Stellantis' decision was \"the direct result of a government policy that is simply unworkable for industry\".",
      "The previous Conservative government moved the deadline for the phase-out from 2030 to 2035, but it kept penalties for non-compliance.",
      "Under the current mandate, a percentage of the cars that companies sell must qualify as zero-emission.",

      "Manufacturers argue that demand for electric cars has not been as high as was expected when the rules were drawn up.",

    "story": [
      "Supermarket loyalty cards do offer genuine savings, the UK's competition watchdog has found, but it said people should still shop around.",
      "The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) looked at 50,000 products on loyalty price promotions across Tesco, Sainsbury's, Morrisons, Co-op and Waitrose.",
      "It found \"very little evidence\" that supermarkets were inflating their \"usual\" prices to make promotions look like a better deal.",
      "However, it found that despite discounts being legitimate many shoppers still did not trust that the offers were cheaper.",
      "While the CMA also said its review \"has shown that loyalty prices aren\u2019t always the cheapest option, so shopping around is still key\".",
      "\"We know many people don\u2019t trust loyalty card prices,\" said George Lusty, the CMA's interim executive director of consumer protection. \"Which is why we did a deep dive to get to the bottom of whether supermarkets were treating shoppers fairly.\"",

      "How a big yellow label influences what we buy",
      "It said about nine out of 10 loyalty promotions it looked at offered genuine savings against the usual in-store price.",
      "Customers made an average saving of between 17% and 25% across the five supermarkets the CMA examined.",
      "The watchdog also surveyed shoppers and said that nearly 70% of those it spoke to think loyalty pricing offers decent savings.",
      "However, there remains a significant amount of mistrust among consumers towards loyalty promotions.",
      "The CMA said: \"A significant proportion - 40% - say they do not trust loyalty prices are a genuine saving on the usual price.\"",
      "A common view among younger people was that non-member prices in a promotion were higher than normal.",
      "More than 70% of 18 to 29-year-olds thought that the price for those without a loyalty card or app had been bumped up, said the CMA.",
      "While the report examined other supermarkets, it did not draw any conclusions about two of the UK's largest - Asda and Aldi.",
      "Asda has a loyalty points scheme which customers can redeem for vouchers but it does not offer lower prices on a product for those with a loyalty card.",
      "Discounters Aldi and Lidl were not included as they don't sell online, and don't stock a wide enough range of branded products to do a like-for-like comparison, the watchdog said.",
      "Consumer group Which? said two-tier pricing had \"become a common practice across retailers\" so it was \"reassuring\" that people could make genuine savings.",
      "However, it has also studied thousands of products, \"and repeatedly found examples of loyalty price offers that aren't as good as they seem\" according to Sue Davies, Which? head of food policy.",
      "She also said there are concerns that \"millions of consumers are being excluded from accessing lower prices due to loyalty scheme restrictions\" because they have not signed up to a card or app.",
      "Shoppers have been under pressure from the pace of food price rises in recent years, the CMA said.",
      "Although inflation has fallen considerably since then, it said the price of food is still substantially higher relative to how much money people earn.",
      "Customer data",
      "One of the main reasons supermarkets offer loyalty schemes is so they can collect data on customers.",
      "This is very valuable information - studying buying decisions can help supermarkets understand and influence shoppers.",
      "They create highly detailed shopper profiles looking at what people bought and how often.",
      "Some supermarkets sell data to suppliers which can then be used to deliver targeted advertising.",
      "Selling data can be lucrative. Sainsbury's has said it expects Nectar360, the group which manages the supermarket's loyalty scheme, to make an additional \u00a3100m in profit over the next three years.",
      "The CMA said shopper attitudes to data collection range from feeling pressure to trade their personal data for lower prices, to others not feeling concerned.",
      "But only 7% of people surveyed by the watchdog said they hadn't signed up to a loyalty scheme due to privacy concerns.",
      "Annich McIntosh, editor and chief executive of Loyalty Magazine, said there was a question mark over whether it was morally right to force people to participate in loyalty schemes to get price promotions.",
      "But she said these schemes in general benefit shoppers because they can help slow down supermarket price increases.",
      "She added that a \"sci-fi scenario\" of customers being offered promotions as they walk past a product was unlikely, as there was little customer appetite.",
      "However, using artificial intelligence to personalise offers could benefit both shoppers and supermarkets, she added.",

      "Then Donald Trump was re-elected as US president.",
      "\"I'm like, okay, we've got to bring those in,\" said Ms Mosee, founder of MinkeeBlue, a small business based in Philadelphia. Her firm is one of the many thousands across the country preparing for the potential impact of Trump's promises to impose stiff new tariffs on all goods coming into the country.",
      "Those efforts gained urgency this week as Trump said he would take action on his first day in office. He aimed the measures - a kind of border tax - at China, Mexico and Canada, America's top three trade partners.",
      "Writing on social media, Trump said he planned to impose a 25% levy on goods from Canada and Mexico and \"an additional 10% tariff, above any additional tariffs\" on imports from China.",
      "The post followed his campaign pledge to impose across-the-board tariffs of at least 10% on all imports coming into the US, and 60% or more on goods from China - many of which already face steep duties left over from actions taken during his first term as president.",
      "Some experts have said that Trump's policies may ultimately prove less aggressive than promised, and that his statements should be understood as opening salvos in bigger negotiations of migration and drug policy.",
      "But regardless of how policy shakes out, the threats are already having economic consequences, as firms like MinkeeBlue start to stockpile, shift supply chains, re-work contracts and take other steps to guard against the possible impact.",

      "In the days after the election, footwear giant Steve Madden told investors that it was moving forward with plans to shift manufacturing outside of China, with the aim of cutting its imports from the country in half over the next year.",
      "Tool and hardware maker Stanley Black & Decker also said it had initiated conversations with its customers about price hikes tied to the tariffs.",
      "Executives at retail giants such as Walmart have discussed similar plans.",
      "Even if Trump's policies remain just talk, Ms Edelberg said the public could see higher prices, as well as possible shortages of some items, as hoarding left some firms scrambling.",
      "Just the simple fact that firms were unsure about what was going to happen was also likely to reduce economic growth in the months ahead, she added.",
      "\"Even if firms don't think that these tariffs are going to happen with 100% certainty, it's not zero, so they should be responding,\" Ms Edelberg said.",
      "Trump and his advisers have argued that tariffs will help revive US manufacturing and drive a new US jobs boom.",
      "But that can come at a cost, businesses owners and economists warn.",
      "Martin Pochtaruk, chief executive of Canadian solar panel maker Heliene, said his firm was nearly wiped out in 2018 when Trump imposed tariffs on foreign-made solar panels and it had to absorb the fees.",
      "The firm now does all of its manufacturing in the US, where it employs 400 people. Many of its suppliers have also set up shop in the US, lured by government incentives for renewable energy introduced by President Joe Biden.",
      "Mr Pochtaruk's firm has learned from its experience, changing the design of its contracts so that customers are responsible for unexpected cost changes - whether due to tariffs or the kind of price spikes that hit during the pandemic.",
      "But despite these protections, the possibility of renewed trade tension between countries as closely connected as Canada and the US was worrying, Mr Pochtaruk said.",
      "Some key materials - such as glass - still come from overseas and face likely price hikes. The new administration could also bring other policies that slow growth in the industry.",
      "\"We are talking to all of our clients,\" Mr Pochtaruk said. \"There is a lot of anxiety.\"",
      "Economists say the evidence from existing tariffs - which have been present for decades in sectors such as clothing and footwear - suggests that while they can protect some firms, the cost is high and they do little to boost overall employment, while raising prices for US companies and consumers.",
      "The National Retail Federation (NRF) has warned that tariffs along the lines of Trump's campaign proposals would cost US consumers between $46bn (\u00a336.6bn) and $78bn more annually for apparel, toys, furniture, household appliances, footwear and travel goods.",
      "By NRF estimates, a $40 toaster, for example, would rise in price to $48-$52, while a $50 pair of athletic shoes could jump to $59-$64.",
      "Trump's move on Monday to target Mexico - a key supplier of grocery staples such as fruits and vegetables and historically protected by a free-trade agreement - underscores the tension between his tariff promises and other pledges on the campaign trail to bring down prices for Americans.",
      "Viktor Shvets of Macquarie Capital said that although Trump's ideas were in conflict with each other, he believed in the end Trump's fear of disrupting financial markets would limit his trade actions.",
      "\"Risks are high, but we remain convinced that 'guardrails' are sufficiently robust to avoid the worst outcomes,\" he wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday.",

    "story": [
      "The owner of Vauxhall has announced plans to close its van-making factory in Luton, putting about 1,100 jobs at risk.",
      "Stellantis, which also owns brands including Citroen, Peugeot and Fiat, said it would combine its electric van production at its other UK plant in Ellesmere Port in Cheshire.",
      "Rules imposed to speed up the transition to electric vehicles (EV) in the UK partly drove the decision, the firm said.",
      "Union Unite said the move was a \"complete slap in the face\" for its members working in Luton.",
      "There are growing concerns among car manufacturers over EV sales targets, with many, including Stellantis, calling for the government to do more to boost consumer demand.",
      "Following the Luton plant announcement and intense pressure from industry leaders, Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said the government would consult on changes to EV sales rules, which is officially called the zero-emission vehicles mandate, because it is not working as intended.",
      "\"I get the seriousness and the urgency of the situation,\" he said, adding that the decision to close the Vauxhall van factory was a \"difficult day for Luton\".",
      "Late on Tuesday, the car industry called for urgent government intervention \"to safeguard the sector and Britain\u2019s zero emission vehicle transition\".",
      "The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said weak demand for EVs and the requirement to fulfill sales quotas would cost carmakers \u00a36bn in 2024 alone, \"with the potential for devastating impacts on business viability and jobs\".",
      "It said the strong EV demand anticipated when the zero emissions mandate was designed more than two years ago had failed to materialise, with interest rates, raw material prices, and energy costs remaining high.",
      "However, Reynolds reaffirmed that the government remained committed to meeting Labour\u2019s manifesto target of ending sales of new petrol and diesel cars by 2030.",
      "As part of the shift to electric, manufacturers are currently required to sell a certain percentage of cars and vans that do not emit any emissions ahead of the 2030 ban, with quotas increasing each year.",
      "Current rules state EVs must make up 22% of a carmaker's car sales, and 10% of van sales in 2024.",
      "For every sale that pushes it outside the mandate, firms must pay a \u00a315,000 fine. There are flexibilities in the system, allowing manufacturers who cannot meet the targets to buy \"credits\" from those that can.",
      "But car brands with factories in the UK have been urging the government to relax the rules, arguing that EV demand is not strong enough and more incentives are required for drivers to go fully electric.",
      "Electric car targets could be eased as demand flags",
      "Car firms demand more help to meet 2030 petrol ban",
      "Stellantis's Vauxhall plant in Luton currently builds petrol and diesel vans and had been due to start making its medium-sized Vivaro electric van from 2025, before the decision to close it.",
      "Electric models from other Stellantis brands, including Citro\u00ebn, Peugeot and Fiat, were also set to be built there. Vauxhall's Luton director said at the time it would be a \"fitting way\" to mark the factory's 120th anniversary.",
      "Now, the electric model that had been scheduled for manufacturing at Luton will move to Ellesmere Port, which is to get a \u00a350m cash injection.",
      "Three years ago, Stellantis invested \u00a3100m into revamping the Ellesmere Port site to make electric vehicles. It currently builds a range of small electric vans.",
      "Production of Stellantis's conventional vans will be transferred to France",
      "The company said the closure of Luton in spring next year would \"potentially contribute to greater production efficiency\". The decision to consolidate production is subject to consultation.",
      "It said hundreds of permanent jobs would be created at Ellesmere Port and that it would provide relocation assistance to workers who wanted to transfer from Luton.",
      "But Unite said \"whatever the positive benefits\" in store for the Ellesmere Port site, the decision was \"not acceptable\".",
      "\u201cWe stand ready to support our members in doing whatever we can to ensure that historical vehicle manufacturing is maintained in Luton,\" the union said.",
      "Luton's Vauxhall factory opened in 1905, with the first vans being assembled there in 1932.",
      "At its height the plant employed 37,000 people, but that number has been falling since the 1960s. The final car rolled off the production line in 2002, though van manufacturing, with the production of the Vivaro model, continued.",
      "Earlier this year, Stellantis chief executive Carlos Tavares warned that the future of both Luton and Ellesmere Port were in doubt, citing the impact of the EV sales mandate.",
      "'Major concern'",
      "Nissan, which builds EVs at its plant in Sunderland, has said the EV sales rules are \"undermining the business case for manufacturing cars in the UK, and the viability of thousands of jobs and billions of pounds in investment\".",
      "Last week, its rival Ford announced it will cut 800 jobs in the UK over the next three years. It said this was partly because of weaker demand for EVs.",
      "The SMMT has previously said support packages and incentives are needed to make the electric vehicles switch more attractive and affordable.",
      "Sales of electric cars have been increasing - in October, they made up one out of every five cars registered. However, industry sources insist this is largely down to unsustainable discounting.",
      "Mike Hawes, chief executive of the SMMT, said the industry did not want to \"water down any commitments\", but said \"workable regulation - backed with incentives - will set us up for success\".",
      "The SMMT said Stellantis's announcement was a \"major concern to UK automotive manufacturing but, most importantly, to the livelihoods of many\".",
      "The government said it was backing the car industry with more than \u00a3300m to \"drive uptake of zero-emission vehicles\"."

    "story": [
      "Is Donald Trump serious about tariffs? This has been the question hanging over not just world markets but the whole world of economics.",
      "The popular wisdom had become that he wasn\u2019t really that serious, and the key bit of evidence for that was his nomination of hedge fund investor Scott Bessent as his Treasury Secretary, someone seen as a moderate when it came to tariffs compared with others whose names were floated for the role.",
      "The answer overnight, though, was pretty brutal. Yes, he is serious, and in the most unexpected way. By choosing to target Mexico and Canada as well as China, he is confirming threats made on the campaign trail that appeared the most fanciful.",
      "For starters he is willing to blow up the Mexico-Canada-America trade deal that he signed in his first term on day one of his second term.",
      "What does a Trump free trade deal even mean now, if the new White House is willing to put tariffs on your country anyway?",
      "And importantly, the rationale for these moves is not mainly or even much about trade or economic policy. These tariffs are about getting Mexico, Canada and China to alter their policies on crackdowns over migration and illicit drugs.",
      "Trump is using tariffs as a weapon of diplomacy, even coercion, on topics entirely unrelated to global trade.",
      "Are the leaders of G20 nations with their own domestic audiences really going to roll over in order to give the new president a win?",
      "They could choose to wait out the inevitable impact of Trump applying a 25% increase on the cost of two-fifths of US imports on US consumers and inflation.",
      "Trump vows tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China on day one",
      "Would Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs hurt US consumers?",
      "The cost of washing machines in the US rose 12% or by about $86, after Trump hit foreign-made machines with a 50% tariff during his first term. Such increases, no matter how modest, run counter to Trump's promises during the campaign to bring down the cost of living.",
      "But though Americans might be more sensitive to price rises now than they were in 2018, the political appetite for tariffs should not be underestimated.",
      "Joe Biden criticised the tariffs Trump put in place on Chinese imports during his first term. But once in office himself, President Biden left the measures in place, even expanding them in targeted ways.",
      "What is also clear is that Trump's selection of Bessent as Treasury Secretary will not temper the tariff push.",
      "Amid the battle for his nomination he went out of his way to acknowledge the power of tariffs as a tool that had been pioneered by Alexander Hamilton himself, the first ever US Treasury Secretary.",
      "But earlier this year he had also suggested that while tariffs might be used tactically, the main tool for the US rejuvenation of manufacturing would be a cheaper dollar.",
      "Europe and the UK have been spared for now. But it is important to reiterate that these moves are not even the real bulk of the tariff policy outlined by Trump.",
      "He wants to fundamentally change the global economic map, and reduce China and Europe\u2019s trade surplus with the US, which he views as \u201cripping off America\u201d.",
      "The world is far more complicated now, however, than these binary economic relationships. The US is undoubtedly powerful enough to start rebalancing world trade.",
      "Push things too far though, especially with G7 and G20 allies, and the US might find itself rather too isolated."

      "Boeing, Nike and Starbucks have all changed their chief executives in recent months. But just how important is the person in the top job for the successful running of such huge companies?",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s only one cat who\u2019s on the hot seat,\u201d says Alan Lafley, who was CEO of global consumer goods giant Procter & Gamble from 2000 to 2010, and then again from 2013 to 2015.",
      "With P&G selling everything from Pampers nappies, to Head & Shoulders shampoo, and Fairy washing up liquid, it has more than five billion customers around the world. And its workforce now exceeds 107,000 people.",
      "Mr Lafley equates leading a firm of that vast size with being the manager of one of England\u2019s Premier League football teams. Specifically, he says the job comes with the same risk of being sacked if results are not as good as expected.",
      "\u201cWith the football players, if they have a bad season, they're not gone,\u201d he says. \u201cInstead it is the coach or manager that\u2019s going to go.\u201d",
      "Coffee giant Starbucks announced a change of CEO in August, following falling sales caused by factors including a complicated menu, tough competition in China, and boycotts linked to the war in the Middle East. The hope is that new boss Brian Niccol can transform the firm\u2019s fortunes.",
      "To lure him away from the success he was enjoying running US restaurant chain Chipotle, Starbucks is paying him more than $100m (\u00a379m) in his first year, plus the use of a private jet to allow him to commute 1,000 miles from his home in California to the firm\u2019s head office in Seattle, Washington state.",
      "\u201cIt's pretty obvious that there's a big hope for him and his ability to turn that company around,\u201d says executive coach Alisa Cohn, who explains that top pay packages are set by a company\u2019s board of directors, and reflect their expectations of the CEO they\u2019re appointing.",
      "Investors welcomed Mr Niccol\u2019s appointment  with a 24.5% jump in Starbucks share price the day it was announced. The same day Chipotle fell 7.5%.",
      "Mr Niccol is now continuing efforts to simplify Starbucks\u2019 menu.",
      "\u201cCEOs are the ones who are setting the strategy for the company,\u201d adds Ms Cohn. \u201cThey're the ones setting the culture for the company, and, truthfully, the buck stops with them in terms of their accountability.\u201d",
      "Marcia Kilgore is a Canadian entrepreneur behind skincare brands Soap & Glory and Beauty Pie, plus footwear firm Fitflop. She says that the role of CEO is complicated, demanding, and critical to a company\u2019s success.",
      "\u201cYou need to have somebody who can really look at the different streams of work that need to be done, and make those organised and prioritised,\u201d she adds.",
      "\u201cAnd someone who can make sure that the different teams in the company are working together harmoniously, and ensuring that time is not wasted, money is not wasted, and energy is not wasted on things that are not going to move the dial for the company.\u201d",
      "The failure to make the right choices and lead teams in the right direction was why Mr Lafley became the boss of P&G in 2000.",
      "His predecessor Durk Jager resigned as a result of the failure of a huge global restructuring that he led. Cutting 15,000 jobs and 10 factories was meant to increase profits, but instead led to repeated profit warnings and a steep share price collapse.",
      "Mr Lafley says that as CEO it\u2019s not about doing everything yourself, but \u201cenabling and empowering everybody in the organisation\u201d to do what needs to be done.",
      "\u201cWe had 100,000 people looking to the new CEO to tell them two things \u2013 \u2018what happened?\u2019, and \u2018what are we going to do next?\u2019.\u201d",
      "He explains that he decided to refocus the firm on serving customers and innovating new products, telling staff that \u201cI have confidence that we\u2019re all going to get us out of where we are and back on track\u201d.",
      "Mr Lafley adds that clearly communicating his plans with employees was so \u201chugely important\u201d that in those pre-Zoom days he flew around the world to meet staff in person.",
      "Inspiration and communication are also seemingly at the heart of the approach of new Nike CEO Elliott Hill. On getting the job in September he wrote to staff telling them he had \u201cgreat confidence in his team and our future together\u201d despite years of falling sales.",
      "Ms Cohn who has worked with companies including Google, Etsy and Johnson & Johnson says that whatever the plans of a new CEO, confidence is vital for any success.",
      "\u201cThe most important quality that you need to be the CEO is knowing that you will be able to be the CEO,\u201d she says. \u201cThere is a sense of confidence, and healthy ego that you need to bring to the table.",
      "\u201cThe second thing you need to bring to the table is an ability to adapt. You've got to be able to assess the situation, make some important decisions, and then adapt them as you go\u201d.",
      "It\u2019s not something she thinks can always be taught, which is why she says so many people get \"stuck\" at lower levels in a company. Ms Cohn adds: \u201cYou need to develop your own sort of internal state to know that you can handle the pressure, the difficulty, the spotlight\u201d.",
      "That pressure is one the reasons why top CEO\u2019s are often compensated with huge pay packages. When it comes to the S&P 500 group of the US\u2019s biggest companies last year, the top earner was Hock Tan at Broadcom who got $162m, followed by Nikesh Arora with $151m at cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks, and Stephen Schwarzman with $120m at investment giant Blackstone.",
      "The average for an S&P500 CEO last year was a record $16.3m, according to executive consultants Equilar. It means they are getting 196 times as much as the average worker at their companies and critics says CEO\u2019s aren\u2019t worth that much more than their staff.",
      "\u201cThis is based on the foolish notion that the person in the corner office is somehow almost single-handedly responsible for corporate value,\u201d says Sarah Anderson from the Washington based progressive think tank the Institute for Policy Studies.",
      "She think it\u2019s a problem that is getting worse, and spreading around the world.  \u201cI think runaway CEO pay is bad for our economy, bad for democracy and bad for business,\u201d she adds.",
      "Mr Lafley agrees that the ratio between staff and CEOs\u2019 pay is \u201ctoo high\u201d, but reasons that firms are having to compete to attract the best talent.",
      "He thinks the answer lies in paying CEOs \u201ca rather modest basic salary, and then everything else is incentive\u201d.",
      "\u201cIn the end, it's sort of like a coach. If you're not motivating people, and you're not enabling them to do what you're asking them to do, then you're not doing the job.\u201d",

      "He was also part of the thinking to famously drop the donuts from Dunkin' to move \"to a first-name basis with America\", given it was also one of the country's the biggest coffee sellers.",
      "He says rebrands occur generally when a company wants to \"shift\" its business strategy, which is what Jaguar is doing in its move to electric-only cars.",
      "In an \"ideal world\" the rebrand leads to buzz and a positive reaction, Mr Rolston adds, but to achieve that you need to \"make sure people understand the context\".",
      "\"Don\u2019t ever just launch a logo - when people see a logo they tend to subjectively respond to it. It\u2019s always good to show as much as you can,\" he explains.",
      "\"Unless you want that response. Maybe Jaguar did actually want this kind of response,\" Mr Rolston ponders.",
      "As a result of Jaguar's rebrand strategy to tease and drip feed information of its plans, a void has been created, and that has been \"filled by opinion\", Mr Rolston says.",
      "\u201cThey have taken a very brave route - it\u2019s one that very, very few brands ever do take because it\u2019s very risky, but time will tell.\"",
      "It's not new to not include a product in an ad or to raise eyebrows - the gorilla beating the drums to Phil Collins didn't feature any Cadbury's chocolate, for example.",
      "Keith Wells, founder and director of brand strategy business Brandwell, points out Apple's \"think different\" advert in 1997 which, rather than showcasing its computers, instead featured the likes of Albert Einstein and Mahatma Gandhi.",
      "However, Mr Wells has first-hand experience of a rebrand backlash. Remember Consignia? (Readers under the age of 40 can be forgiven for not).",
      "In 2001, he led the consultancy Dragon Brands, which came up with the new  corporate name for the Post Office Group. The aim was to create a new, modern umbrella brand for the restructured organisation, which included not just the Post Office, but Royal Mail and Parcelforce too.",
      "But the creation of Consignia led to a backlash from the public, largely due to people misinterpreting the rebrand.",
      "Some people thought Post Office branches would be renamed Consignia, which wasn't the case.",
      "Nonetheless, the negativity, and a new leadership team, eventually led to Consignia being canned, and being renamed Royal Mail plc 16 months later.",
      "While Jaguar isn't changing its name, Mr Wells says the brand has taken a \"huge, bold step\" and people should give \"respect and time\" to see how things pan out.",
      "Mr Rolston said \"branding logic\" suggests companies \"lean into\" their current perception with the public, but Jaguar appears to have shunned that.",
      "\"Everything they have put out so far is not like a Jaguar. The question is, if it\u2019s not a Jaguar as you used to know it, what is it?\"",
      "Jaguar argues its rebrand can been traced back to the words of its founder, Sir William Lyons, that \"A Jaguar should be a copy of nothing\".",
      "'Something has to change'",
      "But it's clear, as Erin Baker, editorial director at AutoTrader puts it, that the carmaker is trying to ditch the \"sage\" image, that its cars are only for older, white men, who perhaps frequent golf clubs, or wear cravats and smoke cigars.",
      "\"It\u2019s been languishing in terms of sales for years now,\" she said. \"Something has to change fundamentally with the brand.\"",
      "But Ms Baker is a fan of the rebrand ad. \"I think it needs to really stir emotion, it needs to stir curiosity, get people asking questions,\" she says.",
      "Jaguar has been the weakest link within the Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) group owned by Tata Motors for almost a decade, with The Range Rover and Defender behind the company's highest profits.",
      "Ms Baker believes Jaguar's radical rebrand is a final attempt to revive it. But what happens if it doesn't pay off?",
      "\"I am not sure what else they can do,\" adds Ms Baker. \"It\u2019s a very risky move to go pure electric in 2026 when sales of electric cars the world over have largely stalled amongst private buyers.",
      "\"But the truth is...no one has an idea if this is going to succeed or not.\"",

    "summary": "Makers of a new generation of European electric aircraft are struggling to raise money.",
    "story": [
      "One of the innovations at this year's Paris Olympics was supposed to be an electric flying taxi service.",
      "Germany's Volocopter promised its electric-powered, two-seater aircraft, the VoloCity, would be ferrying passengers around the city.",
      "It never happened. Instead the company ran demonstration flights.",
      "While missing that deadline was embarrassing, behind the scenes a more serious issue was playing out - Volocopter was urgently trying to raise fresh investment to keep the firm going.",
      "Talks to borrow \u20ac100m (\u00a383m; $106m) from the government failed in April.",
      "Now hopes are pinned on China's Geely, which is in talks to take an 85% stake in Volocopter in return for $95m of funding, according to a Bloomberg report. The deal could mean that any future manufacturing would be moved to China.",
      "Volocopter is one of dozens of companies around the world developing an electric vertical take-off and landing (EVTOL) aircraft.",
      "Their machines promise the flexibility of a helicopter, but without the cost, noise and emissions.",
      "However, faced with the massive cost of getting such novel aircraft approved by regulators and then building up manufacturing capabilities, some investors are bailing out.",
      "One of the most high-profile casualties is Lilium.",
      "The German company had developed a radical take on the EVTOL theme.",
      "Lilium's aircraft uses 30 electric jets that can be tilted in unison to swing between vertical lift and forward flight.",
      "The concept proved attractive, with the company claiming to have orders and memoranda of understanding for 780 jets from around the world.",
      "It was able to demonstrate the technology using a remote controlled scale model. Construction had begun on the first full-sized jets, and testing had been due to begin in early 2025.",
      "As recently as the Farnborough Airshow in July, Lilium\u2019s COO Sebastian Borel was sounding confident.",
      "\u201cWe are definitely burning through cash,\" he told the BBC. \u201cBut this is a good sign, because it means we are producing the aircraft. We\u2019re going to have three aircraft in production by the end of the year, and we have also raised \u20ac1.5bn\u201d.",
      "But then the money ran out.",
      "Lilium had been attempting to arrange a loan worth \u20ac100m from the German development bank, KfW. However, that required guarantees from national and state governments, which never materialised.",
      "In early November, the company put its main operating businesses into insolvency proceedings, and its shares were removed from the Nasdaq stock exchange.",
      "For the moment, work on the new aircraft is continuing, as the company works with restructuring experts to sell the business or bring in new investment. However, getting the new e-jet into production is looking more challenging than ever.",
      "The high-profile British player in the eVTOL market is Vertical Aerospace. The Bristol-based company was founded in 2016 by businessman Stephen Fitzpatrick, who also set up OVO Energy.",
      "Its striking VX4 design uses eight large propellers mounted on slim, aircraft style wings to generate lift. Mr Fitzpatrick has made ambitious claims about the aircraft, suggesting it would be \u201c100 times\u201d safer and quieter than a helicopter, for 20% of the cost.",
      "The company has made progress. After completing a programme of remote-controlled testing, it began carrying out piloted tests earlier this year. Initially, these were carried out with the aircraft tethered to the ground. In early November, it carried out its first untethered take-off and landing.",
      "But there have also been serious setbacks. In August last year, a remotely-piloted prototype was badly damaged when it crashed during testing at Cotswold Airport, after a propeller blade fell off.",
      "In May one of its key partners, the engineering giant Rolls Royce pulled out of a deal to supply electric motors for the aircraft.",
      "Ambitions remain sky high. Vertical Aerospace says it will deliver 150 aircraft to its customers by the end of the decade. By then, it also expects to be capable of producing 200 units a year, and to be breaking even in cash terms.",
      "But the company has been through financial challenges and recently agreed a rescue deal with its biggest creditor, US based Mudrick Capital.",
      "Under the deal, Mudrick will invest up to $50m in Verticial , meanwhile $130m of loans from Mudrick will be converted into shares.",
      "That will leave the US investment firm with a 70% stake in Vertical, while Mr Fitzpatrick's stake falls from 70% to 20%.",
      "\"This comprehensive deal - alongside the recent piloted flight campaign...  means Vertical is positioned to be a winner in one of the 21st century\u2019s most exciting technologies,\" Mr Fitzpatrick said in a statement accompanying the deal.",
      "Amid the turbulence, one European project is quietly on track, says Bjorn Fehrm who has a background in aeronautical engineering and piloted combat jets for the Swedish Air Force. He now works for aerospace consultancy Leeham.",
      "He says that the EVTOL project underway at Airbus is likely to survive.",
      "Called the CityAirbus NextGen, the four-seater aircraft has eight propellers and a range of 80km.",
      "\"This is a technology project for their engineers, and they've got the money, and they've got the know how,\" says Mr Fehrm.",
      "Elsewhere in the world, other well funded start-ups stand a good change of getting their aircraft into production. That would include Joby and Archer in the US.",
      "Once the aircraft are being produced, the next challenge will be to see if there's a profitable market for them.",
      "The first routes are likely to be between airports and city centres. But will they make money?",
      "\"The biggest problem area when it comes to the cost of operation is the pilot and the batteries. You need to change the batteries a couple of times per year,\" points out Mr Fehrm.",
      "Given all the uncertainty and expense, you might wonder why investors put money into new electric aircraft in the first place.",

    "summary": "Police have said staff will not face action over abuse of autistic children shown in videos leaked to the BBC.",
    "story": [
      "CCTV from a school obtained by the BBC shows autistic children being shoved into padded rooms, thrown to the floor, restrained by the neck - or left alone, sitting in vomit.",
      "The footage from Whitefield School in north-east London resembles \"torture\", one safeguarding expert told us. It shows for the first time the reality of what pupils faced.",
      "A police investigation into the abuse footage, taken inside the special school's \"calming rooms\" between 2014 and 2017, ended earlier this year without any charges. However, parents say they have been left to deal with the trauma.",
      "The school says new leadership found the footage after the rooms had been shut and shared it with the police.",
      "About 40 children with learning disabilities and severe mental disorders were confined for hours in the rooms - typically without food or drink.",
      "Six of the families have agreed for the BBC to show the footage. They wanted us to reveal the scale and severity of the trauma their children had experienced - which they feel they have been misled about.",
      "The videos show pupils, many of whom were non-verbal, clearly in acute distress, and many are seen to injure themselves for prolonged periods.",
      "In the footage seen by the BBC, the only time staff at the school in Walthamstow intervene once children are inside the rooms is when a boy repeatedly throws his shoes at the CCTV cameras. They race in to stop him, with one teaching assistant apparently striking him.",
      "\u201cIt broke my heart,\u201d said the mother of one of the abused children after viewing the CCTV for the first time. \u201cYou wouldn't even do that to a dog.\u201d",
      "Even now government guidance says only that removing disruptive pupils from classrooms in England must be for a \u201climited\u201d duration and facilities must be \u201csuitable\u201d.",
      "The BBC has also found evidence of mistreatment in seclusion rooms at other schools across the UK. One autistic child was kept inside a cage.",
      "Meanwhile, local MP Sir Iain Duncan Smith said the Whitefield School footage \u201cmust lead to profound change\u201d and described it as \u201cjaw-dropping\u201d.",
      "Safeguarding expert Elizabeth Swan said it was \u201ceasily the worst footage\u201d she had seen.",
      "\u201cYou look at the children and they're being defeated and responding to that treatment with self-injurious behaviour, it's torture,\u201d she said.",
      "Whitefield School was rated as outstanding until, in 2017, Ofsted discovered the use of bare, padded rooms without windows to seclude children.",
      "But the existence of the CCTV footage did not become public until 2021, when the BBC learned an investigation had been launched after the discovery of a box of USB memory sticks containing 500 hours of disturbing footage from inside the rooms.",
      "In April, we exposed how safeguarding investigations commissioned by the school had proven that six Whitefield staff had abused pupils - but they were not referred to the government\u2019s Disclosure and Barring Service, which can ban people from working with children, and three of them continued to work at the school.",
      "Since we began investigating, we have obtained leaked school and council documents, and spoken to 17 of the 39 affected families.",
      "Jamie\u2019s mother Deborah watched the calming room footage after police formally invited families to view the abuse, following our report in April.",
      "\u201cYou saw them open the door, whack Jamie in his back - he went flying on the floor,\u201d she said, fighting back tears.",
      "Jamie\u2019s coat and bag were placed inside the room with him. Deborah says this shows that it was \u201ccalculated\u201d that Jamie he would remain there until the end of the day, even if he calmed down.",
      "She says Jamie suffered his first ever seizure after he began being placed in the calming rooms and believes his treatment directly resulted in his epilepsy.",
      "Stress can contribute to the development of epilepsy or trigger seizures in those with the condition.",
      "Other families told the BBC their children developed PTSD after being placed in the calming rooms. One child\u2019s family said he suffered severe psychological damage and was later detained in a mental hospital because he was at risk of harming himself.",
      "Parents said they complained to the school about unexplained injuries and the use of the rooms - but this did not lead to investigation, even though the evidence from the CCTV cameras was available.",
      "\u201cIt's a cover-up from higher up,\u201d Deborah says. \u201cI don't see how they could get away with this level of abuse and no-one's accountable.\u201d",
      "Another family complained after their son repeatedly returned home with injuries to his nose. The CCTV leaked to the BBC shows the boy punching himself in the nose while alone inside the room.",
      "The BBC has spent months trying to find out who knew about concerns around the use of the rooms and why there was no investigation into the harm suffered by children in the calming rooms following Ofsted\u2019s 2017 visit.",
      "After the rooms were shut down, a review by a director of the trust running the school reported that governors and a staff member from the local council, Waltham Forest, had visited the rooms. But it did not record any concerns being raised at the time.",
      "The BBC has learned that the job of reviewing the CCTV was largely left to a single teaching assistant.",
      "Once a week, she downloaded the footage and compared it with written staff observations before sharing any incidents and concerns with bosses.",
      "But she failed to report many of the 20-plus clips showing excessive force - according to a school safeguarding investigation into her conduct, which concluded she turned a \u201cblind eye\u201d to the failings.",
      "It also found that she had abused a child herself by using a pad used for rugby training to push them into the corner of a room. Despite these findings, she was not sacked.",
      "'Left in a cage'",
      "She told the investigation that contacting the school\u2019s leadership was \u201chard to do as a teaching assistant\u201d and had become \u201cdesensitised\u201d to the footage, according to records of her interview obtained by the BBC.",
      "A different teaching assistant told the safeguarding investigator that she had seen footage of a colleague observing a child masturbating for over an hour. Police reported that they were unable to corroborate what she said.",
      "The BBC has also uncovered other failings affecting children with special educational needs placed in seclusion across the UK, with an autistic child being kept in a cage at one school about 10 years ago.",
      "The area below a stairwell was enclosed by a cage and another cage with a mattress inside at a school called Include in Bury St Edmunds, which offers alternative provision for children outside mainstream education and is run by the charity Catch22.",
      "The mother of the autistic child only discovered these cages were in use when she visited the school without an appointment, having grown concerned about the real nature of what was referred to as \u201cThe Den\u201d.",
      "She said the stairwell cage would be covered by a blanket when the child was shouting and that her son was sometimes kept inside one of these cages for up to six hours, without water or access to a toilet.",
      "\u201cEven an animal wouldn\u2019t have been left in a cage for that long\u201d, she says.",
      "Council records state that Ofsted were informed about what the mother found but there was no inspection. Ofsted now says it cannot find any record of a complaint.",
      "Catch22 says the spaces were used by previous leadership and a 2018 council report concluded that there was no proof pupils were locked inside.",
      "Regulation of the use and design of calming rooms is now urgently needed - according to Sir Iain Duncan-Smith.",
      "Following our investigation in April, the Children\u2019s Commissioner also called for changes to guidance on the use of seclusion in special schools - which has not happened. The Department for Education says it is \u201clooking\u201d at ways to \u201cstrengthen\u201d it.",
      "The Metropolitan Police says it continues to conduct \u201cwider enquiries\u201d about Whitefield, not relating to abuse. The Crown Prosecution Service declined to comment.",
      "The Flourish Trust, which runs Whitefield, says it has learned from the failings in this case.",
      "Ofsted says responsibility for investigating the harm caused to children following its discovery of the rooms lay with the Department for Education, as regulator, and Waltham Forest.",
      "Although it failed to investigate after Ofsted's inspection, Waltham Forest says it will now commission a local case review, which it says will be \u201cwholly independent\u201d. It says it had not asked to review CCTV at any point because it did not know it existed.",
      "Waltham Forest also says it has offered counselling to families. But the families told the BBC their children need significant and wide-ranging help to address the abuse they faced - and they will be living with its consequences for the rest of their lives.",

      "She added the group had faced \"mistreatment, not just towards us but also including our staff\", and said the group had experienced \"deliberate miscommunications and manipulation in multiple areas\".",
      "Ador maintains that its contract with NewJeans remains valid as it has not violated its duty and has asked the group to \"continue their activities\" with the agency.",
      "\"A unilateral claim that trust has been broken does not constitute valid grounds for termination of a contract,\" Ador said in the statement after the group's announcement.",
      "\"We regret that the press conference on the termination of the contract took place without sufficient consideration, and even before we gave our response to the demand letter,\" the agency said.",
      "NewJeans said they would like to work with Min, the group's former mastermind  who left Ador in August following accusations that she had planned to split from Hybe, taking NewJeans with her.",
      "This would have made NewJeans and Ador independent of Hybe. Min has denied the accusations against her.",
      "She has previously accused Hybe of launching another girl group, Illit, that was copying NewJeans' music and appearance.",
      "On 13 November, NewJeans filed a legal notice to Ador demanding the company resolve breaches of their exclusive contracts within 14 days.",
      "They said that failure to meet their demands would result in the termination of their contracts.",
      "The group has asked for an apology for a comment allegedly made by an executive at Belift Lab, another subsidiary of Hybe, and accused the company of workplace bullying. They have also asked for the immediate reinstatement of Min.",
      "They added that they would fulfil their contractual obligations, but at the conference warned their fans they might not be able to use the band's name after the contract terminates.",
      "Prior to the NewJeans' announcement, the band were committed to a seven-year contract, which runs out in 2029.",
      "The contract includes a clause specifying that parties can unilaterally terminate the contract if the other has violated its duty. However, the matter is likely to go to court as both sides do not agree. In such a scenario, a judge would decide if the contract can be terminated and if one side owes the other any damages.",
      "In October, the K-pop news site Koreaboo estimated that the members would have to pay about 300bn South Korean Won (about \u00a3170m) to terminate the contract early.",
      "But group singer Haerin said it made \"no sense\" that the group would be liable to pay a contract breach fee.",
      "\"We never broke any rules,\u201d Haerin said. \u201cWe did nothing but try our best - they are the ones at fault. Hybe and Ador are the ones responsible.\"",

      "In October, a member of the group, Hanni, 20, testified at the Labour Committee of South Korea's National Assembly at a hearing about workplace harassment.",
      "She alleged that entertainment agency Hybe had deliberately undermined her band, and accused senior managers of deliberately ignoring her.",
      "Following several incidents, she said: \"I came to the realisation that this wasn\u2019t just a feeling. I was honestly convinced that the company hated us.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 28 Nov 2024 02:40:03 GMT",
    "summary": "The musician says winning the Mercury Prize helped put an end to his \"desperate\" search for approval.",
    "story": [
      "When Michael Kiwanuka was nominated for the Mercury Prize in 2020, he thought he knew the deal.",
      "He'd been up for the prestigious album award twice before. Like most artists, he said it was an honour to be nominated. A win would be nice, but not particularly life-changing.",
      "He was wrong.",
      "When Annie Mac ambushed him on The One Show to reveal it was third time lucky, a switch was flipped.",
      "\"It sort of woke me up,\" the singer-songwriter reveals.",
      "\"I'd been desperately looking for approval from my peers and certain [media] outlets - and the Mercury freed me from that desperation.",
      "\"It allowed me to feel that, actually, I just want to make the records that come naturally.\"",
      "The realisation was particularly powerful because his winning album, simply titled Kiwanuka, had grappled with his sense of inferiority as a musician, a black man, a partner and a friend.",
      "External validation didn't silence the voices in his head - but it gave him a healthy dose of perspective.",
      "\"When you have impostor syndrome and you\u2019re busy beating yourself up, you're actually using up all your energy doing that, as opposed to being like, 'Wow, how amazing it is to be making my own record?', or, 'How amazing that I'm playing the Pyramid Stage [at Glastonbury]?'",
      "\"The list is so long of how cool this job is, and I spent most of my time moaning. Winning the Mercury kicked off that feeling of, oh, I've got to sort this out.\"",
      "You could see that newfound freedom when he played at Glastonbury in June. Basking in the late afternoon sun, the 37-year-old took to the stage wearing a bright white kanzu robe - a traditional tunic from Uganda, where his parents are from.",
      "And when a malfunctioning synthesizer forced him to abort a performance of his new song Small Changes, the former perfectionist just laughed it off.",
      "\"I could hear my friend Joe laughing, and I sort of forgot I was on the Pyramid Stage,\" he recalls.",
      "\"A second later, I heard the crowd cheer, and it lifted me up off the ground.",
      "\"It was an amazing feeling. I felt like I had a massive battery pack from these people. I could do no wrong. Wherever I went, they would hold me up.\"",
      "Afterwards, the musician realised that one simple moment of fallibility had put the audience on his side.",
      "\"They saw the real me for a second, rather than what I thought people wanted to see,\" he reflects. \"It was really eye-opening.\"",
      "It\u2019s a little odd to hear the musician describe himself as a people pleaser.",
      "Since the release of his debut album Home Again in 2012, his music has worked in opposition to the trend-chasing virality of modern pop. His grooves are unhurried and thoughtful, his lyrics deeply introspective, and his inspirations - such as Isaac Hayes, Bill Withers and Marvin Gaye - decidedly old-school.",
      "His second album, Love & Hate, brought him to international attention after its opening track, Cold Little Heart, was picked to be the opening theme for hit TV show Big Little Lies,  starring Reese Witherspoon and Nicole Kidman.",
      "Kiwanuka, released in 2019, earned him the Mercury Prize and his first Grammy Award nomination. But the densely-arranged, sumptuous soul often pushed his voice back in the mix \u2013 something he has confronted on his latest record, Small Changes.",
      "\"I fell in love with my voice again, which sounds weird,\" he says. \"But I realised being able to sing, and to have a voice that sounds good on recording, is a blessing.",
      "\"So I started to want that to be heard more than all the other stuff - the drums or the guitars or the strings. And that really aided the sound of the record.\"",
      "Chart battle",
      "The result is his smallest, most understated album to date. Aided once again by producers Inflo and Danger Mouse, he has created a suite of spacious, slow-burning confessionals that compel you to lean in and pay attention, slowly revealing their beauty on repeated listens.",
      "Reviews have been ecstatic. Awarding a score of 9/10, Uncut magazine called it \"rich, moving and inventive\", while Dork said the \"perfectly-balanced\" collection was \"genuine, gracious, and absolutely first-class\".",
      "The record is locked in a two-way battle for this week's UK number one album with Kendrick Lamar\u2019s surprise release GNX \u2013 but you get the impression Kiwunka won't pay too much attention to chart positions.",
      "For him, fulfilment came in the studio, surrounded by some of his favourite musicians -  including legendary bassist Pino Palladino and Janet Jackson\u2019s producer Jimmy Jam, who popped in to say hello and ended up contributing organ parts to half of the record.",
      "Each song is about a small change Kiwanuka has made in his life - confronting depression, rediscovering the innocence of childhood, and weathering the ups and downs of marriage.",
      "His languorous voice can tend towards the melancholy, but the lyrics are full of hope. \u201cSmall changes solve the problems,\u201d he sings on the title track.",
      "Despite that, the album was written during a period of major upheaval, as Kiwanuka moved away from London, became a father, and stared down the barrel of middle age.",
      "\"I realised, at the age of 37, it\u2019s the first time I can talk about something that happened 10 years ago, and I was still an adult,\" he laughs.",

      "Mr Combs is being held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, New York, charged with racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking, and transportation for prostitution.",
      "He has entered a plea of not guilty and has also denied more than two dozen sexual assault accusations lodged in a flurry of civil lawsuits.",

      "They claimed Mr Combs had encouraged his children to post a video on social media featuring their birthday celebration with the aim of swaying prospective jurors.",
      "Allegedly, Mr Combs sent hundreds of text messages using an app called ContactMeASAP, marketed as \"an innovative text messaging service for federal inmates to communicate with loved ones via real-time messages\".",

      "The song was widely regarded as the decisive blow in a long-running feud between the two rappers, who had been trading barbs in their songs since the early 2010s.",
      "Debuting at number one on the US chart, it has also been nominated for four Grammy Awards, including song of the year.",
      "Drake responded with a track called The Heart Part 6, in which he denied accusations of sexual misconduct and claimed to have fed Lamar \"false\" information through a double agent. However, the musician later deleted the track from his Instagram feed.",

      "The single is just the latest in a series of headline-grabbing antics the Liberal Democrats have deployed in recent years.",

      "Reverend and The Makers are putting out Late Night Phonecall to support the Samaritans.",
      "Although Sir Ed may be challenging some big names, there is a fine tradition of choirs making it to number one at Christmas - so he may have chosen a perfect musical coalition by teaming up with the Bath Philharmonia's Young Carers' Choir.",

      "These days the Official Charts Company uses a formula to combine CD and vinyl sales with downloads, streams and YouTube views, giving greater weight to actual sales (physical or downloaded).",
      "As part of the formula, a song needs to be streamed 100 times on a paid-for subscription service to be worth the same as one download sale. For free video and audio streams, 600 plays are required.",
      "But so many classic songs are played relentlessly at parties and on people\u2019s playlists that those streams tot up quickly \u2013 which means the top of the festive charts tends to be dominated by the likes of Mariah Carey\u2019s All I Want for Christmas and the Pogues and Kirsty MacColl with Fairytale of New York.",
      "A year ago, Last Christmas by Wham! was the Christmas number one, 39 years after its release - and that song is the bookmakers\u2019 clear favourite to do so again this year.",
      "Wham! racked up 13.3 million streams a year ago to clinch that accolade \u2013 so if over the next few weeks we notice Sir Ed and his fellow Lib Dems frantically tapping at their phones, we will know the reason why."

    "story": [
      "Forty years on from the original recording, the cream of British and Irish pop music past and present are once again asking whether Ethiopians know it is Christmas.",
      "In 1984, responding to horrific images of the famine in northern Ethiopia broadcast on the BBC, musicians Bob Geldof and Midge Ure corralled some of the biggest stars of the era to record a charity song.",
      "The release of the Band Aid single, and the Live Aid concert that followed eight months later, became seminal moments in celebrity fundraising and set a template that many others followed.",
      "Do They Know It\u2019s Christmas? is back on Monday with a fresh mix of the four versions of the song that have been issued over the years.",
      "But the chorus of disapproval about the track, its stereotypical representation of an entire continent - describing it as a place \"where nothing ever grows; no rain nor rivers flow\" - and the way that recipients of the aid have been viewed as emaciated, helpless figures, has become louder over time.",
      "\"To say: 'Do they know it\u2019s Christmas?\u2019 is funny, it is insulting,\" says Dawit Giorgis, who in 1984 was the Ethiopian official responsible for getting the message out about what was happening in his country.",
      "His incredulity decades on is obvious in his voice and he remembers how he and his colleagues responded to the song.",
      "\"It was so untrue and so distorted. Ethiopia was a Christian country before England\u2026 we knew Christmas before your ancestors,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "But Mr Dawit has no doubt that the philanthropic response to the BBC film, by British journalist Michael Buerk and Kenyan cameraman Mohamed Amin, saved lives.",
      "As the head of Ethiopia's Relief and Rehabilitation Commission he had managed to smuggle the TV crew into the country. This was despite the government at that time, which was marking 10 years of Marxist rule and fighting a civil war, not wanting news of the famine to get out.",
      "\"The way the British people responded so generously strengthened my faith in humanity,\" he says, speaking from Namibia where he now works.",
      "He praises the \"young and passionate people\" behind Band Aid - describing them as \"amazing\".",
      "His questioning of the song, whilst also recognising its impact, sums up the debate for many who might feel that when lives need to be saved the ends justify the means.",
      "Geldof was typically robust in defending it responding to a recent article in The Conversation about the \"problematic Christmas hit\".",
      "\"It\u2019s a pop song [expletive]\u2026 The same argument has been made many times over the years and elicits the same wearisome response,\"  he is quoted as saying.",
      "\"This little pop song has kept hundreds of thousands if not millions of people alive.\"",
      "He also recognises that Ethiopians celebrate Christmas but says that in 1984 \"ceremonies were abandoned\".",

      "He adds that Band Aid\u2019s swift action as a \"first responder\" encourages others to donate where funds are lacking, especially in northern Ethiopia, which is once again emerging from a civil war.",
      "But this is not enough to dampen the disquiet.",
      "In the last week, Ed Sheeran has said he is not happy about his voice from the 2014 recording - made to raise funds for the West African Ebola crisis - being used as his \"understanding of the narrative associated with this has changed\".",

      "\"I go to Ghana every Christmas\u2026 every December so we know there\u2019s peace and joy in Africa this Christmas, we know there isn\u2019t death in every tear.\"",

      "The way that Africans were portrayed in this and other fundraising efforts had had a direct effect on him, he said.",
      "When growing up \"it was not cool to be African in the UK\u2026 [because of] the way that I looked, people were making fun of me\", the singer said.",
      "Research into the impact of charity fundraisers by British-Nigerian King\u2019s College lecturer Edward Ademolu backs this up.",
      "He himself remembers the short films shot in Africa by Comic Relief, which had been influenced by Band Aid, and that his \"African peers at [a British] primary school would passionately deny their African roots, calling all Africans - with great certainty - smelly, unintelligent and equated them to wild animals\".",
      "Images of dangerously thin Africans became common currency in efforts to elicit funds.",
      "The cover for the original Band Aid single, designed by pop artist Sir Peter Blake, features colourful Christmas scenes contrasted with two gaunt Ethiopian children, in black and white, each eating what looks like a life-saving biscuit.",
      "For part of the poster for the Live Aid concert the following year, Sir Peter used a photograph of the back of an anonymous, naked, skeletal child.",
      "That image was used again in the art work for the 2004 release and it has appeared once more this year.",
      "For many working in the aid sector, as well as academics who study it, there is shock and surprise that the song and its imagery keep coming back.",
      "The umbrella body Bond, which works with more than 300 charities including Christian Aid, Save the Children and Oxfam, has been very critical of the release of the new mix.",
      "\"Initiatives like Band Aid 40 perpetuate outdated narratives, reinforce racism and colonial attitudes that strip people of their dignity and agency,\" Lena Bheeroo, Bond\u2019s head of anti-racism and equity, said in a statement.",
      "Geldof had previously dismissed the idea that Band Aid's work was relying on \"colonial tropes\".",
      "The way that charities raise funds has undergone big changes in recent years.",
      "While remaining critical, Kenyan satirist and writer Patrick Gathara, who often mocks Western views of Africa, agrees things have shifted.",
      "\"There has been a push within humanitarian agencies to start seeing people in a crisis first as human beings and not as victims, and I think that\u2019s a big, big change,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "\"In the days of Live Aid, all you really had were these images of starvation and suffering\u2026 the idea that these are people were incapable of doing anything for themselves and that was always a misconception.\"",
      "The fallout from the Black Lives Matter protests added impetus to the change that was already happening.",
      "A decade ago, a Norwegian organisation Radi-Aid made it its mission to highlight the way that Africa and Africans were presented in fundraising campaigns using humour.",
      "For example, it co-ordinated a mock campaign to get Africans to send radiators to Norwegians who were supposedly suffering in the cold.",
      "In 2017, Sheeran himself won one of their \"Rusty Radiator\" awards for a film he made for Comic Relief in Liberia in which he offered to pay for some homeless Liberian children to be put up in a hotel room.",
      "The organisers of the awards said \"the video should be less about Ed shouldering the burden alone but rather appealing to the wider world to step in\".",
      "University of East Anglia academic David Girling, who once wrote a report for Radi-Aid, argues that its work is one of the reasons that things have shifted.",
      "More and more charities are introducing ethical guidelines for their campaigns, he says.",
      "\"People have woken up to the damage that can be caused,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "Prof Girling\u2019s own research, carried out in Kibera, a slum area in Kenya\u2019s capital, Nairobi, showed that campaigns involving and centred on those who are the targets of the charitable assistance could be more effective than the traditional top down efforts.",
      "Many charities are still under pressure to use celebrities to help raise awareness and money. The professor says that some media outlets will not touch a fundraising story unless a celebrity is involved.",
      "But work by his colleague Martin Scott suggests that big stars can often distract from the central message of a campaign. Whereas the celebrity might benefit, the charity and the understanding of the issue that it is working on lose out.",
      "If a Band Aid-type project were to get off the ground now it would have to be centred on African artists, music journalist Christine Ochefu tells the BBC.",
      "\"The landscape for African artists and African music has changed so much that if there was a new release it would need to come from Afrobeats artists or amapiano artists or Afro-pop artists,\" she argues",
      "\"I don\u2019t think people could get away without thinking about the sentiment and imagery associated with the project and it couldn\u2019t continue the saviour narrative that Band Aid had.\"",
      "As King's College academic Dr Ademolu argues: \"Perhaps it's time to abandon the broken record and start anew - a fresh tune where Africa isn\u2019t just a subject, but a co-author, harmonising its own story.\"",

      "For the first time in almost a decade, MPs will on Friday debate and vote on whether terminally ill people should have the right to end their lives.",
      "If MPs vote in favour of assisted dying, it could lead to a significant change to society in the UK, on a par with reforms around the death penalty, divorce, abortion and gay marriage.",
      "MPs last voted on this deeply sensitive issue nearly a decade ago, when they comprehensively rejected the idea. But it is hard to predict how a House of Commons, filled with many first-time MPs and given a free vote on the matter, will approach such a significant debate.",
      "Jan Butterworth wants the choice to end her life. She has advanced endometrial cancer and has been told she has less than six months to live.",
      "She witnessed her husband\u2019s death from liver cancer 30 years ago and does not want to go the same way. \u201cIt was a very difficult and very distressing death,\u201d she says.",
      "Under the proposed new law, people like Jan - who have been told they have less than six months to live - would be able to access drugs to end their lives, but only with the agreement of two doctors and a High Court judge who would review the decision.",
      "Jan would like to die at home with her son and daughter by her side but she knows that isn\u2019t likely, even if the bill does pass, because she only has months to live.",
      "\u201cIt leaves me with a very poor set of options,\u201d she says. \u201cWe should make it right for people, give them the opportunity to have a smooth passing \u2013 a comfortable death.\u201d",

      "\u201cMy absolute worry is that if I am in a position like I was two years ago, where I was in so much excruciating pain, and I don\u2019t have someone with me, I could potentially make the wrong decision,\u201d she tells us. \u201cAnd the wrong decision is not something you can come back from. You\u2019re dead.\u201d",
      "Her view is partly informed by her religious beliefs but also that the bill would be a danger to people with disabilities or terminal illnesses.",
      "It\u2019s an argument often made by opponents of the legislation and especially those who live with disabilities. They are concerned the proposed law would devalue the lives of many vulnerable people.",
      "Becki shares those fears. She says it would open the door to people being subjected to coercive control or being pressured to end their lives prematurely.",
      "\u201cThis law potentially puts people in a position where they think they are a burden and the easy option is to end their life. That\u2019s very worrying, especially at a time when people are at their most vulnerable.\u201d",
      "The proposed bill in England and Wales comes with safeguards supporters say will make it the strictest set of rules in the world",

      "Parkinson\u2019s is not considered a terminal illness. It is a condition affecting specific parts of the brain that become progressively damaged over many years.",
      "Mark\u2019s illness means he can\u2019t speak anymore but he can communicate a little through blinking his eyes.",
      "Asked by BBC News if assisted dying being legalised would make him feel a burden and a pressure to end his life, he indicates it would.",
      "Mark and Eppie have been married for 45 years and she tells us caring for him until the end of his natural life is her way of showing her love for him.",

      "Religious groups, with a strong belief in the sanctity of human life, alongside disability charities, have formed the backbone of the opposition to the proposed legislation, but the arguments against a change in the law have been couched in very secular terms.",
      "For Mark and Eppie, the argument comes down to simply valuing life.",
      "'Prolonged and very unpleasant'",
      "Friday\u2019s vote is just the latest attempt to introduce assisted dying - it was first debated in Parliament in 1936.",
      "The current bill - called the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill - has been introduced by the Labour MP Kim Leadbeater.",
      "She came top of a ballot of MPs and so her bill - known as a Private Members\u2019 Bill - is the first to be considered and has probably the best chance of becoming law.",
      "Even though the government has remained neutral on the issue, and MPs can vote according to their own beliefs, ministers have already come out in favour or against the bill.",
      "For Sir Nicholas Mostyn, a retired High Court judge, the compassionate thing to do would be to give him the choice to end his life before his body deteriorates to the point he can no longer physically do everyday tasks.",
      "Like Mark, he has also been diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s but he is not yet in the advanced stages of the disease.",
      "\u201cThe likelihood, if you\u2019ve got Parkinson\u2019s disease, your ending is going to be prolonged and very unpleasant,\u201d he tells BBC News. He supports the bill \u2013 even though it would not give him the right to end his life.",
      "Symptoms of Parkinson\u2019s include parts of the body shaking uncontrollably and slow movement. In the most advanced stages, the disease people can find themselves unable to move and unable to speak.",
      "Sir Nicholas, and some sufferers of other debilitating conditions not considered terminal illnesses, would like the bill to be amended to cover them.",
      "For some critics, this is an important reason to vote against it.",
      "They fear, whether now or in the future, this bill could be widened to include sufferers of non-terminal conditions \u2013 this, they say, would be a danger to disabled people.",
      "The example most regularly cited is Canada, which opponents say is an example of a so-called \"slippery slope\".",
      "Legislation introduced there in 2016 was initially just for the terminally ill, but was extended in 2021 to those experiencing \"unbearable suffering\" from an irreversible illness or disability. There have been delays to further extensions, but it is still due to become available to those with a mental illness in three years.",
      "Sir Nicholas says: \u201cI just don\u2019t understand the moral argument, which is that because I wish to exercise sovereignty over my own body, that I am in some way facilitating a 'slippery slope\u2019 for abusive treatment of people who don\u2019t actually want to [end their lives].\u201d",
      "Friday\u2019s vote - if it passes - would just be the beginning of a long parliamentary process; weeks of scrutiny by a committee of MPs will follow, as they go through the legislation line-by-line.",
      "The bill will then return to the House of Commons and then the House of Lords where it could be amended in further votes.",
      "Even if MPs vote in favour of the bill - there is still a long way to go before these proposed changes become law.",
      "But if they do, it will mark another significant reform of the law that has seen our society change so much over the past 50 years."

More than 500 Britons have died at Dignitas in the past two decades, including 40 last year. The lethal medication must be self-administered.",

      "Living in Southwell in Nottinghamshire, Mrs Newby has access to only one cycle of IVF under the local NHS integrated care board (ICB) policy - but if she lived about 20 miles (32km) away in the Bassetlaw district, she would get three cycles.",
      "As health bosses propose changes to this policy, Mrs Newby is urging them to end the \"postcode lottery\" and make the system more fair.",
      "The Nottingham and Nottinghamshire Integrated Care Board (ICB) is calling on residents to share their views on the policies surrounding fertility services by responding to an online survey.",
      "Under its current policy, Bassetlaw is the only area in the county where residents have access to three rounds of IVF on the NHS.",
      "Guidance by National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) says women aged under 40 should be offered three cycles if they meet certain conditions.",
      "\"I think it's crazy that we could live in the same region but we could have differences,\" said Mrs Newby. \"I feel it's a right to have a family.\"",
      "'A real mess'",
      "Access to NHS fertility services is also dependent on other criteria, such as health, age, those with children from a previous relationship amongst others.",
      "And there are significant differences in fertility services policy across the five integrated care boards in the East Midlands - which cover Derbyshire, Leicestershire and Rutland, Northamptonshire and Lincolnshire.",
      "Mrs Newby said: \"It's a real mess. Why it's all so separate in regions I don't understand.",
      "\"You do feel upset, angry and all the emotions. It's such a sensitive subject because you want it so badly.",
      "\"Just because of where you live, why should someone have a better chance?\"",
      "These policy gaps have prompted \"listening exercises\" across the region, like the one in Nottinghamshire, with the ambition to create one fair policy for the East Midlands.",
      "Mrs Newby will start treatment in January and although she said she and her husband Dave were trying not to put \"too much pressure\" on themselves, they had had to start thinking about what happens if that cycle is unsuccessful.",
      "\"It's something we've already had to start talking about. What do we do if this doesn't work?\" she said.",
      "\"Do you keep going? How far do you go to achieve having the child you've always dreamed of?",
      "\"We hear of people that have completely bankrupted themselves trying to have a family.\"",
      "Going down the private treatment route could cost the couple up to about \u00a39,000 per cycle, according to Dr James Hopkisson, medical director of TFP Nurture Fertility Clinic across the border in Sandiacre, Derbyshire.",
      "\"Unfortunately there has been a postcode lottery in terms of IVF funding and fertility funding for some time,\" he told the BBC.",
      "The private clinic is contracted by the NHS with about 40% of its cycles being NHS-funded for patients mostly from Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, Leicestershire and Lincolnshire.",
      "Dr Hopkisson said the differences in access criteria across the region were causing unhappiness.",
      "\"Personally I think any decent civilised society should be looking at helping people to achieve their family,\" he said.",
      "\"And in a time where we are seeing national and international birth rates falling, actually it becomes more important that we help people have the families that they so desire.\"",
      "But under the East Midlands-wide proposal to standardise the policy, people wanting to start a family could only be offered one cycle of IVF on the NHS.",
      "Dr Dave Briggs, medical director at Nottingham and Nottinghamshire ICB, said NICE guidance to offer women under 40 three cycles of IVF should be taken \"alongside\" the priorities of the local area.",
      "\"That doesn't mean to say that we don't recognise the importance of IVF and fertility services but we also need to ensure that delivers within our financial means and also a lot of other services at the same time,\" he said.",
      "Dr Briggs added the \"vast majority\" of the region was only offered one cycle.",
      "\"This proposal is looking for a single policy across the entire East Midlands to ensure it doesn't matter if you live in the city centre or out in Bassetlaw or in Newark - you get exactly the same access to this important service, regardless of where you live,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "Robert F Kennedy Jr has set his sights on changing how Americans eat and drink.",
      "From the dyes in Fruit Loops cereal to seed oils in chicken nuggets, Kennedy - who is President-elect Trump's choice to lead the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) - has long spoken out against ingredients that he says hurt Americans' health.",
      "\"We are betraying our children by letting [food] industries poison them,\u201d Kennedy said at a rally in November, after he had ended his independent presidential bid and backed Donald Trump.",
      "But if Kennedy hopes to target junk food, he will first have to shake up the country's food regulations - and run up against Big Food.",
      "\u201cWhat he's suggesting is taking on the food industry,\u201d said former New York University nutrition professor Marion Nestle. \u201cWill Trump back him up on that? I\u2019ll believe it when I see it.\u201d",
      "The former environmental attorney - who still must face confirmation by the Senate - is considered by many to be a controversial pick, given his history of making baseless health claims, including that vaccines can cause autism and that wifi technology causes cancer.",

      "Who else is in Trump's top team?",
      "United by loyalty, Trump's new team have competing agendas",
      "Yet some of his ideas around reforming the FDA have found support from health experts, lawmakers and concerned consumers alike - including some Democrats.",
      "Kennedy \u201cwill help make America healthy again by shaking up HHS and FDA\u201d, Colorado\u2019s Democratic Governor Jared Polis wrote on social media this week, welcoming his nomination. After receiving public backlash for praising him, Polis qualified his endorsement, writing on social media that \"science must remain THE cornerstone of our nation\u2019s health policy\".",
      "Making America Healthy Again",
      "Leading up to the election, Kennedy - a former Democrat - offered several ideas for tackling chronic diseases under his slogan \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d.",
      "He has frequently advocated for eliminating ultra-processed foods - products altered to include added fats, starches and sugars, like frozen pizzas, crisps and sugary breakfast cereals, that are linked to health problems like cancer, cardiovascular disease and diabetes.",
      "He has taken aim primarily at school lunches, telling Fox News: \u201cWe have a generation of kids who are swimming around in a toxic soup right now.\"",
      "Part of Kennedy's new mandate will include overseeing the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which has over 18,000 employees.",
      "The agency is in charge of ensuring the safety of pharmaceuticals and the US food supply, but has come under fire in recent years from some lawmakers and consumer groups, who have accused it of a lack of transparency and action on food safety.",
      "The 70-year-old has pledged to take a sledgehammer to the agency, and fire employees he says are part of a \"corrupt system\".",
      "\u201cThere are entire departments, like the nutrition department at the FDA \u2026 that have to go, that are not doing their job,\u201d Kennedy told MSNBC this month.",
      "He has also pushed for getting rid of food dyes, including Red No. 3, and other additives banned in other countries.",
      "The former Democrat has also singled out more controversial health issues, including fluoride in drinking water, which he says should be banned altogether, and raw milk, which he believes has health benefits despite the increased risk of bacterial contamination.",
      "He\u2019s also come after seed oils, writing on social media that Americans are being \u201cunknowingly poisoned\u201d by products like canola and sunflower oil that are used in fast foods.",
      "What the evidence says",
      "Several public health experts stand behind Kennedy\u2019s goal to tackle ultra-processed food, which they say the US eats at much higher rates than many other countries.",
      "\u201cIt is just thrilling to hear somebody argue for doing something about chronic disease,\u201d Ms Nestle said.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s aim to get rid of certain food additives and dyes also could be beneficial, said Dr Peter Lurie, executive director for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a non-profit group that advocates for food safety.",
      "The former FDA official said several food dyes, including Red No. 3 - which is banned in California - should also be blocked by the US government because of concerns about carcinogens.",
      "The FDA has pushed back on Kennedy\u2019s claim that the US allows thousands of additives that are banned in the European Union. A spokesperson said it was necessary \"to dig deeper and understand the context behind the numbers\" when comparing regulations in the US and EU, which use different methodologies.",
      "But public health experts and former officials said a number of Kennedy\u2019s goals were not worthwhile - and in some cases, harmful.",
      "For instance, drinking raw milk that has not been pasteurized - a process that helps kill bacteria - can make people sick or even kill them, research has found.",
      "\u201cThere's no evidence of any nutritional benefit of any magnitude that we know that comes from non-pasteurizing of milk,\u201d said Dr Lurie.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s proposal to remove fluoride from drinking water also could be problematic, because fluoride, in the low levels found in water, has been proven to improve dental health, said University of Michigan nutritional sciences professor Jennifer Garner.",
      "Removing it from the water supply would also be out of his jurisdiction, because fluoride levels are controlled by states.",
      "And his claim that seed oils are helping drive the obesity epidemic is not based in science, either, Dr Lurie said.",
      "\u201cWe see no evidence for that. In fact, they seem like important products to the extent that they substitute for saturated fats\u201d such as butter, he said.",
      "Taking on Big Food",
      "Food reforms, while long part of the public health conversation, could also simply be unrealistic both politically and bureaucratically, some experts said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a good deal more complicated than he lets on,\u201d said Dr Lurie. \u201cThese are real challenges, and you will encounter industry opposition at every turn.\u201d",
      "For one, the FDA does not have authority over the catch-all of \u201cultra-processed foods\u201d, several former officials told the BBC.",
      "Instead, they said, the process is more complicated. Both the US Department of Agriculture and the FDA regulate the food industry. The FDA does not make the rules - it carries out policies passed by Congress and works to limit unhealthy foods by enforcing limits and labelling on certain nutrients, like sodium and saturated fat.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s comments \u201cmake for great political rhetoric\u201d, Ms Garner said. \u201cIn my view, I don\u2019t see how that could be feasible without drastic changes in other policy and infrastructure.\u201d",
      "He will also face industry backlash for proposals to ban pesticides and genetically modified organisms commonly used by American farmers, former FDA officials said.",
      "\u201cThe businesses will complain,\u201d said Rosalie Lijinsky, a former FDA official of 33 years.",
      "The industry is used to limited oversight from both Democrats and Republicans - including under Trump's first term - while many of Kennedy\u2019s goals would involve even more rulemaking.",
      "Several food industry groups met with lawmakers before Kennedy\u2019s appointment this month to lobby against him, Politico reported last month.",
      "Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, of Iowa, said this week that he planned to meet Kennedy before his confirmation hearing and \u201cspend a lot of time educating him about agriculture\u201d.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s position also puts him at odds with President-elect Trump, a longtime lover of fast food who worked to roll back stricter health requirements for school lunches during his first term.",
      "\u201cYou get some ideas that make a certain amount of sense, but they are exactly the kind to which this administration is hostile,\u201d Dr Lurie said.",
      "In a statement to the BBC, the Food Industry Association, which represents food retailers, producers and manufacturers, like General Mills, said it looked forward to working with Trump\u2019s team to \u201censure food and drug policy continues to be grounded in science, to reduce regulatory complexity\u201d.",
      "The industry complaints about Kennedy\u2019s agenda do not come as a surprise, said Jeff Hutt, a spokesperson for the Make America Healthy Again political action committee, which is urging Republican lawmakers to confirm Kennedy.",
      "The goal of the health movement, Mr Hutt said, is \u201cprioritising the wellness of America over corporate profits\u201d.",
      "\u201cEven if the idea of banning ultra-processed food is not possible politically, it's a conversation that we need to have,\u201d he said.",
      "Pathway to change",
      "Kennedy still could work within existing US regulatory frameworks to improve America\u2019s food systems, former officials said.",
      "Ms Nestle said Kennedy could take on ultra-processed foods by altering the US Dietary Guidelines, which set nutritional standards for the industry and federal government programmes, including school lunches and military meals.",
      "\u201cThey have an enormous impact on the food industry,\u201d Ms Nestle said. \u201cThat would make a big difference.\u201d",
      "The guidelines are updated every five years by the US Department of Agriculture and DHHS, which has previously said there is not enough evidence against ultra-processed foods.",
      "Still, officials and nutrition experts raised concerns about the means by which Kennedy has proposed to enact his agenda, including firing the FDA\u2019s nutritionists.",
      "The move would have large ramifications for food safety, said Ms Lijinsky. \u201cIf you lose your top experts, you\u2019re going to have problems,\u201d she said.",
      "Ultimately, Ms Garner said it is difficult to disentangle some of Kennedy\u2019s more reasonable food-improvement goals with the false health claims he has spread.",
      "\u201cThere's an opportunity here,\u201d Ms Garner said.",
      "\u201cBut I think there's rightful concern based on other issues and how his approach to those issues might play in here.\u201d",

He said he was responsible for organising the whole journey to the UK. But he refused to take responsibility for migrants dying in the Channel, blaming local smugglers for overloading boats and migrants themselves for taking the risk.",

      "As part of the formula, a song needs to be streamed 100 times on a paid-for subscription service to be worth the same as one download sale. For free video and audio streams, 600 plays are required.",
      "But so many classic songs are played relentlessly at parties and on people\u2019s playlists that those streams tot up quickly \u2013 which means the top of the festive charts tends to be dominated by the likes of Mariah Carey\u2019s All I Want for Christmas and the Pogues and Kirsty MacColl with Fairytale of New York.",
      "A year ago, Last Christmas by Wham! was the Christmas number one, 39 years after its release - and that song is the bookmakers\u2019 clear favourite to do so again this year.",

      "Private prosecutions are cases brought to criminal courts without the involvement of the police or Crown Prosecution Service.",
      "The consultation, in the new year, will also look at whether there should be more oversight of organisations with powers to launch specific prosecutions, such as railway companies, the DVLA or the BBC over non-payment of the TV Licence fee.",
      "It will also look at the single justice procedure - the fast-tracking of minor prosecutions without a court hearing.",
      "In 2020, MPs urged the then government to strengthen safeguards around private prosecutions.",
      "And on Thursday, Justice Minister Heidi Alexander told BBC News the new government would now follow up these concerns.",
      "The Horizon scandal revealed the Post Office had failed to ensure its private prosecutions of sub-postmasters were appropriate - and a public inquiry is looking into what went wrong.",
      "And on Thursday, Alexander told BBC News: \u201cWe've seen, through things like the Horizon scandal with the Post Office, private prosecutions being brought which resulted in wrongful convictions.",
      "\u201cNot quite as extreme as that is what happens to some vulnerable people through the use of the single justice procedure.",
      "\u201cSome of the time, organisations are prosecuting individuals where perhaps the public interest in that prosecution hasn't been proved.",
      "\u201cWe want to talk to these organisations so that we can improve the safeguards, so that we make sure that justice and the administration of justice is done fairly.\u201d",
      "There is no public register of private prosecutions - but it is widely thought there could be about 300,000 such cases a year.",

    "story": [
      "Ford UK has called on the government to introduce incentives to encourage drivers to buy electric vehicles (EVs) as an industry backlash grows over sales targets.",
      "Lisa Brankin, Ford UK's chair and managing director, told the BBC that without demand, a government mandate to produce and sell more EVs \"just doesn't work\".",
      "The comments add to a growing row between the government and the industry over the sale of new petrol and diesel cars being phased out over the next few years.",
      "On Tuesday, Stellantis, the owner of Vauxhall, said it would close a plant in Luton, putting 1,100 jobs at risk, partly due to the EV targets.",
      "Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds told the House of Commons on Wednesday that Stellantis's decision was \"a dark day for Luton\".",
      "It joins Ford in axing UK jobs. Last week, it announced it will cut 800 jobs in the UK over the next three years, partly due to the EV target but also because of increased competition.",
      "Ms Brankin told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"The one thing that we really need is government-backed incentives to urgently boost the uptake of electric vehicles.\"",
      "She said Ford has invested \"significantly\" in the production and development of EVs, with \"well over\" \u00a3350m put into electrification in the UK.",
      "\"So we kind of need to make it work,\" she said.",
      "Both firms have previously raised doubts about their future in the UK because of other factors, separate to EV targets.",
      "Ford closed its Bridgend factory in 2020, axing 1,644 jobs, citing Covid-19 as one of the reasons while Vauxhall's former owner suggested in 2019 that Brexit threatened its Luton factory.",
      "Meanwhile, some analysts have said a shift towards luxury vehicles and away from cheaper models are also part of the reason for Ford's problems.",
      "Reynolds blamed the previous government for Stellantis' Luton closure, saying Labour had \"inherited a position of extreme frustration\".",
      "He said there would be a \"fast track\" consultation of how the EV targets are enforced, but reiterated Labour's commitment to a 2030 phase-out of new petrol and diesel vehicle sales.",
      "However, shadow business secretary Andrew Griffith said the 2030 target was a \"jobs killer\" and that Stellantis' decision was \"the direct result of a government policy that is simply unworkable for industry\".",
      "The previous Conservative government moved the deadline for the phase-out from 2030 to 2035, but it kept penalties for non-compliance.",
      "Under the current mandate, a percentage of the cars that companies sell must qualify as zero-emission.",
      "EVs must make up 22% of a company's car sales and 10% of its van sales this year.",
      "For every car sale outside of that, firms must pay a \u00a315,000 fine.",
      "That target is set to rise to 28% for cars and 16% for vans in 2025. The rules will then get tougher every year ahead of a complete ban of new petrol and diesel car sales.",

      "Discounting",

      "In practice, this means firms could buy credits from companies such as Tesla or Chinese firm BYD, which build electric models exclusively.",
      "Manufacturers argue that demand for electric cars has not been as high as was expected when the rules were drawn up.",
      "As a result, to avoid fines, they say they are having to discount new vehicles heavily, or subsidise rivals that only build electric cars, none of whom have a manufacturing base in the UK.",
      "Sales of electric cars have, however, been increasing. In October, they made up one out of every five cars registered. However, industry sources insist this is largely down to unsustainable discounting.",
      "Reynolds told an industry audience at a dinner hosted by Society of Motor Manufacturers & Traders (SMMT) on Tuesday he is \u201cprofoundly concerned\u201d about the way zero-emissions policies currently operate.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t believe the policies that we have inherited, and I mean specifically in relation to zero emission vehicles, are operating today in a way anyone intended them to,\" he said.",

      "A number of options have been suggested, such as allowing sales credits to be transferred between cars and vans and giving \"credits\" for British-made EVs sold abroad.",
      "The SMMT has called for urgent government intervention to safeguard the sector, warning that weak demand for electric cars and the requirement to fulfil sales quotas had \"the potential for devastating impacts on business viability and jobs\".",

      "For the first time in almost a decade MPs are going to vote on giving terminally ill adults in England and Wales the right to have an assisted death. While it\u2019s something that remains illegal in most countries, more than 300 million people now live in countries which have legalised assisted dying.",
      "Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Spain and Austria have all introduced assisted dying laws since 2015 \u2013 when UK MPs last voted on the issue \u2013 some allowing assisted death for those who are not terminally ill.",
      "The proposed bill in England and Wales comes with safeguards supporters say will make it the strictest set of rules in the world, with patients needing the approval of a High Court judge. Critics on the other hand say changing the law would be a dangerous step that would place the vulnerable at risk. They argue the focus should be on improving patchy access to palliative care.",

      "Across the US, assisted dying - which some critics prefer to call assisted suicide - is legal in 10 states, as well as in Washington DC. Oregon was one of the first places in the world to offer help to die for some patients, in 1997, and so has more than 25 years\u2019 experience. It has become the model on which other US assisted dying laws have been framed.",
      "In Oregon, assisted dying is open to terminally ill, mentally competent adults expected to die within six months - and must be signed off by two doctors. Since 1997, 4,274 people have received a prescription for a lethal dose of medication - with 2,847 (67%) deaths.",
      "Two thirds of patients in the state who asked for help to die last year had cancer. Around one in 10 had a neurological condition and about the same proportion had heart disease. Of the 367 patients who took a lethal dose of medication last year, the vast majority (91.6%) said loss of autonomy was a key concern, while others cited:",

      "Oregon is important for supporters of assisted dying in England and Wales as they point out it has remained restricted to terminally ill adults since its introduction. However, opponents say some of the rules have been relaxed. A residency requirement has been lifted, which means it is open to people from outside the state. The number of assisted deaths has also risen substantially over the years.",
      "Canada",
      "Canada is the country often cited by opponents of assisted dying as an example of the so-called \"slippery slope\" - a place where assisted dying has been extended and made available to more people since it was first brought in. Medical assistance in dying (Maid) was introduced in 2016, initially just for the terminally ill.",
      "This was amended in 2021 and extended to those experiencing \"unbearable suffering\" from an irreversible illness or disability. It\u2019s still due to become available to those with a mental illness in three years, despite delays.",
      "Critics say the more the law is widened, the more disabled and vulnerable people will be put at risk. There has also been a dramatic growth in the number of people using Maid. Four in 100 deaths in Canada are now medically assisted, compared to about one in 100 in Oregon.",
      "Kim Leadbeater, the MP who proposed the assisted dying bill in Westminster, says the Canadian system is not what is being debated for England and Wales, where eligibility would be restricted to the terminally ill.",
      "Europe",
      "Across Europe, six countries have some form of legalised assisted dying: Switzerland, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Spain and Austria. In all of them - unlike the proposals in England and Wales - help to die is not restricted to the terminally ill.",
      "Switzerland was the first country in the world to create a \u201cright to die\u201d when it made assisted suicide legal in 1942. It is one of the few countries which allows foreigners access to help to die via organisations like Dignitas, in Zurich. More than 500 Britons have died at Dignitas in the past two decades, including 40 last year. The lethal medication must be self-administered.",
      "The Netherlands and Belgium both legalised assisted dying more than 20 years ago for patients experiencing unbearable suffering from an incurable illness, including mental health issues. It has since been extended to children - the only European countries to allow this. Both allow euthanasia - or physician-assisted dying.",
      "Most recently, Spain and Austria have legalised assisted dying for both terminal illness and intolerable suffering. In Austria, the drugs must be self-administered, whereas in Spain a medical professional can administer them.",
      "Despite the variation, what\u2019s clear is that eligibility for assisted dying is far wider across Europe than is being proposed anywhere in the British Isles. MSPs at Holyrood are to debate a similar bill covering Scotland as that being voted on at Westminster.",
      "A bill to allow terminally ill adult patients to die if they have 12 months or less to live has nearly passed all its stages in the Isle of Man parliament. The legislation is likely to get Royal Assent next year and the first assisted death on the island could happen in 2027. There is a residency requirement of five years. Jersey has also committed to changing the law to allow assisted dying for the terminally ill.",
      "Australia and New Zealand",
      "In the past few years voluntary assisted dying has become legal across most of Australia. While in New Zealand, patients must be terminally ill and expected to die within six months. That is extended to 12 months for those with a neurodegenerative condition in eligible parts of Australia.",
      "In both countries, patients can self-administer the lethal medication. But it can also be administered by a doctor or nurse, usually via an intravenous injection.",

    "published": "Fri, 29 Nov 2024 01:12:13 GMT",
    "summary": "Governments don\u2019t want to tell people they\u2019re going to have to pay more, argues an expert.",
    "story": [
      "It is the perfect start to a holiday: your plane ticket is cheap, your cabin baggage is safely stowed, the engines are roaring into life - and the pilot has announced that there\u2019s no need to worry about the environmental impact.",
      "This is Jet Zero, a vision where air travel is entirely carbon neutral thanks to new technology and green ventures that offset the environmental impact. The plan was drafted in 2022 when Boris Johnson was prime minister, marking a step towards the government\u2019s legal obligation to reach net zero by 2050. The Labour government has since made a similar pledge, and in addition it wants all domestic flights and UK airport operations to reach zero emissions by 2040.",
      "This is no easy feat when you consider the scale of the challenge: one passenger taking an economy-class flight from London to New York generates 309kg of carbon dioxide, which would take roughly a year to absorb via 10 mature trees.",
      "Multiply this on the global scale and the aviation industry would need to plant roughly 100 billion mature trees each year to offset its emissions. For UK emissions alone you\u2019d need a forest almost the size of Wales.",
      "So, just how realistic is the plan to hit Jet Zero by 2050? And what is the knock-on cost for passengers?",
      "Earlier this year, Anthony Browne, who was the aviation minister in the Conservative government at the time, said that he thought any increase in ticket prices would be \u201cmarginal\u201d.",
      "\u201cWe don't think the difference will be noticeable to most consumers,\u201d he said.",
      "But some experts claim that politicians are not being realistic. Sir Dieter Helm, professor of economic policy at the University of Oxford, argues that there \u201cdefinitely would be higher cost\u201d.",
      "\u201cGovernments desperately don\u2019t want to tell people they\u2019re going to have to pay for what they do.\u201d",
      "But ultimately, the cost depends on which methods are employed to cut or reduce emissions.",
      "From sharklets to UltraFans",
      "The previous government said that it aimed reach Jet Zero by focusing on \"the rapid development of technologies\u201d, as well as operational improvements and - among other things - more sustainable fuel types.",
      "This is not an entirely new quest. Aircraft around the world have been steadily getting cleaner since 1969 when the first high-bypass turbofan engines were used on the new Boeing 747 aircraft. In the years since there have been other innovations including sharklets, or upturned wing tips on modern planes that reduce drag and save, on average, 4% of fuel per trip.",
      "More developments are in the pipeline, including a new type of jet engine, developed by Rolls Royce, called the \u201cUltraFan\u201d, which will reduce average fuel consumption by 10%.",
      "\u201cBecause it\u2019s a gearbox, the turbine can run very fast, much more efficiently, the fan can run slower and be much bigger,\u201c explains Simon Burr, a director at Rolls-Royce.",
      "The problem is that, though it was first tested in 2023, it\u2019s unlikely to be available on commercial aircraft until the 2030s because of production lead times - and even then, a 10% improvement is impressive but not a game changer.",
      "Aviation\u2019s CO2 emissions come primarily through jet engines using carbon-rich fossil fuels, which produce CO2 when burned, so there have been attempts to create an alternative type made from renewable biomass and waste resources, known as Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).",
      "The first SAF flight ran between London and Amsterdam in 2008 using fuel derived from a mixture of Brazilian babassu nuts and coconuts.",
      "Now the British government says that 22% of all jet fuel from UK aviation has to come from sustainable sources by 2040. But this comes with further challenges.",
      "In the UK, SAF is mainly made from cooking oil, some of which is shipped from Asia, and shipping is responsible for 2% of global CO2 emissions.",
      "Alternative methods of creating SAF require large quantities of electricity as part of the manufacturing process. This would involve a vast amount of renewable energy to make it sustainable.",
      "\"It's very hard, to think there is such a thing as a sustainable aviation fuel,\u201d says Sir Dieter Helm. \u201cThere are aviation fuels that are less polluting than the ones being used at the moment, and you can use elements of biofuel and chip fat and so on.",
      "\"Think about the scale that's required to do it.\u201d",
      "Remapping the sky",
      "There is another more unexpected way that airlines could reduce emissions. That is, making their flight paths more direct to reduce fuel consumption.",
      "Currently most planes fly on routes determined by a network of beacons, many of which were put in place decades ago. As a result they don\u2019t always fly by the shortest route, but \"airspace modernisation\", as it is known, will allow for straighter paths to destinations.",
      "Satellite technology is required to do this: aircraft flying over the Atlantic used to have to fly at least 40 miles apart, but the satellite technology means that aircraft can in theory fly as close as 14 miles apart, allowing more aircraft to fly on the direct flight paths.",
      "The Jet Zero Strategy estimates that this, together with other fuel efficiency improvements, could cut emissions by as much as 15% by 2050.",
      "But the National Air Traffic Services (NATS), which control most flights in and out of England and Wales, caution that these changes are neither easy nor quick. \u201cIt's a very, very complicated thing to do,\u201d warns Chris Norsworthy, director of future planning.",
      "\u201cThe national infrastructure change of this type takes many years. The deployments we've made already are years in the making.\u201d",
      "The electric plane race",
      "Hidden away in a mini aircraft hangar of sorts, just outside Bristol, inventor Stephen Fitzpatrick has spent seven years working on a pioneering aircraft that could be the basis of another solution. His carbon fibre creation, known as VX4, has eight propellers and looks like a giant drone, but what's crucial is that it doesn\u2019t use fuel. Instead it is powered by lithium-ion batteries similar to those in electric cars.",
      "The batteries alone weigh 800kg, which brings the first challenge: the sheer weight limits how far it can fly.",
      "Mr Fitzpatrick says the VX4 will have a range of around 100 miles to begin with. \u201cEach year the batteries that we use will improve... Over time, we\u2019ll be able to develop a hybrid powertrain, probably using hydrogen fuel cells and batteries, and that will increase the range further.\u201d",
      "The prospect of replacing jet engine-powered long-haul flights is, however, remote. \u201cThere is no battery chemistry in the world that will give us the energy we need to take hundreds of passengers over the Atlantic,\u201d he concedes.",
      "Harnessing hydrogen in other ways may be a better bet.",
      "The British-American aircraft company, ZeroAvia, says it expects to have an 80-seater powered entirely by hydrogen in the air within two to three years. Airbus is developing something similar.",
      "Both are propeller planes, however, with limited speeds and ranges.",
      "The pricetag for passengers",
      "The reductions from SAF, fuel efficiency improvements and zero carbon aircraft will only cut aviation emissions by around a third, according to the previous government's estimates. So another part of the Jet Zero strategy involves a pricing scheme to charge airlines for CO2 emissions and carbon offsetting.",
      "Airlines already pay a duty for each flight someone takes in the UK, a cost that is passed to passengers. In much of the UK (excluding Scotland) this adds \u00a37 to each domestic flight, \u00a314 to short-haul ones and \u00a392 for long-haul. But carbon offsetting means paying another fee.",
      "Some schemes have been highly controversial, with questions around how to prove how many trees have been prevented from being cut down.",
      "Cait Hewitt, policy director at the Aviation Environment Federation, is concerned that the current informal offsetting projects may be counterproductive: \u201cThey could actually have made that problem a bit worse over time by giving consumers the false impression that the emissions from their flight [are] being cancelled out somehow by an offset.\u201d",

      "Duncan McCourt, chief executive of Sustainable Aviation, an umbrella group for UK airlines, airports, manufacturers and others in the business, is optimistic that removing carbon from flying won\u2019t add much more than a few pounds to the cost of an airline ticket.",
      "\u201cWe think we can do it while enabling people to continue to fly and continue to get that benefit of flying, such as connecting people, such as being able to go on holiday,\u201d he says.",
      "But the Jet Zero plan says nothing directly about the knock-on cost to passengers. Instead, it refers to \u201cdemand management\u201d.",
      "Sir Dieter Helm has his own take on what Jet Zero means for holidaymakers and fully believes that it will lead to higher costs. As for the likelihood of the government hitting its Jet Zero target on time, he is unconvinced of this too, but he also suggests that this may not be the point.",
      "\u201cIt depends whether you think Jet Zero is\u2026 genuinely a target and they mean to achieve it. I'm really sceptical about the second.\u201d",
      "And now, the number of flights taken annually by people in the UK is projected to rise even further, translating into an additional 150 million more flights a year. So the scale of the government's challenge, which was large enough when it began, is only set to grow.",

    "published": "Sun, 24 Nov 2024 14:13:37 GMT",
    "summary": "Fraught debate revealed the divide between rich and poor as the UN conference sealed a climate finance deal.",
    "story": [
      "COP29 is over, with developing countries complaining that the $300bn (about \u00a3240bn) a year in climate finance they will receive by 2035 is a \"paltry sum\".",
      "Many of the rich country voices at the UN's climate conference were amazed that developing nations were unhappy with what on the surface seems a huge settlement. It is an improvement - on the current contribution of $100bn (\u00a379.8bn) a year.",
      "However, the developing world, which had pushed for more, had many genuine issues with the final sum.",
      "A massive deal, but bitter divisions remain",
      "There were complaints it simply was not enough and that it was a mixture of grants and loans. And countries were deeply annoyed by the way the wealthy waited until the last minute to reveal their hand.",
      "\u201cIt's a paltry sum,\" India's delegate Chandni Raina told other delegates, after the deal had been gavelled through.",
      "\"This document is little more than an optical illusion. This, in our opinion, will not address the enormity of the challenge we all face.\"",
      "Ultimately, the developing world was compelled to accept it, with many rich countries pointing to next year's arrival of President Donald Trump, a known climate sceptic, and arguing that they would not get a better deal.",
      "But this package is also being criticised as short-sighted from the richer world\u2019s perspective.",
      "The argument runs that if you want to keep the world safe from rising temperatures, then wealthier nations need to help emerging economies cut their emissions, because that is where 75% of the growth in emissions has occurred in the past decade.",
      "New national plans are due to be published next spring to outline how every country will limit their planet warming gases over the next 10 years.",
      "A more generous cash settlement at COP29 would undoubtedly have had a positive knock-on effect on those efforts.",
      "And at a time of geopolitical uncertainty and distraction, keeping countries united on climate should be critical. The big fight over money re-opened old divisions between rich and poor, with an anger and bitterness I have not seen in years.",
      "COP itself is on the ropes",
      "Shepherding 200 countries to an intricate deal on climate finance was always going to be a tough task. But for hosts Azerbaijan, a country with no real history of involvement in the COP process, it proved to be almost beyond them.",
      "The country\u2019s president, Ilham Aliyev, did not help matters by describing oil and gas as a \"gift from God\". His blunt attacks - accusing \"Western fake news media\", charities and politicians of \"spreading disinformation\" - did not improve matters.",
      "Azerbaijan follows Egypt and the United Arab Emirates as the third authoritarian state in a row to host COP, raising concerns about how host countries are selected.",
      "Azerbaijan, like the UAE, has an economy which is built on oil and gas exports, which seems at odds with a process that is meant to be helping the world transition away from coal, oil and gas.",
      "Privately, many senior negotiators spoke of their frustration with what some termed the worst COP in a decade. Half-way through the meeting, several senior climate leaders wrote a public letter saying COP was not fit for purpose and calling for reform.",
      "The quiet ascent of China",
      "With the role of the US in future climate talks in doubt because of Trump, attention shifted to who might become the real climate leader in the expected absence of the US over the next four years.",
      "The natural successor is China.",
      "The world\u2019s largest carbon emitter was largely silent at this year's COP, only showing its hand to give details for the first time on the amount of climate finance it gives to developing countries.",
      "China is still defined by the United Nations as a \"developing\" country, meaning it has no formal obligation to cut greenhouse gas emissions or provide financial help to poorer countries.",
      "However, China has agreed to a formula in the finance deal that would allow its contributions to be counted in the overall fund for climate-vulnerable countries, on a voluntary basis.",
      "All in all, a move that is being seen as very deft and effective.",
      "\u201cChina is becoming more transparent about its financial support to global south countries,\u201d said Li Shuo, from the Asia Society Policy Institute.",
      "\u201cThis should propel the country to play a larger role in the future.\"",
      "'Trump-proofing' the climate",
      "Although he was not there, Trump\u2019s presence was felt across COP.",
      "One common element among the negotiators in Baku was the need to ensure that a second Trump administration would not upend years of careful climate negotiations.",
      "So it was no surprise to see that richer nations wanted to commit to raising funding by 2035. They believe putting that date will allow the US to contribute again once Trump has left office.",
      "Similarly, the drive to increase the contributor base was done with Trump in mind.",
      "Bringing China to the table, even in a voluntary capacity, will be used to show that it is worth engaging in international forums like COP.",
      "\"No-one thinks Trump in the White House will be anything but damaging to the multilateral climate regime,\" said Prof Michael Jacobs, visiting senior fellow at the think tank ODI Global.",
      "\"But this agreement was about trying to limit the damage as much as possible.\u201d",
      "Campaigners become more vocal",
      "One very noticeable trend at COP29 was the sometimes more aggressive stance taken by many environmental NGOs and campaigners.",
      "I witnessed it myself when US climate envoy John Podesta was chased out a meeting area with chants of \u201cshame\u201d ringing in his ears.",
      "Many developing countries rely on these NGOs for support in dealing with complex events like COP.",
      "During the talks, there was a strong push from many of these campaigners for an outright rejection of almost any deal.",
      "Similarly, in the final plenary when all countries accepted the finance text, there were brash cheers when speakers from several nations spoke out against the agreement, after the gavelling.",
      "Will confrontational activism and fraught debate become the new norm at a diplomatic climate conference?",
      "We will have to wait for the next COP to see.",
      "Climate deal too little too late, poorer nations say",
      "Standing ovation as long awaited COP29 finance deal agreed",

    "story": [
      "The couple stands on the edge of the sheer limestone cliff.",
      "More than 100 metres (328ft) beneath them is a lost world of ancient forests, plants and animals. All they can see is leafy tree tops and hear is the echoes of cicadas and birds bouncing off the cliffs.",
      "For thousands of years, this \u201cheavenly pit\u201d or \u201ctiankeng\u201d, in Mandarin, was unexplored.",
      "People feared demons and ghosts hiding in the mists which swirled up from the depths.",
      "But drones and a few brave souls who lowered themselves into places untouched since dinosaurs roamed the Earth have revealed new treasures - and turned China\u2019s sinkholes into a tourist attraction.",
      "Two-thirds of the world\u2019s more than 300 sinkholes are in China, scattered throughout the country\u2019s west - with 30 known tiankeng, Guangxi province in the south has more of them than anywhere else. Its biggest and most recent find was two years ago: an ancient forest with trees reaching as high as 40m (130ft). These cavities in the earth trap time, preserving unique, delicate ecosystems for centuries. Their discovery, however, has begun to draw tourists and developers, raising fears that these incredible, rare finds could be lost forever.",
      "Off the cliff",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve never done this kind of thing before,\u201d says 25-year-old Rui, looking down into the chasm. \u201cIt\u2019s very cool. It will be the first time but not the last time.\u201d",
      "She takes a big breath. Then she and her boyfriend step back - off the edge and into the air.",
      "Fei Ge - the man who had just meticulously checked Rui and Michael\u2019s harnesses before sending them over the cliff - knows better than most the feeling of stepping back over the edge.",
      "He was one of the first explorers. Now in his 50s, he works as a tour guide helping people discover the secrets of Guangxi's sinkholes.",
      "Growing up in a village nearby, Fe had been told to stay away. \u201cWe thought that if humans went into the sinkholes, demons would bring strong winds and heavy rain. We thought ghosts brought the mist and fog.\u201d",
      "Fei Ge - or Brother Fei as he is known - was taught that these sinkholes have their own microclimate. The wind rushes through the tunnels and evaporated water from rivers inside the caves produces the mist.",
      "Eventually Brother Fei's curiosity won and he found a way into a sinkhole as a child.",
      "\u201cEvery tiny stone caused loud noises and echoes,\u201d he said. There was wind, rain and even \u201cmini tornadoes\u201d, he recalled. \u201cAt first, we were afraid.\u201d",
      "But he kept exploring. It was only when he brought scientists to the site that he realised how unique the sinkholes were.",
      "\u201cThe experts were astonished. They found new plants and told us they\u2019ve been doing research for decades and never seen these species. They were very excited. We couldn\u2019t believe that something we had taken for granted nearby was such a treasure.\u201d",
      "As scientists published their finds in journals, and word spread of their discovery, others came to study the sinkholes. Fei says explorers from the UK, France and Germany have come in the last 10 years.",
      "Sinkholes are rare. China - and Guangxi particularly - has so many because of the abundance of limestone. When an underground river slowly dissolves the surrounding limestone rock, it creates a cave that expands upwards towards the ground.",
      "Eventually, the ground collapses, leaving a yawning hole. Its depth and width must measure at least 100m for it to qualify as a sinkhole. Some, like the one found in Guangxi in 2022, are much bigger, stretching 300m into the earth and 150m wide.",
      "For scientists these cavernous pits are a journey back in time, to a place where they can study animals and plants they had thought extinct. They have also found species they had never seen or known, including types of wild orchid, ghostly white cave fish and various spiders and snails.",
      "Protected by sheer cliffs, jagged mountains and limestone caves, these plants and animals have thrived deep in the earth.",
      "Into the cave",
      "There is a delighted shriek as Rui dangles mid-air, before she starts rappelling down.",
      "This is just the start of the adventure for her and Michael. They have more ropework to do, in the belly of the cave.",
      "After a short walk through a maze of stalactites, Michael is lowered into the dark. The guides sweep the area with torches, illuminating the arc above us - a network of caves - and then shine the light into the narrow passages below, where a river once carved through the rock.",
      "That\u2019s where we are headed. The guides have to work hard to move the ropes into position.",
      "\u201cI am not a person that does much exercise,\u201d says Michael, his words echoing in the cave.",
      "This is the highlight of the Shanghai couple\u2019s two-week break in Guangxi, the kind of holiday they had craved during China\u2019s long Covid lockdowns. \u201cThis kind of tourism is more and more familiar on the Chinese internet,\u201d he says. \u201cWe saw it and thought it looked pretty cool. That\u2019s why we wanted to try it.\u201d",
      "Videos of the Guangxi sinkholes have gone viral on social media. What is a fun and daring feat for young people is a source of much-needed revenue in a province that was only recently lifted out of poverty.",
      "There is little farmland in Guangxi\u2019s unusual but stunning terrain, and its mountainous borders make trade with the rest of China and neighbouring Vietnam difficult.",
      "Still, people come for the views. Pristine rivers and the soaring karst peaks of Guilin and Yangshuo in the north draw more than a million Chinese tourists each year. Photographs of mist-covered Guangxi have even made it onto the 20-yuan note.",
      "Yet few have heard of Ping'e village, the nearest settlement to the sinkholes. But that is changing.",
      "Brother Fei says says a steady stream of visitors is changing fortunes for some in Ping\u2019e. \u201cIt used to be very poor. We started developing tourism and it brought lots of benefits. Like when the highways were built. We were really happy knowing we have something so valuable here.\u201d",
      "But there are concerns that tourism revenue could override the demands of scientific research.",
      "About 50km from Ping\u2019e, developers have built what they say is the highest viewing platform, which overlooks Dashiwei, the second-deepest sinkhole in the world. Tourists can peer 500m down into this particular \u201cheavenly pit\u201d.",
      "\u201cWe should better protect such habitats,\u201d says Dr Lina Shen, a leading sinkhole researcher based in China. \u201cSinkholes are paradises for many rare and endangered plant species. We are continuing to make new discoveries.\u201d",
      "By studying sinkholes, scientists also hope to find out how the Earth has changed over tens of thousands of years, and better understand the impact of climate change. At least one sinkhole in Guangxi has already been closed to tourists to protect unique orchid varieties.",
      "\u201cOverdevelopment could cause tremendous damage. We should maintain their original ecological state,\u201d Dr Shen says, adding that the solution lies in striking a balance.",
      "\u201cHot air balloons, drones for aerial photography, and appropriate pathways for observation from a distance could allow tourists to closely yet remotely view sinkholes, while disturbing as few organisms as possible.\u201d",
      "Brother Fei doesn\u2019t disagree, and insists there are \u201cclear rules\u201d to protect the sinkholes and what they hold. To him, they are a prized find that has changed his life. He is now one of Guangxi\u2019s most qualified climbers and a renowned guide for both tourists and scientists, which has made him \u201cvery happy\u201d.",
      "As we walk through acres of lush forest inside the sinkhole, he points to a cliff above us. He tells us to return when the rains do to see the waterfalls that pour down the side. It\u2019s worth coming back for, he assures us.",
      "Rui and Michael are being roped up as they encourage each other to abseil further into the cave. All that is visible beneath them is a narrow chasm, lit up by a torch. It\u2019s all that remains of a river bed, the catalyst in making this sinkhole.",
      "\u201cWe need to balance this joy with protecting this place,\u201d Michael says, looking around him.",
      "He smiles as he is slowly lowered down and disappears into the cave."

      "The regulator, the Advertising Standards Agency (ASA), says it bans and removes ads which fail to make the clear whether or not a game contains a loot box.",
      "But a BBC investigation found only two of the top 45 highest-grossing games on the Google Play store actually followed those rules.",
      "Dr Jane Rigbye, chief executive of Young Gamers & Gamblers Education Trust (Ygam), called the findings \"deeply concerning\".",
      "\"In the absence of robust regulation in gaming, it is essential for games to provide clear and transparent information about their features, allowing both parents and gamers to make informed decisions,\" she said.",

      "But, more than 12 months later, the BBC has discovered the vast majority of major mobile games containing loot boxes are still flouting the rules, with most games only disclosing their presence if would-be players tap a small information button on the Play Store.",

      "Trump was thrown off Meta platforms Facebook and Instagram in 2021 for what the company called his \"praise for people engaged in violence at the Capitol on January 6.\"",
      "But that suspension has since been lifted.",
      "In August this year, Mr Zuckerberg spoke of his regret at de-promoting content relating to allegations about Joe Biden's son Hunter, which had been a right-wing talking point in the US prior to the 2020 presidential election.",
      "He also said he would make no more contributions to support electoral infrastructure, after a $400m (\u00a3302m) donation in 2020 was viewed by some online as a way of skirting donation limits.",
      "Mr Zuckerberg said his donations had been designed to be non-partisan, and his goal was to be neutral in elections.",

      "It has ultimately led to the billionaire being placed in charge of a new Department of Government Efficiency (Doge), which may give him not only influence over government policy, but the very regulation threatening his business empire.",
      "However, Mr Zuckerberg and Mr Musk have a longstanding rivalry.",
      "Some of their disagreements stem from serious business matters, such as a failed collaboration in 2016 when a SpaceX rocket exploding while carrying a Facebook satellite.",

      "Now hopes are pinned on China's Geely, which is in talks to take an 85% stake in Volocopter in return for $95m of funding, according to a Bloomberg report. The deal could mean that any future manufacturing would be moved to China.",

      "Their machines promise the flexibility of a helicopter, but without the cost, noise and emissions.",

      "One of the most high-profile casualties is Lilium.",
      "The German company had developed a radical take on the EVTOL theme.",

      "For the moment, work on the new aircraft is continuing, as the company works with restructuring experts to sell the business or bring in new investment. However, getting the new e-jet into production is looking more challenging than ever.",
      "The high-profile British player in the eVTOL market is Vertical Aerospace. The Bristol-based company was founded in 2016 by businessman Stephen Fitzpatrick, who also set up OVO Energy.",
      "Its striking VX4 design uses eight large propellers mounted on slim, aircraft style wings to generate lift. Mr Fitzpatrick has made ambitious claims about the aircraft, suggesting it would be \u201c100 times\u201d safer and quieter than a helicopter, for 20% of the cost.",
      "The company has made progress. After completing a programme of remote-controlled testing, it began carrying out piloted tests earlier this year. Initially, these were carried out with the aircraft tethered to the ground. In early November, it carried out its first untethered take-off and landing.",
      "But there have also been serious setbacks. In August last year, a remotely-piloted prototype was badly damaged when it crashed during testing at Cotswold Airport, after a propeller blade fell off.",

    "title": "Could a thermal camera reveal your home's hidden heat loss?",
    "published": "Fri, 29 Nov 2024 00:05:12 GMT",
    "summary": "Thermal imaging tech has become cheaper and homeowners are using it to track down heat loss.",
    "story": [
      "It\u2019s like X-ray vision \u2013 for heat loss. Last year, web engineer Jamie Matthews bought a thermal imaging camera. His home, in the southeast of England, was about to give up some of its secrets.",
      "The colourful images on the device\u2019s small screen soon revealed how his loft hatch was letting him down.",
      "\u201cThat was really obvious on the camera,\u201d he says, explaining that he could see cool areas on the hatch, where heat was apparently escaping.",
      "Mr Mathews, who runs a software company that supplies the clean tech industry, also found some other small gaps in external walls and parts of his roof that appeared less well insulated than others.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s good fun and it certainly shows up things that may not be immediately obvious,\u201d he says.",
      "While Mr Matthews was able to draught-proof some areas himself, he says he would take a more methodical approach if he were planning any major changes to his home. The web engineer later had a professional heat loss survey carried out when he installed a heat pump, for example.",
      "That approach is sensible, according to building physics researchers who spoke to the BBC. There are signs that thermal cameras are becoming more popular, as homeowners seek to slash their heating bills and carbon emissions. Local councils are increasingly allowing residents to borrow the devices for free, for example.",
      "But there is no substitute for professional advice if you are planning big works or interventions, experts say.",
      "Thermal cameras work by using a sensor to detect infrared light, which we cannot see, but which we can sometimes feel as heat. Such devices aren\u2019t cheap. Mr Matthews spent roughly \u00a3160 on his, though organisations including local councils and energy supplier Octopus Energy do loan them out to people free of charge so that they can gain a basic understanding of heat loss in their homes.",
      "Wiltshire Council recently made 11 devices available to borrow from local libraries, as well as a brief guide on how to use them. There has been \u201chuge uptake\u201d says Cllr Ian Blair-Pilling, such that the council now has a waiting list for interested residents.",
      "\"Expert advice, combined with a measured approach to the findings from thermal imaging, will give residents the best chance of making informed decisions about energy-saving home improvements,\" says Cllr Blair-Pilling.",
      "Small interventions could help people keep their homes warm and reduce the risk of cold-related health conditions, he adds.",
      "However, Jo Atkinson, senior consultant in buildings decarbonisation at Energy Systems Catapult, a research organisation, expresses concern over the growing availability of thermal cameras: \u201cIn my opinion, the risks are too great for making the wrong choices.\u201d",
      "It is possible to misinterpret thermal camera images, she says, noting that if a wall has been warmed by the sun, an image of that wall taken outside could make it look as though heat is escaping, when it is not. Reflective surfaces can also appear, misleadingly, to be leaking heat.",
      "While using a thermal camera as a starting point for understanding your home is \u201cabsolutely fine\u201d, according to Ronita Bardhan at the University of Cambridge, it is important to ask for independent expert advice when planning any renovation works.",
      "Thermal camera imagery can make it look as though some areas of your home are losing a lot of heat, but this might simply be a result of how the camera has been calibrated, how the user holds it and moves it around, and which colour palette was chosen for the display.",
      "Dr Bardhan adds that there is a risk of triggering \u201cretrofit anxiety\u201d in homeowners.",
      "Plus, if people go on to alter their insulation, for example, such measures should be taken with great care as improper installation can cause damp and mould.",
      "North Somerset Council provides thermal cameras to residents, on loan, and this scheme is also currently operating on a waiting list basis due to its popularity. The Council has published introductory advice on how to use the cameras, including an online video.",
      "The Centre for Sustainable Energy (CSE), a charity, highlights a more detailed guide from the National House-Building Council, which describes how to use thermal cameras. However, a CSE spokeswoman adds that the organisation still recommends people seek expert advice.",
      "Phil Steele, future technologies evangelist at Octopus Energy, agrees: \u201cYou have got to be careful.\u201d Thermal cameras can, for instance, make the corners of rooms look very cold but this is simply a reflection of reduced air circulation in those areas, rather than an insulation problem, he explains.",
      "Octopus Energy has around 500 cameras that it loans out to customers every winter. Last year, the firm distributed the devices roughly 3,800 times.",
      "Thermal camera-wielding homeowners who have spoken to the BBC, such as Mr Matthews, say they have treated the imagery with caution.",
      "Louise Green, a designer in London, says she read online training materials before using a thermal camera to search for points of heat loss in a house shortly after she and her partner moved in.",
      "In her case, Miss Green rented the camera from Library of Things, a community-focused organisation that makes various items available for people to borrow. The device indicated loss of heat around windows and doors in Miss Green\u2019s home. She and her partner were able to compare the results to their neighbour\u2019s better-insulated property.",
      "\u201cIt just confirmed what we knew already, but it was still interesting to see, you know, were there any other areas?\u201d she explains.",
      "Darrell Taylor at Flir, a firm that makes thermal cameras, says that members of the public can access some free training materials on his company\u2019s website.",
      "He adds that Flir aims to make thermal images as clear and easy to interpret as possible \u2013 including by merging optical imagery with thermal imagery, to add more detail to the final picture. And he suggests that, in the future, Flir cameras may offer machine learning-based instructions and advice as people use the devices.",
      "Those who know how best to interpret thermal camera imagery can find extraordinary hidden problems in a building, though.",
      "Dr Bardhan recently took a very high resolution camera to a viewing of a house she was considering buying. But the thermal images revealed cracks in a wall, which later proved to be signs of subsidence.",
      "\u201cThat would probably not have been exposed unless I had gone in and seen it,\u201d she says. Dr Bardhan decided not to make an offer on the property.",

      "The family of four stood in the middle of the street in front of the pile of twisted metal and broken concrete, struggling to comprehend the devastation they were seeing.",
      "The building had been destroyed by a recent Israeli air strike and smoke was still rising from the rubble. The next building to the right had partially collapsed; the one behind it had a huge hole at the top.",
      "They continued walking to the building where they used to live, in Tyre in southern Lebanon. The displaced family was back, hours after a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah had come into effect. Nobody seemed to have stayed in their home.",

      "Mohamad Marouf led his wife and two sons. He struggled to open the main door. When he finally got in, he instantly realised that his home as he knew it was, for now, gone.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m so sad, it\u2019s a nice and decent house,\u201d said Mr Marouf, a car dealer. \u201cThere\u2019s just so much damage.\u201d",
      "Panels had fallen from the ceiling. Windows, doors and furniture were destroyed. In the kitchen, cups and plates lie broken on the floor. There was dust and debris everywhere. Room by room, he mourned objects that were now beyond repair, and celebrated those that somehow had remained intact.",
      "The destruction, Mr Marouf said, had been caused by an attack on a residential building nearby. It was so powerful that his building, too, was heavily damaged.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d he said. They were living with his brother, and did not know when they would be able to move back.",

      "Some people waved Hezbollah flags; in the distance, there was the sporadic sound of celebratory gunfire. Many supporters say the ceasefire is a sign of the group\u2019s victory. The \u201cresistance\u201d, as they often refer to Hezbollah, stopped the Israeli military\u2019s advances on the ground, they contend, and Israel failed to achieve its objectives in Lebanon.",

      "Israel\u2019s stated goal was to remove the group from the border and allow the return of around 60,000 residents who had been displaced.",
      "Israeli bombardments were mostly contained to mainly Shia Muslim areas of the country where Hezbollah was essentially in control. More than one million people were forced to leave their homes.",
      "A 60-day pause is now in force as part of a ceasefire deal, which many hope will bring an end to the conflict. Under its terms Israel and Hezbollah will pull out from the south, a traditional Hezbollah stronghold, and the Lebanese military will deploy an additional 5,000 soldiers to the area.",

      "By the end of the first day of the offensive, the rebels had advanced into the western Aleppo countryside, taking them within 10km (6 miles) from the outskirts of Aleppo city, according to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR).",
      "It reported that they had seized the Syrian army 46th Regiment\u2019s base and at least eight villages.",
      "On Thursday, the monitoring group said the rebels had cut the M5 highway between Aleppo and the capital Damascus near Zarbah, 15km south-west of Aleppo city, and taken control of the interchange between the M5 and the M4 highway further south, near Saraqeb.",
      "The SOHR said 121 rebels, most of them members of HTS, and 40 government troops and 21 militiamen had been killed over the past two days.",
      "The rebels said in a Telegram statement that they had seized the town of Khan al-Assal, which is 5km west of Aleppo city, and had killed more than 200 members of pro-government forces.",
      "A Syrian military statement put out on Thursday said its forces had \u201cconfronted the terrorist attack that is still ongoing with various weapons and in co-operation with friendly forces, leaving heavy losses in equipment and causalities among terrorists\u201d.",
      "It did not mention any losses among its forces, but Iranian news agencies said a senior commander in Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards serving as a \u201cmilitary adviser\u201d in Syria, Brig Gen Kioumars Pourhashemi, had been killed in Aleppo province.",
      "Meanwhile, the Syria Civil Defence, whose first responders are known as the White Helmets, said on Thursday that Syrian and Russian warplanes had struck residential neighbourhoods and shops in the opposition-controlled town of Atareb, 20km west of Aleppo, killing 14 civilians, including three children and two women.",
      "It also reported that four civilians had been killed Darat Izza, north of Atareb.",

      "The UN\u2019s Deputy Regional Humanitarian Co-ordinator for Syria, David Carden, said he was deeply alarmed by the impact of the escalating hostilities on civilians.",

    "story": [
      "Australia will ban children under 16 from using social media, after its parliament approved the world's strictest laws.",
      "The ban, which will not take effect for at least 12 months, could see tech companies fined up to A$50m ($32.5m; \u00a325.7m) if they don't comply.",
      "Prime Minister Anthony Albanese says the legislation is needed to protect young people from the  \"harms\" of social media, something many parent groups have echoed.",
      "But critics say questions over how the ban will work - and its impact on privacy and social connection - have been left unanswered.",
      "This is not the first attempt globally to restrict children's social media use, but the minimum age of 16 is the highest set by any country. Unlike other attempts, it also does not include exemptions for existing users or those with parental consent.",
      "Having passed the Senate by 34 votes to 19 late on Thursday, the bill returned to the House of Representatives where it passed early on Friday.",
      "\u201cWe want our kids to have a childhood and parents to know we have their backs,\" Albanese told reporters afterwards.",
      "The legislation does not specify which platforms will be banned. Those decisions will be made later by Australia\u2019s communications minister, who will seek advice from the eSafety Commissioner - an internet regulator that will enforce the rules.",
      "However the minister, Michelle Rowland, has said the ban will include Snapchat, TikTok, Facebook, Instagram and X. Gaming and messaging platforms are exempt, as are sites that can be accessed without an account, meaning YouTube, for instance, is likely to be spared.",
      "The government says will it rely on some form of age-verification technology to implement the restrictions, and options will be tested in the coming months. The onus will be on the social media platforms to add these processes themselves.",
      "However digital researchers have warned there are no guarantees the unspecified technology - which could rely on biometrics or identity information - will work. Critics have also sought assurances that privacy will be protected.",
      "They have also warned that restrictions could easily be circumvented through tools like a VPN - which can disguise a user\u2019s location and make them appear to be logging on from another country.",
      "Children who find ways to flout the rules will not face penalties, however.",
      "Polling on the reforms, though limited, suggests it is supported by a majority of Australian parents and caregivers.",

      "\"We\u2019ve been trapped in a norm that no one wants to be a part of.\"",
      "But many experts say the ban is \"too blunt an instrument\" to effectively address the risks associated with social media use, and have warned it could end up pushing children into less regulated corners of the internet.",
      "During a short consultation period before the bill passed, Google and Snap criticised the legislation for not providing more detail, and Meta said the bill would be \"ineffective\" and not meet its stated aim of making kids safer.",
      "In its submission, TikTok said the government\u2019s definition of a social media platform was so \"broad and unclear\" that \"almost every online service could fall within [it]\".",
      "X questioned the \"lawfulness\" of the bill - saying it may not be compatible with international regulations and human rights treaties which Australia has signed.",
      "Some youth advocates also accused the government of not fully understanding the role social media plays in their lives, and locking them out of the debate.",
      "\"We understand we are vulnerable to the risks and negative impacts of social media\u2026 but we need to be involved in developing solutions,\" wrote the eSafety Youth Council, which advises the regulator.",
      "Albanese has acknowledged the debate is complex but steadfastly defended the bill.",
      "\"We don't argue that its implementation will be perfect, just like the alcohol ban for [children] under 18 doesn\u2019t mean that someone under 18 never has access \u2013 but we know that it\u2019s the right thing to do,\" he said on Friday.",

      "Troops are in control of, and are clearing, an area across the width of north Gaza. Satellite images and videos show that hundreds of buildings have been demolished between the Mediterranean Sea and the Israel border, mostly through controlled explosions.",
      "Images also show Israeli troops and vehicles have been stationed across the new divide. Analysts said the images suggest Gaza is being split into zones to make it easier to control.",
      "An IDF spokesperson told the BBC it was \"targeting terrorist operatives and infrastructure\" in north Gaza.",
      "Dr H A Hellyer, a Middle East security expert from the Rusi think tank, said the satellite images suggested Israel was preparing to block Palestinian civilians from returning to the north Gaza governorate. More than 100,000 people have already been displaced from the far north of Gaza, according to the UN.",
      "Images appear to show two long sections of road on either end of the strip being connected by cleared land through an urban area. Buildings are being demolished between the two sections of road, with a clear pattern visible since early October.",
      "This partition stretches about 5.6 miles (9km) across Gaza, from east to west, dividing Gaza City and the towns of Jabalia, Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahia in north Gaza.",
      "The BBC has been told that there is a tactical route between Jabalia and Gaza City, which is part of operational activities targeting Hamas in Jabalia.",
      "Videos filmed by the IDF and posted online show several multi-storey buildings being destroyed in controlled explosions since the beginning of October.",

      "An IDF spokesperson told the BBC that it had no intention of destroying civilian infrastructure \"without operational necessity\" to neutralise Hamas.",
      "Other footage shows IDF Humvee vehicles being driven through the cleared area from the direction of Israel. Humvees are not as heavily armoured as other military vehicles - and Dr Hellyer told the BBC that they were unlikely to be used unless the military was confident about their safety, indicating that Israeli troops are in control of the area.",
      "Some analysts believe the IDF\u2019s presence could indicate a permanent military partition \u2013 giving it control of who can travel between the Gaza and the North Gaza governorates.",
      "Dr Hellyer said of the IDF: \u201cThey\u2019re digging in for the long term. I would absolutely expect the north partition to develop exactly like the Netzarim Corridor.\u201d",
      "The BBC has previously documented how two partitions have been constructed in Gaza since the start of the current war. The Netzarim Corridor splits an area south of Gaza City, while the Philadelphi Corridor gives the IDF control of land running the length of Gaza\u2019s border with Egypt.",
      "BBC analysis of this new partition in the north shows a similar pattern to the construction of the previous corridors over the past year, with existing and newly built roads being connected and military positions emerging at regular intervals. Buildings and agricultural land are cleared so roads can be paved and military infrastructure built.",
      "Dr Eado Hecht from the Begin\u2013Sadat Center for Strategic Studies (Besa), an Israeli think tank specialising in national security and foreign policy, agreed that the data showed a new dividing line, but questioned whether it was designed to be permanent.",
      "\u201cThere is a new partition corridor separating Gaza City and the northern towns of the Gaza Strip. The goal is to cut off the Hamas - and other organizations' - forces that have returned to that area from support and the ability to retreat, so they can be dealt with more effectively.\u201d",
      "Israel has denied that it is implementing the \"General\u2019s Plan\". Under the strategy, devised by former general Giora EIland, civilians would be told to leave the north, supplies would be blocked and the area would become a military zone. Those who remained would be treated as combatants and faced with the choice of \u201csurrender or starve\", with the aim of putting pressure on Hamas to release its hostages.",
      "In a statement to the BBC, an IDF spokesperson said: \"The IDF operates according to well-established military plans, and the claim that the IDF is implementing this specific plan is incorrect.\"",
      "But concerns have mounted over the safety of the thousands of Palestinian civilians who remain in besieged towns in north Gaza.",
      "The UN and aid charities have raised significant concerns about the situation in the north of Gaza. While thousands of people have been displaced, the UN says over 65,000 people could remain in the area.",
      "The UN also said that \"virtually no aid\" has entered parts of the North Gaza governorate in 40 days on 20 November. A spokesperson on 26 November said that Palestinians were facing \u201cfacing critical shortages of supplies and services, as well as severe overcrowding and poor hygiene conditions\u201d due to the blockade.",
      "Earlier this month, a UN-backed assessment said there was a strong likelihood that famine was imminent in the besieged areas of northern Gaza.",
      "BBC analysis shows around 90% of north Gaza has been subject to evacuation orders since the start of October. Videos posted on social media document people being moved south of the new partition. It is not clear if and when they will be able to return, but Israel\u2019s foreign minister has insisted civilians will be allowed to return after the war.",
      "Satellite images show the displacement of people in north Gaza. Large groups of tents, erected as temporary shelter, disappear. In the area left behind, there are often destroyed buildings and other examples of military activity.",
      "While the IDF appears to have established enough control in the area to travel in lightly armoured vehicles, heavy fighting has also persisted in the area between IDF troops and Hamas fighters.",
      "Videos posted by Hamas fighters show clashes with IDF tanks in the area around the dividing line.",
      "Experts disagree over how long the new partition might be intended to remain in place. Dr Hellyer suggested that it could form the basis of plan to expel Palestinians from the area permanently.",
      "\"Personally I think they're going to settle Jewish settlers in the north, probably in the next 18 months,\" he said. \"They won't call them settlements. To begin with they'll call them outposts or whatever, but that's what they'll be and they'll grow from there.\"",

    "summary": "The proposed tariffs, if applied to oil and gas, could hammer Canada's economy and hike prices at the pump for Americans, analysts say.",
    "story": [
      "In Canada\u2019s oil-rich province of Alberta, there is a deep sense of unease over President-elect Donald Trump's threat to impose a 25% tariff on Canadian goods.",
      "Canadian politicians and energy experts are warning the hefty tariff would have dire consequences for the economy of America's northern neighbour  - and hike prices on US consumers.",
      "\"Canada has no choice in this,\" Dennis McConaghy, an Alberta-based former energy executive, told the BBC.",
      "\"It has to find an accommodation with Trump.\"",
      "Trump announced on Monday that, upon taking office in January, he would slap an across-the-board tariff on Mexico and Canada - with no suggestion that would exclude oil and gas.",
      "Lisa Baiton, president and CEO of the Calgary-based Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, said the levy would likely mean Canada producing less oil.",
      "Mr McConaghy said that would lead to job losses in Alberta, with potential repercussions for Canada as a whole, as poorer provinces rely on cash transfers from revenues generated by wealthier provinces - like Alberta - to help offset costs and provide social services.",
      "It could also lead to a devaluation of the Canadian dollar at a time when the currency is already struggling due to domestic economic factors, he said.",
      "\u201cKeep in mind, roughly 80% of Canada\u2019s trade is with the United States, and a majority of that trade is in hydrocarbons. Canadians can\u2019t escape how integrated they are with the US.\u201d",
      "US fuel makers have also urged Trump to rule out oil and gas from any proposed levies given that Americans rely heavily on imported Canadian crude.",
      "\u201cCrude oil is to refineries what flour is to bakeries,\u201d said the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers (AFPM) industry group in a statement this week.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s our number one feedstock and input cost. If those feedstocks were to become significantly more expensive, so too would the overall cost of making fuel here in the United States.\u201d",
      "The US is the world\u2019s largest producer of crude oil and natural gas, but some regions - California, the northeast and parts of the Midwest - do not have the infrastructure or pipeline capacity to rely solely on US oil and need imports to supply fuel to consumers.",
      "Around 40% of the crude that runs through US oil refineries is imported, and the vast majority of it comes from Canada.",
      "Canadian oil is especially relied on in the landlocked Midwest, where refineries have been outfitted to process the heavier Canadian blends.",
      "The AFPM said there is no easy replacement for that crude without relying on overseas sources that could erode US energy security.",
      "The industry group warned that a tariff on Canadian oil would drive up operating costs in the Midwest - costs some experts say will be downloaded onto consumers.",
      "Patrick De Haan, a Chicago-based gas prices analyst, estimated that states like Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan could see gas prices rising by up to 75 cents a gallon.",
      "Mr De Haan noted in a post on X, formerly Twitter, that these higher prices would not only be felt at the pump, but could potentially increase costs for airlines and freight haulers as well.",
      "An increase in oil prices for US consumers would run counter to Trump's promise to slash energy costs.",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump frequently said he planned to cut the price of gasoline to under $2 (\u00a31.57) a gallon. As of late November, the price of regular gasoline in the US sat around $3 a gallon.",
      "But Trump has also vowed to increase American energy independence by boosting domestic drilling and being less reliant on foreign oil and gas, particularly from countries not allied with the US.",
      "It remains unclear whether the tariffs will ultimately materialise, analysts have noted, as Trump has been known to use such threats in the past as a negotiation tactic to achieve certain goals.",
      "In this case, Trump could be using the tariffs to get Canada and Mexico to cooperate on border security.",
      "Trump has signalled that the levies would remain in place until both Canada and Mexico work on securing their shared borders with the US, limiting the number of unlawful migrants and drugs flowing into the country.",
      "Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is promising to present a united \u201cTeam Canada\u201d front and to work together with the incoming Trump administration to avoid the blanket tariffs.",
      "The leaders of major Canadian provinces like Ontario, Quebec and Alberta have urged Trudeau to act quickly on these demands, and on Wednesday, Trudeau held an emergency meeting with provincial and territorial leaders to discuss how to move forward.",
      "Danielle Smith, premier of Alberta, said her province will be \u201cworking aggressively\u201d in the coming months to connect with US counterparts and to drill home the message that a strong partnership with Canada would be of benefit to the US and its energy security.",

    "story": [
      "Can a navigation app be held responsible if a user gets into an accident?",
      "That is the question being asked in India after three men died when their car veered off an unfinished bridge and fell on to a riverbed in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh.",
      "Police are still investigating the incident, which took place on Sunday, but they believe that Google Maps led the group to take that route.",
      "A part of the bridge had reportedly collapsed earlier this year because of floods and while locals knew this and avoided the bridge, the three men were not aware of this and were from outside the area. There were no barricades or sign boards indicating that the bridge was unfinished.",
      "Authorities have named four engineers from the state's road department and an unnamed official from Google Maps in a police complaint on charges of culpable homicide.",
      "A spokesperson from Google told BBC Hindi that it was co-operating with the investigation.",
      "The tragic accident has spotlighted India's poor road infrastructure and sparked a debate on whether navigation apps like Google Maps share responsibility for such incidents.",
      "Some blame the app for not providing accurate information while others argue that it is a larger failure on the part of the government for not cordoning off the place.",
      "Google Maps is the most popular navigation app in India and has become synonymous with GPS (Global Positioning System), a satellite-based radio navigation system.",
      "It also powers the services of many ride-sharing, e-commerce and food delivery platforms. The app reportedly has around 60 million active users and witnesses around 50 million searches in a day.",
      "But the app has frequently come under scrutiny for providing incorrect directions, sometimes leading to fatal accidents.",
      "In 2021, a man from Maharashtra state drowned after he drove his car into a dam, allegedly while following directions on the app.",
      "Last year, two young doctors in Kerala state died after they drove their car into a river.  Police said that they had been following a route shown by the app and cautioned people against relying on it too much when roads were flooded.",
      "But how does Google Maps learn about changes on a road?",
      "GPS signals from users\u2019 apps track traffic changes along routes - an increase signals congestion, while a decrease suggests a road is less used. The app also receives updates from governments and users about traffic jams or closures.",
      "Complaints related to high traffic, or the ones notified by authorities are given priority, as Google does not have the manpower to deal with the millions of complaints streaming in daily, says Ashish Nair, the founder of mapping platform Potter Maps and a former Google Maps employee.",
      "\"A map operator then uses satellite imagery, Google Street View and government notifications to confirm the change and update the map.\"",
      "According to Mr Nair, navigating apps cannot be held responsible for mishaps as their terms of services make it clear that users must apply their own judgement on the road and that the information provided by the app might differ from actual conditions.",
      "Besides, it is simply very difficult for a platform like Google, which manages maps across the world, to keep across every change that happens on a road, he adds.",
      "Unlike other countries, India also does not have a robust system for reporting such issues on time.",
      "\"Data remains a big challenge in India. There is no system for infrastructural changes to be logged into a web interface, which can then be used by apps like Google Maps. Countries like Singapore have such a system,\" Mr Nair says.",
      "He adds that India's vast population and fast-paced development make it even more challenging to get accurate, real-time data. \"In other words, bad maps are here to stay until governments become more proactive about collecting and sharing data.\"",
      "Lawyers are divided on whether GPS apps can be held legally responsible for road accidents.",
      "Advocate Saima Khan says that since India's Information Technology (IT) Act gives digital platforms like Google Maps the status of an 'intermediary' (a platform that merely disseminates information provided by a third party) it is protected against liability.",
      "But she adds that if it can be proven that the platform did not rectify its data despite being given correct, timely information, then it might be held liable for   negligence.",

      "For most of the people of Lebanon, a ceasefire could not come quickly enough. A leading Lebanese analyst at a conference on the Middle East that I\u2019m attending in Rome said she couldn\u2019t sleep as the appointed hour for the ceasefire came closer.",
      "\u201cIt was like the night before Christmas when you\u2019re a kid. I couldn\u2019t wait for it to happen.\u201d",
      "You can see why there\u2019s relief. More than 3,500 citizens of Lebanon have been killed in Israeli strikes. Displaced people packed their cars before dawn to try to get back to whatever remains of their homes.",
      "Well over one million of them have been forced to flee by Israeli military action. Thousands have been wounded and the homes of tens of thousands of others have been destroyed.",
      "But in Israel, some feel they have lost the chance to do more damage to Hezbollah.",
      "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met the heads of Israel\u2019s northern municipalities, which have been turned into ghost towns with around 60,000 civilians evacuated further south.",
      "Israel\u2019s Ynet news website reported that it was an angry meeting that turned into a shouting match, with some of the local officials frustrated that Israel was taking the pressure off their enemies in Lebanon and not offering an immediate plan to get civilians home.",
      "In a newspaper column, the mayor of Kiryat Shmona, close to the border, said he doubted the ceasefire would be enforced, demanding that Israel creates a buffer zone in south Lebanon. In a poll commissioned by the Israeli station Channel 12 News those questioned were roughly split between supporters and opponents of the ceasefire.",
      "Half of the participants in the survey believe Hezbollah has not been defeated and 30% think the ceasefire will collapse.",
      "Back in late September, at the UN General Assembly in New York, a deal looked as if it was close. Diplomats from the US and UK were convinced that a ceasefire very similar to the one that is now coming into force was about to happen.",
      "All sides in the war appeared to have signalled their willingness to accept a ceasefire based on the provisions of Security Council resolution 1701, which was passed to end the 2006 Lebanon war: Hezbollah would pull back from the border to be replaced by UN peacekeepers and the Lebanese Armed Forces. As they moved in, Israeli forces would gradually move out.",
      "But Prime Minister Netanyahu went to the podium at the UN to deliver a fiery speech that refused to accept any pause in Israel\u2019s offensive.",
      "Back at his New York hotel Netanyahu\u2019s official photographer captured the moment as he ordered the assassination of Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, along with most of his high command. Netanyahu\u2019s office released the photos, in another calculated snub for American diplomacy.",
      "The assassination was a significant escalation and a blow to Hezbollah. In the weeks since, Israel\u2019s military has inflicted immense damage to Hezbollah\u2019s military organisation. It could still fire rockets over the border and its fighters continued to engage Israel\u2019s invasion force. But Hezbollah is no longer the same threat to Israel.",
      "Netanyahu: Time to 'replenish stocks\u2019",
      "Military success is one of several factors that have come together to persuade Benjamin Netanyahu that this is a good time to stop.",
      "Israel\u2019s agenda in Lebanon is more limited than in Gaza and the rest of the occupied Palestinian territories. It wants to push Hezbollah back from its northern border and to allow civilians to return to border towns.",
      "If Hezbollah looks to be preparing an attack, Israel has a side letter from the Americans agreeing that it can take military action.",
      "In a recorded statement announcing his decision, Netanyahu listed the reasons why it was time for a ceasefire. Israel, he said, had made the ground in Beirut shake. Now there was a chance \u2018to give our forces a breather and replenish stocks,\u2019 he continued.",
      "Israel had also broken the connection between Gaza and Lebanon. After the late Hassan Nasrallah ordered the attacks on Israel\u2019s north, the day after Hamas went to war on 7 October last year, he said they would continue until there was a ceasefire in Gaza.",
      "Now, Netanyahu said, Hamas in Gaza would be under even more pressure. Palestinians fear another escalation in Israel\u2019s Gaza offensive.",
      "There was one more reason; to concentrate on what Netanyahu called the Iranian threat. Damaging Hezbollah means damaging Iran. It was built up by the Iranians to create a threat right on Israel\u2019s border. Hezbollah became the strongest part of Iran\u2019s axis of resistance, the name it gave to its network of forward defence made up of allies and proxies.",
      "Why Iran wanted a ceasefire",
      "Just like Hezbollah\u2019s surviving leaders, their patrons in Iran also wanted a ceasefire. Hezbollah needs a pause to lick its wounds. Iran needs to stop the geostrategic bleeding. Its axis of resistance is no longer a deterrent. Iran\u2019s missile attack on Israel after Nasrallah\u2019s assassination did not repair the damage.",
      "Two men, both now assassinated, designed Hezbollah to deter Israel not just from attacking Lebanon \u2013 but also from attacking Iran. They were Qasem Soleimani, head of the Quds Force of Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards, who was killed by an American drone strike at Baghdad airport in January 2020. The order was issued by Donald Trump in his last few weeks in the White House at the end of his first term. The other was Hassan Nasrallah, killed by a huge Israeli air strike in Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs.",
      "Hezbollah and Iran\u2019s deterrence strategy matched Israel\u2019s own deterrence for almost 20 years after the end of the 2006 war. But among the profound changes caused by the 7 October attacks was Israel\u2019s determination not to accept restrictions on the wars it would wage in response. America, its most important ally, also put almost no restrictions on the supply or use of the weapons it kept on providing.",
      "Nasrallah and Iran failed to see what had happened. They did not understand how Israel had changed.  They sought to impose a war of attrition on Israel, and succeeded for almost a year. Then on 17 September Israel broke out of it by triggering the miniature bombs built into the network of booby-trapped pagers its intelligence services had duped Hezbollah into buying.",
      "Hezbollah was thrown off balance. Before it could react with the most powerful weapons Iran had provided, Israel killed Nasrallah and most of his key lieutenants, accompanied by massive strikes that destroyed arms dumps. That was followed by an invasion of South Lebanon and the wholesale destruction of Lebanese border villages as well as Hezbollah\u2019s tunnel network.",
      "Trump, Gaza and the future",
      "A ceasefire in Lebanon is not necessarily a precursor to one in Gaza. Gaza is different. The war there is about more than security of the border, and Israeli hostages.",
      "It is also about revenge, about Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s political survival, and his government\u2019s absolute rejection of Palestinian aspirations for independence.",
      "The Lebanon ceasefire is fragile and deliberately paced to buy time for it to work. When the 60 days in which it is supposed to take effect ends, Donald Trump will be back in the Oval Office. President-elect Trump has indicated that he wants a ceasefire in Lebanon, but his precise plans have not yet emerged.",
      "The Middle East is waiting for the ways he might affect the region. Some optimists hope that he might want to create a moment akin to President Nixon\u2019s sensational visit to China in 1972 by reaching out to Iran.",
      "The pessimists fear he might abandon even the hollow genuflection that the US still makes to the idea of a creating an independent Palestine alongside Israel \u2013 the so-called two state solution. That might pave the way to annexation of those parts of the occupied Palestinian territories Israel wants, including much of the West Bank and northern Gaza.",
      "What is certain though is that the Middle East has no chance of escaping more generations of war and violent death until the region\u2019s fundamental political ruptures are faced and fixed. The biggest is the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.",
      "Benjamin Netanyahu and his government, along with most Israelis believe it is possible to dominate their enemies by pressing on to a military victory. Netanyahu is actively using force, unrestrained by the US, to alter the balance of power in the Middle East in Israel\u2019s favour.",
      "In a conflict that has lasted more than a century both Arabs and Jews have dreamt repeatedly of peace through military victory. Every generation has tried and failed. The catastrophic consequences of the Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October 2023 ripped away any pretence that the conflict could be managed while Israel continued to deny Palestinian rights to self-determination. The ceasefire in Lebanon is a respite. It is not a solution.",

      "Where can I buy the book?",
      "The new keepsake, titled \"Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour Book,\" is available only at Target. It hits the retailer's stores on Friday, while it will become available for sale on Target's website\u00a0on Saturday. Swift self-published the book under Taylor Swift Publications.",
      "Target first teased the book launch in an Instagram\u00a0post on Oct. 15. Swift herself also promoted the book in an Instagram\u00a0post that garnered more than 3.6 million likes.",
      "What's in The Eras Tour book?",

      "Former TV host Charlie Rose has resolved a sexual harassment lawsuit brought by three women in the wake of his #MeToo-era ouster from CBS News in 2017 and the cancellation of his long-running, eponymous PBS talk show.",
      "In settling, the plaintiffs said they assign no \"ill intent\" to Rose and realize now that his conduct could be subject to interpretation.",
      "Lawyers for Rose and the women \u2014 younger employees who accused him of \"predatory behavior\" and \"blatant and repeated sexual harassment\" \u2014 filed court papers this week confirming that the lawsuit has been resolved. An online court docket listed the case as settled. The terms were not disclosed.",
      "The lawsuit had been set to go to trial Monday in Manhattan after years of sparring over the women's allegations and the dismissal of their retaliation claims against Rose.",
      "Plaintiffs Katherine Brooks Harris, Sydney McNeal and Yuqing Wei said in a statement that the litigation process and the required pretrial exchange of evidence known as discovery had enabled both sides to \"better understand each others' points of view.\"",
      "\"On reflection, and after having the benefit of discovery, we realize that different people could interpret the conduct in different ways, and therefore we have resolved the claims,\" the women said. \"We do not assign any bad motive or ill intent to Charlie Rose.\"",
      "A lawyer for Rose, 82, and his production company, Charlie Rose Inc., declined comment.",
      "The veteran TV host has apologized in the past for his behavior, including in a statement on the eve of his November 2017 firing after at least eight women had come forward to accuse him of misconduct.",
      "\"It is essential that these women know I hear them and I deeply apologize for my inappropriate behavior,\" Rose said. \"I am greatly embarrassed. I have behaved insensitively at times, and I accept responsibility for that, though I do not believe that all of these allegations are accurate. I always felt that I was pursuing shared feelings, even though I now realize I was mistaken.\"",
      "Rose's downfall was part of America's #MeToo reckoning with sexual misconduct by powerful figures \u2014 a social media-fueled movement that also took down \"Today\" host Matt Lauer and movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, among others. In September 2018, Rose said the three women he settled with this week were \"exploiting the #MeToo movement\" when he filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit.",
      "Rose is now hosting an interview show on YouTube where his recent guests have included author Michael Lewis and broadcaster Bob Costas.",
      "Harris, McNeal and Wei sued Rose and CBS in state court in New York in May 2018, about six months after CBS fired him as an anchor on its morning show, then called \"CBS This Morning,\" and PBS and Bloomberg Television dropped his nightly \"Charlie Rose Show,\" which had been on the air since 1991.",
      "Harris was a broadcast associate at \"CBS This Morning,\" and she later worked as an associate producer for Rose's PBS show. McNeal was Rose's executive assistant. Wei was a news associate and later an anchor assistant for Rose at \"CBS This Morning.\"",
      "The women, all in their early 20s when they were hired, accused the much older Rose of subjecting them to repeated physical and verbal sexual harassment while working, including inquires about their sex lives and boasts about his own. Harris and McNeal alleged that Rose said \"they were hired because he likes 'tall women,' i.e., he was attracted to them,\" and Wei alleged that Rose referred to her \"as China doll.\"\u00a0 The three women also accused CBS of knowingly failing to prevent Rose's harassment.",
      "CBS settled in December 2018 for an undisclosed sum. The network said at the time that the women had requested the terms be kept confidential.",
      "Had the lawsuit gone to trial, Rose's lawyer said in court papers that he would challenge the credibility of Harris, McNeal and Wei's claims with evidence showing they had previously expressed little or no concern about the ex-anchor.",
      "Among the evidence, lawyer Jonathan Bach wrote in a Nov. 13 filing, were documents showing that Wei told a CBS human resources officer that she experienced nothing \"sexually inappropriate\" while working for Rose and that McNeal confided in her therapist at the time that she had no personal experience of sexual harassment by Rose.",

      "Combs' lawyers had asked he be released on $50 million bond, saying he would stay in a three-bedroom apartment on New York's Upper East Side and pay the cost to have private security monitor him around the clock.",
      "District Judge Arun Subramanian denied the request, ruling, \"The Court finds that the government has shown by clear and convincing evidence that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the safety of the community.\"",

    "story": [
      "Rapper Drake's company Frozen Moments filed a petition in a New York court Monday accusing the streaming service Spotify and Universal Music Group of conspiring to inflate the streams of Kendrick Lamar's hit diss track \"Not Like Us.\"",
      "\"Not Like Us,\" the result of Lamar and Drake's weekslong beef, broke records on the Billboard rap charts, retaining the top spot all summer. Frozen Moments, described in the filing as \"an entity wholly owned by Drake,\" alleges that UMG \"launched a campaign to manipulate and saturate the streaming services and airwaves\" with \"Not Like Us\" via bots and pay-for-play agreements.",
      "The filing alleges the song was licensed to Spotify at a 30% discount in exchange for a boost in recommendations to users \u2014 the track now has over 900 million streams on Spotify, according to the service. The petition also alleges UMG used bots to drive up the streams on \"Not Like Us,\" paid radio promoters to increase air play and even paid tech giant Apple to have its voice assistant Siri misdirect users to Lamar's hit song.",
      "A spokesperson for UMG called the allegations \"offensive and untrue.\"",
      "\"We employ the highest ethical practices in our marketing and promotional campaigns,\" the spokesperson said in a statement. \"No amount of contrived and absurd legal arguments in this pre-action submission can mask the fact that fans choose the music they want to hear.\"",
      "When reached by CBS News, a publicist for Drake Tuesday had no comment. Spotify, Apple and representatives for Lamar did not immediately respond to CBS News requests for comment.",
      "According to the Associated Press, Drake on Tuesday filed a second legal action against UMG, but in Texas, also over \"Not Like Us.\" According to the AP, Tuesday's filing in Bexar County accuses UMG of engaging in \"irregular and inappropriate business practices\" to get radio airplay for \"Not Like Us,\" including making illegal payments to San Antonio-based iHeartMedia.",
      "When reached by CBS News Tuesday, iHeartMedia also declined to comment.",
      "UMG owns both Interscope, Lamar's label and Republic Records, where Drake has spent his entire career. Drake has mentioned UMG CEO Lucian Grainge in lyrics multiple times over the years, including 2023's \"Away From Home\" \u2014   rapping \"Who the CEO of Universal? They mistaken, 'cause Google saying Lucian, but that just doesn't make sense. Who filling up the piggy bank? Who bringing home the bacon?\" The line seems to indicate Drake's perceived importance to the label as Spotify's second most streamed artist behind Taylor Swift, whose Big Machine Records is also distributed by UMG.",
      "According to the petition, UMG terminated certain employees perceived as being loyal to Drake during the inter-label feud with Lamar, and rebuffed his attempts at negotiation, insisting that Drake take it up with Lamar directly instead of the label.",
      "The petition filed Monday is not a lawsuit, but a pre-action motion meant to gather more information from UMG and Spotify in the pursuit of a civil claim under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, commonly referred to as RICO.",
      "The legal action comes days after Lamar released \"GNX,\" his first album since the beef.

      "\"It's surprising and gratifying and humbling, in a way, that a little thing that I spent two weeks on has become a worldwide phenomenon,\" Heinemann said.",
      "The idea sprouted when Heinemann's friend, Don Rawitsch, came up with a board game for students he was teaching that simulated 1800s settlers going west on the Oregon Trail.",
      "Computers were in their very early days, and even though Heinemann says he'd only seen \"Pac-Man,\" he sensed an opportunity.",

      "Mark Young, Woolery's podcast co-host and friend, said in an email early Sunday that Woolery died at his home in Texas with his wife, Kristen, present. \"Chuck was a dear friend and brother and a tremendous man of faith, life will not be the same without him,\" Young wrote.",
      "Woolery, with his matinee idol looks, coiffed hair and ease with witty banter, was inducted into the American TV Game Show Hall of Fame in 2007 and earned a daytime Emmy nomination in 1978.",
      "In 1983, Woolery began an 11-year run as host of TV's \"Love Connection,\" for which he coined the phrase, \"We'll be back in two minutes and two seconds,\" a two-fingered signature dubbed the \"2 and 2.\" In 1984, he hosted TV's \"Scrabble,\" simultaneously hosting two game shows on TV until 1990.",
      "\"Love Connection,\" which aired long before the dawn of dating apps, had a premise that featured either a single man or single woman who would watch audition tapes of three potential mates and then pick one for a date.",
      "A couple of weeks after the date, the guest would sit with Woolery in front of a studio audience and tell everybody about the date. The audience would vote on the three contestants, and if the audience agreed with the guest's choice, \"Love Connection\" would offer to pay for a second date.",
      "Woolery told The Philadelphia Inquirer in 2003 that his favorite set of lovebirds was a man aged 91 and a woman aged 87. \"She had so much eye makeup on, she looked like a stolen Corvette. He was so old he said, 'I remember wagon trains.' The poor guy. She took him on a balloon ride.\"",
      "Other career highlights included hosting the shows \"Lingo,\" \"Greed\" and \"The Chuck Woolery Show,\" as well as hosting the short-lived syndicated revival of \"The Dating Game\" from 1998 to 2000 and an ill-fated 1991 talk show. In 1992, he played himself in two episodes of TV's \"Melrose Place.\"",
      "Woolery became the subject of the Game Show Network's first attempt at a reality show, \"Chuck Woolery: Naturally Stoned,\" which premiered in 2003. It shared the title of the pop song in 1968 by Woolery and his rock group, the Avant-Garde. It lasted six episode and was panned by critics.",
      "Woolery began his TV career at a show that has become a mainstay. Although most associated with Pat Sajak and Vanna White, \"Wheel of Fortune\" debuted on Jan. 6, 1975, on NBC with Woolery welcoming contestants and the audience. Woolery, then 33, was trying to make it in Nashville as a singer.",
      "\"Wheel of Fortune\" started life as \"Shopper's Bazaar,\" incorporating Hangman-style puzzles and a roulette wheel. After Woolery appeared on \"The Merv Griffin Show\" singing \"Delta Dawn,\" Merv Griffin asked him to host the new show with Susan Stafford.",
      "\"I had an interview that stretched to 15, 20 minutes,\" Woolery told The New York Times in 2003. \"After the show, when Merv asked if I wanted to do a game show, I thought, 'Great, a guy with a bad jacket and an equally bad mustache who doesn't care what you have to say \u2014 that's the guy I want to be.'\"",
      "NBC initially passed, but they retooled it as \"Wheel of Fortune\" and got the green light. After a few years, Woolery demanded a raise to $500,000 a year, or what host Peter Marshall was making on \"Hollywood Squares.\" Griffin balked and replaced Woolery with weather reporter Pat Sajak.",
      "\"Both Chuck and Susie did a fine job, and 'Wheel' did well enough on NBC, although it never approached the kind of ratings success that 'Jeopardy!' achieved in its heyday,\" Griffin said in \"Merv: Making the Good Life Last,\" an autobiography from the 2000s co-written by David Bender. Woolery earned an Emmy nod as host.",
      "Born in Ashland, Kentucky, Woolery served in the U.S. Navy before attending college. He played double bass in a folk trio, then formed the psychedelic rock duo The Avant-Garde in 1967 while working as a truck driver to support himself as a musician.",
      "The Avant-Garde, which toured in a refitted Cadillac hearse, had the Top 40 hit \"Naturally Stoned,\" with Woolery singing, \"When I put my mind on you alone/I can get a good sensation/Feel like I'm naturally stoned.\"",
      "After The Avant-Garde broke up, Woolery released his debut solo single \"I've Been Wrong\" in 1969 and several more singles with Columbia before transitioning to country music by the 1970s. He released two solo singles, \"Forgive My Heart\" and \"Love Me, Love Me.\"",
      "Woolery wrote or co-wrote songs for himself and everyone from Pat Boone to Tammy Wynette. On Wynette's 1971 album \"We Sure Can Love Each Other,\" Woolery wrote \"The Joys of Being a Woman\" with lyrics including \"See our baby on the swing/Hear her laugh, hear her scream.\"",
      "After his TV career ended, Woolery went into podcasting. In an interview with The New York Times, he called himself a gun-rights activist and described himself as a conservative libertarian and constitutionalist. He said he hadn't revealed his politics in liberal Hollywood for fear of retribution.",
      "He teamed up with Mark Young in 2014 for the podcast \"Blunt Force Truth\" and soon became a full supporter of Donald Trump while arguing minorities don't need civil rights and causing a firestorm by tweeting an antisemitic comment linking Soviet Communists to Judaism.",
      "\"President Obama's popularity is a fantasy only held by him and his dwindling legion of juice-box-drinking, anxiety-dog-hugging, safe-space-hiding snowflakes,\" he said.",
      "Woolery also was active online, retweeting articles from Conservative Brief, insisting Democrats were trying to install a system of Marxism and spreading headlines such as \"Impeach him! Devastating photo of Joe Biden leaks.\"",
      "During the early stages of the pandemic, Woolery initially accused medical professionals and Democrats of lying about the virus in an effort to hurt the economy and Trump's chances for reelection to the presidency.",
      "\"The most outrageous lies are the ones about COVID-19. Everyone is lying. The CDC, media, Democrats, our doctors, not all but most, that we are told to trust. I think it's all about the election and keeping the economy from coming back, which is about the election. I'm sick of it,\" Woolery wrote in July 2020.",
      "Trump retweeted that post to his 83 million followers. By the end of the month, nearly 4.5 million Americans had been infected with COVID-19 and more than 150,000 had died.",

My son tested positive for the virus, and I feel for of those suffering and especially for those who have lost loved ones,\" Woolery posted before his account was deleted.",
      "Woolery later explained on his podcast that he never called COVID-19 \"a hoax\" or said \"it's not real,\" just that \"we've been lied to.\" Woolery also said it was \"an honor to have your president retweet what your thoughts are and think it's important enough to do that.\"",

    "summary": "Barbara Taylor Bradford\u200b was one of the world's most popular and wealthiest writers, her net worth estimated at more than $200 million.",
    "story": [
      "Barbara Taylor Bradford, a British journalist who became a publishing sensation in her 40s with the saga \"A Woman of Substance\" and wrote more than a dozen other novels that sold tens of millions of copies, has died. She was 91.",
      "Bradford died Sunday at her home in New York City, a spokesperson said Monday. An obituary\u00a0was also posted to her website.",
      "Starting with \"A Woman of Substance,\" published in 1979, Bradford averaged nearly a book a year as one of the world's most popular and wealthiest writers, her net worth estimated at more than $200 million and her fame so high that her image appeared on a postage stamp in 1999. In 2007, Queen Elizabeth II awarded her an OBE (The Most Excellent Order of the British Empire).",
      "Her books were published in 40 languages and sold more than 90 million copies around the world.",
      "With titles like \"Breaking the Rules\" and \"Act of Will,\" she specialized in stories of women fighting for love and power in a man's world. Her favorite among her books was \"The Women In His Life,\" inspired by her husband's escape from the Nazis.",
      "Bradford was married for 56 years to German-born film producer Robert Bradford, who died in 2019.",
      "A native of Leeds, West Yorkshire, she was an only child in a working class family who loved books early. As a girl, she had a story published in a local magazine. By age 16, she left school against her parents' wishes to become a reporter for the Yorkshire Evening Post. Over the next 30 years, she would work as fashion editor of Woman's Own Magazine, cover a variety of beats for the London Evening News and, in the United States, write a syndicated column about interior design.",
      "Although she wrote children's stories and advice books, novels were her dream. \"A Woman of Substance\" was a multi-generational chronicle of the travails and triumphs of retail baron Emma Harte, who would be featured in several other Bradford novels. The book has sold more than 30 million copies and was the basis of a 1984 television miniseries starring Jenny Seagrove as a young Emma and Deborah Kerr as Emma late in life.",
      "\"And if you want to meet the real Emma, meet me,\" Bradford told the Telegraph of London in 2009. \"Emma had to be tough and ruthless at times: but then so am I. I have to be, as a businesswoman. And I'm a bloody good businesswoman.\"",
      "Bradford and Emma Harte were linked by more than money: both had family secrets. As a young woman, Emma became pregnant by a man who refused to marry her and gave birth to a daughter. Years later, Bradford learned through her biographer that her own mother had been born out of wedlock. It is now believed that Bradford's maternal grandfather was Frederick Oliver Robinson, the second Marquess of Ripon and owner of the Studley Royal estate in Yorkshire, which is now a World Heritage Site.",
      "Seagrove, who became friends with Bradford after starring in the miniseries, described her as a \"powerhouse of glamour and warmth\" and a \"force of nature\" who stayed true to her roots.",
      "\"Success never diluted her warmth and humor or her ability to relate to everyone she met, whether a cleaner or a princess,\" Seagrove said. \"She never, ever forgot that she was just a girl from Yorkshire that worked hard and made good. RIP dear friend.\"",
      "Bradford had a strict writing routine: at work behind her IBM Lexmark typewriter by 6 a.m., break around 1 p.m., then back to writing until 6 p.m., at the latest. According to an authorized 2006 biography, Piers Dudgeon's \"The Woman of Substance,\" Bradford more than adapted to her midlife fortune, living in a 5,300 square foot apartment overlooking Manhattan's East River, collecting Impressionist art and enjoying refills of pink champagne poured by her Moroccan butler. When the Bradfords put their apartment up for sale in 2010, the asking price was just under $19 million. (They sold it to Uma Thurman in 2013 for $10 million).",
      "Over the years, she met many other celebrities. Bradford befriended Sean Connery before he appeared in his first James Bond movie and remembered advising him, thankfully in vain, that he should lose his Scottish accent if he wanted to succeed.",
      "Around the same time, she met a fellow journalist at the Yorkshire Evening Post. He was \"lanky and disheveled with acne,\" and kept trying to talk to her even after she turned him down for a date at the movies.",
      "He was Peter O'Toole.",
      "\"Years later, (Evening Post editor) Keith Waterhouse and I were at an event where the producer Sam Spiegel introduced the star of his new movie,\" she told The Guardian in 2021. \"Out walked the most beautiful man I'd ever seen, dressed as Lawrence of Arabia. Keith said: 'Don't you wish you'd gone to the pictures with him now?' I never got over Peter's transformation.\"",
      "According to the obituary on her website, when Bradford was recently asked what would be on her epitaph, she replied: \"She made her dreams come true.\"",
      "According to the obituary, Bradford will be laid to rest alongside her husband at Westchester Hills Cemetery, New York following a private funeral at Saint Thomas Church Fifth Avenue.",

      "Nowadays, what makes a martini a martini? Robert Simonson, who wrote a book about the martini, said, \"It's funny: it's strict and loose at the same time.\"",
      "Everyone seems to have an opinion about the cocktail: \"Ingredients, proportions, garnishes \u2013 it's all subject to debate,\" Simonson said. \"I'm a purist. I would think it needs to be gin and vermouth. But I'm willing to bend and say, 'Okay, vodka and vermouth as well.' [However,] if there's no vermouth in there, I don't know how you can call it a cocktail.\"",
      "Simonson says the martini was probably named after a vermouth company. It was invented in America in the 1870s or '80s when bartenders mixed gin with vermouth, a fortified wine made with herbs and spices. \"It's a very big player in cocktail history,\" he said.",

      "In the early 20th century, the \"very-dry\" martini became very-popular: Ice cold gin or vodka, garnished with a lemon twist, or an olive, or an onion, but only a little vermouth (or maybe not even a little).",
      "Samantha Casuga, the head bartender at Temple Bar in New York City, says the reason why many people might not want vermouth in their martini is because, for years, vermouth was stored improperly. \"It should be in the fridge,\" she said.",
      "Casuga's classic martini is two parts gin, one part vermouth, with a twist of lemon. She suggests that you probably shouldn't order it the way James Bond does \u2013 shaken, not stirred. Casuga says she's always stirring, but some people like the show behind the bar when a bartender shakes their cocktail. \"Definitely, people love a good shake,\" she said.",

The menu was eclectic \u2013 they served everything from Biddie's Chicken (just like Fleetwood's mom, Biddie, made it) to cookie dough desserts dreamed up by his children.

      "The decision about what to do with the land is still up in the air; the priority is housing for the displaced residents. But Fleetwood says he's determined to rebuild, just maybe not in the same place.",
      "Asked what he pictures in a new place, he said, \"For me, it has to encompass being able to handle playing music. There has to be music. We had it every day. That's a selfish request!\"",
      "But before anything is rebuilt, there's still a massive cleanup that needs to be completed here.",
      "\"We will see,\" he said. \"You have a blank [canvas] to paint on, and there's a lot of painting to do.",
      "\"You have to be careful, even in this conversation, of going like, 'How sad that was,' when really it's about, 'Yes, but now we need this.' In the end you go like, it happened. And what's really important is absorbing maybe how all these things happened, and can they be circumnavigated to be more safe in the future, and be more aware? Of course that's part of it.

    "story": [
      "Ryan Wettstein Nauman was inconsolable one evening last December. After being put down for bed, the 3-year-old from Peoria, Illinois, just kept crying and crying and crying, and nothing would calm her down.",
      "Her mother, Maggi Wettstein, remembered fearing it could be a yeast or urinary tract infection, something they had been dealing with during potty training. The urgent care centers around them were closed for the night, so around 10:30 p.m. she decided to take Ryan to the emergency room at Carle Health.",
      "The medical procedure",
      "The ER wasn't very busy when they arrived at 10:48 p.m., Wettstein recalled. Medical records indicate they checked in and she explained Ryan's symptoms, including an intermittent fever. The toddler was triaged and given a nasal swab test to check for Covid-19 and influenza A and B.",
      "Wettstein said they sat down and waited to be called. And they waited.",
      "As Wettstein watched Ryan in the waiting room's play area, she noticed her daughter had stopped crying.",
      "In fact, she seemed fine.",
      "So Wettstein decided to drive them home. Ryan had preschool the next day, and she figured there was no point keeping her awake for who knew how much longer and getting stuck with a big ER bill.",
      "There was no one at the check-in desk to inform that they were leaving, Wettstein said, so they just headed home to go to bed.",
      "Ryan went to her preschool the next day, and Wettstein said they forgot all about the ER trip for eight months.",
      "Then the bill came.",
      "The final bill",
      "$445 for the combined Covid and flu test \u2014 from an ER visit in which the patient never made it beyond the waiting room.",
      "The billing problem: A healthy hospital markup and standard insurance rules",
      "Even though Ryan and her mother left without seeing a doctor, the family ended up owing $298.15 after an insurance discount.",
      "At first, Wettstein said, she couldn't recall Ryan being tested at all. It wasn't until she received the bill and requested her daughter's medical records that she learned the results. (Ryan tested negative for Covid and both types of flu.)",
      "While Wettstein said the bill isn't going to break the bank, it seemed high to her, considering Walgreens sells an at-home Covid and flu combination test for $30 and can do higher-quality PCR testing for $145.",
      "Under the public health emergency declared in 2020 for the Covid pandemic, insurance companies were required to pay for Covid tests without copayments or cost sharing for patients.",
      "That requirement ended when the emergency declaration expired in May 2023. Now, it is often patients who foot the bill \u2014 and ER bills are notoriously high.",
      "\"That's a pretty healthy markup the hospital is making on it,\" Loren Adler, associate director of the Brookings Institution Center on Health Policy, told KFF Health News when contacted about Ryan's case.",
      "The rates the insurance companies negotiate with hospitals for various procedures are often based on multipliers of what Medicare pays, Adler said.",
      "Lab tests are one of the few areas in which insurance companies can often pay less than Medicare, he said \u2014 the exception being when the test is performed by the hospital laboratory, which is often what happens during ER visits.",
      "Medicare pays $142.63 for the joint test that Ryan received, but the family is on the hook for more than twice that amount, and the initial hospital charge was over three times as much.",
      "The hospital is \"utilizing their market power to make as much money as possible, and the insurance companies are not all that good at pushing back,\" Adler said. A markup of a few hundred dollars is a drop in the bucket for big insurers. But for the patients who get unexpected bills, it can be a big burden.",
      "Brittany Simon, a public relations manager for Carle Health, did not respond to specific questions but said in a statement, \"We follow policies that support the safety and wellbeing of our patients, which includes the initial triage of symptomatic patients to the Emergency Department.\"",
      "While Ryan's family would not have had to pay for a Covid test during the public health emergency, it was the family's insurer, Cigna, that did not have to pay this time, since the family had not yet met a $3,000 yearly deductible.",
      "A Cigna representative did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "The resolution",
      "Wettstein said she knew she could just pay the bill and be done with it, \"but the fact that I never saw a provider, and the fact that it was just for a Covid test, is mind-blowing to me.\"",
      "She contacted the hospital's billing department to make sure the bill was correct. She explained what happened and said the hospital representative was also surprised by the size of the bill and sent it up for further review.",
      "\"'Don't pay this until you hear from me,'\" Wettstein remembered being told.",
      "Soon, though, she received a letter from the hospital explaining that the charge was correct and supported by documentation.",
      "Wettstein thought she was avoiding any charges by taking Ryan home without being seen. Instead, she got a bill \"that they have verified that I have to pay.\"",
      "\"Like I said, it's mind-blowing to me.\"",
      "The takeaway",
      "ERs are among the most expensive options for care in the nation's health system, and the meter can start running as soon as you check in \u2014 even if you check out before receiving care.",
      "If your issue isn't life-threatening, consider an urgent care facility, which is often cheaper (and look for posted notices to confirm whether it's actually an urgent care clinic). The urgent care centers near Ryan's home were closed that evening, but some facilities stay open late or around the clock.",
      "In some ways, Wettstein was lucky. KFF Health News' \"Bill of the Month\" has received tips from other patients who left an ER after a long wait without seeing a doctor \u2014 and got slapped with a facility fee of over $1,000.",
      "Making the decision about where to go is tough, especially in a stressful situation \u2014 such as when the patient is too young to communicate what's wrong. Trying to figure out what's going on physically with a 3-year-old can feel impossible.",
      "If you decide to leave an ER without treatment, don't just walk out. Tell the triage nurse you're leaving. You might get lucky and avoid some charges.",
      "Wettstein won't think twice about taking Ryan to the pediatrician or an urgent care center the next time she's ailing. But, Wettstein said, after getting this bill, \"I'm not going to create a habit out of going to the emergency room.\"",
      "Bill of the Month is a crowdsourced investigation by KFF Health News and The Washington Post's Well+Being that dissects and explains medical bills. Since 2018, this series has helped many patients and readers get their medical bills reduced, and it has been cited in statehouses, at the U.S. Capitol, and at the White House.

      "This timeline was decided long before Election Day, one person familiar with the process told CBS News.",
      "A spokesperson for HHS did not comment on the timing of the report, except to confirm that it is expected \"later in the year.\"",
      "\"HHS and USDA continue to demonstrate their commitment to transparency, equity, and scientific integrity throughout the entire process,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "It is virtually impossible for the Biden administration to finish an update before leaving office, former officials said. Too many tasks remain, like vetting the findings and developing and testing updated messaging through tools like MyPlate, which replaced the food pyramid.",
      "\"This is a very heavy lift, given the complexity and given the points of view of the different departments,\" said Dr. Brett Giroir, who served as assistant secretary for health in HHS under the Trump administration's last revision.",
      "Input from the public and agencies also must be worked into the guidelines, before the agriculture and health departments can come to an agreement.",
      "\"My belief is that when Congress tells two agencies to collaborate on something, that is an intended tension, hopefully to move the final product in the right direction. And I think certainly folks would agree that HHS and USDA often come from different constituencies, different perspectives,\" said Brandon Lipps, who was the USDA's deputy under secretary for food, nutrition and consumer services under Trump.",
      "One expected fight will be over proposals floated last month by members of the committee \"to emphasize plant sources\" of protein, as part of a broader recommendation to \"shift\" to more \"nutrient dense, plant-based meals.\"",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump had accused his rival of wanting to \"stop people from eating red meat.\" In a statement last month, the National Cattlemen's Beef Association denounced the recommendations as \"unhinged\" and \"impractical.\"",
      "Under the drafts, beans, peas and lentils could be listed as protein sources too, not just vegetables. Red meat would be moved down the ranking of protein foods, over health concerns like cardiovascular disease.",
      "Red meats often needed to be substituted the most in American diets, analyses by the committee concluded, to cut health risks and still meet nutritional goals.",
      "\"Red meats, whether they were processed or not, were the ones to reduce more than the poultry or the eggs. So I would've put them very last,\" said Christopher Gardner, a member of the committee.",
      "How Trump administration officials could change the guidelines",
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has made changes to the committee a central part of his \"Make America Healthy Again\" platform.",
      "\"What we need to do is change the panel, so they're making good recommendations and they're telling people don't eat these foods,\" Kennedy said in September.",
      "They could also offer Kennedy a vehicle to accomplish his goals, like curbing ultra-processed foods in school lunches. If confirmed as secretary, Kennedy and his counterpart at USDA would have the ultimate authority over what goes into the guidelines.",
      "\"If Congress wanted a group of scientists to write the dietary guidelines, they would have put that in statute. So the committee makes recommendations, and the secretaries take the input from that report,\" said Lipps.",
      "Completely ignoring the committee's work would be unprecedented, though departments in the past \u2013 often driven by career civil servants \u2013 have sometimes disagreed with some recommendations.",
      "\"The process is not perfect, there's bureaucracy in there. But I do believe having transparent scientific committees that everybody knows where it's coming from is the best way to go,\" said Giroir.",

    "summary": "When it comes to eating healthy, all of us respond to foods differently. The National Institutes of Health's new nutrition study hopes to finally provide Americans a personalized answer to the question: \"What should I eat?\"",
    "story": [
      "It's been said the best meals come from the heart, not from a recipe book. But at this USDA kitchen, there's no pinch of this, dash of that, no dollops or smidgens of anything. Here, nutritionists in white coats painstakingly measure every single ingredient, down to the tenth of a gram.",
      "Sheryn Stover is expected to eat every crumb of her pizza; any tiny morsels she does miss go back to the kitchen, where they're scrutinized like evidence of some dietary crime.",
      "Stover (or participant #8180, as she's known) is one of some 10,000 volunteers enrolled in a $170 million nutrition study run by the National Institutes of Health. \"At 78, not many people get to do studies that are going to affect a great amount of people, and I thought this was a great opportunity to do that,\" she said.",
      "It's called the Nutrition for Precision Health Study. \"When I tell people about the study, the reaction usually is, 'Oh, that's so cool, can I do it?'\" said coordinator Holly Nicastro.",
      "She explained just what \"precise\" precisely means: \"Precision nutrition means tailoring nutrition or dietary guidance to the individual.\"",
      "The government has long offered guidelines to help us eat better. In the 1940s we had the \"Basic 7.\" In the '50s, the \"Basic 4.\" We've had the \"Food Wheel,\" the \"Food Pyramid,\" and currently, \"My Plate.\"",
      "They're all well-intentioned, except they're all based on averages \u2013 what works best for most people, most of the time. But according to Nicastro, there is no one best way to eat. \"We know from virtually every nutrition study ever conducted, we have inner individual variability,\" she said. \"That means we have some people that are going to respond, and some people that aren't. There's no one-size-fits-all.\"",
      "The study's participants, like Stover, are all being drawn from another NIH study program called All Of Us, a massive undertaking to create a database of at least a million people who are volunteering everything from their electronic health records to their DNA. \u00a0It was from that All of Us research that Stover discovered she has the gene that makes some foods taste bitter, which could explain why she ate more of one kind of food than another.",
      "Professor Sai Das, who oversees the study at Tufts University, says the goal of precision nutrition is to drill down even deeper into those individual differences. \"We're moving away from just saying everybody go do this, to being able to say, 'Okay, if you have X, Y and Z characteristics, then you're more likely to respond to a diet, and somebody else that has A, B and C characteristics will be responding to the diet differently,'\" Das said.",
      "It's a big commitment for Stover, who is one of 150 people being paid to live at a handful of test sites around the country for six weeks \u2013 two weeks at a time. It's so precise she can't even go for a walk without a dietary chaperone. \"Well, you could stop and buy candy \u2026 God forbid, you can't do that!\" she laughed.",
      "While she's here, everything from her resting metabolic rate, her body fat percentage, her bone mineral content, even the microbes in her gut (digested by a machine that essentially is a smart toilet paper reading device) are being analyzed for how hers may differ from someone else's.",
      "Nicastro said, \"We really think that what's going on in your poop is going to tell us a lot of information about your health and how you respond to food.\"",
      "Stover says she doesn't mind, except for the odd sounds the machine makes. While she is a live-in participant, thousands of others are participating from their homes, where electronic wearables track all kinds of health data, including special glasses that record everything they eat, activated when someone starts chewing. Artificial intelligence can then be used to determine not only which foods the person is eating, but how many calories are consumed.",
      "This study is expected to be wrapped up by 2027, and because of it, we may indeed know not only to eat more fruits and vegetables, but what combination of foods is really best for us. \u00a0The question that even Holly Nicastro can't answer is, will we listen? \"You can lead a horse to water; you can't make them drink,\" she said. \"We can tailor the interventions all day. But one hypothesis I have is that if the guidance is tailored to the individual, it's going to make that individual more likely to follow it, because this is for me, this was designed for me.\"",

    "summary": "Canada's Competition Bureau says that an investigation found the company \"unlawfully\" tied together its ad tech tools to maintain its dominant market position.",
    "story": [
      "Canada's antitrust watchdog said Thursday it is suing Google over alleged anticompetitive conduct in the tech giant's online advertising business and wants the company to sell off two of its ad tech services and pay a penalty.",
      "The Competition Bureau said that such action is necessary because an investigation into Google found that the company \"unlawfully\" tied together its ad tech tools to maintain its dominant market position.",
      "The matter is now headed for the Competition Tribunal, a quasi-judicial body that hears cases brought forward by the competition commissioner about non-compliance with the Competition Act.",
      "The bureau is asking the tribunal to order Google to sell its publisher ad server, DoubleClick for Publishers, and its ad exchange, AdX. It estimates Google holds a market share of 90% in publisher ad servers, 70% in advertiser networks, 60% in demand-side platforms and 50% in ad exchanges.",
      "This dominance, the bureau said, has discouraged competition from rivals, inhibited innovation, inflated advertising costs and reduced publisher revenues.",
      "\"Google has abused its dominant position in online advertising in Canada by engaging in conduct that locks market participants into using its own ad tech tools, excluding competitors, and distorting the competitive process,\" Matthew Boswell, Commissioner of Competition, said in a statement.",
      "Google, however, maintains the online advertising market is a highly competitive sector.",
      "Dan Taylor, Google's vice president of global ads, said in a statement that the bureau's complaint \"ignores the intense competition where ad buyers and sellers have plenty of choice.\"",
      "The statement added that Google intends to defend itself against the allegation.",
      "U.S. regulators want a federal judge to break up Google to prevent the company from continuing to squash competition through its dominant search engine after a court found it had maintained an abusive monopoly over the past decade.",
      "The proposed breakup, floated in a 23-page document filed this month by the U.S. Department of Justice, calls for sweeping punishments that would include a sale of Google's industry-leading Chrome web browser and impose restrictions to prevent Android from favoring its own search engine.",
      "U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta\u00a0ruled in August\u00a0that \"Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly.\" He outlined a timeline for a trial on proposed remedies next spring and plans to issue a decision by August 2025.",
      "Mehta also found that Google in 2021 Google paid about $26 billion to Apple and other partners to ensure its search engine would be the default one on internet browsers.",
      "His ruling stemmed from a Justice Department antitrust lawsuit first filed against Google in October 2020 during the first Trump administration.",
      "Google has already said it plans to appeal Mehta's ruling, but the tech giant must wait until he finalizes a remedy before doing so. The appeals process could take as long as five years, predicts George Hay, a law professor at Cornell University who was the chief economist for the Justice Department's antitrust division for most of the 1970s.",
      "And in January 2023, the Justice Department and several states filed a separate lawsuit against Google claiming it has an illegal monopoly over online advertising.",

    "story": [
      "Experts are warning that fraudsters are exploiting Black Friday sales to target U.S. shoppers with fake websites and ads for major brands like IKEA, Wayfair and The North Face, after online scams hit record highs in 2023.",
      "A new report released by threat intelligence company EclecticIQ identified a campaign that operates a sprawling network of fabricated websites using \"Trusted Store\" badges to lure shoppers with fake products.",
      "When consumers attempt to make a purchase, scammers steal their personal and payment information. The consumers are often unaware they were scammed until they fail to receive the product.",
      "Reports of online fraud in 2023 exceeded $12.5 billion in potential losses \u2014   a 22% jump from 2022, according to FBI data. Officials say increasingly sophisticated scams are using tools including AI to power their campaigns.",
      "\"With the way it now seems like everyone is shopping online, reliance on digital platforms has handed these groups a wider attack surface than ever,\" EclecticIQ CEO Cody Barrow told CBS News. \"Unfortunately, it's likely we'll see its impact stretch into next week.\"",
      "The scams",
      "EclecticIQ says it identified at least 8,000 fabricated sites that lure shoppers by offering steep \"deals\" on popular brands. The websites are not affiliated with the brands they appear to represent, but are designed to look like official sites and use URLs that appear authentic.",
      "In one example, a site posing as Wayfair used the URL wayfairtoday.com. Another site used the URL wayfairblackfriday.com. The website was registered in early November and offered fake \"deals\" including an $800 mattress reduced to $39.",
      "CBS News also found an ad appropriating Wayfair's logo that directed users to another counterfeit site posing as the retailer. It was removed from Meta's ad library as of Friday. Wayfair told CBS News that it is actively monitoring scams to ensure customers are protected.",
      "Analysts discovered Mandarin coding and Chinese IP addresses on the sites, indicating that the phishing campaign was operated by a China-based group. IKEA told CBS News it was investigating one of the scam websites using its name that EclecticIQ identified.",
      "Separately, an ad on Facebook and Instagram using The North Face logo routed users to a fabricated site. The ad was removed for policy violations, and The North Face told CBS News it was working with Meta and \"other partners\" to combat scam sites.",
      "\"Scammers use every online platform available to them and constantly evolve their tactics in order to evade enforcement,\" said Meta spokesperson Erin Logan. \"In this instance, our systems proactively detected and removed a number of these ads before they were reported to us.\"",
      "The Federal Trade Commission released data in February that shows online shopping fraud was the second most common type of fraud reported in 2023.",
      "Experts say fraudulent sites and ads remain a pervasive issue. \"Many of the scam sites are short-lived campaigns, so it's an ongoing effort to identify new sites,\" Ilya Volovik, director of Recorded Future Payment Fraud Intelligence, told CBS News. \"Some of the longer living scam sites change their 'sales' advertisement based on a holiday.\"",
      "Tips to protect yourself",
      "Cliff Steinhauer, director of Information Security and Engagement at the National Cybersecurity Alliance, said consumers should take precautions, stay alert when online shopping and act quickly if they believe they have been scammed.",
      "Secure your accounts. Experts recommend setting up multifactor authentication as well as strong and unique passwords for all accounts, including shopping and bank sites.",
      "Avoid unfamiliar links: Be wary of links from unsolicited emails and text messages. Instead, use a search engine to navigate to the retailer's website.",
      "Look for red flags. Be wary of deals that appear too good to be true, as well as websites that use excessive pop-ups and urgent language. If in doubt, leave the site.",
      "Research the website. Look up reviews from other shoppers who have used the site. Visit the Better Business Bureau's website, which maintains a database with ratings for millions of businesses.",
      "If you think you have been the victim of fraud, immediately notify your bank to reverse the charges. You should also change the passwords to your online accounts. File a police report if you experience harassment or repeated attempts to steal more of your information.",
      "Experts also recommend freezing your credit on the three major credit reporting bureaus if your personal information has been compromised through a data breach. This will ensure your identity can't be stolen in the event that scammers obtain your social security number.",

      "\"Blanket 25% tariffs on Canada threatened by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump earlier this week would push Canada into a recession in 2025, cause a sharp spike in inflation and force the Bank of Canada to hold rates higher next year,\" economist Michael Davenport of Oxford Economics said in a report Thursday.",
      "Inflation in Canada would top 7% by mid-2025, while unemployment would approach 8% by year-end, according to the investment research firm. The country's auto, energy and heavy manufacturing industries, which rely on exports to the U.S., would take the biggest hit, he added, noting that the sectors also depend on components from American suppliers.",
      "Canada fired back with duties of its own when Trump slapped tariffs on the country's steel and aluminum exports to the U.S. during his first stint in the White House. Canada targeted U.S. products including whiskey and yogurt, most of which came from one plant in Wisconsin, home state of then-House Speaker Paul Ryan.",
      "Canadian officials say lumping Canada in with Mexico is unfair but say they are ready to make new investments in border security and work with the Trump administration to lower the numbers from Canada. The Canadians are also worried about an influx of migrants if Trump follows through with his plan for mass deportations.",
      "U.S. also would feel the pain",
      "Trump and his allies, including his choice for Treasury Secretary,\u00a0Scott Bessent,\u00a0have said\u00a0tariffs deployed during his first term advanced U.S. economic aims, including boosting federal revenue, and didn't boost inflation.",
      "But the U.S. likely wouldn't go unscathed in a full-blown trade war with Canada. Across-the-board tariffs on American products would likely cause a \"shallow\" recession in the U.S. and fracture political relations between the allies, according to Oxford.",
      "Although the U.S. is the world's leading oil producer, Canada supplies roughly 20% of the oil used stateside. As a result, U.S. gas prices could shoot up 30 to 40 cents a gallon, and potentially up to 70 cents, soon after Trump levied the tariffs on Canada, Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "With so much on the line, the incoming Trump administration is more likely to impose limited tariffs on Canadian products, such as steel, lumber and farm products like dairy.",
      "\"Despite Trump's latest threat of blanket tariffs, we still think it's unlikely that the Trump administration will put tariffs on Canadian autos and energy exports, which make up about 40% of total Canadian exports to the U.S.,\" Davenport said. \"The North American energy sector and auto supply chains are highly integrated across the U.S.-Canada border and any tariffs on these goods would also have a significant negative effect on the US economy.\"",

    "summary": "As the holiday shopping season kicks off, here are five ways retailers try to get consumers to spend.",
    "story": [
      "As shoppers gear up for Black Friday and the holiday shopping season, it can be easy for people to rack up debt that will weigh them down well into the new year. So it pays for consumers to be aware of some of the tactics retailers employ to get them to spend.",
      "For example, most offers that dangle savings in the form of free shipping or a free gift if you spend over a certain amount don't save you money. The practice, called \"spaving,\" or spending more in order to save, rarely benefits consumers, according to personal finance experts.",
      "\"I understand the appeal of getting to checkout and a notification pops up saying spend $10 more to get some perk,\" LendingTree senior economist Jacob Channel told CBS MoneyWatch. \"But 90% of the time when you break it down, it doesn't make sense. You're not actually saving money if you are spending more of it.\"",
      "Here are five tactics retailers use to get you to spend more, according to the U.S. Public Interest Research Group (PIRG), a consumer advocacy group.",
      "Creating a false sense of urgency",
      "The fear of missing out on a good deal can nudge consumers into making impulse buys. Although some offers really are only valid for a limited time, U.S. PIRG identified a number of sellers on Etsy, an e-commerce site for independent craftspeople, who used fake countdown clocks for deals that never expire.",
      "Of 20 top-selling products on the site with countdown timers on deals, 80% of them simply reset when their tickers tickers hit \"0,\" according to a PIRG study.",
      "\"The 'limited' time window may not be as limited as it sounds and the deals not as good as they seem,\" U.S. PIRG's R.J. Cross told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Make your list, comparison shop on those items, and don't get distracted by offers you haven't had the time to think through.\"",
      "Implying scarcity",
      "Online retailers may label products as \"selling fast!\" or, as a consumer is considering a purchase, display how many other consumers are browsing the same item.",
      "\"Retailers and advertisers are always trying to get you to buy more than you need and spend more than you want,\" Cross said in a statement.\u00a0\"Once you know what to look for, you end up chuckling when you see these tactics instead of falling for them.\"",
      "Pricing tricks",
      "Ever wonder why a price reads $4.99 and not simply $5? When sellers round an item's price down, it suggests to a shopper that it is cheaper, PIRG notes. Although $4.99 is only a penny less than $5, a shopper is more likely to fixate on the dollar figure \u2014 $4 \u2014 versus the cents.",
      "Even removing a comma from a high sticker price like $1,200 and displaying it as $1200 can entice someone to pull the trigger, according to PIRG. Meanwhile, breaking the cost of an item down into monthly installments can also make the price seem smaller than it really is, the organization noted.",
      "\"You're still going to have to pay the full cost, and sometimes\u00a0even more in late fees, if you're not careful,\" Cross pointed out.",
      "Dubious testimonials",
      "Many retailers feature online testimonials ostensibly from customers raving about a \"life-changing\" vacuum cleaner or pair of sweatpants. Some of these account are from real customers, while other reviews cannot be trusted because they have been generated by a bot or the company itself, PIRG said.",

      "The volume chronicles Swift's wildly successful series of concerts, which concludes in December and which last year became the first music tour to gross over $1 billion.",
      "A movie version of the concert she performed on her Eras Tour also shattered box office records. It earned an estimated $96 million domestically over its opening weekend, making it the most successful concert film of all time, according to Comscore.",
      "Where can I buy the book?",
      "The new keepsake, titled \"Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour Book,\" is available only at Target. It hits the retailer's stores on Friday, while it will become available for sale on Target's website\u00a0on Saturday. Swift self-published the book under Taylor Swift Publications.",
      "Target first teased the book launch in an Instagram\u00a0post on Oct. 15. Swift herself also promoted the book in an Instagram\u00a0post that garnered more than 3.6 million likes.",
      "What's in The Eras Tour book?",
      "The 256-page hardcover title, which costs $39.99, includes unreleased photographs of Swift in concert from every period in her meteoric career, according to Target.",
      "The book also documents the production of Swift's epic Eras Tour, which kicked off in August 2023, including \"personal reflections\" written by the artist herself.",
      "In tandem with the book release, Target is also exclusively launching \"The Tortured Poets Department: The Anthology\" album as both a vinyl record and CD. The recording feature 35 tracks, including four acoustic versions of the following songs: \"Fortnight,\" \"Down Bad,\" \"But Daddy I Love Him\" and \"Guilty as Sin?\"",
      "Two million copies of the book have been printed, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing a person familiar with the matter. Assuming the initial print run sells out, it would generate nearly $80 million in sales. Forbes puts Swift's net at worth $1. 6 billion, including $600 million from music royalties and touring, a music catalog valued at an estimated $600 million, and $125 million in real estate.",
      "Swift alone could be a forceful enough economic engine to boost Target. The retailer's latest sales and profit figures fell short of analysts' expectations, while Target lowered its earnings forecast for the current quarter. Analysts say that inflation-weary consumers are after deeper discounts than the retailer can offer, or simply aren't making as many discretionary purchases.",

      "President-elect Donald Trump this week said he would enact a 25% tariff on all products from both countries, citing concerns about illegal immigration and illicit drugs flowing into the U.S. While prices could climb on a variety of goods shipped to the U.S., the potential impact on motorists and on the transportation sector could be particularly acute, analysts say.",

      "Although the U.S. is the world's leading oil producer, we still import a lot of crude, with Canada providing roughly 20% of the oil used stateside. As a result, gas prices could shoot up 30 to 40 cents a gallon, and potentially up to 70 cents, within as little as two days after the tariffs take effect, De Haan said.",
      "The national average for a gallon of regular on Wednesday stood at $3.07, down from $3.25 a year ago, according to AAA.",

      "To be sure, it remains uncertain if Trump will follow through on his trade threats. Some analysts think the president-elect is likely using the specter of tariffs as a way to wring concessions from other countries, noting that his administration will be eager to avoid setting off another round of inflation just as U.S. prices are growing at a normal level.",

      "Trump on Monday pledged to put a 25% tariff on all products from Mexico and Canada, along with a 10% levy on Chinese goods, in an effort to crack down on illegal immigration and illicit drugs flowing into the U.S. The tariffs are not certain to go into effect, and if they are implemented, their impact would depend on how they are structured and if certain categories are exempted.",
      "Trump and his allies, including his choice for Treasury Secretary,\u00a0Scott Bessent,\u00a0have argued that his first-term tariffs didn't boost inflation, and that import taxes can provide valuable benefits to American workers and businesses. Among them, Trump has said, are protecting U.S. manufacturing jobs and boosting federal revenue, although tariffs are paid by importers and often passed onto consumers in the form of higher prices.",
      "For their part, experts and business groups are clear that tariffs would lift prices. A barrage of new duties on foreign imports would likely boost consumer costs on everything from vacuum cleaners to tiki torches, which are largely imported from China and are already subject to tariffs, according to Scott Lincicome, a trade expert at the Cato Institute, a public policy research group.",

Video game consoles and smartphones could also see double-digit gains.",
      "Researchers assumed retailers would pass all added costs related to tariffs along to consumers. In the smartphone category, the average increase in price would be $213 per device, according to CTA.",
      "\"The likelihood of retailers or any importer absorbing the tariff cost is very low, so the pass through to consumers will be quick,\" said Ed Brzytwa, vice president of international trade at CTA. \"On all the products we looked at, there are going to be price increases.\"",
      "Best Buy CEO Cory Barrie on Tuesday also said on the company's earnings call that Trump's proposed tariffs would force the retailer to raise costs on a\u00a0range of consumer electronics, noting that \"there's very little in consumer electronics space that is not imported.\"",
      "Footwear",
      "Footwear is another goods category that experts are watching. According to Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America (FDRA), 99% of footwear sold in the U.S. is imported from other countries, with 56% of footwear by volume coming from China.",
      "\"We know that if they apply tariffs on Chines goods and Chinese footwear, it will hit working families the hardest,\" FDRA CEO Matt Priest told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Some retailers could also decide to hike prices whether or not they face added costs related to potential tariffs. \"It's a pretty handy excuse when you're in a constant battle with consumers on price,\" Lincicome said.",
      "Home goods",
      "A number of retailers have already suggested that the proposed tariffs could force them to raise prices. In an email to customers, filtered shower head maker Jolie said this week that tariffs on goods made outside of the U.S. would \"mean we would need to raise our prices.\"",
      "\"If you're considering buying a Jolie, now is a great time to lock in our current prices,\" the company added. Currently, a shower head with a filter subscription costs $148. The company announced a \"potential\" new price of $178.",

      "\"Tariffs make it more difficult for us to maintain the low prices and be affordable for many people, which in the end is our goal,\" Jesper Brodin, Ingka Group CEO, told CNN. \"But it's beyond our control. We will need to understand and adapt.\"",
      "Gasoline",
      "Adding a 25% tariff to Canadian imports would affect crude oil, which is imported from Western Canada and refined at U.S. facilities, according to Patrick De Haan, an analyst at Gas Buddy.",
      "\"Canada and Mexico are huge U.S. trading partners, so it's a shot across the bow of longtime U.S. allies,\" Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, told CBS MoneyWatch.",

      "So should consumers be thinking about buying certain products now ahead of possible tariffs next year? Brzytwa thinks so.",
      "\"People should be thinking about buying now. From all indications we have, the Trump administration wants to move as fast as possible to impose much higher tariffs on imports from China, including products not yet subject to tariffs,\" he said.",

    "title": "How Trump's economic agenda could affect mortgage rates in 2025",
    "published": "Wed, 27 Nov 2024 17:51:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Here's what a noted housing expert thinks will happen to mortgage rates next year as Donald Trump outlines his priorities.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump has promised to lower prices for Americans, but his economic policies may not help one embattled part of the economy: the housing market.",
      "Mortgage rates continue to hover near a 20-year high, while house hunters face near record high\u00a0home prices. The Federal Reserve's two rate cuts, in September and November, haven't trickled through to mortgages, which instead have climbed during the past month and are again hovering close to 7%.",
      "That's because mortgage rates are based on several factors beyond the Fed's benchmark rate, including the strength of the U.S. economy and changes in the yield for the U.S. 10-year Treasury bond. The latter surged after Trump's November 5 electoral victory on concerns that his policies, including stiff tariffs on U.S. imports, big tax cuts for individuals and businesses, and a crackdown on undocumented immigrants could drive up inflation.",
      "A key question for housing",
      "Housing affordability is viewed as a top problem within the U.S. by Democrats, Republicans and Independents alike, according to a May\u00a0poll from the Bipartisan Policy Center. The difficulty of affording a home, as well as the impact of rising rents, are issues that colored how voters viewed the economy leading into the election, with the high cost of living top of mind for many.",
      "\"Going forward, the key question is: Are some of the Trump proposals inflationary or non-inflationary?\" Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"One alarming part is tariffs \u2014 that means imported products will be more expensive, and it could take time for domestic production to ramp up.\"",
      "Trump on Monday pledged to put a 25% tariff on all products\u00a0from Mexico and Canada, along with a 10% levy on Chinese goods. Those costs could boost the U.S. inflation rate by almost 1 percentage point, according to a new Goldman Sachs estimate. Higher inflation in turn could lead the Fed to slow or even pause its rate cuts \u2013 another blow to Americans hoping for lower borrowing costs.",
      "Where will mortgage rates go in 2025?",
      "To be sure, forecasting mortgage rates is difficult, given the number of factors that influence them. Yet based on Trump's stated economic plans, Yun said he thinks the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate will bounce around between 6% and 7% for the next year, and could stick around 6.5% for much of 2025.",
      "But, he added, there's a risk mortgage rates could inch even higher if Trump's policies prove more inflationary than expected. Higher mortgage rates can add hundreds of dollars in monthly costs for borrowers.",
      "Another issue is whether Trump's policies could widen the federal deficit, which impacts borrowing as well as the yield on the 10-year Treasury. The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget forecasts that Trump's proposals would increase the federal budget deficit by $7.75 trillion over the next decade.",
      "To pay interest on that debt, the government would likely have to issue more bonds, like 10-year Treasurys. That could lead investors to demand higher yields, or the return they receive for investing in the bonds. As those yields rise, that would push mortgage rates higher.",
      "\"In the first Trump presidency, the average mortgage rate was about 4% to 5%,\" Yun said, adding, \"We won't get back to that 4% to 5% of that first Trump presidency.\"",
      "Will housing become more affordable?",
      "Most Americans report that housing in their communities has become less affordable during the past year, a trend they don't see improving, the Bipartisan Policy Center found.",
      "The median sale price of U.S. homes has dropped slightly during the past year, dipping to about $420,000 in the third quarter from $435,000 a year earlier, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. But that's also considerably higher than the median sale price of $329,000 at the start of 2020, just prior to the pandemic.",
      "The double whammy of high home costs and mortgage rates is pricing many buyers out of the market. The share of first-time home buyers dropped to 24% in 2024, the lowest since 1981, when the National Association of Realtors started tracking the metric. Prior to 2008, the share of first-time buyers had historically been 40%.",
      "That's a problem for would-be homebuyers \u2014 as well as the nation's overall economic health \u2014 because homeownership is a key to building personal wealth. People who delay buying a home have fewer years to grow their assets, which can in turn crimp their ability to build a nest egg for their later years.",
      "The difference in wealth between homeowners and renters is stark: Homeowners had a median net worth of $396,200 in 2022, compared with $10,400 for renters and other non-homeowners, according to the Federal Reserve's Survey of Consumer Finances.",
      "While mortgage rates might not see much relief in 2025, home prices are likely to remain stable, Yun predicted.",
      "\"The American way is to buy a home,\" he said. \"Maybe it's a little smaller, or not perfectly ideal, but then trade up to the next home \u2014 in terms of buying rather than delaying, the data shows that homeowners build wealth, while renters are spinning their wheels.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 27 Nov 2024 14:01:40 -0500",
    "summary": "Millions of Americans would be eligible to have popular drugs used for weight loss like Wegovy or Ozempic covered by Medicare and Medicaid under a rule the Biden administration has proposed.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Millions of Americans with obesity would be eligible to have popular drugs used for weight loss like Wegovy or Ozempic covered by Medicare and Medicaid under a new rule the Biden administration proposed Tuesday morning.",
      "The costly proposal from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services sets the stage for a potential showdown between the powerful pharmaceutical industry and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an outspoken opponent of the weight-loss drugs who, as President-elect Donald Trump's nominee to lead the department, could try to block the measure.",
      "While the rule would give millions of people access to weekly injectables that have helped people shed pounds so quickly that some have labeled them miracle drugs, it would cost taxpayers as much as $35 billion over the next decade.",
      "\"It's a good day for anyone who suffers from obesity,\" U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra told The Associated Press in an interview. \"It's a game changer for Americans who can't afford these drugs otherwise.\"",
      "\"This proposal would allow Americans and their doctors to determine the best path forward so they can lead healthier lives, without worrying about their ability to cover these drugs out-of-pocket, and ultimately reduce health care costs to our nation,\" the White House said in a statement.",
      "A bipartisan coalition of congressional members have lobbied for the drugs to be covered by Medicare, saying it could save the government from spending billions of dollars on treating chronic ailments that stem from obesity.",
      "Who would be eligible to get weight loss drugs?",
      "Under the\u00a0proposal, Medicare and Medicaid coverage would extended to people prescribed the drugs \"to reduce excess body weight and maintain weight reduction long-term for individuals with obesity.\"",
      "Medicare estimates most obese enrollees are already eligible through other conditions, like diabetes, heart disease or sleep apnea. Around 7% of Medicare beneficiaries would be newly eligible.This means people who are only overweight but not obese would still not be covered, unless it was paired with another qualifying condition like treating diabetes or heart disease.",
      "The change also applies to state Medicaid programs, which would now no longer be allowed to exclude coverage of weight loss drugs for obese residents.",
      "The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services estimates that 12% of adults covered by Medicaid would be newly eligible. Adolescents could also be covered, given the Food and Drug Administration  has\u00a0approved\u00a0use of Wegovy down to age 12.",
      "The anti-obesity drug market has expanded significantly in recent years, with the FDA approving a new class of weekly injectables like Novo Nordisk's Wegovy and Eli Lilly's Zepbound to treat obesity.",
      "People can lose as much as 15% to 25% of their body weight on the drugs, which imitate the hormones that regulate appetites by communicating fullness between the gut and brain when people eat.",
      "The cost of the drugs has largely limited them to the wealthy, including celebrities who boast of their benefits. A monthly supply of Wegovy rings up at $1,300 and Zepbound will put you out $1,000. Shortages of the drugs have also limited the supplies.",
      "When would coverage of weight loss drugs start?",
      "For Medicare, the proposal to require Part D plans to expand coverage for weight loss drugs would take effect for plans in 2026.Officials claimed they do not think the proposal will lead to significantly increased costs for seniors next year, citing provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act.",
      "\"We do not expect any short-term impact on premiums from this proposal, and in fact, this proposal provides a significant savings for people who currently may be paying out of pocket for these medications,\" Dr. Meena Seshamani, the top official overseeing Medicare, told reporters.",
      "It is unclear when the proposal would take effect in state Medicaid programs.",
      "Centers for Medicare and Medicaid officials said they are inviting\u00a0public comment\u00a0on when states should be required to cover the costly medications.\"States are also feeling substantial state budget pressure and we are doing our part to make sure patients, Medicaid enrollees all across the country can get access,\" Dan Tsai, the agency's top Medicaid official, told reporters.",
      "Over the next decade, the proposal would cost the federal government $11 billion and states $3.8 billion, they estimated.\"We would urge drug manufacturers to do their part as well, make sure they're thinking about offering fair, appropriate prices to the Medicaid program,\" Tsai said.",
      "The path forward in new administration is unclear",
      "While it's unclear where Trump himself stands on coverage of the weight-loss drugs, his allies and Cabinet picks who have vowed to cut government spending could balk at the upfront price tag",
      "Medicare has been barred from offering the drugs under a decades-old law that prohibits the government-backed insurance program from covering weight-loss products. The rule proposed by the Biden administration, however, would recognize obesity as a disease that can be treated with the help of the drugs.",
      "Kennedy, who as Trump's nominee for HHS secretary is subject to Senate confirmation, has railed against the drugs' popularity. In speeches and on social media, he's said the U.S. shouldn't cover the drugs through Medicaid or Medicare. Instead, he supports a broad expansion of coverage for healthier foods and gym memberships.",
      "\"For half the price of Ozempic, we could purchase regeneratively raised, organic food for every American, three meals a day and a gym membership, for every obese American,\" Kennedy said to a group of federal lawmakers during a roundtable earlier this year.",

    "published": "Wed, 27 Nov 2024 09:52:13 -0500",
    "summary": "An Illinois mom got stuck with a big bill after taking her 3-year-old to the ER but never seeing a doctor. \"It's mind-blowing,\" she said.",
    "story": [
      "Ryan Wettstein Nauman was inconsolable one evening last December. After being put down for bed, the 3-year-old from Peoria, Illinois, just kept crying and crying and crying, and nothing would calm her down.",
      "Her mother, Maggi Wettstein, remembered fearing it could be a yeast or urinary tract infection, something they had been dealing with during potty training. The urgent care centers around them were closed for the night, so around 10:30 p.m. she decided to take Ryan to the emergency room at Carle Health.",
      "The medical procedure",
      "The ER wasn't very busy when they arrived at 10:48 p.m., Wettstein recalled. Medical records indicate they checked in and she explained Ryan's symptoms, including an intermittent fever. The toddler was triaged and given a nasal swab test to check for Covid-19 and influenza A and B.",
      "Wettstein said they sat down and waited to be called. And they waited.",
      "As Wettstein watched Ryan in the waiting room's play area, she noticed her daughter had stopped crying.",
      "In fact, she seemed fine.",
      "So Wettstein decided to drive them home. Ryan had preschool the next day, and she figured there was no point keeping her awake for who knew how much longer and getting stuck with a big ER bill.",
      "There was no one at the check-in desk to inform that they were leaving, Wettstein said, so they just headed home to go to bed.",
      "Ryan went to her preschool the next day, and Wettstein said they forgot all about the ER trip for eight months.",
      "Then the bill came.",
      "The final bill",
      "$445 for the combined Covid and flu test \u2014 from an ER visit in which the patient never made it beyond the waiting room.",
      "The billing problem: A healthy hospital markup and standard insurance rules",
      "Even though Ryan and her mother left without seeing a doctor, the family ended up owing $298.15 after an insurance discount.",
      "At first, Wettstein said, she couldn't recall Ryan being tested at all. It wasn't until she received the bill and requested her daughter's medical records that she learned the results. (Ryan tested negative for Covid and both types of flu.)",
      "While Wettstein said the bill isn't going to break the bank, it seemed high to her, considering Walgreens sells an at-home Covid and flu combination test for $30 and can do higher-quality PCR testing for $145.",
      "Under the public health emergency declared in 2020 for the Covid pandemic, insurance companies were required to pay for Covid tests without copayments or cost sharing for patients.",
      "That requirement ended when the emergency declaration expired in May 2023. Now, it is often patients who foot the bill \u2014 and ER bills are notoriously high.",
      "\"That's a pretty healthy markup the hospital is making on it,\" Loren Adler, associate director of the Brookings Institution Center on Health Policy, told KFF Health News when contacted about Ryan's case.",
      "The rates the insurance companies negotiate with hospitals for various procedures are often based on multipliers of what Medicare pays, Adler said.",
      "Lab tests are one of the few areas in which insurance companies can often pay less than Medicare, he said \u2014 the exception being when the test is performed by the hospital laboratory, which is often what happens during ER visits.",
      "Medicare pays $142.63 for the joint test that Ryan received, but the family is on the hook for more than twice that amount, and the initial hospital charge was over three times as much.",
      "The hospital is \"utilizing their market power to make as much money as possible, and the insurance companies are not all that good at pushing back,\" Adler said. A markup of a few hundred dollars is a drop in the bucket for big insurers. But for the patients who get unexpected bills, it can be a big burden.",
      "Brittany Simon, a public relations manager for Carle Health, did not respond to specific questions but said in a statement, \"We follow policies that support the safety and wellbeing of our patients, which includes the initial triage of symptomatic patients to the Emergency Department.\"",
      "While Ryan's family would not have had to pay for a Covid test during the public health emergency, it was the family's insurer, Cigna, that did not have to pay this time, since the family had not yet met a $3,000 yearly deductible.",
      "A Cigna representative did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "The resolution",
      "Wettstein said she knew she could just pay the bill and be done with it, \"but the fact that I never saw a provider, and the fact that it was just for a Covid test, is mind-blowing to me.\"",
      "She contacted the hospital's billing department to make sure the bill was correct. She explained what happened and said the hospital representative was also surprised by the size of the bill and sent it up for further review.",
      "\"'Don't pay this until you hear from me,'\" Wettstein remembered being told.",
      "Soon, though, she received a letter from the hospital explaining that the charge was correct and supported by documentation.",
      "Wettstein thought she was avoiding any charges by taking Ryan home without being seen. Instead, she got a bill \"that they have verified that I have to pay.\"",
      "\"Like I said, it's mind-blowing to me.\"",
      "The takeaway",
      "ERs are among the most expensive options for care in the nation's health system, and the meter can start running as soon as you check in \u2014 even if you check out before receiving care.",
      "If your issue isn't life-threatening, consider an urgent care facility, which is often cheaper (and look for posted notices to confirm whether it's actually an urgent care clinic). The urgent care centers near Ryan's home were closed that evening, but some facilities stay open late or around the clock.",
      "In some ways, Wettstein was lucky. KFF Health News' \"Bill of the Month\" has received tips from other patients who left an ER after a long wait without seeing a doctor \u2014 and got slapped with a facility fee of over $1,000.",
      "Making the decision about where to go is tough, especially in a stressful situation \u2014 such as when the patient is too young to communicate what's wrong. Trying to figure out what's going on physically with a 3-year-old can feel impossible.",
      "If you decide to leave an ER without treatment, don't just walk out. Tell the triage nurse you're leaving. You might get lucky and avoid some charges.",
      "Wettstein won't think twice about taking Ryan to the pediatrician or an urgent care center the next time she's ailing. But, Wettstein said, after getting this bill, \"I'm not going to create a habit out of going to the emergency room.\"",

      "Wojcicki's future plans for 23andMe",
      "23andMe's stock has dropped around 98% since 2021, when it went public. The company, which was once valued at $6 billion, now has a market cap of around $80 million. In its most recent quarter, the company reported a net loss of $59.1 million.",
      "King asked, \"How does a company survive when it's lost 98% of its value though?\"",

      "To help boost revenue, Wojcicki said the company is focusing on its subscription service, where members can get more insights into their health.

      "\"People did 23andMe, and they loved it. And we see over 50% of our customers coming back on a quarterly basis, so they're engaged,\" said Wojcicki, adding that it shows \"they want more.\"",
      "Wojcicki said the recent layoffs, which affected more than 200 employees, were also an attempt to help slash costs.",
      "\"The focus right now is 100% on making 23andMe sustainable. And I will not be taking on research initiatives at our own cost anymore.

    "published": "Wed, 27 Nov 2024 06:59:02 -0500",
    "summary": "The cartel allegedly uses fishing boats to smuggle drugs and migrants \u2014 and catch tons of red snapper, a commercially valuable but vulnerable species.",
    "story": [
      "For years, U.S. authorities and fishermen have been complaining about illegal fishing for red snapper in the Gulf of Mexico, and now it's been revealed who is behind the lucrative trade: a Mexican drug cartel.",
      "The U.S. Treasury Department announced sanctions Tuesday against members of the Gulf drug cartel, which operates in the border cities of Reynosa and Matamoros, across from McAllen and Brownsville, Texas.",
      "While commercial fishing and drug cartels may seem like an unlikely combination, it makes perfect sense for a criminal organization.",
      "The department says the cartel uses fishing boats to facilitate drug and migrant smuggling; along the way, the boats catch tons of red snapper, a commercially valuable but vulnerable species. The boats often launch from Playa Bagdad, east of Matamoros, on the Gulf coast.",
      "\"The Gulf Cartel engages in the illicit trade of red snapper and shark species through 'lancha' operations based out of Playa Bagdad,\" the department said. \"Apart from their use for IUU (illegal, unregulated or unreported) fishing in U.S. waters, lanchas are also used to move illicit drugs and migrants into the United States.\"",
      "To add insult to injury, these Mexican boats, often based out of Playa Bagdad, sell their catch in Mexican border cities, where they are sometimes shipped into Texas for resale in the U.S. market.",
      "This occurs while U.S. fishermen had to respect strict seasonal limits or closures designed to protect fish populations.",
      "\"As the fishing of red snapper and shark species is under strict limits in the United States, and therefore those species are more abundant in U.S. waters, Mexican fishermen cross into U.S. waters to fish via these lanchas,\" the department said.",
      "\"They then bring their catch back to lancha camps into Mexico, where the product is ultimately sold and, oftentimes, exported into the United States,\" it continued. \"This activity earns millions a year for lancha camps. In addition, it also leads to the death of other marine species that are inadvertently caught\" on the long lines of baited hooks the boats use.",
      "The Treasury announced Tuesday it was designating five individuals linked to the cartel for illegal fishing -- Ildelfonso Carrillo Sapien (a.k.a. \"El Chivo\"), Raul Decuir Garcia (a.k.a. \"La Burra\"), Ismael Guerra Salinas (a.k.a. \"El Comandante\"), Omar Guerra Salinas (a.k.a. \"Samorano\"), and Francisco Javier Sierra Angulo (a.k.a. \"El Borrado\").",
      "History of illegal fishing",
      "This isn't the first time cartels have been involved in illegal fishing in Mexico. Experts say other drug cartels are involved in the prohibited gillnet fishing for totoaba in the Gulf of California, also known as the Sea of Cortez, threatening the world's most endangered porpoise, the vaquita marina.",
      "Those designated under Tuesday's sanctions - which block any of their U.S. assets - include Gulf cartel local bosses in Playa Bagdad, as well as two owners of fishing camps there.",
      "The illegal fishing problem became so severe that in 2022, the U.S. government prohibited Mexican fishing vessels from entering U.S. ports on the Gulf of Mexico, arguing the Mexican government had not done enough to prevent its boats from illegally fishing in U.S. waters.",
      "Mexican fishing boats in the Gulf \"are prohibited from entering U.S. ports, will be denied port access and services,\" the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration wrote in a report in 2022. According to a Sept. 10, 2024 NOAA bulletin, those restrictions remain in place.",
      "Small Mexican boats frequently use prohibited long lines or nets to haul in snapper in U.S. waters, which can harm other marine life, such as sharks.",
      "NOAA said in a previous report that the U.S. Coast Guard apprehended dozens of Mexican boats in the Gulf, including repeat offenders who had been interdicted multiple times since 2014.",
      "It noted the United States imported nearly five tons of fresh and frozen snapper from Mexico in 2018, raising concerns that \"these imports may have included fish harvested illegally in U.S. waters.\"",
      "U.S. targeting cartels recently",
      "In recent months, the U.S. Treasury has imposed sanctions on cartels for a variety of reasons -- from drug trafficking to fuel theft to time share scams.",
      "In October, the U.S. sanctioned senior members of the armed wing of a Mexican drug cartel that operates on border territories in and around Chihuahua, Mexico. The cartel has also been linked to the 2019 ambush that\u00a0killed nine Americans\u00a0in Mexico.",
      "In September, the U.S. sanctioned a\u00a0man known as \"The Tank\"\u00a0who allegedly leads the fuel theft arm of Mexico's hyper-violent\u00a0Jalisco New Generation cartel.",
      "In July, the U.S. imposed sanctions on a group of Mexican accountants and firms allegedly linked to a\u00a0timeshare fraud\u00a0ring run by the Jalisco cartel in a multi-million dollar scheme targeting Americans.",
      "The month before that, U.S. officials announced economic sanctions against eight targets affiliated with a Mexican drug cartel, La Nueva Familia Michoacana, accused of fentanyl trafficking and human smuggling. Among the leaders targeted was an alleged assassin named Uriel Tabares Martinez.\u00a0 According to the Treasury Department, he is known as \"El Medico\" (\"The Doctor\") for the violent and surgical manner in which he\u00a0tortures\u00a0and kills those who cross the high-ranking members of the cartel.",

    "published": "Tue, 26 Nov 2024 20:23:03 -0500",
    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump is proposing sweeping new tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China as soon as he takes office. Here's why.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump, an avowed fan of tariffs, is pledging to enact stiff import duties as soon as he's inaugurated in January. For Trump, these new levies would both supercharge the\u00a0trade policies\u00a0pursued during his first administration and, more broadly, help the U.S. achieve key economic and social goals.",
      "On his Truth Social site Monday evening, Trump unveiled plans to place a 25% tariff on all imports from Mexico and Canada on January 20, his inauguration day. The president-elect also said he intends to levy an additional 10% fee on all imports from China.",
      "Trump's penchant for protectionist trade policies is a source of concern for many economists and Wall Street analysts, who worry new tariffs and retaliatory measures by U.S. trade partners could slow economic growth, spur inflation and trigger a trade war.",
      "But Trump and his allies, including his choice for Treasury Secretary,\u00a0Scott Bessent, have argued that tariffs deployed during his first term didn't boost inflation and that the upside could far outweigh any negatives.",
      "\"But tariffs are two things if you look at it,\" Trump said in October in an interview with Bloomberg News editor-in-chief John Micklethwait. \"No. 1 is for protection of the companies that we have here, and the new companies that will move in because we're going to have thousands of companies coming into this country.\"",
      "Here are four ways Trump says tariffs will help with the U.S., along with what experts say.",
      "Protect U.S. manufacturing",
      "Trump believes that imposing tariffs on trading partners will help protect U.S. businesses at a time when domestic manufacturing jobs have fallen far from their peak in 1979.",
      "In some instances, the tariffs that Trump imposed in 2018-19 achieved that goal, with the Brookings Institution noting there's some evidence that jobs in specific industries may have received a boost. For instance, tariffs on imported washing machines may have created 1,800 new U.S. jobs at Whirlpool and other manufacturers, according to the centrist think tank.",
      "But that ignores the broader impact of Trump's first-term tariffs on U.S. manufacturing, with the Federal Reserve finding\u00a0that U.S. manufacturers ended up facing higher costs for raw materials they imported, as well as from retaliatory tariffs from other nations. The number of U.S. manufacturing jobs fell slightly during Trump's first term, from about 12.4 million to 12.2 million workers, although a range of factors could account for that decline.",
      "\"[O]ur results suggest that the tariffs have not boosted manufacturing employment or output, even as they increased producer prices,\" the Fed researchers noted.",
      "Bring new companies to the U.S.",
      "Trump also contends that broad-based tariffs will convince some foreign manufacturers to open plants in the U.S. as a way to avoid the import duties.",
      "\"The higher the tariff, the more likely it is that the company will come into the United States and build a factory in the United States, so it doesn't have to pay the tariff,\" Trump told Bloomberg's Micklethwait.",
      "Although such a shift is possible, Micklethwait said such changes would \"take many, many years.\" (Trump disputed that, saying companies would \"come right away.\") Experts note that many factors beyond tariffs affect where companies decide to operate, including supply chains, taxes, shipping costs, and labor and regulatory policies.",
      "Already, some businesses are anticipating the impact of tariffs by shifting their manufacturing locations, but that may not be guaranteed to benefit the U.S. For instance, shoemaker Steve Madden said if Trump places new tariffs on Chinese imports, it will shift manufacturing away from China and toward nations such as Cambodia and Vietnam.",
      "Deliver billions in new federal revenue",
      "Trump has also touted tariffs as a way to generate new federal revenue that can offset his proposed tax cuts. During his first administration, his tariffs \u2014 more limited than his current proposals \u2014 generated $80 billion in revenue, according to the Tax Foundation.",
      "If Trump institutes a 10% tariff on all imports, as he proposed during his campaign, the federal government would reap $2 trillion from 2025 through 2034,\u00a0estimates\u00a0the nonpartisan Tax Foundation, a think tank focused on tax issues.",
      "According to Goldman Sachs, a 25% tariff on Canada and Mexico, along with a 10% tax on Chinese imports, would generate just under $300 billion in tariff revenue per year. Overall, 43% of U.S. imports come from Mexico (15.4%), Canada (13.6%),and China (13.9%).",
      "However, that revenue would largely be paid by U.S. consumers and businesses, experts say. That's because tariffs are not paid by the countries that export to the U.S., as Trump maintains, but rather by U.S. importers.",
      "In other words, companies like Walmart would be faced with the decision of whether to swallow the higher costs of imports, or passing those on to consumers, Vicky Redwood, senior economic adviser for Capital Economics, wrote in a research note.",
      "\"If the costs are passed on, then customers face a choice: continue buying the (now more expensive) import or switch to buying a domestic alternative (which will cost more than the import pre-tariff),\" she noted.",
      "Trump's tariffs could cost the typical U.S. family an additional $2,600 a year due to importers and manufacturers passing the cost of tariffs to consumers, according to an August analysis from the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a nonpartisan think tank focused on economic issues.",
      "Stem the flow of drugs and illegal immigration",
      "Trump also sees the threat of new tariffs as a way to curb illegal immigration and drug smuggling, citing people \"pouring through Mexico and Canada, bringing Crime and Drugs at levels never seen before.\" The tariffs would remain \"until such time as Drugs, in particular Fentanyl, and all Illegal Aliens stop this Invasion of our Country!\" he added.",
      "Much of the fentanyl within the U.S.\u00a0is smuggled from Mexico. During President Biden's term, border seizures of the drug rose sharply, with U.S. officials tallying about 21,900 pounds (12,247 kilograms) of fentanyl seized in the 2024 government budget year, versus 2,545 pounds (1,154 kilograms) in 2019, when Trump was president.",
      "While it's possible that Canada, Mexico and China could increase enforcement against drug smuggling or immigration to avoid Trump's tariffs, it's unclear whether such a threat along would achieve those goals. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum on Tuesday suggested Mexico could retaliate with tariffs of its own and described illegal drugs as a U.S. problem, while indicating a willingness to discuss the issues with Trump.",
      "The flow of drugs into the U.S. \"is a problem of public health and consumption in your country's society,\" she said.",

      "The warning came one day after Trump said he would impose a\u00a0new round of tariffs\u00a0on Mexico, Canada and China on his first day in office. Before the Nov. 5 election, he had proposed a baseline 10% tariff on all U.S. imports and a 60% tariff on goods shipped from China, arguing the such levies protect domestic manufacturers and encourage American companies to create jobs at home.",
      "Any added costs on U.S. imports from the three counties \"will be shared by our customers,\" Barry told investors in the company's Nov. 26 earnings call, noting that \"there's very little in [the] consumer electronics space that is not imported.\"",
      "\"These are goods that people need, and higher prices are not helpful,\" she added.",

      "Best Buy could try to partly offset the impact of new tariffs by importing more goods ahead of levies taking effect in 2025, as well as working with vendors to source products from countries other than China, Barry said during the call.

And what we're trying to do is to ensure that every customer, every associate feels welcome here to shop. And to feel like they belong,\" Furner said in response to questions about the DEI policy decision in an exclusive interview Tuesday with \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "The changes, confirmed by Walmart on Monday after\u00a0Wall Street Journal earlier reported\u00a0on them, represent the end of a five-year commitment for an equity racial center set up after\u00a0the police killing of George Floyd, as well as the retailer's decision to phase out the term DEI. Walmart will also no longer give priority treatment to suppliers based on race or gender diversity and will halt sellers from listing some transgender-related or themed items on the website.",

      "While consuming a large chunk of many families' income, child care workers are generally poorly paid. As of May 2023, wages averaged $15.42 an hour, or just over $32,000 a year, according\u00a0to\u00a0federal data. Overall, the nation's child care workforce is among the lowest 5% paid of all occupations, noted Haspel.",

      "U.S. Border Patrol is on pace to record fewer than 50,000 apprehensions of migrants crossing the southern border unlawfully this month.",
      "Trump also turned his ire on China, saying he has \"had many talks with China about the massive amounts of drugs, in particular Fentanyl, being sent into the United States \u2013 But to no avail.\"",
      "\"Until such time as they stop, we will be charging China an additional 10% Tariff, above any additional Tariffs, on all of their many products coming into the United States of America,\" he wrote.",
      "It is unclear whether Trump will actually go through with the threats or if he is using them as a negotiating tactic before he takes office in the new year.",
      "Much of America's fentanyl is smuggled from Mexico. Border seizures of the drug rose sharply under President Joe Biden, and U.S. officials tallied about 21,900 pounds (12,247 kilograms) of fentanyl seized in the 2024 government budget year, compared with 2,545 pounds (1,154 kilograms) in 2019, when Trump was president.",
      "Trump's nominee for treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, if confirmed, would be one of several officials responsible for imposing tariffs on other nations. He has on several occasions said tariffs are a means of negotiation with other countries.",

Whether it is getting allies to spend more on their own defense, opening foreign markets to U.S. exports, securing cooperation on ending illegal immigration and interdicting fentanyl trafficking, or deterring military aggression, tariffs can play a central role.\"",
      "If Trump were to move forward with the threatened tariffs, the new taxes would pose an enormous challenge for the economies of Canada and Mexico, in particular.",

    "story": [
      "President Claudia Sheinbaum suggested Tuesday that Mexico could retaliate \u2014\u2014\u2014with tariffs of its own, after U.S. President-elect Donald Trump threatened to impose 25% import duties on Mexican goods if the country doesn't stop the flow of drugs and migrants across the border.",
      "Sheinbaum said she was willing to engage in talks on the issues, but said drugs were a U.S. problem.",
      "\"One tariff would be followed by another in response, and so on until we put at risk common businesses,\" Sheinbaum said, referring to U.S. automakers that have plants on both sides of the border.",
      "The tariffs, if implemented,\u00a0could dramatically raise prices\u00a0on everything from gas to automobiles. The U.S. is the largest importer of goods in the world, with Mexico, China and Canada its top three suppliers, according to the most recent Census data.",
      "Sheinbaum said in a letter to Trump, which she read at a news conference Tuesday, that Mexico had done a lot to stem the flow of migrants, noting \"caravans of migrants no longer reach the border.\" However, Mexico's efforts to fight drugs like the deadly synthetic opioid fentanyl \u2014 which is manufactured by Mexican cartels using chemicals imported from China \u2014 have weakened in the last year.",
      "Sheinbaum said Mexico suffered from an influx of weapons smuggled in from the United States, and said the flow of drugs \"is a problem of public health and consumption in your country's society.\"",
      "Sheinbaum also criticized U.S. spending on weapons, saying the money should instead be spent regionally to address the problem of migration. \"If a percentage of what the United States spends on war were dedicated to peace and development, that would address the underlying causes of migration,\" she said.",
      "Sheinbaum's bristly response suggests that Trump faces a much different Mexican president than he did in his first term.",
      "Back in late 2018, former President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador was a charismatic, old-school politician who developed a chummy relationship with Trump. The two were eventually able to strike a bargain in which Mexico helped keep migrants away from the border \u2014 and received other countries' deported migrants \u2014 and Trump backed down on the threats.",
      "But Sheinbaum, who took office Oct. 1, is a stern leftist ideologue trained in radical student protest movements, and appears less willing to pacify or mollify Trump.",
      "\"We negotiate as equals, there is no subordination here, because we are a great nation,\" Sheinbaum said, while adding, \"I think we are going to reach an agreement.\"",
      "But Gabriela Siller, director of economic analysis of the financial group Banco Base, fears the personality clash could escalate things into brinkmanship; Trump clearly hates to lose.",
      "\"Trump may have just tossed the threat out there, as he does,\" Siller said. \"But Mexico's response, that we're going to respond to you with tariffs, that will make Trump really impose them.\"",
      "Brian Peck, adjunct assistant professor of international trade law at USC, recently told CBS News that the new administration could instead use tariffs chiefly as a tool\u00a0for negotiating leverage\u00a0in trade talks.",
      "\"If he doesn't like a certain practice or policy initiative, he can use it as leverage to threaten them,\" Peck told\u00a0CBS News' Carter Evans.",
      "It's not clear how serious Trump's threat is. The U.S.-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement forbids just imposing tariffs on other member countries. And it's not clear whether the economy could even tolerate sudden levies on imports: Auto plants on both sides of the border rely on each other for parts and components, and some production lines could screech to a halt.",
      "\"It is unacceptable and would cause inflation and job losses in Mexico and the United States,\" Sheinbaum said, while offering to talk about the issues. \"If tariffs go up, who will it hurt? General Motors,\" she said.",
      "\"Dialogue is the best path to achieve understanding, peace and prosperity for our two countries,\" Sheinbaum said at the end of the letter to Trump. \"I hope our teams can meet soon.\"",
      "Late Monday, Trump said he would impose a 25% tax on all products entering the country from Canada and Mexico, and an additional 10% tariff on goods from China, as one of his first executive orders. The tariffs, if implemented, could dramatically raise prices for American consumers on everything from gas to automobiles to agricultural products.",
      "Trump made the threats Monday in a pair of posts on his Truth Social site in which he railed against an influx of illegal migrants, even though apprehensions at the southern border have been hovering near four-year lows.",

    "story": [
      "Walmart, the world's largest retailer, is rolling back its diversity, equity and inclusion policies, joining a growing list of major corporations that have done the same after coming under attack by conservative activists.",
      "The changes, confirmed by Walmart on Monday, are sweeping and include everything from not renewing a five-year commitment for an equity racial center set up in 2020 after the police killing of George Floyd to pulling out of a prominent gay rights index. And when it comes to race or gender, Walmart won't be giving priority treatment to suppliers.",
      "Walmart's moves underscore the increasing pressure faced by corporate America as it continues to navigate the fallout from the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in June 2023 ending affirmative action in college admissions. Emboldened by that decision, conservative groups have filed lawsuits making similar arguments about corporations, targeting workplace initiatives such as diversity programs and hiring practices that prioritize historically marginalized groups.",
      "Separately, conservative political commentator and activist Robby Starbuck has been going after corporate DEI policies, calling out individual companies on the social media platform X. Several of those companies have subsequently announced that they are pulling back their initiatives, including Ford, Lowe's, Tractor Supply and Harley-Davidson.",
      "But Walmart, which employs 1.6 million workers in the U.S., is the largest one to do so.",
      "\"This is the biggest win yet for our movement to end wokeness in corporate America,\" Starbuck wrote on X, adding that he'd been in conversation with Walmart.",
      "Walmart confirmed to The Associated Press that it will better monitor its third-party marketplace items to make sure they don't feature sexual and transgender products aimed at minors. That would include chest binders intended for youths who are going through a gender change, the company said.",
      "The Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer will also be reviewing grants to Pride events to make sure it isn't financially supporting sexualized content that may be unsuitable for kids. For example, the company wants to makes sure a family pavilion isn't next to a drag show at a Pride event, the company said.",
      "Additionally, Walmart will no longer consider race and gender as a litmus test to improve diversity when it offers supplier contracts. The company said it didn't have quotas and won't do so going forward. It won't be gathering demographic data when determining financing eligibility for those grants.",
      "Walmart also said it wouldn't renew a racial equity center that was established through a five-year, $100 million philanthropic commitment from the company with a mandate to, according to its website, \"address the root causes of gaps in outcomes experienced by Black and African American people in education, health, finance and criminal justice systems.\"",
      "And it would stop participating in the Human Rights Campaign's annual benchmark index that measures workplace inclusion for LGBTQ+ employees.",
      "\"We've been on a journey and know we aren't perfect, but every decision comes from a place of wanting to foster a sense of belonging, to open doors to opportunities for all our associates, customers and suppliers and to be a Walmart for everyone,\" the company said in a statement.",
      "The changes come soon after an election win by former President Donald Trump, who's criticized DEI initiatives and surrounded himself with conservatives who hold similar views, including his former adviser Stephen Miller, who leads a group called America First Legal that has challenged corporate DEI policies. Trump named Miller to be the deputy chief of policy in his new administration.",
      "A Walmart spokesperson said some of its policy changes have been in progress for a while. For example, it's been moving away from using the word DEI in job titles and communications and started to use the word \"belonging.\" It also started making changes to its supplier program in the aftermath of the Supreme Court affirmative action ruling.",

    "summary": "Most Americans are forced to retire earlier than they had expected, often disrupting their financial planning.",
    "story": [
      "The typical American retires far earlier than he or she expects to, and it's often not by choice, according to new research from the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies.",
      "The median retirement age in the U.S. is 62, with nearly six in 10 retirees telling the research firm that they stepped back from the workforce earlier than they had planned. Almost half of those people said the reason came down to health issues, such as physical limitations or disability. Losing a job or an organizational change at their employer were among the other reasons people stopped working before they planned to retire.",
      "\"Financially precarious\"",
      "The findings underscore the fragility of retirement in the U.S., with older Americans often finding themselves retired before they're financially ready to call it quits. And with many people outliving earlier generations \u2014 the typical respondent told Transamerica they believe they'll live to age 90 \u2014 they're also facing the prospect of supporting themselves financially for several decades in retirement, which can easily stretch or even exhaust their savings.",
      "\"Many of them are financially precarious \u2014 if they were to have some sort of major financial shock or their health would decline and needed long-term care, they would have a hard time affording it,\" Catherine Collinson, CEO and president of the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The research backs up previous research about the typical retirement age, with the nonprofit Employee Benefit Research Institute finding earlier this year that the median retirement age for Americans is 62. That underscores a gap between retirement plans and reality, with business leaders and policy experts often urging Americans to work longer so they can save more for their old age \u2014 a strategy that often doesn't unfold as envisioned.",
      "Retirees forced to leave their jobs earlier than planned is a \"cautionary tale for people currently in the workforce,\" Collinson said.",
      "People should actively maintain their health and keep their skills up to date, while also educating themselves about retirement and financial planning, as well as socking away savings, she noted.",
      "Why Americans claim Social Security early",
      "Retiring before a person expects may explain why millions of Americans claim Social Security before they reach their \"full retirement age,\" or the age at which they are entitled to their full benefits.",
      "Retirement experts generally urge Americans to hold off on claiming Social Security as long as possible because of the financial benefits of waiting. Workers can file for the retirement benefit as early as age 62, but the tradeoff is a roughly 30%\u00a0reduction\u00a0in their monthly checks compared with waiting until full retirement age, which is either 66 or 67 depending on one's birth year.",
      "But the median age when Americans claim Social Security benefits is 63, Transamerica found in its survey of more than 2,400 retirees. That means many older Americans are locking themselves into permanently lower monthly checks throughout their retirement.",
      "On the flip side, waiting until age 70 to collect Social Security \u2014 the maximum age to claim benefits \u2014 provides a boost of more than 30% to one's monthly benefits. Despite that incentive, Transamerica found that only 4% of retirees wait until 70 to file for their benefits.",
      "\"One of the most important things they can do is fully understand their benefits, and if they have any options to stretch out those benefits,\" Collinson said. \"If it's a spousal situation, maybe if they need the income, one claims first and the other later, or if they can jump back in the workforce and hit the pause button on Social Security and get more income.\"",
      "Another reason for claiming Social Security early is likely that many retirees may not have enough money put away in a retirement fund to keep them afloat. Only about half of U.S. retirees participated in a 401(k) or similar plan throughout their working careers, while more than one in four said their employer never offered retirement benefits while they worked, Transamerica found.",
      "About 6 in 10 retirees cited Social Security as their primary source of income, underscoring the importance of the program for older Americans. By comparison, only about 1 in 10 said retirement accounts like 401(k)s or IRAs would be their main source of income.",
      "Challenged but happy",
      "Despite the challenges, many retirees are sanguine about stepping back from work, the study found. Almost 9 in 10 described themselves as being generally happy and having close relationships with family and friends.",
      "\"One of the things that stands out is retirees are really enjoying their time in retirement, which I think bodes well for all of us,\" Collinson said. \"They've made some adjustments, especially to their financial situation, and overall they are doing well.\"",
      "Americans \"dream of retirement,\" she added. \"Retirement is more about freedom and the ability to spend their time as they want to, rather than it is financial freedom specifically.\"",

But Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum suggested Mexico was already doing its part and had no interest in closing its borders.",
      "The two spoke just days after Trump threatened to impose sweeping new tariffs on Canada and Mexico as part of his effort to crack down on illegal immigration and drugs \u2014 a threat that drew a prompt and terse response from Sheinbaum, who said any U.S. tariffs would be met with reciprocal measures from her government \u2014 stressing: \"There is no subordination here.\"",
      "Sheinbaum said on Thursday she did not discuss tariffs in the call with Trump.",
      "Trump said in his social media posts that Sheinbaum had \"agreed to stop Migration through Mexico, and into the United States, effectively closing our Southern Border.\"",
      "Sheinbaum indicated on social media, however, that she'd \"explained\" to Trump that Mexico is already \"taking care of\" migrant caravans, calling it an \"excellent conversation,\" but indicating no major changes in her government's policies.",
      "\"I explained to him the comprehensive strategy that Mexico has followed to address the migration phenomenon, respecting human rights. Thanks to this, migrants and caravans are assisted before they reach the border,\" the Mexican leader wrote. \"We reiterate that Mexico's position is not to close borders but to build bridges between governments and between peoples.\"",
      "Trump's social media posts about the borders \u2014 describing what he called \"a wonderful conversation\" with Sheinbaum and suggesting Mexico had made concessions in the wake of his tariff threat \u2014 did move financial markets.",
      "Even if the proposed tariffs fail to materialize, Trump may argue to his supporters that the mere possibility of them is an effective policy tool, and continue to rely on tariff threats.",
      "But the only new policy clearly referenced by either leader in their social media posts Wednesday was a vow by Trump to launch a new national ad campaign warning against the dangers of fentanyl use.",
      "Sheinbaum had said in her message that she and Trump, \"also talked about reinforcing cooperation on security issues, within the framework of our sovereignty, and the campaign we are carrying out to prevent fentanyl consumption.\"",

By the time the Campaign is over, everyone will know how really bad the horror of this Drug is.\"",

      "Arrivals at the U.S.-Mexico border have dropped 40% from an all-time high last December. U.S. officials mostly credit Mexican vigilance around rail yards and highway checkpoints.",
      "Driven by mounting pressure from the U.S. to block migrants going north, in the past few years Mexican authorities have turned to sending them to southern Mexico, in a strategy seen by experts as an attempt to wear migrants out until they give up.",
      "Neither side clarified any firm plans to impose new tariffs in their social media messages on Wednesday. But their implementation could fuel higher prices for American consumers and slow economic growth, potentially blowing up the trade agreement among the U.S., Canada and Mexico that was finalized in 2020 during Trump's previous time in the White House.",
      "Trump on Monday said he would impose a 25% tax on all products entering the country from Canada and Mexico as one of his first executive orders upon taking office on Jan. 20.

    "story": [
      "The history of White House Thanksgiving traditions date back more than 160 years to President Abraham Lincoln, who established the national holiday.",
      "During his time in office, Lincoln issued a proclamation calling for the celebration of Thanksgiving, triumphing over similar efforts of presidents who came before him, according to the National Park Service.",
      "The official designation of the annual national holiday is due, in part, to writer Sarah Josepha Hale. The NPS notes that in 1827 \u2014 as editor of \"Boston's Ladies Magazine\" \u2014 Hale began writing essays calling for the national holiday. Finally, on Sept. 18, 1863, she wrote to Lincoln asking him to use his presidential powers to create the holiday.",
      "Lincoln obliged and a few weeks later, on Oct. 3, 1863 \u2014 during the height of the Civil War \u2014 he issued the Thanksgiving Proclamation. Ever since, the country has celebrated Thanksgiving Day.",
      "But it wasn't until after a bill passed by Congress on Dec. 26, 1941, that made the holiday fall annually on the fourth Thursday in November.",
      "Thanksgiving at the White House is usually relatively quiet and includes the tradition of pardoning lucky turkeys from their doomed fate of the dinner table.",
      "Presidential turkey pardons",
      "The first turkey pardon ever issued is believed to have been by Lincoln as recorded by White House reporter Noah Brooks in an 1865 dispatch, according to the White House Historical Association.",
      "Lincoln had granted clemency to a turkey named Jack belonging to his son Tad Lincoln, that had originally been slated to be gobbled up at the family's Christmas dinner in 1863.",
      "But the annual practice in which the White House sent pardoned presentation turkeys to a farm to live out their days did not occur until Ronald Reagan's presidency in the 1980s, the WHHA says. In decades prior, presidents would occasionally receive turkeys from the poultry industry and decide not to eat them without an official pardon.",
      "The WHHA notes the practice of sending presentation turkeys to the president became a norm in 1981, and the pardoning ceremonies quickly became a national sensation. By 1989, the annual tradition materialized with President George H.W. Bush \u2014 as documented by the association \u2014 speaking to the pardoned turkey, saying the line his successors still reprise at ceremonies today: \"He's granted a presidential pardon as of right now.\"",
      "On Monday, President Biden issued the final two turkey pardons of his term, to Peach and Blossom, sending them to live out the rest of their lives at Minnesota's Farmamerica as poultry ambassadors for agricultural students.",
      "Gathering with family and friends",
      "Aside from the turkey pardoning spectacle, presidents spend Thanksgiving in the same fashion as households across the country.",
      "The first documented Thanksgiving gathering at the White House dates back to Nov. 28, 1878, according to the WHHA. Then-President Rutherford B. Hayes held a large Thanksgiving dinner gathering with his family and private secretaries, singing hymns in the Red Room afterward and inviting African-American staff to enjoy their own Thanksgiving meal in the State Dining Room.",
      "The tradition has since withstood the test of time. Through economic hardship and times of wars, presidents have carved out time for family. The WHHA notes that President Woodrow Wilson's first Thanksgiving meal during World War I on Nov. 29, 1917, was an economical one \u2014 and one without cranberries.",
      "In recent decades, presidents have taken to the tradition of celebrating the holiday outside the White House at their so-called \"go-to\" vacation spots. President Ronald Reagan in 1985 traveled to the family ranch in Santa Barbara, California.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump spent all but one Thanksgiving of his first term at his Mar-a-Lago estate in West Palm Beach, Florida. President Biden has spent every Thanksgiving during his term with family in Nantucket, Massachusetts as the Biden family has for over 40 years.",

      "\"Swatting\" is the action of falsely calling emergency services in an effort to send armed police officers to a specific address or target in a threatening way. Bomb threats can represent a form of swatting \u2014 misleading authorities to believe that a serious threat or crime is underway to prompt an urgent response from police.

      "Now, as Trump prepares to return to the White House in January, the promise will be put to the test. He has Republican allies in Congress on the issue, and now the Lumbee, as well as tribal nations across the country, are watching closely to see what comes next.",
      "Tribal nations typically receive federal recognition through an application with the Department of the Interior, but the Lumbee have been trying for many years to circumvent that process by going through Congress. Chairman John Lowery called Interior's application process \"flawed\" and overly lengthy and said it should be up to Congress to right what he calls a historic wrong.",
      "\"It's just crazy that we're sitting here fighting this battle, and I have to tell you that I am real in 2024,\" Lowery said.",
      "Following the presidential election, the Lumbee hope there will be momentum behind their cause, but they face deep-rooted opposition from tribal nations across the country.",
      "There are questions about Trump's next move",
      "Several tribes, including the only one that is federally recognized in North Carolina, argue that if the Lumbee Tribe wants federal acknowledgment, it should go through the formal process in the Department of the Interior. One person familiar with Trump's thinking said the president-elect will require the Lumbee Tribe to do just that, and he won't sign a Lumbee recognition bill. The person requested anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly speak about Trump's views.",
      "Trump's spokeswoman, Karoline Leavitt, said \"no policy should be deemed official unless it comes directly from President Trump.\"",
      "Federal recognition is of enormous importance, as it comes with access to resources like healthcare through Indian Health Services and the ability to create a land base such as reservations through the land-to-trust process. But before that happens, a tribal nation has to file a successful application with the Office of Federal Acknowledgement, a department within the Interior.",
      "The Lumbee Tribe has applied for federal recognition, but that petition was denied in 1985 because it \"could not establish the group's descendency either culturally, politically, or genealogically from any tribe which existed historically in the area.\"",
      "In 2016, the Interior reversed a decision barring the Lumbee Tribe from reapplying, but the Lumbee have opted for the congressional route.",
      "Gaining federal recognition through legislation is a rare but not unheard of path. But the Lumbee's approach has stoked a simmering debate in both Indian Country and Congress about Indigenous identity and tribal nationhood.",
      "The Lumbee have received support from members of both parties",
      "Members of Congress from both parties have supported recognizing the Lumbee through legislation, including Oklahoma Republican Sen. Markwayne Mullin, a member of the Cherokee Nation who campaigned for Trump in North Carolina and backed the legislation.",
      "But perhaps the state-recognized tribe's most ardent ally in Congress is North Carolina Republican Sen. Thom Tillis, who is up for reelection in 2026.",
      "Tillis introduced the\u00a0Lumbee Fairness Act\u00a0last year and has been a vocal supporter of the Lumbee. In interviews with The Associated Press, several tribal leaders, lobbyists, and advocates said they were told by Tillis directly or by his staff that the senator is currently and will continue to block certain bills backed by tribal nations unless the leaders of those tribes support the Lumbee.",
      "One of the bills he's promised to block, according to those interviewed by the AP, is a land transfer that would allow the Tennessee Valley Authority to return 70 acres of land to the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, the only federally recognized tribal nation in Tillis's state. It would allow the tribe to put the land in Monroe County, Tennessee into trust. The plot is part of the tribal nation's homelands and contains the birthplace of Sequoyah.",
      "\"It's appalling to me. It's disgraceful,\" Principal Chief of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians Michell Hicks said. He said that Tillis told him earlier this year that he would stop any legislation dealing with the Eastern Band unless Hicks pledged his support.",
      "Hicks is among the tribal leaders who question the validity of the Lumbee's historical claims, and he said that is out of the question. At one point about a century ago, the Lumbee were known as the Cherokee Indians of Robeson County, and for many years now all three Cherokee tribes \u2014 the Eastern Band, the Cherokee Nation, and the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians \u2014 have denounced this and been vocal opponents of granting the Lumbee federal recognition.",
      "Representatives for Tillis declined to comment.",
      "Tillis held up legislation last week that would have allowed for the preservation of the site of the Wounded Knee massacre. While doing so, he singled out the heads of the Oglala Sioux Tribe and the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, who have backed the preservation measure, for not supporting his efforts to federally recognize the Lumbee.",
      "\"This is not about you,\" Tillis said to the two tribal nations, who he acknowledged had been trying for a century to preserve the site of the massacre. \"But you need to know that your leadership is playing a game that will ultimately force me to take a position.\"",
      "Tillis suggested it was a \"casino cartel\" in part driven by the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians and an Osage attorney named Wilson Pipestem working for the tribe, that is trying to keep the Lumbee from gaining recognition, which could one day lead to the Lumbee opening their own casinos. Tillis threatened to continue publicly naming tribal leaders and their employees who he felt were standing in the way of his bill.",
      "In a statement to the AP, Pipestem said Tillis should \"apologize to the Tribal leaders for his false allegations and unscrupulous tactics.\"",
      "Lowery acknowledged that Tillis has held up both pieces of legislation, but he said that Tillis has not done so at the direction of the Lumbee.",
      "\"If he's put a hold on the bill it's because he reached out to tribal leaders to see where they stand on his bill, and they apparently have told him that they're not in support,\" Lowery said. \"So, he said 'well, if you can't be supportive of my bill, I can't be supportive of your bill.'\""

Bob Menendez asked a federal court in New York on Wednesday to throw out his conviction in a sprawling bribery scheme and grant him a new trial after prosecutors disclosed that the jury was inadvertently provided information during deliberations that it should not have been given.",

      "\"If you take government resources, the memorandum with GSA requires that you then have to report all donations to the transition, and they cannot exceed $5,000 per person,\" she said. \"It's two things: One, they want the privacy of who their donors are and if they don't accept the GSA money, they don't have to disclose anything \u2014 and secondly, they have a few supporters, like Miriam Adelson and Elon Musk that are billionaires... So this notion of getting $7 million from the government to help jump-start your transition just isn't as attractive as it might have been to the Harris campaign, but I think more importantly, they probably don't want people to know that so-and-so gave $2 billion to the transition.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump has tapped Keith Kellogg, a retired lieutenant general, to serve as special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, he announced Wednesday.",
      "Kellogg served as chief of staff to the National Security Council and national security adviser to former Vice President Mike Pence during Trump's first term in office. He will assume the role as assistant to the president and special envoy for Ukraine and Russia as it nears the three-year mark of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.",
      "Trump announced Kellogg as the envoy in a post to social media, writing that he \"has led a distinguished Military and Business career, including serving in highly sensitive National Security roles in my first Administration.\"",
      "\"He was with me right from the beginning! Together, we will secure PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH, and Make America, and the World, SAFE AGAIN!\" the president-elect wrote.",
      "Trump's return to the White House has raised questions about the future of U.S. involvement in the war in Ukraine. The U.S. under President Biden had provided roughly $64.1 billion in military aid since Russia launched its invasion in 2022, and about $66.9 billion in military assistance since Russia initially invaded Ukraine in 2014, according to the State Department.",
      "The president-elect, however, has criticized Ukrainian President Voldymyr Zelenskyy, calling him in June \"the greatest salesman of all time\" for pushing for continued U.S. support in Ukraine's efforts to push back against Russia's aggression. Trump has claimed he would have the war \"settled\" before taking office for his second term, and has said Russian President Vladimir Putin would not have invaded Ukraine if he were president.",
      "Trump and Zelenskyy spoke by phone after the president-elect defeated Vice President Kamala Harris in the election earlier this month. Ukraine's leader said on social media the call was \"excellent\" and praised his \"tremendous campaign\" that made his victory possible.",
      "\"We agreed to maintain close dialogue and advance our cooperation. Strong and unwavering U.S. leadership is vital for the world and for a just peace,\" Zelenskyy wrote.",
      "Trump, meanwhile, has praised Russian President Vladimir Putin as \"savvy\" and suggested in February that he \"would encourage\" Russia \"to do whatever the hell they want\" with NATO member countries that failed to meet the alliance's defense spending targets.",
      "Ret. Gen. H.R. McMaster, who served as Trump's national security adviser in his first term, told \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday that the upcoming months are \"really critical\" in determining the \"next phase\" of the war in Ukraine.",

    "published": "Wed, 27 Nov 2024 14:01:40 -0500",
    "summary": "Millions of Americans would be eligible to have popular drugs used for weight loss like Wegovy or Ozempic covered by Medicare and Medicaid under a rule the Biden administration has proposed.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Millions of Americans with obesity would be eligible to have popular drugs used for weight loss like Wegovy or Ozempic covered by Medicare and Medicaid under a new rule the Biden administration proposed Tuesday morning.",
      "The costly proposal from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services sets the stage for a potential showdown between the powerful pharmaceutical industry and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an outspoken opponent of the weight-loss drugs who, as President-elect Donald Trump's nominee to lead the department, could try to block the measure.",
      "While the rule would give millions of people access to weekly injectables that have helped people shed pounds so quickly that some have labeled them miracle drugs, it would cost taxpayers as much as $35 billion over the next decade.",
      "\"It's a good day for anyone who suffers from obesity,\" U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra told The Associated Press in an interview. \"It's a game changer for Americans who can't afford these drugs otherwise.\"",
      "\"This proposal would allow Americans and their doctors to determine the best path forward so they can lead healthier lives, without worrying about their ability to cover these drugs out-of-pocket, and ultimately reduce health care costs to our nation,\" the White House said in a statement.",
      "A bipartisan coalition of congressional members have lobbied for the drugs to be covered by Medicare, saying it could save the government from spending billions of dollars on treating chronic ailments that stem from obesity.",
      "Who would be eligible to get weight loss drugs?",
      "Under the\u00a0proposal, Medicare and Medicaid coverage would extended to people prescribed the drugs \"to reduce excess body weight and maintain weight reduction long-term for individuals with obesity.\"",
      "Medicare estimates most obese enrollees are already eligible through other conditions, like diabetes, heart disease or sleep apnea. Around 7% of Medicare beneficiaries would be newly eligible.This means people who are only overweight but not obese would still not be covered, unless it was paired with another qualifying condition like treating diabetes or heart disease.",
      "The change also applies to state Medicaid programs, which would now no longer be allowed to exclude coverage of weight loss drugs for obese residents.",
      "The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services estimates that 12% of adults covered by Medicaid would be newly eligible. Adolescents could also be covered, given the Food and Drug Administration  has\u00a0approved\u00a0use of Wegovy down to age 12.",
      "The anti-obesity drug market has expanded significantly in recent years, with the FDA approving a new class of weekly injectables like Novo Nordisk's Wegovy and Eli Lilly's Zepbound to treat obesity.",
      "People can lose as much as 15% to 25% of their body weight on the drugs, which imitate the hormones that regulate appetites by communicating fullness between the gut and brain when people eat.",
      "The cost of the drugs has largely limited them to the wealthy, including celebrities who boast of their benefits. A monthly supply of Wegovy rings up at $1,300 and Zepbound will put you out $1,000. Shortages of the drugs have also limited the supplies.",
      "When would coverage of weight loss drugs start?",
      "For Medicare, the proposal to require Part D plans to expand coverage for weight loss drugs would take effect for plans in 2026.Officials claimed they do not think the proposal will lead to significantly increased costs for seniors next year, citing provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act.",
      "\"We do not expect any short-term impact on premiums from this proposal, and in fact, this proposal provides a significant savings for people who currently may be paying out of pocket for these medications,\" Dr. Meena Seshamani, the top official overseeing Medicare, told reporters.",
      "It is unclear when the proposal would take effect in state Medicaid programs.",
      "Centers for Medicare and Medicaid officials said they are inviting\u00a0public comment\u00a0on when states should be required to cover the costly medications.\"States are also feeling substantial state budget pressure and we are doing our part to make sure patients, Medicaid enrollees all across the country can get access,\" Dan Tsai, the agency's top Medicaid official, told reporters.",
      "Over the next decade, the proposal would cost the federal government $11 billion and states $3.8 billion, they estimated.\"We would urge drug manufacturers to do their part as well, make sure they're thinking about offering fair, appropriate prices to the Medicaid program,\" Tsai said.",
      "The path forward in new administration is unclear",
      "While it's unclear where Trump himself stands on coverage of the weight-loss drugs, his allies and Cabinet picks who have vowed to cut government spending could balk at the upfront price tag",
      "Medicare has been barred from offering the drugs under a decades-old law that prohibits the government-backed insurance program from covering weight-loss products. The rule proposed by the Biden administration, however, would recognize obesity as a disease that can be treated with the help of the drugs.",
      "Kennedy, who as Trump's nominee for HHS secretary is subject to Senate confirmation, has railed against the drugs' popularity. In speeches and on social media, he's said the U.S. shouldn't cover the drugs through Medicaid or Medicare. Instead, he supports a broad expansion of coverage for healthier foods and gym memberships.",
      "\"For half the price of Ozempic, we could purchase regeneratively raised, organic food for every American, three meals a day and a gym membership, for every obese American,\" Kennedy said to a group of federal lawmakers during a roundtable earlier this year.",

    "summary": "Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, who has faced restrictions on social media platforms because of his views, was a critic of pandemic lockdowns and vaccine mandates.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump has chosen health economist Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, a critic of pandemic lockdowns and vaccine mandates, to lead the National Institutes of Health, the nation's leading medical research agency.",
      "Trump, in a statement Tuesday evening, said Bhattacharya, a 56-year-old physician and professor at Stanford University School of Medicine, will work in cooperation with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., his pick to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, \"to direct the Nation's Medical Research, and to make important discoveries that will improve Health, and save lives.\"",
      "\"Together, Jay and RFK Jr. will restore the NIH to a Gold Standard of Medical Research as they examine the underlying causes of, and solutions to, America's biggest Health challenges, including our Crisis of Chronic Illness and Disease,\" he wrote.",
      "The decision to choose Bhattacharya for the post is yet another reminder of the ongoing impact of the COVID pandemic on the politics on public health.",
      "Bhattacharya was one of three authors of the Great Barrington Declaration, an October 2020 open letter maintaining that lockdowns were causing irreparable harm.",
      "The document \u2014 which came before the availability of COVID-19 vaccines and during the first Trump administration \u2014 promoted \"herd immunity,\" the idea that people at low risk should live normally while building up immunity to COVID-19 through infection. Protection should focus instead on people at higher risk, the document said.",
      "\"I think the lockdowns were the single biggest public health mistake,\" Bhattacharya said in March 2021 during a panel discussion convened by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.",
      "The Great Barrington Declaration was embraced by some in the first Trump administration, even as it was widely denounced by disease experts. Then-NIH director Dr. Francis Collins called it dangerous and \"not mainstream science.\"",
      "His nomination would need to be approved by the Senate.",
      "Trump on Tuesday also announced that Jim O'Neill, a former HHS official, will serve as deputy secretary of the sprawling agency. Trump said O'Neill \"will oversee all operations and improve Management, Transparency, and Accountability to, Make America Healthy Again,\" the president-elect announced.",
      "O'Neill is the only one of Trump's health picks so far who brings previous experience working inside the bureaucracy to the job. Trump's previous choices to lead public health agencies \u2014 including Kennedy, Dr. Mehmet Oz for Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services administrator and Dr. Marty Makary for Food and Drug Administration commissioner \u2014 have all been Washington outsiders who are vowing to shake up the agencies.",
      "Bhattacharya, who faced restrictions on social media platforms because of his views, was also a plaintiff in Murthy v. Missouri, a Supreme Court case contending that federal officials improperly suppressed conservative views on social media as part of their efforts to combat misinformation. The Supreme Court sided with the Biden administration in that case.",
      "After Elon Musk acquired Twitter in 2022, he invited Bhattacharya to the company's headquarters to learn more about how his views had been restricted on the platform, which Musk renamed X. More recently, Bhattacharya has posted on X about scientists leaving the site and joining the alternative site Bluesky, mocking Bluesky as \"their own little echo chamber.\"",
      "Bhattacharya has argued that vaccine mandates that barred unvaccinated people from activities and workplaces undermined Americans' trust in the public health system.",
      "He is a former research fellow at the Hoover Institution and an economist at the RAND Corporation.",
      "The National Institutes of Health falls under HHS, which Trump has nominated Kennedy to oversee. The NIH's $48 billion budget funds medical research on vaccines, cancer and other diseases through competitive grants to researchers at institutions across the nation. The agency also conducts its own research with thousands of scientists working at NIH labs in Bethesda, Maryland.",
      "Among advances that were supported by NIH money are a medication for opioid addiction, a vaccine to prevent cervical cancer, many new cancer drugs and the speedy development of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines.",

      "Alexander Smirnov was an FBI informant for about a decade, providing information to federal investigators in what his defense attorneys claimed in court filings demonstrated an \"undivided, years-long loyalty to the United States.\"",
      "But Weiss \u2014 the Trump-appointed Delaware U.S. attorney who was kept on during the Biden administration and later elevated to the role of special counsel by Attorney General Merrick Garland to continue the Hunter Biden probes \u2014 alleged in a February 2024 indictment that Smirnov illegally made false claims to FBI handlers about Hunter and Mr. Biden that dated back to 2020.",
      "Smirnov was accused of lying to investigators when he told them the two Bidens had each accepted $5 million from the Ukrainian energy company Burisma. The claims \"were false, as the Defendant knew,\" according to the charging documents filed against him.",
      "Smirnov, who court records say was born in Ukraine, pleaded not guilty to the charges and in court filings, his defense team has accused prosecutors of charging their client \"as a result of the rejection of Hunter Biden's plea resolutions.\" He remains in pretrial detention pending trial.",
      "On Nov. 21, just weeks before he was set to go to trial on Dec. 3, federal prosecutors in Weiss' office filed a little-noticed indictment in a separate case against Smirnov, alleging he had illegally concealed from the IRS millions of dollars in income between 2020 and 2022.",
      "Court records alleged Smirnov spent unreported income on a Las Vegas apartment, a Bentley and payments on credit card debt. Prosecutors did not name the alleged source of the funds, but the dates and amounts of his payments to him from a single company identified in their filing as \"Company 1\" coincide with payments they alleged Smirnov received from the Economic Transformation Technologies Corporation, which was named in court records filed in Smirnov's other case. The new charges do not indicate any wrongdoing by Economic Transformation Technologies Corporation. Other income came from an unnamed individual, the new indictment said.",
      "\"In order to conceal the millions of dollars he received in income in 2020, 2021 and 2022, the Defendant created and filed false Forms 1040, U.S. Individual Income Tax Returns, for himself and in Domestic Partner's name that included false and fictitious income and expenses,\" the 27-page indictment filed last week said.",
      "According to newly published court records, the judge overseeing Weiss' first case against Smirnov \u2014 District Court Judge Otis Wright \u2014 held a status conference on Tuesday and delayed his upcoming trial on the false statements charges until January.",

      "A spokesperson for Weiss declined to comment when contacted by CBS News.",
      "Prosecutors alleged earlier this year that Smirnov's false claims against the Bidens were memorialized in an FBI document known as an FD 1023. Congressional Republicans previously pointed to that document's allegations of bribery as evidence of misdeeds and fought with the FBI to publicly release the document, which investigators now say contained fake allegations.",

      "In court records filed earlier this year, the special counsel said Smirnov told the FBI about contacts with foreign intelligence officials, \"including Russian intelligence agencies, and has had such contacts recently.\" Defense attorneys in court filings of their own called allegations of Russian ties baseless.",
      "Apart from the specific charges at issue, law enforcement experts told CBS News earlier this year that the mounting questions about Smirnov's truthfulness should trigger an audit of every case in which he was involved. A CBS News investigation published earlier this year revealed that serious doubts about Smirnov's credibility were raised almost a decade ago.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0 A federal appeals court on Tuesday granted special counsel Jack Smith's bid to end the case against President-elect Donald Trump arising from his alleged mishandling of sensitive government documents, effectively bringing to a close the historic and unprecedented case against the nation's former and next president.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit said in a brief order that it had granted Smith's request to dismiss the appeal as to Trump. The special counsel had asked the Atlanta-based court on Monday to drop his effort to revive\u00a0the case, citing Trump's recent victory over Vice President Kamala Harris in the November presidential election and longstanding Justice Department policy that forbids the prosecution of a sitting president.",
      "The district court judge presiding over Trump's case, U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, had ruled earlier this year that the charges should be dismissed because Smith was unlawfully appointed. The special counsel appealed the decision, but asked the 11th Circuit to dismiss his appeal.",
      "\"The American people re-elected President Trump with an overwhelming mandate to make America great again. Today's decision by the DOJ ends the unconstitutional federal cases against President Trump and is a major victory for the rule of law,\" Steven Cheung, Trump's spokesman, said in a statement in response to Smith's request. \"The American people and President Trump want an immediate end to the political weaponization of our justice system and we look forward to uniting our country.\"",
      "In his brief filing\u00a0with the 11th Circuit, Smith cited a separate request to dismiss his other case involving Trump, which involves an alleged scheme to overturn the 2020 election. The special counsel said in that filing submitted to a federal judge in Washington, D.C., that after consultation with the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel, \"the department's position is that the Constitution requires that this case be dismissed before the defendant is inaugurated.\"",
      "The federal judge overseeing the 2020 election case agreed to drop the charges against Trump just hours after Smith filed his request, marking the culmination of that monthslong prosecution against the president-elect. In the documents case, dismissing the appeal as to Trump leaves in place the lower court's order tossing out the charges against him. The appeal will continue as to Trump's two co-defendants, Walt Nauta and Carlos de Oliveira, because unlike the president-elect, \"no principle of temporary immunity applies to them,\" Smith wrote.",
      "\"The special counsel's decision to proceed in this case even after dismissing it against President Trump is an unsurprising tribute to the poor judgment that led to the indictment against Mr. De Oliveira in the first place,\" John Irving, de Oliveira's lawyer, said in a statement. \"Just because you can doesn't mean you should. If they prefer a slow acquittal, that's fine with us.\"",
      "A lawyer for Nauta declined to comment.",
      "Trump became the first former president to face federal charges when a grand jury returned an indictment against him in June 2023. The prosecution came months after FBI agents conducted a court-authorized search of Trump's South Florida property, Mar-a-Lago, in August 2022 and recovered more than 100 documents marked classified that he kept after his first term ended in January 2021.",
      "Following the search, Trump mounted a separate legal battle that brought the appointment of an independent arbiter to sift through the material seized by the FBI, though the 11th Circuit ordered an end to that review in late 2022.",
      "Smith was appointed by Attorney General Merrick Garland in November of that year to take over the federal investigation into Trump's handling of sensitive government records and pursued charges against the president-elect for unlawfully retaining national defense information and attempting to obstruct the Justice Department's probe. Trump was charged alongside two employees, Nauta, an aide, and de Oliveira, the property manager as Mar-a-Lago.",
      "Trump, Nauta and de Oliveira pleaded not guilty to all charges. The president-elect claimed his prosecution was a politically motivated attempt to harm his candidacy in the race for a second term.",
      "Prosecutors used court filings to reveal information about how Trump allegedly stored records containing the nation's secrets at his resort, as well as how he, with his co-defendants, allegedly engaged in a scheme to deceive federal investigators and stymie their probe.",
      "They included photos showing boxes of material stacked on the stage in Mar-a-Lago's ballroom and in a bathroom on the property. Other images taken by the FBI during its August 2022 search show boxes of records in a storage room and in Trump's office, some of which prosecutors said contained highly sensitive information alongside personal keepsakes and other items from his presidency.",
      "Cannon initially set a trial date for May 20, 2024, but she postponed the proceedings weeks before they were set to begin.",
      "The president-elect and his lawyers attempted to have the case against him dismissed on a variety of grounds, claiming he was selectively prosecuted, he was shielded from federal charges by presidential immunity and Smith was appointed in violation of the Constitution.",
      "Trump succeeded in persuading Cannon that the special counsel's appointment and funding for his office were unlawful, and she ordered the case to be dismissed in July.",
      "But Smith appealed the decision to the 11th Circuit. Both he and Trump's lawyers submitted filings with the court presenting their views on Cannon's ruling, though the court had not yet set a date for arguments. It was expected that an eventual decision from the 11th Circuit would wind up before the Supreme Court.",
      "The documents case was one of two that Smith brought against Trump. In Washington, he faced charges related to an alleged attempt to subvert the transfer of power after the 2020 presidential election. The president-elect pleaded not guilty to the four counts he faced there, and the dispute landed before the Supreme Court as Trump argued presidential immunity shielded him from prosecution.",
      "He was also charged by local prosecutors in separate cases in Fulton County, Georgia, and New York City. The New York case stemmed from a hush-money payment made to adult film actor Stormy Daniels after the 2016 election, and a jury found Trump guilty of 34 felonies in May, making him the first former president convicted of a crime.",
      "He was set to be sentenced last month in New York, but it was delayed.",
      "The Fulton County case involved an alleged plot by Trump to overturn the results of the 2020 election in Georgia. He pleaded not guilty to charges in the sprawling racketeering case brought by District Attorney Fani Willis. Proceedings had been halted, though, while a state appeals court considered whether Willis should be disqualified from the case. It's unclear how Trump's victory will affect his prosecution in Fulton County.",
      "Trump's bid for a second term loomed over his prosecutions, as it was widely expected his federal cases would be dropped if he succeeded in winning the White House.",
      "Now, Smith has sought to end both of the historic prosecutions of the former and next president.",
      "With both cases settled, Smith is likely to file a final report with the attorney general, as is required by special counsel regulations, and is expected to resign from his post before Trump is sworn into office on Jan. 20, two sources familiar with Smith's plans previously told CBS News. Garland has pledged to publicly release all special counsel reports completed during his tenure \u2014 a commitment he has so far upheld \u2014 and he is likely to do so for Smith's report, too.

    "published": "Tue, 26 Nov 2024 12:42:04 -0500",
    "summary": "Claudia Sheinbaum said Mexico suffered from an influx of weapons smuggled in from the United States, and that drugs were a U.S. problem.",
    "story": [
      "President Claudia Sheinbaum suggested Tuesday that Mexico could retaliate \u2014\u2014\u2014with tariffs of its own, after U.S. President-elect Donald Trump threatened to impose 25% import duties on Mexican goods if the country doesn't stop the flow of drugs and migrants across the border.",
      "Sheinbaum said she was willing to engage in talks on the issues, but said drugs were a U.S. problem.",
      "\"One tariff would be followed by another in response, and so on until we put at risk common businesses,\" Sheinbaum said, referring to U.S. automakers that have plants on both sides of the border.",
      "The tariffs, if implemented,\u00a0could dramatically raise prices\u00a0on everything from gas to automobiles. The U.S. is the largest importer of goods in the world, with Mexico, China and Canada its top three suppliers, according to the most recent Census data.",
      "Sheinbaum said in a letter to Trump, which she read at a news conference Tuesday, that Mexico had done a lot to stem the flow of migrants, noting \"caravans of migrants no longer reach the border.\" However, Mexico's efforts to fight drugs like the deadly synthetic opioid fentanyl \u2014 which is manufactured by Mexican cartels using chemicals imported from China \u2014 have weakened in the last year.",
      "Sheinbaum said Mexico suffered from an influx of weapons smuggled in from the United States, and said the flow of drugs \"is a problem of public health and consumption in your country's society.\"",
      "Sheinbaum also criticized U.S. spending on weapons, saying the money should instead be spent regionally to address the problem of migration. \"If a percentage of what the United States spends on war were dedicated to peace and development, that would address the underlying causes of migration,\" she said.",
      "Sheinbaum's bristly response suggests that Trump faces a much different Mexican president than he did in his first term.",
      "Back in late 2018, former President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador was a charismatic, old-school politician who developed a chummy relationship with Trump. The two were eventually able to strike a bargain in which Mexico helped keep migrants away from the border \u2014 and received other countries' deported migrants \u2014 and Trump backed down on the threats.",
      "But Sheinbaum, who took office Oct. 1, is a stern leftist ideologue trained in radical student protest movements, and appears less willing to pacify or mollify Trump.",
      "\"We negotiate as equals, there is no subordination here, because we are a great nation,\" Sheinbaum said, while adding, \"I think we are going to reach an agreement.\"",
      "But Gabriela Siller, director of economic analysis of the financial group Banco Base, fears the personality clash could escalate things into brinkmanship; Trump clearly hates to lose.",
      "\"Trump may have just tossed the threat out there, as he does,\" Siller said. \"But Mexico's response, that we're going to respond to you with tariffs, that will make Trump really impose them.\"",
      "Brian Peck, adjunct assistant professor of international trade law at USC, recently told CBS News that the new administration could instead use tariffs chiefly as a tool\u00a0for negotiating leverage\u00a0in trade talks.",
      "\"If he doesn't like a certain practice or policy initiative, he can use it as leverage to threaten them,\" Peck told\u00a0CBS News' Carter Evans.",
      "It's not clear how serious Trump's threat is. The U.S.-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement forbids just imposing tariffs on other member countries. And it's not clear whether the economy could even tolerate sudden levies on imports: Auto plants on both sides of the border rely on each other for parts and components, and some production lines could screech to a halt.",
      "\"It is unacceptable and would cause inflation and job losses in Mexico and the United States,\" Sheinbaum said, while offering to talk about the issues. \"If tariffs go up, who will it hurt? General Motors,\" she said.",
      "\"Dialogue is the best path to achieve understanding, peace and prosperity for our two countries,\" Sheinbaum said at the end of the letter to Trump. \"I hope our teams can meet soon.\"",
      "Late Monday, Trump said he would impose a 25% tax on all products entering the country from Canada and Mexico, and an additional 10% tariff on goods from China, as one of his first executive orders. The tariffs, if implemented, could dramatically raise prices for American consumers on everything from gas to automobiles to agricultural products.",
      "Trump made the threats Monday in a pair of posts on his Truth Social site in which he railed against an influx of illegal migrants, even though apprehensions at the southern border have been hovering near four-year lows.",
      "\"On January 20th, as one of my many first Executive Orders, I will sign all necessary documents to charge Mexico and Canada a 25% Tariff on ALL products coming into the United States, and its ridiculous Open Borders,\" he wrote.",
      "He said the new tariffs would remain in place \"until such time as Drugs, in particular Fentanyl, and all Illegal Aliens stop this Invasion of our Country!\"",
      "\"Both Mexico and Canada have the absolute right and power to easily solve this long simmering problem. We hereby demand that they use this power,\" he went on, \"and until such time that they do, it is time for them to pay a very big price!\"",

    "summary": "Walmart is rolling back its diversity, equity and inclusion policies, joining a growing list of major corporations doing the same after coming under attack by conservative activists.",
    "story": [
      "Walmart, the world's largest retailer, is rolling back its diversity, equity and inclusion policies, joining a growing list of major corporations that have done the same after coming under attack by conservative activists.",
      "The changes, confirmed by Walmart on Monday, are sweeping and include everything from not renewing a five-year commitment for an equity racial center set up in 2020 after the police killing of George Floyd to pulling out of a prominent gay rights index. And when it comes to race or gender, Walmart won't be giving priority treatment to suppliers.",
      "Walmart's moves underscore the increasing pressure faced by corporate America as it continues to navigate the fallout from the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in June 2023 ending affirmative action in college admissions. Emboldened by that decision, conservative groups have filed lawsuits making similar arguments about corporations, targeting workplace initiatives such as diversity programs and hiring practices that prioritize historically marginalized groups.",
      "Separately, conservative political commentator and activist Robby Starbuck has been going after corporate DEI policies, calling out individual companies on the social media platform X. Several of those companies have subsequently announced that they are pulling back their initiatives, including Ford, Lowe's, Tractor Supply and Harley-Davidson.",
      "But Walmart, which employs 1.6 million workers in the U.S., is the largest one to do so.",
      "\"This is the biggest win yet for our movement to end wokeness in corporate America,\" Starbuck wrote on X, adding that he'd been in conversation with Walmart.",
      "Walmart confirmed to The Associated Press that it will better monitor its third-party marketplace items to make sure they don't feature sexual and transgender products aimed at minors. That would include chest binders intended for youths who are going through a gender change, the company said.",
      "The Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer will also be reviewing grants to Pride events to make sure it isn't financially supporting sexualized content that may be unsuitable for kids. For example, the company wants to makes sure a family pavilion isn't next to a drag show at a Pride event, the company said.",
      "Additionally, Walmart will no longer consider race and gender as a litmus test to improve diversity when it offers supplier contracts. The company said it didn't have quotas and won't do so going forward. It won't be gathering demographic data when determining financing eligibility for those grants.",
      "Walmart also said it wouldn't renew a racial equity center that was established through a five-year, $100 million philanthropic commitment from the company with a mandate to, according to its website, \"address the root causes of gaps in outcomes experienced by Black and African American people in education, health, finance and criminal justice systems.\"",
      "And it would stop participating in the Human Rights Campaign's annual benchmark index that measures workplace inclusion for LGBTQ+ employees.",
      "\"We've been on a journey and know we aren't perfect, but every decision comes from a place of wanting to foster a sense of belonging, to open doors to opportunities for all our associates, customers and suppliers and to be a Walmart for everyone,\" the company said in a statement.",
      "The changes come soon after an election win by former President Donald Trump, who's criticized DEI initiatives and surrounded himself with conservatives who hold similar views, including his former adviser Stephen Miller, who leads a group called America First Legal that has challenged corporate DEI policies. Trump named Miller to be the deputy chief of policy in his new administration.",
      "A Walmart spokesperson said some of its policy changes have been in progress for a while. For example, it's been moving away from using the word DEI in job titles and communications and started to use the word \"belonging.\" It also started making changes to its supplier program in the aftermath of the Supreme Court affirmative action ruling.",
      "Some have been urging companies to stick with their DEI policies. Last month, a group of Democrats in Congress appealed to the leaders of the Fortune 1000, saying DEI efforts give everyone a fair chance at achieving the American dream.",

    "published": "Tue, 26 Nov 2024 07:31:19 -0500",
    "summary": "Warnings have been popping up on social media urging women who might be considering divorce to \"pull the trigger\" while they still have the option of no-fault divorce.",
    "story": [
      "Married couples across the U.S. have had access to no-fault divorce for more than 50 years, an option many call crucial to supporting domestic abuse victims and key to preventing already crowded family courts from drowning in complicated divorce proceedings.",
      "But some advocates for women worried as old comments from now Vice President-elect JD Vance circulated during the presidential campaign opposing no-fault divorce. And after President-elect Donald Trump and Vance won the election, warnings began popping up on social media urging women who might be considering divorce to \"pull the trigger\" while they still could. Some attorneys posted saying they were seeing a spike in calls from women seeking divorce consultations.",
      "Trump - who is twice-divorced - hasn't championed overhauling the country's divorce laws, but in 2021 Vance lamented that divorce is too easily accessible. Conservative podcasters and others have, as well.",
      "\"We've run this experiment in real time and what we have is a lot of very, very real family dysfunction that's making our kids unhappy,\" Vance said during a speech  at a Christian high school in California, where he criticized people being able to \"shift spouses like they change their underwear.\"",
      "Despite concerns, even those who want to make divorces harder to get say they don't expect big, swift changes. There is no national coordinated effort underway. And states determine their own divorce laws, so national leaders can't change policy.",
      "\"Even in some of the so-called red states, it hasn't gotten anywhere,\" said Beverly Willett, co-chair of the Coalition for Divorce Reform, whose group has unsuccessfully attempted to get states to repeal their no-fault divorce laws.",
      "Mark A. Smith, a political science professor at the University of Washington, said that while many Americans have become accustomed to no-fault divorce being an option, Vance's previous comments on making it more difficult to separate from a spouse could help jumpstart that effort.",
      "\"Even though he's not directly proposing a policy, it's a topic that hasn't gotten a ton of discussion in the last 15 years,\" Smith said. \"And so to have a national profile politician talk that way is noteworthy.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Republican Party platforms in Texas and Nebraska were amended in 2022 to call for the removal of no-fault divorce. Louisiana's Republican Party considered something similar earlier this year but ultimately declined to do so.",
      "A handful of proposals have been introduced in conservative-led statehouses over the years, but all immediately stalled after they were filed.",
      "In January, Oklahoma Republican Sen. Dusty Deevers introduced legislation that would have kept married couples from filing for divorce on the grounds of incompatibility. Deevers backed the bill after writing a piece declaring no-fault divorce was an \"abolition of marital obligation.\"",
      "Similarly, in South Carolina, two Republican lawmakers in 2023 filed a bill that would have required both spouses to file for a no-fault divorce application rather than just one. And in South Dakota, a Republican lawmaker has attempted to remove irreconcilable difference as grounds for divorce since 2020.",
      "None of the sponsors of these bills responded to interview requests from The Associated Press. All are members of their state's conservative Freedom Caucus.",
      "Alarms sounded",
      "Nevertheless, some Democratic lawmakers say they remain worried about the future of no-fault divorce. They point to the U.S. Supreme Court overturning the constitutional right to abortion in 2022 as an example of a long-accepted option that was revoked through a decades-long effort.",
      "\"When you choose to be silent, you allow for this to creep in,\" said Democratic South Dakota Rep. Linda Duba. \"These are the bills that gain a foothold because you choose to be silent.\"",
      "Before California became the first state to adopt a no-fault divorce option in 1969, married couples had to prove their spouse had violated one of the approved \"faults\" outlined in their state's divorce law or risk a judge denying their divorce, said Joanna Grossman, a law professor at Southern Methodist University in Dallas. Qualified reasons varied from state to state, but largely included infidelity, incarceration or abandonment.",
      "The system was a particular burden on domestic violence victims, often times women, who could be stuck in dangerous marriages while trying to prove their partner's abuse in court through expensive and lengthy legal proceedings.",
      "\"(Even) if there was any evidence that the couple both wanted to get divorced, that was supposed to be denied because divorce was not something you got because you wanted it, it was something you got because you've been wronged in a way that the state thought was significant,\" Grossman said.",
      "\"Extremely worried\"",
      "To date, every state in the U.S. has adopted a no-fault divorce option. However, 33 states still have a list of approved \"faults\" to file as grounds for divorce - ranging from adultery to felony conviction. In 17 states, married people only have the option of choosing no-fault divorce to end their marriages.",
      "Calls to reform no-fault divorce have remained fairly silent until the late 1990s, when concern pushed by former President George Bush's administration over the country's divorce rate sparked a brief movement for states to adopt \"covenant marriages.\" The option didn't replace a state's no-fault divorce law, but provided an option for couples that carried counseling requirements and strict exceptions for divorce.",
      "Louisiana was the first state to embrace covenant marriage options, but the effort largely stopped after Arizona and Arkansas followed suit.",
      "Christian F. Nunes, president of the National Organization for Women, said she is \"extremely worried\" about the possibility of no-fault divorce being removed with the incoming Trump administration, Republican-controlled Congress and wide range of conservative state leaders.",
      "\"With so many states focusing on a misogynistic legislative agenda, this will turn back the clocks on women's rights even more,\" Nunes said in a statement. \"This is why removing 'no fault' divorce is another way for the government to control women, their bodies, and their lives. Eliminating no-fault divorce is also a backdoor way of eliminating gay marriage, since this implies that a marriage is only between a man and a woman.\"",
      "With Trump's reelection, Willett, whose group opposes no-fault divorce, said she's cautiously optimistic that the political tide could change.",
      "\"Was what he said an indication of things to come? I don't know,\" Willett said. \"It's a good thing but it's certainly not anything that has been really discussed other than a few high profile conservatives who talk about it.\""

    "published": "Tue, 26 Nov 2024 03:22:25 -0500",
    "summary": "Special counsel Jack Smith asked a federal judge to toss out the charges against President-elect Donald Trump in the case stemming from the 2020 election.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The federal judge overseeing the 2020 election case against former President Donald Trump agreed to dismiss the charges following a request from special counsel Jack Smith, bringing to a close the historic and unprecedented prosecution of the nation's 45th and 47th president.",
      "U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan granted Smith's request just hours after he said in a filing that he is seeking to close Trump's case because Justice Department policy forbids the prosecution of a sitting president.",
      "\"After careful consideration, the department has determined that [the Office of Legal Counsel's] prior opinions concerning the Constitution's prohibition on federal indictment and prosecution of a sitting president apply to this situation and that as a result this prosecution must be dismissed before the defendant is inaugurated,\" Smith wrote\u00a0in his filing. \"That prohibition is categorical and does not turn on the gravity of the crimes charged, the strength of the government's proof, or the merits of the prosecution, which the government stands fully behind.\"",
      "The special counsel noted the historic nature of Trump's prosecution and subsequent election to the presidency, writing that the \"department and the country have never faced the circumstance here, where a federal indictment against a private citizen has been returned by a grand jury and a criminal prosecution is already underway when the defendant is elected president.\"",
      "But after consultation with the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel, the special counsel said \"the department's position is that the Constitution requires that this case be dismissed before the defendant is inaugurated.\"",
      "Smith said in his six-page motion that he conferred with Trump's lawyers, and they did not object to the request to drop the case. The special counse sought to dismiss the case without prejudice, meaning prosecutors could decide to charge Trump again after he leaves office in January 2029.",
      "Chutkan said in a brief opinion that dismissing the case without prejudice is \"appropriate\" in part because it is \"consistent with the government's understanding that the immunity afforded to a sitting president is temporary, expiring when they leave office.\"",
      "In response to Smith's request to drop the charges, Steven Cheung, Trump's spokesman, said in a statement, \"The American people re-elected President Trump with an overwhelming mandate to make America great again. Today's decision by the DOJ ends the unconstitutional federal cases against President Trump and is a major victory for the rule of law. The American people and President Trump want an immediate end to the political weaponization of our justice system and we look forward to uniting our country.\"",
      "The judge's approval of Smith's request to dismiss the case and toss the four federal counts against the president-elect was expected. The special counsel is also likely to submit a final report to the attorney general and resign before Trump takes office. Smith's request was not a surprise, as he and the Justice Department were in talks about how to wind down the prosecution after Trump was elected to a second term earlier this month. The special counsel consulted with Attorney General Merrick Garland about the decision to drop the case.",
      "Smith was appointed special counsel by Attorney General Merrick Garland in November 2022 after Trump announced his third run for the White House. He took over two ongoing federal probes into Trump's conduct, one focused on his alleged mishandling of classified records and the other tied to the 2020 election.",
      "After a monthslong grand jury investigation, Smith obtained a four-count indictment against Trump that alleged he sought to resist the peaceful transfer of power following Joe Biden's electoral victory and allegedly engaged in a criminal scheme in the process. Trump pleaded not guilty to all charges and denied wrongdoing.",
      "The indictment laid out a sprawling scheme in which prosecutors accused Trump and his unnamed co-conspirators of working to undermine the legitimacy of the election results and halt the certification of the Electoral College votes in a bid to stay in power.",
      "Trump's legal team successfully delayed the case well into this year after they claimed Trump was immune from prosecution because he was president at the time the alleged conduct took place. Chutkan and a D.C. appeals court panel rejected the argument of presidential immunity. The case was put on hold as the Supreme Court then took up the matter.",
      "Ultimately, the high court issued a landmark decision in the case, ruling in July that presidents are immune from federal criminal prosecution for actions taken in their official capacity as president of the United States. The Supreme Court's 6-3 opinion written by Chief Justice John Roberts allowed for charges to be filed when a president acted in an unofficial or personal capacity.",
      "Some of the alleged conduct included in Smith's 2023 indictment was disqualified from the case and the special counsel later secured a superseding indictment against Trump in an attempt to contour the charges to the Supreme Court's ruling. Trump pleaded not guilty to the new indictment earlier in September.",
      "Before Smith asked her to dismiss the case, Chutkan was in the midst of applying the Supreme Court's immunity decision to the case. In October, she made public a key filing from Smith that provided a comprehensive look at the evidence prosecutors amassed in their case against Trump. The special counsel and his team said that when he lost the 2020 race, Trump \"resorted to crimes\" to hold onto power.",
      "The filing described how Trump and his aides allegedly planned to challenge the results of the 2020 election well before Election Day and pressured then-Vice President Mike Pence to reject electoral votes on Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "In one striking passage, prosecutors said Trump replied, \"So what?\" when he was told that Pence could be in danger at the Capitol, where Congress had convened to tally state electoral votes. A mob of Trump's supporters breached the building, leading to the evacuation of Pence and lawmakers.",
      "The White House declined to comment on Smith's filing to dismiss the charges.",
      "\"I'd refer you to the Department of Justice, and I would just underline that the president is proud to have restored the independence of the Department of Justice when it comes to critical matters \u2014 criminal matters,\" White House spokesman Andrew Bates said.",
      "The special counsel made a similar request to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, where judges were considering whether Smith's other case against Trump \u2014 dealing with classified documents \u2014 should be revived after a Florida federal judge dismissed the case in July. Judge Aileen Cannon ruled Smith was unlawfully appointed to the role of special counsel by Garland and as a result, the case against Trump was invalid. The Justice Department appealed her ruling.",
      "In addition to the two federal cases, Trump was charged by local prosecutors in separate cases in Fulton County, Georgia, and New York City. The New York case stemmed from a hush-money payment made to adult film actor Stormy Daniels after the 2016 election, and a jury found Trump guilty of 34 felonies in May, making him the first former president convicted of a crime.",
      "He was set to be sentenced last month in New York, but it was delayed following the election. Trump pleaded not guilty to the charges brought against him in the sprawling racketeering case in Fulton County, which is related to an alleged effort to overturn the results of the 2020 election in Georgia.",
      "Trump's bid for a second term loomed over his prosecutions, as it was widely expected his federal cases would be dropped if he succeeded in winning the White House.",
      "Now, with both of Smith's cases closer to being settled, he is likely to file a final report with the attorney general, as is required by special counsel regulations, and is expected to resign from his post before Trump is sworn into office on Jan. 20, 2025, two sources familiar with Smith's plans previously told CBS News. Garland pledged to publicly release all special counsel reports completed during his tenure \u2014 a commitment he has so far upheld \u2014 and he is likely to do so in the Smith cases, too. Prior special counsels have testified before Congress about their reports, and Smith could, as well.",
      "Should the public release of Smith's report stall for any reason and be delayed into the Trump administration, the odds of its disclosure become increasingly slim, since the president-elect has said he intends to nominate many of his top defense attorneys to leadership roles within the Justice Department.",
      "Todd Blanche and Emil Bove, who defended Trump in the two federal cases and other matters in New York, are set to serve as deputy attorney general and principal associate deputy attorney general respectively, two powerful posts within the Justice Department. Trump has said he will nominate former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi for the top job as attorney general.",

    "summary": "Republicans vying for jobs allege Trump transition aide Boris Epshteyn has been mixing private consulting with his transition role.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump's transition team is grappling with internal strife over the alleged conduct of a senior and longtime adviser, Boris Epshteyn, who has been accused by at least one Republican politician of trying to profit personally from his ability to influence Trump's Cabinet picks.",
      "Former Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens submitted a sworn declaration to the transition team alleging that \"Mr. Epshteyn's overall tone and behavior gave me the impression of an implicit expectation to engage in business dealings with him before he would advocate for or suggest my appointment to the President.\"",
      "\"This created a sense of unease and pressure on my part,\" said the declaration, which was first obtained by the online publication Just the News and shared with CBS News. Greitens and his attorney, Timothy Parlatore, authenticated the one-page document to CBS News.",
      "Parlatore, who has been critical of Epshteyn in the past, confirmed to CBS News that the declaration was submitted in connection with an internal investigation that is being conducted by David Warrington, who served as general counsel to the Trump campaign. According to Parlatore, Warrington interviewed Greitens about his interaction with Epshteyn late last week and then asked Greitens to submit the declaration. Warrington has not responded to a request for comment.",
      "\"It was important to me to protect the president because I was concerned about the ethics of what was happening,\" Greitens told CBS News. \"Very specifically, I was concerned that there was an offer to advance a nomination in return for financial payments.\"",
      "Epshteyn told CBS News he is \"honored to work for President Trump and with his team.\"",
      "\"These fake claims are false and defamatory and will not distract us from Making America Great Again,\" Epshteyn said in his statement.",
      "The Trump transition team confirmed it had conducted a review and now intended to move on from the issue,\u00a0as first reported by CNN. \"As is standard practice, a broad review of the campaign's consulting agreements has been conducted and completed, including as to Boris, among others,\" said transition spokesman Steven Cheung. \"We are now moving ahead together as a team to help President Trump Make America Great Again.\"",
      "Epshteyn has been a near-constant figure by Trump's side in recent years, buoying him on air and helping to coordinate his multiple legal teams behind closed doors. Those teams have had unquestionable success, impeding Trump's two federal criminal cases before they could get to trial, and stymying a state case against Trump in Georgia. Trump was convicted in the one case that went to trial, in New York, but recently the sentencing in that case was postponed indefinitely. On Monday, special counsel Jack Smith asked a federal district court to dismiss the charges against Trump stemming from an alleged scheme to subvert the transfer of power after the 2020 election, and he also sought to end his bid to revive the case against Trump arising from his alleged mishandling of sensitive government documents.",
      "A native of Russia who emigrated to New Jersey with his family when he was 11, Epshteyn was brought into the Trump sphere by Georgetown University classmate Eric Trump. He started as a low-level staffer during Trump's first run for office and was able to parlay that into a junior position on the White House communications team. Two months later he abruptly resigned over circumstances that remain unclear, but by then he had managed to win over Trump as his loyal confidant and fixer.",
      "Eric Trump said Monday in a Fox News interview that \"I've known Boris for years, and I've never known him to be anything but a good human being.\" But he implied the allegations could have consequences for Epshteyn.",
      "\"I certainly hope the reporting is false and I can also tell you if it's true, you know, the person will probably no longer be around,\" Eric Trump said.",
      "Epshteyn supporters praise his ability to execute orders and resolve problems, which they attribute to a frenetic energy, his bulldog personality and a cunning understanding of the political dynamics of Trump's advisers. Epshteyn has become so close to Trump that the president-elect jokingly refers to Epshteyn as \"my psychiatrist,\" The New York Times first noted. According to multiple sources, Epshteyn's access to Trump is at times only rivaled by family members.",
      "In the weeks since Trump won his second term as president, Epshteyn has been a mainstay in discussions about filling out the Cabinet. The New York Times reported Epshteyn played a critical role in recommending former Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz to serve as attorney general, a bid that ultimately failed to win favor and was withdrawn.",
      "The status of Epshteyn's consulting business while assisting in the transition is unclear. But prior to the 2024 election, the business appeared to be robust. A review of publicly available records indicate his firm has been paid more than $1 million from Trump's campaigns and aligned PACs since 2020, and another $1.2 million by other campaigns.",
      "While there is nothing new about political consultants \u2014 on both sides of the aisle \u2014 using their connections, interviews with about two dozen advisers, lawyers and allies of Trump reveal Epshteyn's political consulting work has bred both praise and resentment.",
      "CBS News spoke with more than half a dozen Republican candidates who have engaged with Epshteyn. Many described his pitch, offering an array of services, including \"strategic advice\" on messaging and boosting a candidate's social media presence. But nearly everyone interviewed said his access to Trump had allure.",
      "Ahead in the polls as his Republican Senate primary approached in 2022, Don Bolduc wanted to make sure Trump didn't play spoiler by endorsing one of his New Hampshire rivals. Bolduc said he turned to Epshteyn \"to run interference inside the Trump circle.\"",
      "A service like that doesn't come cheap. \"I thought $100,000 was a lot of money for what we were asking, but that's what was paid,\" said Bolduc, who added \"no guarantee\" was given by Epshteyn that Trump wouldn't endorse a rival.",
      "Bolduc won his primary after Trump stayed neutral. He told CBS News that while it appeared to him that he got what he paid for, the experience left him feeling disillusioned with the transactional side of elections. After the campaign ended in general election defeat, Bolduc said he chose to leave politics for good.",
      "\"There's nothing honorable about politics,\" said Bolduc, a retired Army brigadier general. After his failed Senate race, Bolduc enrolled in a police academy and became a rookie small-town cop at age 60.",
      "After publication, Rick Wiley, a senior adviser on Bolduc's campaign, told CBS News that Epshteyn \"was retained by General Bolduc's campaign for strategic media consulting with conservative media outlets, and he delivered.\"",
      "Wiley listed three shows that Bolduc appeared on and said they enabled \"his campaign to reach supporters and voters throughout New Hampshire and across the country.\"",
      "Among those who hired Epshteyn for his campaign services in the past was Greitens, who served as Missouri governor during a portion of the first Trump term. In the weeks since Trump won reelection, Greitens said he contacted Epshteyn for assistance to be considered for an appointment as U.S. Navy secretary.",
      "\"During the conversation, despite the absence of an explicit offer, Mr. Epshteyn's comments and demeanor suggested that he might entertain offering a position in the administration in exchange for financial consideration, but such an offer would happen in a subsequent discussion,\" Greitens wrote. \"He stated that there would be 'time for that later' and that it was 'not time for that yet.'\"",
      "\"Mr. Epshteyn's overall tone and behavior gave me the impression of an implicit expectation to engage in business dealings with him before he would advocate for or suggest my appointment to the President,\" Greitens wrote. \"This created a sense of unease and pressure on my part.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 27 Nov 2024 11:46:48 -0500",
    "summary": "Scientists now have a clearer picture of Camp Century, an abandoned U.S. military base long hidden under the ice in Greenland, thanks to a NASA research team's good luck.",
    "story": [
      "As NASA scientist Chad Greene flew over northern Greenland with a team of engineers in April, they never expected their radar to find something manmade buried deep within the ice. Greene and his team were flying above the Greenland Ice Sheet on a NASA Gulfstream III plane, scanning the barren expanse of ice that's more than a mile deep in some areas, when their radar instrument picked up something unusual.",
      "\"We didn't know what it was at first,\" Greene said in a statement released by NASA's Earth Observatory this week, along with new images of the discovery. \"We were looking for the bed of the ice and out pops Camp Century.\"",
      "It turns out the team had stumbled upon an abandoned Cold War-era military base built by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in 1959. Nicknamed the \"city under the ice,\" the compound consists of a network of tunnels carved into the ice sheet. It was abandoned in 1967 and, over time, became buried about 100 feet below the surface as snow and ice accumulated.",
      "The base was built as part of Project Iceworm, a then-secret plan to experiment with building a missile launch site under the Greenland Ice Sheet during the Cold War, when tension soared between the U.S. and the then-Soviet Union. Camp Century, a remote, nuclear-powered installation, was built to study the feasibility of such a project, but it was never realized and the base was decommissioned under the assumption it would be buried forever under the ice.",
      "While the \"city under the ice\" had been picked up by previous radar scans, the instruments used on the NASA flight in April provided a more detailed, if unexpected, survey.",
      "\"In the new data, individual structures in the secret city are visible in a way that they've never been seen before,\" said Greene, who works with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.",
      "Past scans had used a type of radar that points straight down at the ground and produces a two-dimensional scan of structures buried beneath the ice. Greene's flight used NASA's Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar, which is able to produce maps with \"more dimensionality,\" according to the agency.",
      "A photo released by NASA on Monday showed the features of the base hidden deep under the ice, appearing as anomalies near the base of the ice sheet.",
      "\"Scientists have used maps acquired with conventional radar to corroborate estimates of Camp Century's depth \u2014 part of an\u00a0effort to estimate\u00a0when melting and thinning of the ice sheet could\u00a0re-expose the camp\u00a0and any remaining biological, chemical, and radioactive waste that was buried along with it,\" NASA's Earth Observatory said in its article this week. \"The scientific utility of the new UAVSAR image of Camp Century remains to be seen; for now, it remains a novel curiosity acquired by chance.\"",
      "A 2016 study of the abandoned base suggested that the facility could no longer be considered \"preserved for eternity,\" due to climate change increasing the rate at which Arctic ice is melting.",
      "CBS News' Walter Cronkite visited Camp Century for a tour of the still-under-construction facility for a program that aired in 1961. The camp's commander, Captain Tom Evans, explained to him that the goals of the program were three-fold: \"The first one is to test out the number of promising new concepts of polar construction. And the second one is to provide a really practical field test of this new nuclear plant. And, finally, we're building Camp Century to provide a good base, here, in the interior of Greenland, where the scientists can carry on their R&D activities.\"",
      "The exact nature of that research and development work wasn't discussed in Cronkite's report for the CBS documentary show \"The Twentieth Century.\" \u00a0(An abridged version of that report can be viewed at the link above.)",
      "Speaking with 60 Minutes in 2016, as that show revisited Cronkite's decades-old trip to Camp Century, producer Daniel Ruetenik said the trip was fascinating, and he marveled at the evolution of human interest in the vast, frozen expanse of the Greenland Ice Sheet.",
      "\"At the time [of Camp Century], the Cold War was considered to be the greatest threat to humanity,\" Ruetenik said. \"And now, the area has become a destination for climate scientists trying to study changes in the environment. So, it has a second purpose now.\"",

    "summary": "Forensic pathologists hope advanced DNA testing technology will enable them to attach names to all the unidentified people at the Honolulu Medical Examiner's Office.",
    "story": [
      "Some may have been lost hikers, runaway children, or wanderers.",
      "One thing connects the 58 or so remains at the Honolulu Medical Examiner's Office found with no identification card and no next of kin to claim them: They remain nameless.",
      "Forensic pathologists hope advanced DNA testing technology will enable them to attach names to all of the agency's unidentified people. But for now, five cases - all children and teens - have been sent for additional testing thanks to a $50,000 grant from Texas-based cold case resolution company Othram.",
      "They include the partial skeleton of a teenager found in Keehi Lagoon near the Daniel K. Inouye International Airport in 2002; parts of the body of a 7- to 10-year-old boy discovered in Waianae in 2000; six fingers of a girl under the age of 4 who was found in Honolulu in 2012; and the skeletal remains of an adolescent found mixed with animal bones inside of a vase purchased in Honolulu in 2015.",
      "The medical examiner's office wouldn't provide additional details about the cases, but medicolegal investigator Charlotte Carter said each represents a person whose family deserves closure.",
      "The five cases sent to Othram for testing were chosen in part because they are juveniles who DNA experts felt had a good chance of being identified through advanced technology.",
      "One case is connected to a 2014 homicide, so the medical examiners office declined to provide information while the investigation continues.",
      "For the case involving the severed fingers, it's unclear whether they belong to a child who died or only suffered trauma to their hands. The other cases could be missing children, a possibility that can't be ruled out until DNA testing is complete.",
      "Carter said she's committed to resolving the other unidentified cases in Honolulu's morgue, especially if DNA testing becomes more accessible and affordable.",
      "\"Anybody who's unidentified deserves to have a chance at being found and identified,\" she said, \"and given their name back.\"",
      "The Honolulu City Council in June accepted the grant from Houston-based Othram, which performs forensic genetic genealogy testing, which combines DNA analysis with genealogy research.",
      "So far, Carter said, none of the samples have been identified.",
      "Sparse information about each case is available publicly through the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System, or NamUs, an organization funded by the National Institute of Justice, which runs a national database of unidentified, missing and unclaimed persons. Representatives with NamUs didn't respond to interview requests.",
      "For some cases, very little is known.",
      "For the skeletal remains found inside the vase in Honolulu, for example, forensic pathologists could not identify an age range, gender, height, weight or year of death - only that the person was still an adolescent.",
      "Other cases include more clues. The young boy found in Waianae in 2000 was suspected to have died that same year. He was recovered without a torso and was missing one or more of his limbs and one or both of his hands.",
      "A forensic artist reconstructed his face, which is included on his NamUs profile, showing what he may have looked like in life. He's listed in the missing children's database as \"John Waianae Doe 2000.\"",
      "Carter said it can take a year or more for DNA testing results to come back.",
      "Thus far, her agency has worked on one successful identification with Othram.",
      "Skeletal remains unearthed by a construction crew in Manoa in 2010 were tested and later identified as belonging to William Hans Holling Jr., a Washington man last seen by friends and family in January 1985. Othram identified Holling's remains and the Honolulu Police Department confirmed his identity in July. No arrests have been made, and the investigation remains open.",
      "Serial killer-rapist identified with the technology",
      "Forensic genetic genealogy testing enables investigators to search for an unidentified person's relatives as a starting point and, with the help of public records, to build a family tree they hope will get them closer to an identification.",
      "The method became popular in criminal investigations in the 2010s after companies like 23andMe and Ancestry came onto the market. Those companies block law enforcement agencies like the FBI from their databases, but investigators can use others, like GEDMatch, which is public-facing, and FamilyTreeDNA, which allows limited access by law enforcement, according to Stephen Kramer, a former FBI in-house counsel and founder of Indago Solutions, a DNA identification company.",
      "While still working with the FBI in 2018, Kramer helped identify the Golden State Killer using forensic genetic genealogy testing. Joseph James DeAngelo Jr., pleaded guilty to 13 murder and rape charges for crimes committed in the 1970s and '80s and has admitted overall to 161 crimes involving 48 victims, including dozens of rapes.",
      "Kramer's company recently identified Albert Lauro as the murder suspect in the 1991 killing of Dana Ireland on the Big Island.",
      "During a presentation to University of Hawaii law students this month, Kramer said genetic analysis of the DNA found on Ireland's body connected him to ancestry information about the suspect. He discovered the man was 83% Filipino, meaning he had three Filipino grandparents. He was also 5% European and Scandinavian, with the rest a mix of Hawaiian, Maori and South Pacific Islander.",
      "That told Kramer the suspect's fourth grandparent was about 30% European and 25% Pacific Islander, he said. Kramer focused on that grandparent because it's generally easier to find public records for people of European descent.",
      "He used records to identify people with this ancestry who had moved to Hawaii and married into Filipino families, leaving very few potential matches. He traced a family tree with three Filipino grandparents and one grandparent descending from Europeans, Scandinavians and Pacific Islanders.",
      "There, he found his suspect.",
      "Investigators followed Lauro by picking up a fork he discarded, which was tested against a DNA sample from Ireland's body.",
      "Detectives later reconfirmed Lauro's identity with a swab when they brought him in for questioning on July 19. Hawaii County Police Chief Ben Moszkowicz later said police didn't have enough probable cause to arrest Lauro for Ireland's murder, and they let him go.",
      "He killed himself four days later.",
      "Factors hindering use of the technology",
      "Lack of funds is the main obstacle to more intensive screening and forensic genetic genealogy on cold cases, Carter said. Each case costs about $10,000, and NamUs pays for Honolulu to send around five cases per year for testing.",
      "The 58 unidentified cases at the Honolulu Medical Examiner's Office date back to about 1966 and include people found under a variety of circumstances.",
      "Many are skeletal remains uncovered at construction sites, Carter said. Others are remains discovered by hikers that likely belonged to people who were homeless and living in encampments in remote parts of the island.",
      "If remains are found on tribal lands, are more than 50 years old or otherwise suspected to be Native Hawaiian, medical examiners contact the Department of Land and Natural Resources' State Historic Preservation Division for confirmation. If the remains are confirmed to be Native Hawaiian, the agency takes custody of them for repatriation.",
      "But some unidentified cases involve people who died fairly recently and, although they were physically recognizable when they were found, still haven't been claimed by family members or matched through any national database.",
      "Forensic pathologists haven't been able to identify a woman fatally struck by a car while trying to cross a road on May 21, 2016, Carter said. She was between 50 and 75 years old, of Asian or mixed Asian ancestry and appeared to be homeless, according to her NamUs profile. Her DNA was run through the national database and Honolulu police collected her fingerprints and sent them to the FBI but received no matches.",
      "A few people have come forward thinking they knew her, but her identity wasn't able to be confirmed, Carter said.",
      "\"That is a person who was a victim of a crime,\" she said. \"But, unfortunately, we're not able to figure out who she is.\"",
      "The most recent case was discovered on Oct. 9 when military personnel doing a training exercise found two femurs inside a camping tent off a hiking trail in Haleiwa.",
      "Carter said her office doesn't track statistics on identifications but said usually one or two unidentified remains are ID'd each year through DNA testing. If a person is identified but their next of kin can't be found, their case is moved to NamUs's unclaimed persons database.",
      "If family members are found, they are able to collect their relative's remains for burial or cremation, Carter said.",
      "She hopes that as technology improves, testing will become more accessible so every case can be resolved.",
      "\"I just think everybody deserves a name and their family deserves an answer,\" she said. \"We have a lot of families who are out there wondering what happened to somebody they love. And now that there's new technologies, we're maybe going to get a little step closer to having more closure or more processing to that new normal for those families.\"",

      "The Sombrero galaxy, named for its resemblance to the Mexican hat, is about 30 million light-years from Earth, NASA said in a news release. The galaxy is surrounded by multiple rings, where stars are formed. At its center is a supermassive black hole that emits a bright jet of light and consumes material from inside the galaxy. Both the rings and black hole are relatively docile, NASA said, and neither creates much solar activity each year.",
      "What sets the galaxy apart is its 2,000 globular clusters, or collections of hundreds of thousands of old stars held together by gravity, according to NASA. These clusters allow astronomers to study stars, since there are thousands of stars in one area. The stars are roughly the same age, but they vary in many other ways, allowing scientists to compare them.",
      "Photos taken by the Webb telescope's Mid-Infrared Instrument, or MIRI, reveals a new texture in the galaxy's outer ring and details the dust along the ring. Such dust is an \"essential building block\" for solar objects, NASA said.",
      "The outer ring had been photographed before, but appeared smooth. The more detailed MIRI images revealed intricate clumps along the rings. The images also show various galaxies in the background, which NASA said can allow astronomers to learn about their properties, including how far away they are from the Sombrero galaxy.",
      "The Webb telescope is set to begin its fourth year of science operations this summer, NASA said. Researchers are able to apply for observation time with the telescope, with a record-breaking 2,377 proposals submitted in October.

      "Canada's antitrust watchdog said Thursday it is suing Google over alleged anticompetitive conduct in the tech giant's online advertising business and wants the company to sell off two of its ad tech services and pay a penalty.",
      "The Competition Bureau said that such action is necessary because an investigation into Google found that the company \"unlawfully\" tied together its ad tech tools to maintain its dominant market position.",
      "The matter is now headed for the Competition Tribunal, a quasi-judicial body that hears cases brought forward by the competition commissioner about non-compliance with the Competition Act.",
      "The bureau is asking the tribunal to order Google to sell its publisher ad server, DoubleClick for Publishers, and its ad exchange, AdX.

      "The proposed breakup, floated in a 23-page document filed this month by the U.S. Department of Justice, calls for sweeping punishments that would include a sale of Google's industry-leading Chrome web browser and impose restrictions to prevent Android from favoring its own search engine.",
      "U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta\u00a0ruled in August\u00a0that \"Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly.\" He outlined a timeline for a trial on proposed remedies next spring and plans to issue a decision by August 2025.",

    "published": "Thu, 28 Nov 2024 08:03:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Australia's full legislature has now passed a bill that will soon ban children under the age of 16 from using most social media platforms.",
    "story": [
      "Australia's Senate passed legislation Wednesday that, once signed by the country's leader who has strongly endorsed it,\u00a0will ban children under the age of 16 from using most social media platforms. The new law will give Australia the tightest restrictions of any democracy in the world on children's use of hugely popular social media apps.",
      "The Senate passed the bill by 34 votes to 19 on Thursday, a day after Australia's House of Representatives\u00a0passed the same bill by a sweeping margin of 102 votes to 13.",
      "Australia's major parties in the House all supported the bill, which will see social media companies such as TikTok, Facebook, Snapchat, Reddit, X and Instagram face fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars ($33 million) for failing to prevent people under 16 from creating accounts on their platforms.",
      "Tech giant Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads, has called for the bill to be delayed. In a\u00a0statement\u00a0posted online Tuesday, Meta said it was \"concerned the government is rushing this legislation without adequate consultation or evidence and there are still many unknowns with respect to its implementation.\"",
      "\"The Government's approach will likely require each app provider to collect personal identification or biometric data from all Australians in order to prevent under 16s from accessing their services, an inefficient and burdensome process for everyone,\" a Meta spokesperson said.",
      "Meta also pointed to a policy it introduced earlier this year on its Instagram platform, Instagram teen accounts, which limits who can contact teenagers via their accounts and attempts to moderate the content that young users see.",
      "In a post shared last week on the X platform that he owns, tech billionaire Elon Musk also condemned the Australian bill and said it seemed to him \"like a backdoor way to control access to the Internet by all Australians.\"",
      "Other independent bodies and non-profit organizations have also taken aim at the bill, voicing concern that young people's human rights could be restricted by it.",
      "The CEO of the Save the Children charity Mat Tinkler said in a statement\u00a0earlier this month that while he welcomes government efforts to protect children from harm online, the solution should be regulating social media companies, rather than introducing a blanket ban.",
      "\"We are asking the government to reconsider this legislative approach and instead use the momentum of this moment to hold the social media giants to account, to demand that they embed safety into their platforms rather than adding it as an afterthought, and to work closely with experts and children and young people themselves to make online spaces safer, as opposed to off-limits,\" Tinkler said.",
      "The Australian Human Rights Commission, an independent government body, expressed its own \"serious reservations\" over the proposed law in an analysis published last week.",
      "\"There are less restrictive alternatives available that could achieve the aim of protecting children and young people from online harms, but without having such a significant negative impact on other human rights. One example of an alternative response would be to place a legal duty of care on social media companies,\" the analysis said. \"We also need to help children and young people to better navigate online spaces by ensuring the national curriculum includes a specific focus on teaching digital literacy and online safety.\"",
      "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese rejected criticism of the proposed law as he\u00a0addressed the parliament\u00a0Monday.",
      "\"There are common sense exemptions. We want to make sure that young people can continue to access health and education related services \u2014 Headspace, YouTube, Google Classroom \u2014 as well as messaging services and online games,\" he said.",
      "The Australian leader added that there would be \"very strong and strict privacy requirements to protect people's personal information, including an obligation to destroy information provided once age has been verified.\"",
      "Despite the criticism, the legislation remains popular among Australians, according to recent polling data.",

      "While Daisy may sound like a human, she is essentially an AI large language model with the character application of a grandma. She functions by listening to the scammers and translating their voice to text. The AI then searches its large database to find an appropriate response, based on the specific scam training it's received, and translates that text response to speech for Daisy to reply. All this happens in seconds with no additional input needed.",
      "The company told CBS they worked with known scam artists to train Daisy and used a tactic called number seeding to get Daisy's phone number added to a list of online \"mugs lists\" \u2014 lists used by scammers targeting U.K. consumers. When they call, Daisy \"has all the time in the world\" to keep the scammers occupied.",

      "\"Daisy is also a reminder that no matter how persuasive someone on the other end of the phone may be, they aren't always who you think they are,\" Mackenzie said.",
      "According to the company's research, 69% of the British public has reported being the target of a scam and the company says it intercepted and blocked over \u00a3250 million ($260 million) in suspected fraudulent transactions last year.",

      "\"We're constantly building our defenses higher and sharing compelling evidence of what these gangs are up to but with no real deterrent in place, these criminals can repeatedly steal free from the threat of prosecution.\"",
      "Fraud is a big problem in the U.S. too. According to TrueCaller, a caller ID and phone blocking app, Americans receive an average of 2.9 billion unwanted or spam calls a month. That's about eight spam calls per user, per month.",
      "Although there is no American version of Daisy, many U.S. phone companies have call screening software that can identify a likely scam or robocall.",
      "On Nov. 13, Google announced a new A.I. feature for its Pixel phone that will go one step further and listen in to calls you make. Google AI will sound an alarm or vibrate if it detects conversation patterns commonly associated with scams, like a caller urgently requesting money transfers or asking for account login information or your bank details.",
      "As phone companies and scammers continue to innovate with AI for their own purposes, the best thing consumers can do is stay vigilant.",
      "\"In terms of tips and tricks, whether you're shopping online, reviewing your emails, or receiving an out-of-the-blue phone call, it's important to always remain vigilant,\" a spokesperson for O2 told CBS. \"We never call customers and ask for their full passwords, one-time passcodes or bank details over the phone, so any call like this is guaranteed to be fraud. Always check links you receive and if something sounds too good to be true, it probably is.\"",

Deepware correctly identified all videos that were longer. According to the company, its detection rate is considered good for the industry at 70%.",

    "story": [
      "Canada's antitrust watchdog said Thursday it is suing Google over alleged anticompetitive conduct in the tech giant's online advertising business and wants the company to sell off two of its ad tech services and pay a penalty.",
      "The Competition Bureau said that such action is necessary because an investigation into Google found that the company \"unlawfully\" tied together its ad tech tools to maintain its dominant market position.",
      "The matter is now headed for the Competition Tribunal, a quasi-judicial body that hears cases brought forward by the competition commissioner about non-compliance with the Competition Act.",
      "The bureau is asking the tribunal to order Google to sell its publisher ad server, DoubleClick for Publishers, and its ad exchange, AdX. It estimates Google holds a market share of 90% in publisher ad servers, 70% in advertiser networks, 60% in demand-side platforms and 50% in ad exchanges.",
      "This dominance, the bureau said, has discouraged competition from rivals, inhibited innovation, inflated advertising costs and reduced publisher revenues.",
      "\"Google has abused its dominant position in online advertising in Canada by engaging in conduct that locks market participants into using its own ad tech tools, excluding competitors, and distorting the competitive process,\" Matthew Boswell, Commissioner of Competition, said in a statement.",
      "Google, however, maintains the online advertising market is a highly competitive sector.",
      "Dan Taylor, Google's vice president of global ads, said in a statement that the bureau's complaint \"ignores the intense competition where ad buyers and sellers have plenty of choice.\"",
      "The statement added that Google intends to defend itself against the allegation.",
      "U.S. regulators want a federal judge to break up Google to prevent the company from continuing to squash competition through its dominant search engine after a court found it had maintained an abusive monopoly over the past decade.",
      "The proposed breakup, floated in a 23-page document filed this month by the U.S. Department of Justice, calls for sweeping punishments that would include a sale of Google's industry-leading Chrome web browser and impose restrictions to prevent Android from favoring its own search engine.",
      "U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta\u00a0ruled in August\u00a0that \"Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly.\" He outlined a timeline for a trial on proposed remedies next spring and plans to issue a decision by August 2025.",
      "Mehta also found that Google in 2021 Google paid about $26 billion to Apple and other partners to ensure its search engine would be the default one on internet browsers.",
      "His ruling stemmed from a Justice Department antitrust lawsuit first filed against Google in October 2020 during the first Trump administration.",
      "Google has already said it plans to appeal Mehta's ruling, but the tech giant must wait until he finalizes a remedy before doing so. The appeals process could take as long as five years, predicts George Hay, a law professor at Cornell University who was the chief economist for the Justice Department's antitrust division for most of the 1970s.",
      "And in January 2023, the Justice Department and several states filed a separate lawsuit against Google claiming it has an illegal monopoly over online advertising.",

    "summary": "Experts warn of fabricated websites posing as retailers to scam shoppers looking for Black Friday deals.",
    "story": [
      "Experts are warning that fraudsters are exploiting Black Friday sales to target U.S. shoppers with fake websites and ads for major brands like IKEA, Wayfair and The North Face, after online scams hit record highs in 2023.",
      "A new report released by threat intelligence company EclecticIQ identified a campaign that operates a sprawling network of fabricated websites using \"Trusted Store\" badges to lure shoppers with fake products.",
      "When consumers attempt to make a purchase, scammers steal their personal and payment information. The consumers are often unaware they were scammed until they fail to receive the product.",
      "Reports of online fraud in 2023 exceeded $12.5 billion in potential losses \u2014   a 22% jump from 2022, according to FBI data. Officials say increasingly sophisticated scams are using tools including AI to power their campaigns.",
      "\"With the way it now seems like everyone is shopping online, reliance on digital platforms has handed these groups a wider attack surface than ever,\" EclecticIQ CEO Cody Barrow told CBS News. \"Unfortunately, it's likely we'll see its impact stretch into next week.\"",
      "The scams",
      "EclecticIQ says it identified at least 8,000 fabricated sites that lure shoppers by offering steep \"deals\" on popular brands. The websites are not affiliated with the brands they appear to represent, but are designed to look like official sites and use URLs that appear authentic.",
      "In one example, a site posing as Wayfair used the URL wayfairtoday.com. Another site used the URL wayfairblackfriday.com. The website was registered in early November and offered fake \"deals\" including an $800 mattress reduced to $39.",
      "CBS News also found an ad appropriating Wayfair's logo that directed users to another counterfeit site posing as the retailer. It was removed from Meta's ad library as of Friday. Wayfair told CBS News that it is actively monitoring scams to ensure customers are protected.",
      "Analysts discovered Mandarin coding and Chinese IP addresses on the sites, indicating that the phishing campaign was operated by a China-based group. IKEA told CBS News it was investigating one of the scam websites using its name that EclecticIQ identified.",
      "Separately, an ad on Facebook and Instagram using The North Face logo routed users to a fabricated site. The ad was removed for policy violations, and The North Face told CBS News it was working with Meta and \"other partners\" to combat scam sites.",
      "\"Scammers use every online platform available to them and constantly evolve their tactics in order to evade enforcement,\" said Meta spokesperson Erin Logan. \"In this instance, our systems proactively detected and removed a number of these ads before they were reported to us.\"",
      "The Federal Trade Commission released data in February that shows online shopping fraud was the second most common type of fraud reported in 2023.",
      "Experts say fraudulent sites and ads remain a pervasive issue. \"Many of the scam sites are short-lived campaigns, so it's an ongoing effort to identify new sites,\" Ilya Volovik, director of Recorded Future Payment Fraud Intelligence, told CBS News. \"Some of the longer living scam sites change their 'sales' advertisement based on a holiday.\"",
      "Tips to protect yourself",
      "Cliff Steinhauer, director of Information Security and Engagement at the National Cybersecurity Alliance, said consumers should take precautions, stay alert when online shopping and act quickly if they believe they have been scammed.",
      "Secure your accounts. Experts recommend setting up multifactor authentication as well as strong and unique passwords for all accounts, including shopping and bank sites.",
      "Avoid unfamiliar links: Be wary of links from unsolicited emails and text messages. Instead, use a search engine to navigate to the retailer's website.",
      "Look for red flags. Be wary of deals that appear too good to be true, as well as websites that use excessive pop-ups and urgent language. If in doubt, leave the site.",
      "Research the website. Look up reviews from other shoppers who have used the site. Visit the Better Business Bureau's website, which maintains a database with ratings for millions of businesses.",
      "If you think you have been the victim of fraud, immediately notify your bank to reverse the charges. You should also change the passwords to your online accounts. File a police report if you experience harassment or repeated attempts to steal more of your information.",
      "Experts also recommend freezing your credit on the three major credit reporting bureaus if your personal information has been compromised through a data breach. This will ensure your identity can't be stolen in the event that scammers obtain your social security number.",

    "summary": "The history of White House Thanksgiving traditions date back more than 160 years to President Abraham Lincoln, who established the national holiday.",
    "story": [
      "The history of White House Thanksgiving traditions date back more than 160 years to President Abraham Lincoln, who established the national holiday.",
      "During his time in office, Lincoln issued a proclamation calling for the celebration of Thanksgiving, triumphing over similar efforts of presidents who came before him, according to the National Park Service.",
      "The official designation of the annual national holiday is due, in part, to writer Sarah Josepha Hale. The NPS notes that in 1827 \u2014 as editor of \"Boston's Ladies Magazine\" \u2014 Hale began writing essays calling for the national holiday. Finally, on Sept. 18, 1863, she wrote to Lincoln asking him to use his presidential powers to create the holiday.",
      "Lincoln obliged and a few weeks later, on Oct. 3, 1863 \u2014 during the height of the Civil War \u2014 he issued the Thanksgiving Proclamation. Ever since, the country has celebrated Thanksgiving Day.",
      "But it wasn't until after a bill passed by Congress on Dec. 26, 1941, that made the holiday fall annually on the fourth Thursday in November.",
      "Thanksgiving at the White House is usually relatively quiet and includes the tradition of pardoning lucky turkeys from their doomed fate of the dinner table.",
      "Presidential turkey pardons",
      "The first turkey pardon ever issued is believed to have been by Lincoln as recorded by White House reporter Noah Brooks in an 1865 dispatch, according to the White House Historical Association.",
      "Lincoln had granted clemency to a turkey named Jack belonging to his son Tad Lincoln, that had originally been slated to be gobbled up at the family's Christmas dinner in 1863.",
      "But the annual practice in which the White House sent pardoned presentation turkeys to a farm to live out their days did not occur until Ronald Reagan's presidency in the 1980s, the WHHA says. In decades prior, presidents would occasionally receive turkeys from the poultry industry and decide not to eat them without an official pardon.",
      "The WHHA notes the practice of sending presentation turkeys to the president became a norm in 1981, and the pardoning ceremonies quickly became a national sensation. By 1989, the annual tradition materialized with President George H.W. Bush \u2014 as documented by the association \u2014 speaking to the pardoned turkey, saying the line his successors still reprise at ceremonies today: \"He's granted a presidential pardon as of right now.\"",
      "On Monday, President Biden issued the final two turkey pardons of his term, to Peach and Blossom, sending them to live out the rest of their lives at Minnesota's Farmamerica as poultry ambassadors for agricultural students.",
      "Gathering with family and friends",
      "Aside from the turkey pardoning spectacle, presidents spend Thanksgiving in the same fashion as households across the country.",
      "The first documented Thanksgiving gathering at the White House dates back to Nov. 28, 1878, according to the WHHA. Then-President Rutherford B. Hayes held a large Thanksgiving dinner gathering with his family and private secretaries, singing hymns in the Red Room afterward and inviting African-American staff to enjoy their own Thanksgiving meal in the State Dining Room.",
      "The tradition has since withstood the test of time. Through economic hardship and times of wars, presidents have carved out time for family. The WHHA notes that President Woodrow Wilson's first Thanksgiving meal during World War I on Nov. 29, 1917, was an economical one \u2014 and one without cranberries.",
      "In recent decades, presidents have taken to the tradition of celebrating the holiday outside the White House at their so-called \"go-to\" vacation spots. President Ronald Reagan in 1985 traveled to the family ranch in Santa Barbara, California.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump spent all but one Thanksgiving of his first term at his Mar-a-Lago estate in West Palm Beach, Florida. President Biden has spent every Thanksgiving during his term with family in Nantucket, Massachusetts as the Biden family has for over 40 years.",

    "story": [
      "In the remotest reaches of Alaska, there's no relying on DoorDash to have\u00a0Thanksgiving dinner\u00a0\u2014 or any dinner \u2014 delivered. But some residents living well off the grid nevertheless have turkeys this holiday, thanks to the Alaska Turkey Bomb.",
      "For the third straight year, a resident named Esther Keim has been flying low and slow in a small plane over rural parts of south-central Alaska, dropping frozen turkeys to those who can't simply run out to the\u00a0grocery store.",
      "Alaska is mostly wilderness, with only about 20% of it accessible by road. In winter, many who live in remote areas rely on small planes or snowmobiles to travel any distance, and frozen rivers can act as makeshift roads.",
      "When Keim was growing up on an Alaska homestead, a family friend would airdrop turkeys to her family and others nearby for the holidays. Other times, the pilot would deliver newspapers, sometimes with a pack of gum inside for Keim.",
      "Her family moved to more urban Alaska nearly 25 years ago but still has the homestead. Using a small plane she had rebuilt with her father, Keim launched her turkey delivery mission a few years back after learning of a family living off the land nearby who had little for Thanksgiving dinner.",
      "\"They were telling me that a squirrel for dinner did not split very far between three people,\" Keim recalled. \"At that moment, I thought ... 'I'm going to airdrop them a turkey.'\"",
      "She decided not to stop there. Her effort has grown by word of mouth and by social media posts. This year, she's delivering 32 frozen turkeys to people living year-round in cabins where there are no roads.",
      "All but two had been delivered by Tuesday, with delivery plans for the last two birds thwarted by Alaska's unpredictable weather.",
      "Among the beneficiaries are Dave and Christina Luce, who live on the Yentna River about 45 miles (72 kilometers) northwest of Anchorage. They have stunning mountain views in every direction, including North America's tallest mountain, Denali, directly to the north. But in the winter it's a 90-minute snowmobile ride to the nearest town, which they do about once a month.",
      "\"I'm 80 years old now, so we make fewer and fewer trips,\" Dave Luce said. \"The adventure has sort of gone out of it.\"",
      "They've known Keim since she was little. The 12-pound (5.44-kilogram) turkey she delivered will provide more than enough for them and a few neighbors.",
      "\"It makes a great Thanksgiving,\" Dave Luce said. \"She's been a real sweetheart, and she's been a real good friend.\"",
      "Keim makes 30 to 40 turkey deliveries yearly, flying as far as 100 miles (161 kilometers) from her base north of Anchorage toward Denali's foothills.",
      "Sometimes she enlists the help of a \"turkey dropper\" to ride along and toss the birds out. Other times, she's the one dropping turkeys while her friend Heidi Hastings pilots her own plane.",
      "Keim buys about 20 turkeys at a time, with the help of donations, usually by people reaching out to her\u00a0through Facebook. She wraps them in plastic garbage bags and lets them sit in the bed of her pickup until she can arrange a flight.",
      "\"Luckily it's cold in Alaska, so I don't have to worry about freezers,\" she said.",
      "She contacts families on social media to let them know of impending deliveries, and then they buzz the house so the homeowners will come outside.",
      "\"We won't drop the turkey until we see them come out of the house or the cabin, because if they don't see it fall, they're not going to know where to look,\" she said.",
      "It can be especially difficult to find the turkey if there's deep snow. A turkey was once missing for five days before it was found, but the only casualty so far has been a lost ham, Keim said.",
      "Keim prefers to drop the turkey on a frozen lake if possible so it's easy to locate.",
      "\"As far as precision and hitting our target, I am definitely not the best aim,\" she joked. \"I've gotten better, but I have never hit a house, a building, person or dog.\"",
      "Her reward is the great responses she gets from families, some who record her dropping the turkeys and send her videos and texts of appreciation.",
      "\"They just think it's so awesome that we throw these things out of the plane,\" Keim said.",
      "Ultimately, she hopes to set up a nonprofit organization to solicit more donations and reach people across a bigger swath of the state. And it doesn't have to stop at turkeys.",
      "\"There's so many kids out in the villages,\" she said. \"It would be cool to maybe add a stuffed animal or something they can hold.\"",

      "\"Swatting\" is the action of falsely calling emergency services in an effort to send armed police officers to a specific address or target in a threatening way.

Trump said the stepped-up duties are necessary to curb the flow of undocumented immigrants and illicit drugs from Mexico and Canada.",
      "\"Blanket 25% tariffs on Canada threatened by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump earlier this week would push Canada into a recession in 2025, cause a sharp spike in inflation and force the Bank of Canada to hold rates higher next year,\" economist Michael Davenport of Oxford Economics said in a report Thursday.",
      "Inflation in Canada would top 7% by mid-2025, while unemployment would approach 8% by year-end, according to the investment research firm. The country's auto, energy and heavy manufacturing industries, which rely on exports to the U.S., would take the biggest hit, he added, noting that the sectors also depend on components from American suppliers.",
      "Canada fired back with duties of its own when Trump slapped tariffs on the country's steel and aluminum exports to the U.S. during his first stint in the White House. Canada targeted U.S. products including whiskey and yogurt, most of which came from one plant in Wisconsin, home state of then-House Speaker Paul Ryan.",
      "Canadian officials say lumping Canada in with Mexico is unfair but say they are ready to make new investments in border security and work with the Trump administration to lower the numbers from Canada.

Salmonella can cause fatal infections in young children, elderly people or other individuals with weakened immune systems.",
      "The recall applies to all sizes of SunFed whole, fresh cucumbers. The produce came packaged in bulk cardboard containers with a \"SunFed\" label, or could also have been displayed in a generic white box or black plastic grate. A sticker on such containers would indicate the cucumbers' grower's name, the company said.",
      "The produce was shipped to customers in the following states: Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin. Some of the recalled cucumbers also could have ended up at retail outlets beyond those states.",
      "The cucumbers were also sold in the Canadian provinces of Alberta, British Columbia, Calgary, Ontario and Saskatchewan.",
      "Consumer are urged to check their own produce against images of the potentially affected products and to refrain from consuming or distributing suspect cucumbers. Recalled products should be destroyed, SunFed said.",
      "\"As soon as we learned of this issue, we immediately acted to protect consumers. We are working closely with authorities and the implicated ranch to determine the possible cause,\" SunFed President Craig Slate said in a statement.",

    "published": "Thu, 28 Nov 2024 15:41:00 -0500",
    "summary": "As the holiday shopping season kicks off, here are five ways retailers try to get consumers to spend.",
    "story": [
      "As shoppers gear up for Black Friday and the holiday shopping season, it can be easy for people to rack up debt that will weigh them down well into the new year. So it pays for consumers to be aware of some of the tactics retailers employ to get them to spend.",
      "For example, most offers that dangle savings in the form of free shipping or a free gift if you spend over a certain amount don't save you money. The practice, called \"spaving,\" or spending more in order to save, rarely benefits consumers, according to personal finance experts.",
      "\"I understand the appeal of getting to checkout and a notification pops up saying spend $10 more to get some perk,\" LendingTree senior economist Jacob Channel told CBS MoneyWatch. \"But 90% of the time when you break it down, it doesn't make sense. You're not actually saving money if you are spending more of it.\"",
      "Here are five tactics retailers use to get you to spend more, according to the U.S. Public Interest Research Group (PIRG), a consumer advocacy group.",
      "Creating a false sense of urgency",
      "The fear of missing out on a good deal can nudge consumers into making impulse buys. Although some offers really are only valid for a limited time, U.S. PIRG identified a number of sellers on Etsy, an e-commerce site for independent craftspeople, who used fake countdown clocks for deals that never expire.",
      "Of 20 top-selling products on the site with countdown timers on deals, 80% of them simply reset when their tickers tickers hit \"0,\" according to a PIRG study.",
      "\"The 'limited' time window may not be as limited as it sounds and the deals not as good as they seem,\" U.S. PIRG's R.J. Cross told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Make your list, comparison shop on those items, and don't get distracted by offers you haven't had the time to think through.\"",
      "Implying scarcity",
      "Online retailers may label products as \"selling fast!\" or, as a consumer is considering a purchase, display how many other consumers are browsing the same item.",
      "\"Retailers and advertisers are always trying to get you to buy more than you need and spend more than you want,\" Cross said in a statement.\u00a0\"Once you know what to look for, you end up chuckling when you see these tactics instead of falling for them.\"",
      "Pricing tricks",
      "Ever wonder why a price reads $4.99 and not simply $5? When sellers round an item's price down, it suggests to a shopper that it is cheaper, PIRG notes. Although $4.99 is only a penny less than $5, a shopper is more likely to fixate on the dollar figure \u2014 $4 \u2014 versus the cents.",
      "Even removing a comma from a high sticker price like $1,200 and displaying it as $1200 can entice someone to pull the trigger, according to PIRG. Meanwhile, breaking the cost of an item down into monthly installments can also make the price seem smaller than it really is, the organization noted.",
      "\"You're still going to have to pay the full cost, and sometimes\u00a0even more in late fees, if you're not careful,\" Cross pointed out.",
      "Dubious testimonials",
      "Many retailers feature online testimonials ostensibly from customers raving about a \"life-changing\" vacuum cleaner or pair of sweatpants. Some of these account are from real customers, while other reviews cannot be trusted because they have been generated by a bot or the company itself, PIRG said.",
      "At bottom, it's a form of peer pressure \u2014 shoppers are subtly induced to think that buying the product will make them as happy as the satisfied customers depicted in the testimonial. In reality, many online reviews are fake, especially as AI bots proliferate.",
      "\"When you look at reviews on a product, don't necessarily take the star ratings for granted. Better to look through the comments and find those that seem real \u2014 that either include a picture of the product or that make a point specific to the product instead of a generic note like 'great product!'\" Cross recommends.",
      "Appeals based on fear",
      "Many marketing pitches and ads suggest that your life will somehow be worse if you don't make a purchase, from being at risk of a home invasion to hair loss. With e-commerce, of course, such messages are tailored to your individual interests and tastes given that website cookies track share your browsing patterns with retailers.",
      "Messages \"about how to fix our perceived flaws only become more capable of finding us at all hours of the day whenever we go online,\" Cross said.",

    "story": [
      "The United States is known as a great melting of people, food and culture. In major cities across the country like New York, Chicago and Los Angeles, people can find nearly any cuisine that fits their heart's desire.",
      "However, as Chef Sean Sherman of the Oglala Lakota Tribe has pointed out in the past, these cities have few - if any - restaurants focused on Indigenous cuisines from the more than 570 recognized American Indian tribes and Alaska Native entities. Each of these tribes has their distinct food traditions.",
      "Eateries like Watecha Bowl, Tocabe: An American Indian Eatery, and Owamni aim to change that by reviving or paying homage to the centuries-old techniques and flavors passed down through generations.",
      "\"We all are on the same mission of food sovereignty,\" Watecha Bowl owner and entrepreneur Lawrence West told CBS News. \"And introducing the world to Native American food.\"",
      "West is a member of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe.",
      "\"The things that I cook and the way that I prepare food is very important because it only represents a certain heritage of people,\" he said.",
      "Restaurant options around the country",
      "West's restaurant Watecha Bowl is a fast-food eatery in Sioux Falls, South Dakota that serves food and flavors from the Lakota Nation.",
      "\"I've had the privilege of feeding people from all over the world,\" West said. \"I've fed people from all 50 states.\"",
      "This year, his restaurant is giving out an Indian taco in exchange for a toy that will be donated to local Native American kids in foster care, according to the Facebook page with 30,000 followers.",
      "Tocabe: An American Indian Eatery is a fast-casual restaurant that serves build-your-own Native American food in Denver, Colorado. Its goal is to \"rebuild the original American food system.\"",
      "Co-founder and President Ben Jacobs, told CBS News that he wants to make his cuisine accessible to everyone while offering a space for Native community members to feel at home. He is a tribal member of the Osage Nation of northeast Oklahoma.",
      "He said he was inspired to open the eatery because Native food did not seem to have a place in the culinary industry in 2008 when it opened. More than 16 years later, Tocabe's food still shares stories of community, culture and identity.",
      "In Minneapolis, Minnesota, Chef Sean Sherman's restaurant Owammni aims to \"decolonize\" the dining experience by purchasing ingredients from Indigenous food producers that would have been found in North America before European colonization.",
      "\"It's unfortunate that this restaurant is unique. Part of the goal is, how do we normalize something that's healthy and Indigenous? We're showing a model that's possible,\" Sherman wrote in a recent blog post on the restaurant's website.",
      "What are the essential dishes to try?",
      "According to West, wojapi is a must-have. The thick berry sauce is one of the most traditional foods of the American plains. It can be used as a dip, on frybread, meat or even as is.",
      "Next is bison, particularly chislic, invented in South Dakota. Third is wild rice with maple syrup.",
      "Frybread is one of the most popular Native American foods. But West said this was embraced out of necessity when the U.S. government forced assimilation with stipends during the land grab and the Trail of Tears.",
      "Jacobs emphasizes, though, that ingredients found in local grocery stores like corn, beans, squash, tomatoes, potatoes, peppers and chillies originate \"right here\" in America. Those are Native foods, too. He said he hopes all Americans should understand where our food comes from and appreciate the story behind it.",
      "The Tacobe Indigenous Marketplace offers common, or not-so-common, ingredients, but they are sourced from Native producers on tribal lands.",
      "A history of food",
      "Native American food is not mainstream for a variety of reasons.",
      "Sherman pointed to the idea of \"manifest destiny,\" or the 19th-century belief that the U.S. was \"destined\" by God to expand across North America to spread democracy and capitalism.",
      "West and Sherman also pointed to \"forced assimilation,\" or the U.S. government's aim to make Native people adopt the customs, values and behaviors of the dominant culture. Laws like The Indian Removal Act of 1830, The Homestead Act of 1862, The Dawes Act of 1887 and others helped make this happen.",
      "According to Britannica, The Trail of Tears refers to the forced relocation of Native people in the Southeastern U.S. during the 1830s. Tribal military records estimate that around 100,000 indigenous people were forcibly removed from their homes.",
      "Policies like these disrupted Native food systems, leading to food insecurity and poor health outcomes, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities\u00a0(CBPP).",
      "The CBPP said the U.S. has made treaties with tribes since the 1700s, promising to provide Indigenous people with rations, giving them food like lard, wheat and flour, which were often unhealthy.",
      "According to the 2023 U.S. Census data, around 1.3% of Americans identify as American Indian or Native American.",
      "Jacobs said after centuries of the American government deconstructing Native food systems, \"we're trying to rebuild.\"",

      "Prosecutors filed two new charges against James Craig last week - solicitation to commit murder as well as solicitation to commit perjury. The charging document does not say who Craig allegedly wanted to have killed but a spokesperson for Aurora police, Joe Moylan, confirmed late Wednesday that the alleged intended victim was an Aurora police detective.",
      "Online court records did not list a lawyer representing Craig as of Thursday. A judge allowed Craig's latest lawyer, Harvey Steinberg, to withdraw from the case Nov. 21, after he cited a professional conflict, just as Craig was about to stand trial for first-degree murder in the death of Angela Craig. Prosecutors filed the two new charges against Craig the following day.",

      "Angela Craig, 43, died in March 2023 of poisoning from cyanide and tetrahydrozoline, the latter a substance found in over-the-counter eye drops, according to the coroner. The couple had been married for 23 years and had six children together.",

      "He is also accused of asking another inmate to plant forged journal entries at the Craig home suggesting that Angela Craig killed herself. The inmate declined, according to court documents. Craig's original defense team pointed out that the inmate only contacted authorities after an initial hearing to review the evidence in the case, which was widely covered by the media.",
      "Prosecutors also allege Craig tried a more elaborate and convoluted approach to put the blame on his wife.

      "The volume chronicles Swift's wildly successful series of concerts, which concludes in December and which last year became the first music tour to gross over $1 billion.",
      "A movie version of the concert she performed on her Eras Tour also shattered box office records. It earned an estimated $96 million domestically over its opening weekend, making it the most successful concert film of all time, according to Comscore.",
      "Where can I buy the book?",
      "The new keepsake, titled \"Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour Book,\" is available only at Target. It hits the retailer's stores on Friday, while it will become available for sale on Target's website\u00a0on Saturday. Swift self-published the book under Taylor Swift Publications.",
      "Target first teased the book launch in an Instagram\u00a0post on Oct. 15. Swift herself also promoted the book in an Instagram\u00a0post that garnered more than 3.6 million likes.",
      "What's in The Eras Tour book?",
      "The 256-page hardcover title, which costs $39.99, includes unreleased photographs of Swift in concert from every period in her meteoric career, according to Target.",
      "The book also documents the production of Swift's epic Eras Tour, which kicked off in August 2023, including \"personal reflections\" written by the artist herself.",
      "In tandem with the book release, Target is also exclusively launching \"The Tortured Poets Department: The Anthology\" album as both a vinyl record and CD. The recording feature 35 tracks, including four acoustic versions of the following songs: \"Fortnight,\" \"Down Bad,\" \"But Daddy I Love Him\" and \"Guilty as Sin?\"",
      "Two million copies of the book have been printed, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing a person familiar with the matter. Assuming the initial print run sells out, it would generate nearly $80 million in sales. Forbes puts Swift's net at worth $1. 6 billion, including $600 million from music royalties and touring, a music catalog valued at an estimated $600 million, and $125 million in real estate.",
      "Swift alone could be a forceful enough economic engine to boost Target. The retailer's latest sales and profit figures fell short of analysts' expectations, while Target lowered its earnings forecast for the current quarter. Analysts say that inflation-weary consumers are after deeper discounts than the retailer can offer, or simply aren't making as many discretionary purchases.",

      "In the wake of a divisive election cycle full of misinformation, many families will be sitting down at the Thanksgiving table with loved ones who may not see eye-to-eye. In North Salem, New York, a seventh-grade media literacy class has been preparing for that challenge by learning how to have difficult but empathetic conversations.",
      "\"One of the most important things to know about media literacy education is that it is not partisan,\" Cynthia Sandler, who's teaching the class, told CBS News. \"It is about asking questions. It is about critical thinking. It is about teaching students and people how to think and not what to think.\"",
      "There is a growing desire for media literacy classes like Sandler's around the country. In the last 15 years, 19 states have added some kind of media literacy standards to their education requirements, according to a\u00a02023 report from Media Literacy Now. The report found at least seven more states have pending legislation on the topic, including New York, home to the largest public school district in the country.",
      "Learning how to have productive conversations",
      "The week before Thanksgiving, Sandler's students role-played scenarios like how to have a productive discussion with someone who doesn't believe the truth and how to tell the difference between fact and opinion.",
      "\"Facts can be proven, like pumpkin pie has less sugar and apple pie has more nutritional value,\" one student said, after acting out an argument about which kind of pie is best.",

      "\"Satire can be a form of saying a joke,\" the student explained. \"But satire can be dangerous, because some people may fall for it. Like you might have gone to buy plane tickets for Florida.\"",
      "While the subject matter isn't as intense as a political debate, the skills the students are learning are easily transferable. Sandler uses an acronym for the method: C.A.R.E.",

Eighty percent of the responding teens said they regularly see conspiracy theories online. Of that group, 80% self-reported believing at least one. These conspiracy theories vary from the earth being flat to government officials actually being \"lizard people.\"",
      "Beyond those alarming statistics, most students struggled to correctly read media in general. More than half the students could not tell the difference between branded content and reported articles and did not recognize that an op-ed was based on opinion, not fact.",
      "\"We've been talking about media in relation to books forever. English teachers will talk about, 'Here's a book, and this is the context in which it was written,'\" Sandler said. \"We don't have the skills for what's happening on social media. We don't have the skills for the flurry of activity of different websites\u2026different channels.\"",
      "Students are also taught how to share what they've learned with the adults in their lives. In North Salem, Sandler said parents expressed that they wish they could get this training.",
      "\"We are working with a citizenry who does not know what to believe,\" Sandler said.",
      "\"Misinformation gets confused with information. And ultimately, you can get to the point where nobody knows what to trust, and nobody trusts anything, and that's a terrible place. That's a terrible place to be in a democracy, that's a terrible place to be as a person.\"",
      "An integral part of American education",
      "It's not just teachers and parents who see the need for these classes. In that same News Literacy Project survey, 94% of teens said they wanted media literacy classes but only 39% said they've taken one.",
      "The NLP is working with schools to help them build some form of media literacy into their curriculum. Some schools have created dedicated media literacy classes, like in North Salem. Others are incorporating elements of media literacy into their subject-matter classes, like science and social studies.",

      "\"Google has abused its dominant position in online advertising in Canada by engaging in conduct that locks market participants into using its own ad tech tools, excluding competitors, and distorting the competitive process,\" Matthew Boswell, Commissioner of Competition, said in a statement.",
      "Google, however, maintains the online advertising market is a highly competitive sector.",
      "Dan Taylor, Google's vice president of global ads, said in a statement that the bureau's complaint \"ignores the intense competition where ad buyers and sellers have plenty of choice.\"",
      "The statement added that Google intends to defend itself against the allegation.",
      "U.S. regulators want a federal judge to break up Google to prevent the company from continuing to squash competition through its dominant search engine after a court found it had maintained an abusive monopoly over the past decade.",
      "The proposed breakup, floated in a 23-page document filed this month by the U.S. Department of Justice, calls for sweeping punishments that would include a sale of Google's industry-leading Chrome web browser and impose restrictions to prevent Android from favoring its own search engine.",
      "U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta\u00a0ruled in August\u00a0that \"Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly.\" He outlined a timeline for a trial on proposed remedies next spring and plans to issue a decision by August 2025.",
      "Mehta also found that Google in 2021 Google paid about $26 billion to Apple and other partners to ensure its search engine would be the default one on internet browsers.",
      "His ruling stemmed from a Justice Department antitrust lawsuit first filed against Google in October 2020 during the first Trump administration.",
      "Google has already said it plans to appeal Mehta's ruling, but the tech giant must wait until he finalizes a remedy before doing so. The appeals process could take as long as five years, predicts George Hay, a law professor at Cornell University who was the chief economist for the Justice Department's antitrust division for most of the 1970s.",

      "Lebanese authorities reported scattered incidents of Israeli mortar attacks, strikes and shots fired that wounded two people trying to return to southern Lebanon. Lebanon's state-run media said the wounded were civilians, while the Israeli military described them as suspects who violated the terms of the truce that ended more than a year of conflict between Israel and Hezbollah.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces said in a statement that \"several suspects were identified arriving with vehicles to a number of areas in southern Lebanon, breaching the conditions of the ceasefire. The IDF opened fire toward them.\"",
      "\"The IDF remains in southern Lebanon and will actively enforce violations of the ceasefire agreement,\" the military said.",
      "Lebanon's state-run National News Agency said Israeli fire wounded two civilians in Markaba, a village close to the border that has been a scene of intense fighting over the past 14 months. It also reported Israeli tank fire hitting some villages and farms in the south, causing no casualties.",
      "The bursts of violence \u2014 with no reports of serious casualties \u2014 reflected the uneasy nature of the ceasefire that otherwise appeared to hold Thursday as Lebanese troops began to deploy in parts of southern Lebanon, the eastern Bekaa Valley and the southern suburbs of Beirut, where Hezbollah has based its operations.",
      "The Lebanese military said it was setting up temporary checkpoints and detonating unexploded ordnance in hopes of helping displaced civilians return to their homes.",

      "An Associated Press reporter in northern Israel near the border heard Israeli drones buzzing overhead and the sound of artillery strikes in Lebanon.",
      "Hezbollah has not issued any public statements on the alleged Israeli ceasefire violations but Hezbollah lawmaker Hassan Fadlallah acknowledged the incidents. When asked by reporters how Hezbollah would respond, he was cautious.",
      "\"We don't want to rush things,\" he said, adding that Hezbollah \"has the right to self-defense.\"",
      "The agreement, brokered by the United States and France, includes an initial two-month ceasefire in which Hezbollah militants are to withdraw north of the Litani River and Israeli forces are to return to their side of the border. As Israeli forces withdrawal, the buffer zone will be patrolled by Lebanese troops and U.N. peacekeepers moving in to take their place, but it is expected to take weeks, and Israel retained full security control over both sides of the border region as of Thursday.",
      "Lebanon's state-run National News Agency said two people were wounded by Israeli fire in Markaba, close to the border, without providing further details. It said Israel fired artillery in three other locations near the border. There were no immediate reports of casualties.",
      "While the detailed terms of the ceasefire agreement have not been made public by the U.S., President Biden made clear when he announced it on Tuesday that Israel retained the right to self-defense, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned that any violations of the deal would be met with a swift and harsh military response.",
      "Israeli officials have said forces will be withdrawn gradually as it ensures that the agreement is being enforced. Israel has warned people repeatedly not to return to areas where troops are deployed, and says it reserves the right to strike Hezbollah if it violates the terms of the truce.",
      "The ceasefire agreement announced late Tuesday ended 14 months of conflict between Israel and Hezbollah that began a day after Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 attack out of Gaza, when the Lebanese militant group began firing rockets, drones and missiles in solidarity. The Hamas attack saw the militants kill some 1,200 people in southern Israel and take 250 others hostage.",

The war in Gaza is still raging with no end in sight, with health officials in the Hamas-run Palestinian territory saying more than 44,280 people have been killed. Most of the enclave's 2.3 million people have been displaced from their homes, many of them forced to flee multiple times over the last year.",
      "More than 3,760 people were killed by Israeli fire in Lebanon during the conflict, many of them civilians, according to Lebanese health officials. The fighting killed more than 70 people in Israel, meanwhile, more than half of them civilians, as well as dozens of Israeli soldiers fighting in southern Lebanon.",

      "A flight attendant discovered the suspected stowaway during the mostly full, but not sold-out flight after she made frequent and lengthy visits to the Boeing 767-400ER's various lavatories, according to a source familiar with the incident. The 767-400 is wide-body airliner and one of the largest in Delta's fleet with a seat capacity of 238 in the carrier's configuration.",
      "Flight attendants have access to the flight's manifest, which lists passengers and seat numbers, allowing the crew to verify the woman was a suspected stowaway and not ticketed for the flight. Three pilots and eight flight attendants were on Tuesday's flight, according to the source. Delta didn't disclose the number of passengers, citing ongoing investigations into the incident.",

But Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum suggested Mexico was already doing its part and had no interest in closing its borders.",
      "The two spoke just days after Trump threatened to impose sweeping new tariffs on Canada and Mexico as part of his effort to crack down on illegal immigration and drugs \u2014 a threat that drew a prompt and terse response from Sheinbaum, who said any U.S. tariffs would be met with reciprocal measures from her government \u2014 stressing: \"There is no subordination here.\"",
      "Sheinbaum said on Thursday she did not discuss tariffs in the call with Trump.",
      "Trump said in his social media posts that Sheinbaum had \"agreed to stop Migration through Mexico, and into the United States, effectively closing our Southern Border.\"",
      "Sheinbaum indicated on social media, however, that she'd \"explained\" to Trump that Mexico is already \"taking care of\" migrant caravans, calling it an \"excellent conversation,\" but indicating no major changes in her government's policies.",
      "\"I explained to him the comprehensive strategy that Mexico has followed to address the migration phenomenon, respecting human rights. Thanks to this, migrants and caravans are assisted before they reach the border,\" the Mexican leader wrote. \"We reiterate that Mexico's position is not to close borders but to build bridges between governments and between peoples.\"",
      "Trump's social media posts about the borders \u2014 describing what he called \"a wonderful conversation\" with Sheinbaum and suggesting Mexico had made concessions in the wake of his tariff threat \u2014 did move financial markets.",

      "But the only new policy clearly referenced by either leader in their social media posts Wednesday was a vow by Trump to launch a new national ad campaign warning against the dangers of fentanyl use.",
      "Sheinbaum had said in her message that she and Trump, \"also talked about reinforcing cooperation on security issues, within the framework of our sovereignty, and the campaign we are carrying out to prevent fentanyl consumption.\"",

      "Driven by mounting pressure from the U.S. to block migrants going north, in the past few years Mexican authorities have turned to sending them to southern Mexico, in a strategy seen by experts as an attempt to wear migrants out until they give up.",
      "Neither side clarified any firm plans to impose new tariffs in their social media messages on Wednesday. But their implementation could fuel higher prices for American consumers and slow economic growth, potentially blowing up the trade agreement among the U.S., Canada and Mexico that was finalized in 2020 during Trump's previous time in the White House.",

      "Inflation in Canada would top 7% by mid-2025, while unemployment would approach 8% by year-end, according to the investment research firm. The country's auto, energy and heavy manufacturing industries, which rely on exports to the U.S., would take the biggest hit, he added, noting that the sectors also depend on components from American suppliers.",

Canada targeted U.S. products including whiskey and yogurt, most of which came from one plant in Wisconsin, home state of then-House Speaker Paul Ryan.",
      "Canadian officials say lumping Canada in with Mexico is unfair but say they are ready to make new investments in border security and work with the Trump administration to lower the numbers from Canada.

      "But the U.S. likely wouldn't go unscathed in a full-blown trade war with Canada. Across-the-board tariffs on American products would likely cause a \"shallow\" recession in the U.S. and fracture political relations between the allies, according to Oxford.",

As a result, U.S. gas prices could shoot up 30 to 40 cents a gallon, and potentially up to 70 cents, soon after Trump levied the tariffs on Canada, Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "With so much on the line, the incoming Trump administration is more likely to impose limited tariffs on Canadian products, such as steel, lumber and farm products like dairy.",

      "Benastick told police he had stayed in his car for a couple of days at the start of his backcountry trip, before walking to a mountainside creek and camping there for 10 or 15 days, the RCMP said. At that point, the hiker said he moved to a different location farther down into the valley and a built a camp and shelter in a dried-out creek bed. Eventually, Benastick found his way to the road where he encountered the Redfern Lake trail employees, well over six weeks after he first set out on his journey.",
      "\"Finding Sam alive is the absolute best outcome. After all the time he was missing, it was feared that this was would not be the outcome,\" said Corporal Madonna Saunderson, a spokesperson for the RCMP in British Columbia, in a statement.",
      "Benastick, 20, survived extraordinarily harsh conditions. When he was found, the hiker was using two walking sticks to support himself and had cut his sleeping back to wrap the fabric around his legs for warmth, the Canadian broadcaster CBC News reported. Temperatures in the park were frigid while he was missing, at times dropping to -20 degrees Celsius, or -4 degrees Fahrenheit, according to BBC News, a CBS News partner.",
      "Missing hiker found alive after more than five weeks in wilderness https://t.co/X3dpSyNFcn",
      "\"Those are very difficult conditions for really anyone to survive in, especially [with] limited supplies and equipment and food,\" Prince George Search and Rescue search manager Adam Hawkins told the BBC.",
      "Mike Reid, the general manager of the inn near Redfern-Kiely Provincial Park where Benastick's family stayed as search efforts got underway in October, told CBC News that Benastick was in \"rough shape\" Tuesday. But he is expected to recover.",
      "Authorities initiated a massive search for Benastick when the missing person report for him was filed, but that search was called off at the end of October, BBC News reported. Police said they intend to gather more information about what happened to the hiker and why he remained missing for so long once Benastick's health has improved.",

      "Australia's Senate passed legislation Wednesday that, once signed by the country's leader who has strongly endorsed it,\u00a0will ban children under the age of 16 from using most social media platforms. The new law will give Australia the tightest restrictions of any democracy in the world on children's use of hugely popular social media apps.",
      "The Senate passed the bill by 34 votes to 19 on Thursday, a day after Australia's House of Representatives\u00a0passed the same bill by a sweeping margin of 102 votes to 13.",
      "Australia's major parties in the House all supported the bill, which will see social media companies such as TikTok, Facebook, Snapchat, Reddit, X and Instagram face fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars ($33 million) for failing to prevent people under 16 from creating accounts on their platforms.",
      "Tech giant Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads, has called for the bill to be delayed. In a\u00a0statement\u00a0posted online Tuesday, Meta said it was \"concerned the government is rushing this legislation without adequate consultation or evidence and there are still many unknowns with respect to its implementation.\"",

      "\"There are less restrictive alternatives available that could achieve the aim of protecting children and young people from online harms, but without having such a significant negative impact on other human rights. One example of an alternative response would be to place a legal duty of care on social media companies,\" the analysis said. \"We also need to help children and young people to better navigate online spaces by ensuring the national curriculum includes a specific focus on teaching digital literacy and online safety.\"",

      "A kilogram of cocaine is sold for up to $240,000 in Australia, said Grisales -- about six times more than the price in the United States.",
      "\"It is a route that is becoming increasingly profitable because prices are much higher in Australia,\" a security source told AFP.",

      "As a ceasefire the U.S. helped broker between Israel and the Iran-backed group Hezbollah came into effect Wednesday, President Biden said his administration would quickly launch \"another push\" with international partners to secure a deal to end the even deadlier war in the Gaza Strip.",
      "Mr. Biden, who has less than two months left in office, said in a social media post Wednesday morning that his administration would work in the coming days with Israel and other partners in the region to \"achieve a ceasefire in Gaza with the [Israeli] hostages released and an end to the war without Hamas in power.\"",
      "The ceasefire the U.S. and France helped secure to stop the fighting between the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah and Israel appeared to be largely holding Wednesday hours after it took effect. There was, however, an unverified claim from the head of Lebanon's national journalists syndicate that Israeli forces in or near the southern city of Khiam had opened fire \"at a group of journalists and correspondents\" there, allegedly leaving two \u2014 one with The Associated Press and one with the Russian agency Sputnik \u2014 with unspecified injuries.",

      "The Israel Defense Forces did not immediately reply to CBS News' request for comment on the incident, but the IDF said in a brief statement that troops had questioned four \"suspects [who] approached IDF soldiers stationed in southern Lebanon\" Wednesday. There were no further details, and it was unclear whether that incident was related to the alleged shooting in Khiam.",
      "The war in Lebanon simmered for months after Hezbollah started launching rockets at northern Israel in support of its ideological allies Hamas, the day after Hamas carried out its Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack in Israel, sparking the war in Gaza. That attack saw Hamas and allied militants kill some 1,200 people in Israel and take 250 others hostage.",
      "The near-constant volley of rockets and missiles across the Israel-Lebanon border escalated dramatically in September, and Lebanese officials said about 3,800 people had been killed by the time the truce took effect Wednesday morning. Israeli authorities say Hezbollah's rocket strikes have killed 45 civilians over the past year, and at least 73 Israeli soldiers have been killed amid the operations in southern Lebanon.",
      "Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, President-elect Donald Trump's pick for U.S. ambassador to Israel, told reporters Wednesday that it is Israel that \"is going to choose\" how it finishes the Israel-Hezbollah war.",
      "\"Never forget that Hezbollah started this attack on Israel. Israel didn't attack them, they attacked Israel, on October the 8th, the day after the massacre outside of Gaza,\" Huckabee said. \"The old reality is that if you start a war with me, you may get to start it, but I choose how we finish it. Israel is going to choose how they finish it. Not Iran, not the U.N., not France, not America. Israel will decide how this has to end.\"",
      "But the agreement between Israel and Hezbollah did not address the war in Gaza, which sits at the heart of the tension in the Middle East. Health officials in the decimated, Hamas-ruled Palestinian territory say Israel's military assault in Gaza has killed more than 44,280 people and left some 104,000 others wounded. Most of the enclave's 2.3 million people have been displaced from their homes, many of them forced to flee multiple times over the last year.",
      "\"Just as the Lebanese people deserve a future of security and prosperity, so do the people of Gaza. They too deserve an end of the fighting and displacement,\" Mr. Biden said Tuesday at the White House. \"The people of Gaza have been through hell.\"",
      "Hamas indicated its openness to renewed negotiations for a Gaza ceasefire on Wednesday, with a senior official from the group telling the French news agency AFP that it had \"informed mediators in Egypt, Qatar and Turkey that Hamas is ready for a ceasefire agreement and a serious deal to exchange prisoners.\"",
      "The Reuters news agency quoted Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri as saying the group recognized Lebanon's right to take part in the ceasefire with Israel, to protect its population, and voicing hope that an agreement to end the Gaza war might also be possible after many months of largely fruitless talks.",
      "Mr. Biden said the U.S. would work with \"Turkey, Egypt, Qatar, Israel, and others\" to broker a so-far elusive deal between Israel and Hamas, and the Egyptian government announced Wednesday that President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi had already met with the visiting Qatari prime minister to review \"joint efforts aimed at a ceasefire in Gaza, joint efforts to secure the release of the hostages and the unconditional access of humanitarian and relief aid to the Gaza Strip.\"",
      "Earlier Wednesday, King Abdullah II of Jordan also visited Cairo and met with el-Sisi, discussing both the ceasefire in Lebanon and the latest developments in Gaza, according to Egyptian officials.",
      "But while the negotiators renew their efforts on Gaza, they'll likely be keeping a very close, even wary eye on Israel's northern border with Lebanon, as there's far more international will behind the ceasefire with Hezbollah than there is trust between the longtime foes.",
      "Israel and Hezbollah were exchanging heavy fire right up until the moments before the ceasefire came into effect Wednesday. It will now be a tense wait to see if the peace holds during the 60-day period when Israeli forces, who crossed the border in early October, slowly pull out of Hezbollah's previous stronghold in southern Lebanon. They are to be replaced by Lebanese soldiers and United Nations peacekeepers during a process monitored by the U.S. and France.",
      "Over the coming two months, Israel must withdraw all its troops from Lebanon and Hezbollah must pull its fighters and weapons back about 20 miles north of the border, to the other side of the Litani River.",
      "But the distrust on both sides of the border \u2013 the so-called Blue Line established after the last Israel-Hezbollah war in 2006 \u2013 runs deep. Both Mr. Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stressed Tuesday that, in the Israeli leader's words: \"If Hezbollah breaks the agreement and tries to rearm, we will attack.\"",
      "\"For every violation,\" Netanyahu threatened, \"we will attack with might.\"",
      "Speaking Wednesday on \"CBS Mornings\" U.S. National Security adviser Jake Sullivan said the Biden administration helped broker the truce based on previous successes, and failures.",
      "\"We have learned from the past,\" he said, \"and we have designed this deal to be long-standing and to stay in effect - to continue to sustain the peace and also to ensure the security of the State of Israel.\"",
      "The fighting between Israel and Hezbollah drove hundreds of thousands of Lebanese civilians from their homes in the south, and about 60,000 Israelis from their communities near the border in the north.",
      "\"It's not safe to go home,\" Israeli Eliyahu Maman said as the truce silenced the rocket-fire, \"because Hezbollah can still harm us.\"",
      "On the other side of the border, Beirut resident Rima Abdkhaluk said she didn't \"believe in this ceasefire\u2026 Israel cannot be trusted.\"",
      "But neither the lack of trust nor warnings from Israeli and Lebanese officials for civilians not to return to areas evacuated amid Israel's offensive since October were enough to deter thousands of Lebanese civilians from packing their belongings back into cars and cramming onto highways to try to return to their homes in the south on Wednesday.",
      "Some 2 million Palestinians in Gaza will be hoping that they, too, might get the chance to start rebuilding their shattered lives in the coming weeks. The families of about 100 Israeli hostages still held in the Gaza Strip will be hoping the renewed push for a ceasefire with Hamas can also bring their loved ones back home.",

      "Police in the Balkans arrested 11 alleged members of a criminal syndicate responsible for smuggling cocaine from South America to Europe, Croatia said Wednesday, in the latest effort to crack down on traffickers. Among the people arrested was a suspect who is also wanted for his alleged membership in the notorious \"Pink Panthers\" jewel heist gang.",
      "The arrests were carried out during raids Tuesday that saw police seize weapons, large amounts of ammunition along with luxury cars and cash, Croatia's interior ministry said in a statement.",
      "The so-called Balkans route is a vital transit network long used by criminals to smuggle drugs, weapons, and people into western Europe.",
      "Eight suspects were arrested in Serbia, while two were taken into custody in Bosnia and another individual was apprehended in Croatia, the statement added.",
      "\"The cocaine dealers used different maritime routes... and are linked with the seizure of more than 500 kilogrammes (1,102 pounds) of cocaine... in 2021 at Croatia's port of Ploce,\" the statement said.",
      "The drugs -- worth a potential street value of 50 million euros ($53 million) -- were hidden in a cargo container, and the ministry released several images showing packages of the cocaine.",
      "\"The seizure showed the international drug smuggling groups increasingly target smaller EU ports,\" the ministry added.",
      "One of the suspects arrested in Serbia was also wanted for his alleged membership in the Pink Panthers jewel heist gang -- a notorious international criminal network that has drawn many of its members from the Balkans. As \"60 Minutes\" reported in 2014, the Pink Panthers have done jobs in dozens of countries, and many members fought in the Serbian special forces during the Bosnian wars.",
      "In recent months, members of Balkan cartels and gangs have been linked to major cocaine trafficking operations.",

    "summary": "Scientists now have a clearer picture of Camp Century, an abandoned U.S. military base long hidden under the ice in Greenland, thanks to a NASA research team's good luck.",
    "story": [
      "As NASA scientist Chad Greene flew over northern Greenland with a team of engineers in April, they never expected their radar to find something manmade buried deep within the ice. Greene and his team were flying above the Greenland Ice Sheet on a NASA Gulfstream III plane, scanning the barren expanse of ice that's more than a mile deep in some areas, when their radar instrument picked up something unusual.",
      "\"We didn't know what it was at first,\" Greene said in a statement released by NASA's Earth Observatory this week, along with new images of the discovery. \"We were looking for the bed of the ice and out pops Camp Century.\"",
      "It turns out the team had stumbled upon an abandoned Cold War-era military base built by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in 1959. Nicknamed the \"city under the ice,\" the compound consists of a network of tunnels carved into the ice sheet. It was abandoned in 1967 and, over time, became buried about 100 feet below the surface as snow and ice accumulated.",
      "The base was built as part of Project Iceworm, a then-secret plan to experiment with building a missile launch site under the Greenland Ice Sheet during the Cold War, when tension soared between the U.S. and the then-Soviet Union. Camp Century, a remote, nuclear-powered installation, was built to study the feasibility of such a project, but it was never realized and the base was decommissioned under the assumption it would be buried forever under the ice.",
      "While the \"city under the ice\" had been picked up by previous radar scans, the instruments used on the NASA flight in April provided a more detailed, if unexpected, survey.",
      "\"In the new data, individual structures in the secret city are visible in a way that they've never been seen before,\" said Greene, who works with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.",
      "Past scans had used a type of radar that points straight down at the ground and produces a two-dimensional scan of structures buried beneath the ice. Greene's flight used NASA's Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar, which is able to produce maps with \"more dimensionality,\" according to the agency.",
      "A photo released by NASA on Monday showed the features of the base hidden deep under the ice, appearing as anomalies near the base of the ice sheet.",
      "\"Scientists have used maps acquired with conventional radar to corroborate estimates of Camp Century's depth \u2014 part of an\u00a0effort to estimate\u00a0when melting and thinning of the ice sheet could\u00a0re-expose the camp\u00a0and any remaining biological, chemical, and radioactive waste that was buried along with it,\" NASA's Earth Observatory said in its article this week. \"The scientific utility of the new UAVSAR image of Camp Century remains to be seen; for now, it remains a novel curiosity acquired by chance.\"",
      "A 2016 study of the abandoned base suggested that the facility could no longer be considered \"preserved for eternity,\" due to climate change increasing the rate at which Arctic ice is melting.",
      "CBS News' Walter Cronkite visited Camp Century for a tour of the still-under-construction facility for a program that aired in 1961. The camp's commander, Captain Tom Evans, explained to him that the goals of the program were three-fold: \"The first one is to test out the number of promising new concepts of polar construction. And the second one is to provide a really practical field test of this new nuclear plant. And, finally, we're building Camp Century to provide a good base, here, in the interior of Greenland, where the scientists can carry on their R&D activities.\"",
      "The exact nature of that research and development work wasn't discussed in Cronkite's report for the CBS documentary show \"The Twentieth Century.\" \u00a0(An abridged version of that report can be viewed at the link above.)",
      "Speaking with 60 Minutes in 2016, as that show revisited Cronkite's decades-old trip to Camp Century, producer Daniel Ruetenik said the trip was fascinating, and he marveled at the evolution of human interest in the vast, frozen expanse of the Greenland Ice Sheet.",
      "\"At the time [of Camp Century], the Cold War was considered to be the greatest threat to humanity,\" Ruetenik said. \"And now, the area has become a destination for climate scientists trying to study changes in the environment. So, it has a second purpose now.\"",

    "story": [
      "For years, U.S. authorities and fishermen have been complaining about illegal fishing for red snapper in the Gulf of Mexico, and now it's been revealed who is behind the lucrative trade: a Mexican drug cartel.",
      "The U.S. Treasury Department announced sanctions Tuesday against members of the Gulf drug cartel, which operates in the border cities of Reynosa and Matamoros, across from McAllen and Brownsville, Texas.",
      "While commercial fishing and drug cartels may seem like an unlikely combination, it makes perfect sense for a criminal organization.",
      "The department says the cartel uses fishing boats to facilitate drug and migrant smuggling; along the way, the boats catch tons of red snapper, a commercially valuable but vulnerable species. The boats often launch from Playa Bagdad, east of Matamoros, on the Gulf coast.",
      "\"The Gulf Cartel engages in the illicit trade of red snapper and shark species through 'lancha' operations based out of Playa Bagdad,\" the department said. \"Apart from their use for IUU (illegal, unregulated or unreported) fishing in U.S. waters, lanchas are also used to move illicit drugs and migrants into the United States.\"",
      "To add insult to injury, these Mexican boats, often based out of Playa Bagdad, sell their catch in Mexican border cities, where they are sometimes shipped into Texas for resale in the U.S. market.",
      "This occurs while U.S. fishermen had to respect strict seasonal limits or closures designed to protect fish populations.",
      "\"As the fishing of red snapper and shark species is under strict limits in the United States, and therefore those species are more abundant in U.S. waters, Mexican fishermen cross into U.S. waters to fish via these lanchas,\" the department said.",
      "\"They then bring their catch back to lancha camps into Mexico, where the product is ultimately sold and, oftentimes, exported into the United States,\" it continued. \"This activity earns millions a year for lancha camps. In addition, it also leads to the death of other marine species that are inadvertently caught\" on the long lines of baited hooks the boats use.",
      "The Treasury announced Tuesday it was designating five individuals linked to the cartel for illegal fishing -- Ildelfonso Carrillo Sapien (a.k.a. \"El Chivo\"), Raul Decuir Garcia (a.k.a. \"La Burra\"), Ismael Guerra Salinas (a.k.a. \"El Comandante\"), Omar Guerra Salinas (a.k.a. \"Samorano\"), and Francisco Javier Sierra Angulo (a.k.a. \"El Borrado\").",
      "History of illegal fishing",
      "This isn't the first time cartels have been involved in illegal fishing in Mexico. Experts say other drug cartels are involved in the prohibited gillnet fishing for totoaba in the Gulf of California, also known as the Sea of Cortez, threatening the world's most endangered porpoise, the vaquita marina.",
      "Those designated under Tuesday's sanctions - which block any of their U.S. assets - include Gulf cartel local bosses in Playa Bagdad, as well as two owners of fishing camps there.",
      "The illegal fishing problem became so severe that in 2022, the U.S. government prohibited Mexican fishing vessels from entering U.S. ports on the Gulf of Mexico, arguing the Mexican government had not done enough to prevent its boats from illegally fishing in U.S. waters.",
      "Mexican fishing boats in the Gulf \"are prohibited from entering U.S. ports, will be denied port access and services,\" the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration wrote in a report in 2022. According to a Sept. 10, 2024 NOAA bulletin, those restrictions remain in place.",
      "Small Mexican boats frequently use prohibited long lines or nets to haul in snapper in U.S. waters, which can harm other marine life, such as sharks.",
      "NOAA said in a previous report that the U.S. Coast Guard apprehended dozens of Mexican boats in the Gulf, including repeat offenders who had been interdicted multiple times since 2014.",
      "It noted the United States imported nearly five tons of fresh and frozen snapper from Mexico in 2018, raising concerns that \"these imports may have included fish harvested illegally in U.S. waters.\"",
      "U.S. targeting cartels recently",
      "In recent months, the U.S. Treasury has imposed sanctions on cartels for a variety of reasons -- from drug trafficking to fuel theft to time share scams.",
      "In October, the U.S. sanctioned senior members of the armed wing of a Mexican drug cartel that operates on border territories in and around Chihuahua, Mexico. The cartel has also been linked to the 2019 ambush that\u00a0killed nine Americans\u00a0in Mexico.",
      "In September, the U.S. sanctioned a\u00a0man known as \"The Tank\"\u00a0who allegedly leads the fuel theft arm of Mexico's hyper-violent\u00a0Jalisco New Generation cartel.",

    "story": [
      "Sydney, Australia \u2014\u00a0A police officer who shocked a 95-year-old nursing home resident with a Taser was found guilty of manslaughter in an Australian court Wednesday. A jury found Kristian James Samuel White guilty in the trial in Sydney after 20 hours of deliberation. White, who is on bail, could get up to 25 years in prison when he is sentenced later.",
      "Clare Nowland, a great-grandmother who had dementia and used a walker, was refusing to put down the steak knife she was holding when the officer discharged his Taser at her in May 2023. Nowland fell backward after White shocked her and died a week later in hospital.",
      "Police said at the time that Nowland sustained her fatal injuries from striking her head on the floor, rather than directly from the device's debilitating electric shock.",
      "White's employment is under review and is subject to legal processes, New South Wales state Police Commissioner Karen Webb told reporters after the verdict.",
      "\"The court has found Claire Nowland died as a result of the actions of a police officer. This should never have happened,\" Webb said, as she offered her \"deepest condolences\" to Nowland's family. The state's police reviewed its Taser policy and training in January and no changes to it were made, she added.",
      "In video played during the New South Wales Supreme Court trial, White was heard saying \"nah, bugger it\" before discharging his weapon, after the officers told Nowland 21 times to put the knife down. White, 34, told the jury he had been taught that any person wielding a knife was dangerous, the Guardian reported.",
      "But after an eight-day trial, the jury rejected arguments by White's lawyers that his use of the Taser was a proportionate response to the threat posed by Nowland, who weighed about 100 pounds.",
      "White and other officers were called to the nursing home by staff who told them a woman was \"armed with a knife.\"",
      "Police said they urged Nowland to drop the serrated steak knife before she started moving toward them \"at a slow pace,\" with her walking frame, prompting White to fire his taser at her.",
      "The prosecutor argued that White's use of the Taser was \"utterly unnecessary and obviously excessive,\" local news outlets said.",
      "The extraordinary case provoked debate about how officers in the state use Tasers, a device that incapacitates people using electricity.",
      "Nowland, a resident of Yallambee Lodge, a nursing home in the town of Cooma, was survived by eight children, 24 grandchildren and 31 great-grandchildren, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported.",
      "Lawyers for Nowland's family filed a separate civil suit last year against the New South Wales state government, seeking damages on behalf of her estate for alleged battery and assault. The suit was settled on private terms in March this year.",
      "Cooma businessman and community advocate Andrew Thaler, speaking on Australian television not long after the incident, said Nowland was, \"about 5-foot-2 and weighs all of 43 kilos [about 95 pounds], she can't walk on her own without walking assistance.\"",
      "\"The use of a Taser, when a kind word was all she needed, if she was confused \u2014 which is what happens with people who have dementia \u2014 she needed kind words and assistance and help,\" Thaler said. \"She didn't need the force of the law.\"",

Andrew Cuomo joined Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s legal defense team this week, as the Jewish leader and his former defense chief Yoav Gallant face arrest warrants from the International Criminal Court (ICC) over their ongoing response to Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack.",
      "Cuomo, a three-term Democrat who resigned in 2021 amid harassment allegations he has personally denied, also railed against antisemitism at a recent dinner with leaders of New York\u2019s Jewish community.",
      "Cuomo condemned what he characterized as whitewashing Hamas kidnappings and murders in Israel, telling the National Committee for Furtherance of Jewish Education he is proud to join Netanyahu\u2019s defense.",
      "He condemned the \"denial\" that too many people and \"institutions\" have about the scourge of antisemitism.",
      "Cuomo said one Jewish leader, Rabbi Zvi Kogan, who had been reported as \"missing\" in the United Arab Emirates was not so, and instead was kidnapped and murdered by Hamas. Cuomo suggested such incorrect characterizations should be considered antisemitic.",

      "\"This is the moment that is going to be in the history books. This is a pivotal moment and this is the moment when true friends stand shoulder to shoulder and fight for the state of Israel,\" Cuomo said.",
      "\"I am proud to be on the legal defense team of the prime minister against the arrest warrant at the ICC \u2013 and I\u2019m proud to stand against antisemitism.\"",
      "The ICC charged Netanyahu and Gallant with crimes against humanity and war crimes, setting off a global firestorm as signatories to the court\u2019s jurisdiction found themselves at odds with non-party allies like the U.S.",
      "In recognizing the ICC, member nations have a sworn duty to uphold its edicts. Netanyahu\u2019s warrant therefore presented the swath of Western nations \u2013 including the entire European Union \u2013 with a predicament that placed them counter to the U.S. and Israel.",
      "Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts told Britain's GB News there would be \"hell to pay for any international leader buying into this bulls---.\" That nation's leader, left-wing Prime Minister Keir Starmer, faces pressure from some members of his Labour Party who have cited an \"obligation\" to arrest Netanyahu, according to the outlet.",

      "Separately, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot was asked if France would arrest Netanyahu, and responded that Paris is \"very committed to international justice and will apply international law,\" according to the Jerusalem Post.",
      "The warrants caused bipartisan outrage on Capitol Hill as Sens. John Fetterman, D-Pa., Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Tom Cotton, R-Ark., and Reps. Jared Moskowitz, D-Fla., and Ritchie Torres, D-N.Y., found rare agreement.",
      "Graham told \"Hannity\" that he and Cotton seek to pass a law sanctioning any country aiding the ICC in arresting Netanyahu, while the other listed lawmakers all condemned the warrant.",
      "Cuomo is also rumored to be considering a 2025 mayoral run in New York City \u2013 which is home to the largest Jewish community in the U.S.",
      "During his remarks, he cited the 1.6 million Jews in the Big Apple and said Hamas is demonstrating in the streets with masks while Jewish people are afraid to wear yarmulkes or Stars of David in public.",
      "\"That cannot happen in the state of New York,\" he said, adding a relevant law he signed as governor should be properly enforced.",
      "In 2019, Cuomo approved antisemitic-hate-crimes legislation sponsored by state Sen. Todd Kaminsky, D-Long Beach, and launched a \"No Hate In Our State\" campaign soon after.",

      "Fox News chief political anchor Bret Baier has the latest on the Trump transition team on 'Special Report.'",
      "President-elect Donald Trump last week announced the nomination of Florida\u2019s former attorney general, Pam Bondi, to head up the Justice Department, touching off a flurry of speculation as to how Bondi, a longtime prosecutor and close ally of Trump, might lead the department.",
      "Former colleagues who knew her best during her time as a Florida prosecutor, including a Democrat opponent for state attorney general who she later tapped to be her drug czar, described Bondi in a series of interviews as an experienced litigator whose leadership style is more consensus-builder than bridge-burner and whose tenure may generate less friction among rank-and-file career staff at the Justice Department than early critics might fear.",
      "If confirmed, those close to Bondi told Fox News Digital that she will likely espouse many of the same priorities she did in her years as a prosecutor in Florida, primarily in cracking down on drug trafficking, illicit fentanyl imports and in running a Justice Department that enforces fair treatment of both political and career appointees alike.",
      "\"From a lawyer's standpoint, this woman knows how to be a lawyer and a trial lawyer,\" Nicholas Cox, Florida's statewide prosecutor, told Fox News Digital of Bondi's record. \"There's just not a question about it.\"",
      "Here are some of the ways her time in Florida could inform her tenure as attorney general.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump and nominee for AG Pam Bondi (AP | Getty)",
      "Drug crackdown:",
      "In Florida, Bondi quickly earned a reputation for cracking down on opioids and the many \"pill mills\" operating in the Sunshine State when she was elected as the state's attorney general in 2010. At the time, Florida \"was the epicenter of the opioid crisis,\" Florida statewide prosecutor Nicholas Cox said in an interview.",
      "It was also a hub for so-called drug tourism: Out-of-state residents traveled to Florida from across the country to purchase opioids in bulk, relying on the state's many-house pharmacies, \"cash-only\" clinics and a lack of statewide prescribing laws to purchase the addictive medications, largely without restriction.",
      "When Bondi took office, opioids were killing around seven people each day, Dave Aronberg, the state attorney for Palm Beach County, who formerly served as Bondi's drug czar, said in an interview.",
      "There were also \"more pain clinics than McDonald's locations\" in Florida at the time, he said, illustrating the magnitude of the problem.",
      "Aronberg, a Democrat who ran against Bondi for attorney general in 2010 before she appointed him to the post, credits his former boss as being the person \"most responsible for ridding the state of Florida of destructive pill mills.\"",
      "He and others point to Bondi's push for legislation that helped eliminate pill mills in the state, her crackdown on doctors and clinics responsible for prescribing the pain pills en masse, and her work in enforcing Florida's \"Statewide Prescription Drug Diversion and Abuse Road Map\" to best coordinate federal, state and local efforts as helping end the crisis.",
      "Later, she served in Trump's first presidential term as a member of his Opioid and Drug Abuse Commission.",
      "If confirmed as U.S. attorney general, Bondi has made clear she plans to remain focused on cracking down on illicit drugs\u2014albeit on a national scale.",
      "Bondi's former colleagues told Fox News Digital they expect she will bring the same playbook to Washington\u2014this time with an eye to cracking down on drug trafficking, illicit fentanyl use, and the cartels responsible for smuggling the drugs across the border.",

      "Cox, the Florida state prosecutor, noted that Bondi's career was also heavily shaped by her 18 years working in the Florida District Attorney's Office, a career position that was not informed by politics.",
      "There, the main focus was \"cooperation\"\u2014 a mentality that Cox said extended to \"prosecutors, law enforcement, and public defenders, for that matter.\"\u00a0 \"We all worked together and it made for a really strong criminal justice system,\" Cox said.",
      "\"We all worked together, and it made for a really strong criminal justice system,\" Cox said.",

      "But afrer her election, Bondi tapped him to be her drug czar\u2014 an unorthodox move that Aronberg and others said demonstrates Bondi's commitment to solving problems and working across the aisle on top priorities.",
      "\"It really said a lot about her because she got a lot of criticism, withering criticism, from some members of her own party\" who were upset she would choose a Democrat for the role, Aronberg said.",
      "DNC UNION LAUNCHES GOFUNDME TO HELP FORMER STAFFERS HIT BY MASSIVE LAYOFFS AFTER ELECTION LOSSES",

      "Fox News chief political anchor Bret Baier reports on the use of artificial intelligence in agriculture on 'Special Report.'",
      "In the 1930s, there were around 6.8 million farms in the United States. The size averaged at around 155 acres. Over the next several decades, the number of farms rapidly declined to around 1.9 million in 2023. Those farms grew larger, averaging around 464 acres.",

      "\"I think there's a lot of potential for both increasing productivity on the crop side, but also for reducing the amount of resources that we use on the productivity side. There's the data that we can actually collect to increase yields and improve the nutritional quality. But then there's also the facilitate facilitating of reductions in labor availability,\" said Mason Earles, an assistant professor at UC Davis in the departments of Viticulture & Enology and Biological & Agricultural Engineering and researcher at the AI Institute for Next Generation Food Systems or AIFS.",
      "In the 1930s, there were around 6.8 million farms in the United States. In 2023, the number of farms declined to around 1.9 million. (AI Institute For Next Generation Food Systems)",
      "The most recent data shows 41% of farmers reported labor shortages in 2018. That\u2019s a 27% increase from those reporting shortages in 2014. The trend is expected to continue. The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects a 2% decline in workers through 2033 despite the number of job openings remaining the same.",
      "\"We do more with less. It's not that it has no set way and has totally changed the traditional work, it is empowering, and it is increasing the productivity of existing workers,\" said Ilias Tagkopoulos, a computer science professor at UC Davis and the director of AIFS.",

Whether that has to do with production of different types of vegetables, fruits, nuts, other types of meats or other types of foods,\" Earles said. \"There\u2019s a lot of potential, we think, all the way from going from the research and lab side through startups, through corporate innovation. And we're here to kind of find a way to facilitate and integrate that along the way.\"",

Our mission is to leverage AI to build that, to help towards that goal,\" Tagkopoulos said. \"AI is doing two things. One is making businesses more productive. And the second is to accelerate innovation. It accelerates innovation by actually focusing on what matters versus what's out there.\"",
      "Researchers are looking into how AI hardware like sensors or robotics can better gather data in the field.",

And the consumer sees better fruit, veggies and other products that are coming out of those fields,\" Earles said.",

      "\"The question there is how can you make this technology even more cost-effective and the even more practical, which is always a challenge,\" Tagkopoulos said.",
      "Controlled environments or indoor farming also see high upfront costs. But some studies have shown that higher crop yields are possible because of fewer weather-related challenges and the ability to grow year-round.",
      "\"We see in the future more data being generated, more tools becoming available, easier, much less expensive in terms of AI tools to be able to give recommendations on when to irrigate, when to farm, where to sell.

      "How the Spotify scam works",
      "As reported by\u00a0BleepingComputer, this scam works by misusing Spotify\u2019s popularity and trustworthiness. Scammers exploit Spotify playlists by injecting targeted keywords, such as \"free download,\" \"crack\" or \"warez,\" into titles and descriptions.",
      "These keywords are designed to align with popular search terms. Since Spotify\u2019s web player pages are indexed by search engines like Google, these spammy results appear in user searches, driving traffic to their links. For example, a Spotify playlist titled \"Sony Vegas Pro 13 Crack\u2026\" was found promoting \"free\" software sites in its title and description, directing users to questionable external links.",
      "The scam isn\u2019t limited to playlists. It extends to podcasts as well. Scammers create podcasts with multiple short episodes, typically under 20 seconds, using synthesized speech to direct listeners to click links in the description for free content. These podcasts often target users searching for pirated ebooks, audiobooks or game cheats. While the content may appear legitimate at first glance, clicking on the links often results in being redirected to unsafe pages that further exploit users.",

      "2. Stick to official sources: Always download software, eBooks or other digital content from trusted official websites or reputable platforms. If you see a Spotify playlist or podcast offering \"free\" versions of paid content, it\u2019s likely a scam. Cross-check the legitimacy of the content through known channels instead of relying on unverified links.",

      "3. Use strong, unique passwords: Create complex and unique passwords for your Spotify account and avoid using personal information like birthdays or pet names. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "4. Be skeptical of synthesized speech and short episodes: Many scam podcasts feature short episodes (10-20 seconds) with synthesized speech directing you to click on a link in the description. These are a common tactic used to trick users into visiting unsafe pages. If the content feels automated, vague or overly promotional, it\u2019s best to avoid it.",
      "5. Verify curator credentials: Check the credentials of playlist curators. Legitimate curators usually have a verifiable online presence. If you can't find any information about them, it's best to avoid engaging with them.",
      "6. Recognize phishing attempts: Be cautious of emails claiming to be from Spotify that ask you to confirm account details or click on suspicious links. These are often phishing attempts designed to steal your credentials.",
      "7. Report and block suspicious content: If you come across playlists or podcasts that seem fraudulent or inappropriate,\u00a0report them directly to Spotify. Use Spotify\u2019s reporting tools to flag content that violates its platform rules. Blocking suspicious accounts or playlists also ensures you won\u2019t accidentally interact with them in the future, and reporting helps Spotify improve its filtering and moderation systems.",
      "HOW TO REMOVE YOUR PRIVATE DATA FROM THE INTERNET",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Scammers will use any means possible to trick you. In the past, we\u2019ve seen bad actors weaponize\u00a0Google search results with malicious websites that install malware when links are clicked on. There have also been plenty of\u00a0SEO scams targeting users. Companies like Spotify need to implement measures to prevent their platforms from being misused by scammers. Google also has a responsibility to ensure the quality of its search results.

      "With the holiday season just around the corner, many of us are gearing up to spread some cheer with gift cards.",
      "However, it\u2019s important to remember that these convenient gifts are also a favorite target for scammers. We're going to break down six sneaky gift card tricks that could leave you out of pocket during this time of year.",

      "1. Display rack gift card trick",
      "One of the latest gift card tricks involves tampering with the gift cards on the display racks at retail stores. Scammers will record the activation code on the card or place a custom barcode sticker over the real barcode, which allows them to secretly load the cash onto their own card immediately after you purchase the gift card. This means that when you or your recipient try to use the gift card, it will be empty or invalid.",
      "Check the packaging of the gift card before buying it. Look for signs of tampering, such as the wrapping being torn or resealed or stickers placed over the barcode or card number. Also, choose a card from the back of the rack, as scammers often place their fraudulent cards at the front of the display.",

      "2. Impersonation gift card trick",
      "Another common gift card trick scammers use involves impersonating someone you know or trust, such as a family member, a romantic interest, a company or the government. Scammers will contact you by phone, text, email or social media and create a fake story or emergency that requires you to send them money urgently.",
      "They will ask you to buy a gift card or multiple gift cards and then send them a photo of the card or the numbers on the back of the card. Once they have the gift card information, they will disappear with your money and cut off contact.",
      "Never send money or gift cards to anyone you don\u2019t know personally or haven\u2019t met in person. If someone claims to be someone you know or trust, verify their identity by contacting them directly through a different channel.",
      "Don\u2019t trust caller ID, as scammers can spoof phone numbers. Don\u2019t be pressured by threats or promises, as scammers use emotional manipulation to get you to act quickly and without thinking. And remember, no legitimate company or government agency will ever ask you to pay them with a gift card.",

      "3. Resale gift card trick",
      "Another gift card trick involves buying or selling gift cards on online platforms, such as websites, apps or social media groups. Scammers will offer to sell you gift cards at a discounted price or buy your unwanted gift cards for cash.",
      "However, they will either send you a fake or empty gift card or take your gift card information and money without sending you anything in return. They may also use stolen credit cards or hacked accounts to buy or sell gift cards, which can put you at risk of fraud or identity theft.",
      "Only buy or sell gift cards from reputable sources, such as official retailers, authorized resellers or trusted friends and family. Avoid buying or selling gift cards from strangers online, especially if they offer a deal that sounds too good to be true.",
      "Don\u2019t share your gift card information or personal details with anyone you don\u2019t know or trust. And use a secure payment method that offers protection, such as a credit card or PayPal, instead of a gift card, wire transfer or cash.",

      "4. Phishing gift card trick",
      "A very popular gift card trick this holiday season\u00a0involves phishing, which is a type of online fraud that tries to trick you into revealing your personal or financial information. Scammers will send you an email, text or pop-up message that looks like it comes from a legitimate company, such as a retailer, bank or\u00a0tech support service.",
      "They will claim that there is a problem with your account, your order, your device or your security and that you need to verify your identity, update your information or fix an issue. They will then ask you to click on a link, open an attachment or call a number and then request that you pay them with a gift card or provide them with your gift card information.",
      "Never click on links, open attachments or call numbers from unsolicited messages, as they may lead to fake or malicious websites or software. Don\u2019t provide any personal or financial information, such as your passwords, PINs, account numbers or gift card numbers, to anyone who contacts you unexpectedly.",
      "Don\u2019t trust messages that create a sense of urgency, pressure or fear, as they are designed to make you act without thinking. If you have any doubts about the legitimacy of a message, contact the company directly using a verified website, phone number or email address.",
      "Using antivirus protection will help to protect you against scammers and hackers who try to steal your money and personal information using gift card tricks, especially\u00a0through phishing. The best way to protect yourself from clicking on any malicious links, fake websites, phishing emails and text messages is to have strong\u00a0antivirus protection installed and actively running on all your devices. It\u2019s the best to help stop and alert you of any malware in your system and ultimately protect you from being hacked.",

      "A person purchasing a gift card online (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "5. Loyalty program gift card trick",
      "This gift card trick involves loyalty programs, which are rewards programs that offer you points, discounts or freebies for being a loyal customer. Scammers will pretend to be representatives of a loyalty program that you are a member of or that you are eligible to join.",
      "They will tell you that you have won a prize, sweepstakes or a promotion and that you need to pay a fee, a tax or a shipping cost to claim it. They will then ask you to pay them with a gift card or provide them with your gift card information.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Be wary of any unsolicited offers or notifications that claim that you have won something, especially if you don\u2019t remember entering or signing up for anything. Don\u2019t pay any money or fees to receive a prize, as legitimate loyalty programs will never ask you to do that. Don\u2019t provide any personal or financial information, such as your passwords, account numbers or gift card numbers, to anyone who contacts you unexpectedly.",
      "Don\u2019t trust messages that create a sense of excitement, curiosity or greed, as they are designed to make you act impulsively. If you have any doubts about the legitimacy of a message, contact the loyalty program directly using a verified website, phone number or email address.",
      "A person purchasing a gift card online (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "6. Fake balance checker scam",
      "In this scam, fraudsters set up fake websites or phone services that claim to check the balance of your gift cards. Victims are lured into providing their gift card numbers and PINs under the guise of verifying their balance. Once the information is entered, scammers can drain the funds from the card almost immediately.",
      "To avoid this scam, always use official websites or apps from reputable retailers to check your gift card balance. Be wary of unsolicited calls or messages asking for your gift card information, especially if they claim to be from a legitimate company. It is important never to enter your gift card details on unfamiliar websites.",
      "HOW TO FIGHT BACK AGAINST DEBIT CARD HACKERS WHO ARE AFTER YOUR MONEY",
      "How to safely give and receive gift cards",
      "Buy gift cards online instead of physical cards directly from the store, not from third parties.\u00a0You can also use\u00a0these favorite sites and apps that will reward you with a percentage back on all gift card purchases.Avoid gift card racks at retail stores like the grocery store.

When you connect to a VPN, it hides your real IP address by assigning you a new one from their server network, effectively preventing websites and cyber criminals from tracking your location or identifying you based on your IP address.",
      "Simultaneously, VPNs encrypt all data transmitted between your device and the internet, rendering it unreadable to anyone who might attempt to intercept it. This encryption process ensures that sensitive information, such as credit card details, remains confidential throughout your online activities. By combining these two powerful features, VPNs create a secure tunnel for your internet traffic, significantly enhancing your online privacy and security.",
      "A woman using a VPN on her cellphone (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Understanding the risks",
      "When you access your retirement accounts online, especially through public Wi-Fi networks, you're potentially exposing sensitive financial information to cybercriminals. These hackers can intercept your data, steal your login credentials and potentially drain your accounts. What's more concerning is that retirement accounts are often less frequently monitored than regular bank accounts, making them an attractive target for cybercriminals.",
      "A woman using a VPN on her cellphone and a laptop (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "BEST ANTIVIRUS FOR PCS, MACS, IPHONES AND ANDROIDS \u2013 CYBERGUY PICKS",
      "Why a VPN is crucial for protecting your retirement accounts",
      "By creating an encrypted tunnel for your internet traffic, a VPN makes it extremely difficult for hackers to intercept your sensitive data. Here's a deeper look at why VPNs are indispensable for safeguarding your retirement accounts:",
      "VPNs employ military-grade encryption protocols, such as AES-256, to scramble your data. This means that even if a cybercriminal manages to intercept your information, it would appear as an indecipherable jumble of characters. For your retirement accounts, this translates to an extra layer of security for your login credentials, account numbers and financial transactions.",
      "By masking your IP address and replacing it with one from their servers, VPNs make it significantly harder for malicious actors to track your online activities. This anonymity is crucial when accessing financial accounts, as it prevents cybercriminals from identifying you as a high-value target based on your browsing habits or the financial institutions you visit online.",
      "The ability to check your accounts while traveling or using\u00a0public Wi-Fi is convenient but risky. A VPN provides a secure connection, essentially creating a protected tunnel between your device and the financial institution's servers. This is particularly important for retirement accounts, which may not have the same level of fraud protection as checking or savings accounts.\u00a0However, check if your retirement fund platform permits VPN usage, as some might flag it as unusual activity.",
      "VPNs are excellent safeguards against man-in-the-middle attacks, where hackers position themselves between you and the website you're trying to access. By encrypting your data from end to end, VPNs make it nearly impossible for attackers to insert themselves into your connection and steal your information.",
      "If you're traveling abroad and need to access your U.S.-based retirement accounts, some financial institutions may block access from foreign IP addresses. A VPN allows you to connect through a U.S.-based server, ensuring you can manage your accounts securely from anywhere in the world.",

      "THINK TWICE BEFORE USING A PUBLIC COMPUTER: HERE'S WHY",
      "7 steps to secure your retirement accounts",

      "2) Always use VPN on public Wi-Fi:\u00a0Never access financial accounts on public networks without activating your VPN first.",
      "3) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): Add an extra layer of security to your accounts by\u00a0enabling 2FA.",
      "4) Use strong, unique passwords:\u00a0Create complex passwords for each of your accounts and consider using a password manager. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "5) Regularly monitor your accounts: Check your retirement accounts frequently for any suspicious activity.",
      "6) Keep software updated: Ensure your devices and apps are always\u00a0up to date with the latest security patches.",
      "7) Be wary of phishing attempts: Don't click on suspicious links or provide personal information in response to unsolicited emails. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "HOW TO REMOVE YOUR PRIVATE DATA FROM THE INTERNET",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Securing your retirement accounts is not just about protecting your current savings; it's about safeguarding your future. By implementing a VPN and following best security practices, you're taking proactive steps to ensure that the nest egg you've worked so hard to build remains safe and secure. Remember, the small investment in a quality VPN service is negligible compared to the potential losses from a compromised retirement account.",

      "The apps use a technology called Flutter, a tool often used to create apps that work on multiple devices like phones and computers. Flutter makes it easier for app developers to design their software, but its unique structure also helps hackers hide their malicious code, making it harder for experts to detect.",
      "Once installed, the malware connects to a remote server (think of it as a command center for hackers) to receive instructions. These instructions could include running commands on your computer without your knowledge. One trick this malware uses is running AppleScripts, a type of script built for macOS systems, which can quietly execute commands to steal your data or even control your device.",

      "2) Be careful with downloads and links:\u00a0Only download apps from trusted sources like the Mac App Store or official websites of known developers. Hackers often disguise malware as legitimate updates or harmless apps.",
      "3) Keep your software up to date:\u00a0Regular updates for macOS and installed apps are essential because they patch security flaws. Apple frequently rolls out updates to address vulnerabilities, so enabling automatic updates ensures you stay protected without the hassle of manually checking for them.",
      "4) Use strong, unique passwords:\u00a0A strong password can help keep your Mac safe from unauthorized access. Avoid reusing passwords across different accounts. A\u00a0password manager can be incredibly helpful here\u2014it generates and stores complex passwords for you, making them difficult for hackers to crack.",
      "It also keeps track of all your passwords in one place and automatically fills them in when you log into accounts, so you don\u2019t have to remember them yourself. By reducing the number of passwords you need to recall, you\u2019re less likely to reuse them, which lowers the risk of security breaches. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2024 here.",
      "5) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Activate\u00a02FA for key accounts like your Apple ID, email, and financial services. This adds a second layer of security, making it much harder for attackers to access your accounts\u2014even if they have your password.",

      "A Stanford University \"misinformation expert\" has been accused of using artificial intelligence (AI) to craft testimony later used by Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison in a politically-charged case.",
      "Jeff Hancock, a professor of communications and founder of the vaunted school's Social Media Lab, provided an expert declaration in a case involving a satirical conservative YouTuber named Christopher Kohls. The court case is about Minnesota's recent ban on political\u00a0deepfakes, which the plaintiffs argue is an attack on free speech.",
      "Hancock's testimony was submitted to the court by Ellison, who is arguing in favor of the law. Hancock is \"well-known for his research on how people use deception with technology, from sending texts and emails to detecting fake online reviews,\" according to Stanford's website.",

      "\"[The] Declaration of Prof. Jeff Hancock cites a study that does not exist,\" lawyers argued in a recent 36-page memo. \"No article by the title exists.\"",
      "The \"study\" was called \"The Influence of Deepfake Videos on Political Attitudes and Behavior\" and was purportedly published in the Journal of Information Technology & Politics. The Nov. 16 filing notes that the journal is authentic, but had never published a study by that name.",
      "\"The publication exists, but the cited pages belong to unrelated articles,\" the lawyers argued. \"Likely, the study was a \u2018hallucination\u2019 generated by an AI large language model like ChatGPT.\"",
      "\"Plaintiffs do not know how this hallucination wound up in Hancock\u2019s declaration, but it calls the entire document into question, especially when much of the commentary contains no methodology or analytic logic whatsoever.\"",
      "The document also calls out Ellison, arguing that \"the conclusions that Ellison most relies on have no methodology behind them and consist entirely of expert say-so.\"",
      "\"Hancock could have cited a real study similar to the proposition in paragraph 21,\" the memo states. \"But the existence of a fictional citation Hancock (or his assistants) didn\u2019t even bother to click calls into question the quality and veracity of the entire declaration.\"",

      "The memorandum also doubles down on the claim that the citation is bogus, noting the multiple searches lawyers went through to try to locate the study.",
      "\"The title of the alleged article, and even a snippet of it, does not appear on anywhere on the internet as indexed by Google and Bing, the most commonly-used search engines,\" the document states. \"Searching Google Scholar, a specialized search engine for academic papers and patent publications, reveals no articles matching the description of the citation authored by \u2018Hwang\u2019 [the purported author] that includes the term \u2018deepfake.\u2019\"",
      "\"Perhaps this was simply a copy-paste error? It\u2019s not,\" the filing later flatly states. \"The article doesn\u2019t exist.\"",
      "The attorneys concluded that, if the declaration were partially fabricated, it is entirely unreliable and should be dismissed from court consideration.",
      "\"The declaration of Prof. Hancock should be excluded in its entirety because at least some of it is based on fabricated material likely generated by an AI model, which calls into question its conclusory assertions,\" the document concluded. \"The court may inquire into the source of the fabrication and additional action may be warranted.\"",

There\u2019s usually a link that leads to a fake Apple site, asking you to enter your username, password and additional personal details to reactivate your account.

      "3. Don\u2019t click on suspicious links: If the email asks you to click a link, don\u2019t do it right away. Hover over the link to see the actual URL. If it doesn\u2019t look like an official Apple website (or any site you trust), don\u2019t click it.",

      "6. Invest in data removal services: Scammers often use personal information that\u2019s readily available online to craft more convincing phishing attempts. By investing in data removal services, you can reduce the amount of personal data that\u2019s exposed on the web, making it harder for scammers to target you effectively.",

      "Free email services may not charge you money directly, but they often monetize your data in other ways. These providers typically engage in data collection and analysis, which can lead to targeted advertising and tracking of your email activity.",

      "Secure email providers offer several advantages over their free counterparts. One of the most significant benefits is enhanced encryption, which provides better protection for your communications. Unlike many free services that collect and sell user data to third parties, privacy-focused providers do not engage in such practices.

First, you should research and choose a provider that meets your needs by comparing features, pricing and user reviews. Once you have made your selection, create an account with your chosen service; many offer a free tier to get started. After setting up your account, it is essential to enable encryption by following the provider's instructions.",
      "Next, you can import any existing emails from your old account using the provider's import tool. Informing your contacts about your new email address is also important to ensure seamless communication moving forward. To further enhance security, enable\u00a0two-factor authentication on your new account to add an extra layer of protection.

      "While paying for an email service might seem unnecessary at first glance, it is an investment in your privacy and security that can yield significant benefits over time. By choosing a subscription-based model, you support the development of privacy-focused technologies that prioritize user interests over advertising revenue.

Second, from all the companies that received your consumer profile, the ones listed (or not) in the fine print of the privacy policy. Third, from all the retailers you bought from in the past, including that one-time purchase of a kettlebell set three years ago (that you\u2019d rather forget).",
      "But that\u2019s not all; Black Friday is a fiesta for hackers, too, and the perfect time for social engineering attacks! The urgency and excitement of Black Friday deals encourage you to let your guard down. You\u2019re likelier to click on links or open attachments without checking the source. And less likely to notice that a phishing email pretending to be sent by a big retailer has sneaked into your inbox. Your data is being collected, shared and sold as you read this article.",

If you\u2019re ambitious, use the search function (Ctrl+F or Command+F) to find terms like \"opt out,\" \"unsubscribe\" or \"do not sell\" to quickly locate sections where you can limit data sharing. Depending on where you live, these options may simply not be available to you.",
      "An easier solution is to use a\u00a0disposable email address whenever you open an account for the sole purpose of making a purchase. Once you receive your order confirmation, you can disable it so that no further communication is sent your way. You can also use privacy-focused tools or browsers that block tracking cookies and prevent companies from collecting your data.",

      "8 tips to safeguard your email after Black Friday",
      "As the dust settles from the shopping rush, it's crucial to be proactive; here are eight essential tips to help you protect your email and personal information from the surge of spam and scams that often follow.",
      "1. Create alias email addresses.\u00a0An alias email address is an additional email address that can be used to receive emails in the same mailbox as the primary email address. It acts as a forwarding address, directing emails to the primary email address. An email alias address is a great way for you to stop receiving constant spam mail by simply deleting the email alias address.\u00a0See my review of best secure and private email services here.",
      "2. Use a\u00a0password manager to consistently use complex passwords that you can change frequently.",
      "3. Avoid opening attachments or clicking on links from emails unless you are sure they are from a trusted source. Scammers or hackers can easily change the name of the sender to make it look like it came from a legitimate organization such as Amazon or an individual.\u00a0 But if you click the email header, you will see the sender's actual email address. By pretending to be a reputable organization, the crooks send urgent messages to make you click on links, reply or provide personal information in an attempt to fix a problem or claim a reward. If you click on a malicious link, then a scammer may be able to access your email and other personal data.",
      "4. Have strong antivirus software on all your devices:\u00a0The best way to protect yourself from having your data breached is to have antivirus protection installed on all your devices. Having good antivirus software actively running on your devices will alert you of any malware in your system, warn you against clicking on any malicious links in phishing emails, and ultimately protect you from being hacked.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Malicious links are often disguised as legitimate ones, but they can download malware onto your device without your knowledge. Malware is a type of software that can damage your device, steal your personal information, or give hackers access to your data. Hackers can then use your data for various purposes, such as\u00a0identity theft, fraud or blackmail. This is why it is important to have antivirus software that can detect and remove malware before it causes any harm.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "5. Go directly to the official site where you have any accounts, such as your financial institution, to check if any changes or charges were made instead of clicking links in the email you received or responding to the email. This way, you can avoid falling for phishing scams and keep your account secure.",
      "6. Limit the number of accounts or profiles you create with your personal email account.",
      "7.\u00a0Regularly scrub your personal information on the internet. You don\u2019t want spammers to take your email and add it to their lists, do you? That would result in annoying and potentially dangerous messages flooding your inbox. To prevent that, you need to make sure your personal information is not exposed on the internet. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "8. Using a\u00a0VPN (Virtual Private Network) service can enhance your privacy by encrypting your internet traffic, making it harder for hackers and third parties to intercept your data, especially on public Wi-Fi. A VPN masks your IP address, helping to obscure your location and online activity. While VPNs don\u2019t directly prevent phishing emails, they reduce the exposure of your browsing habits to trackers that may use this data maliciously. With a VPN, you can securely access your email accounts from anywhere, even in areas with restrictive internet policies.\u00a0See my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "I've been scammed! What to do next?",
      "If a scammer gets hold of your email address, they can use it to access your other accounts, send phishing emails to trick you into revealing your passwords or personal details, or even impersonate you to commit fraud or other crimes. This is why it is important to protect your email address from falling into the wrong hands and to act quickly if you suspect that it has been compromised. Below are some next steps if you find you or your loved one is a victim of identity theft.",
      "1. If you can regain control of your accounts,\u00a0change your passwords and inform the account provider.",
      "2. Look through bank statements and checking account transactions to see where outlier activity started.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "3. Use\u00a0identity theft protection services to manage your personal information on and offline. Identity Theft protection companies can monitor personal information like your home title, Social Security Number (SSN), phone number, and email address and alert you if it is being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "One of the best parts of using identity theft protections services is that it can include identity theft insurance of up to\u00a0$1 million to cover losses and legal fees and a white-glove fraud resolution team where a U.S.-based case manager\u00a0helps you recover any losses.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "4.\u00a0Report any breaches to official government agencies like the Federal Communications Commission.",
      "5. You may wish to get the professional advice of a lawyer\u00a0before speaking to law enforcement, especially when you are dealing with criminal identity theft, and if being a victim of criminal identity theft leaves you unable to secure employment or housing.",
      "6.\u00a0Alert all three major credit bureaus and possibly place a fraud alert on your credit report.",
      "7. Run your own background check or request a copy of one if that is how you discovered your information has been used by a criminal.",
      "If you are a victim of identity theft, the most important thing to do is to take immediate action to mitigate the damage and prevent further harm.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Navigating the world of online shopping during Black Friday can be a thrilling yet daunting experience. While the discounts are enticing, they often come with hidden costs \u2014 namely, your personal data. As you prepare your shopping list, consider utilizing tools to safeguard your information.

      "Following an overnight missile and drone attack by Russia targeting Ukraine\u2019s key energy infrastructure, Russian President Vladimir Putin now says that government buildings in Kyiv could be targeted next using a new hypersonic missile that could also potentially reach the U.S.",
      "Russian attacks have not so far struck \"decision-making centers\" in the Ukrainian capital as Kyiv is heavily protected by air defenses. But Putin says Russia's Oreshnik hypersonic missile, which it fired for the first time at a Ukrainian city last week, is incapable of being intercepted.",
      "Russia fired the Oreshnik at the Ukrainian city of Dnipro on Nov. 21, striking a weapons production plant. This was in retaliation against Ukrainian strikes on a Russian military facility in Bryansk two days earlier with U.S. made long-range missiles called ATACMS, after\u00a0President Biden\u00a0had given Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy permission to do so.",

      "Russia says Ukraine fired more ATACMS at its Kursk region on Nov. 23 and Nov. 25.",
      "\"Of course, we will respond to the ongoing strikes on Russian territory with long-range Western-made missiles, as has already been said, including by possibly continuing to test the Oreshnik in combat conditions, as was done on November 21,\" Putin told a meeting of a security alliance of ex-Soviet countries in Kazakhstan.",
      "\"At present, the Ministry of Defense and the General Staff are selecting targets to hit on Ukrainian territory. These could be military facilities, defense and industrial enterprises, or decision-making centers in Kyiv,\" he said.",
      "The instrumentations of the Oreshnik missile \u2013 its sensors, electronics, data acquisition capabilities \u2013 are those of the Rubezh, a Russian\u00a0solid-fueled\u00a0intermediate-range ballistic missile\u00a0(IRBM). With its flight capability of between 310 miles and 3,100 miles \u2013 just 310 miles below the standard low limit of an ICBM \u2013 the Oreshnik can target most of Europe and the West Coast of the United States. After a launch, such a missile could probably hit Britain in 20 minutes and Poland in 12 minutes.",
      "The Oreshnik can be outfitted with a non-nuclear or nuclear warhead. And it is nearly impossible to intercept by existing missile defense systems because it is designed to fly at hypersonic speeds, reaching Mach 11.",
      "Putin said Russia's production of advanced missile systems exceeds that of the NATO military alliance by 10 times, and that Moscow planned to ramp up production further.",
      "His plans to increase production and ongoing strikes mean the conflict \u2013 which has already passed 1,000 days \u2013 shows no signs of abating.",

      "The attack consisted of firing nearly 200 missiles and drones with explosions being reported in Kyiv, Kharkiv, Rivne, Khmelnytskyi, Lutsk and many other cities in central and western Ukraine.",
      "The operation was Russia's second major aerial attack\u00a0on Ukraine's power grid in less than two weeks, with President Vladimir Putin saying on Thursday that the attack was a response to Kyiv's attacks on Russian regions using longer-range American missiles.",
      "The attack has raised fears in Ukraine that Russia is looking to cripple its energy infrastructure before the winter cold starts to bite and dampen Ukrainian spirits about the outcome of the war.",

The fact that the ICC lacked jurisdiction did not cause the ICC to pause even for a second. It was only President Trump\u2019s sanctions against the ICC (during his first term) that forced the ICC to obey the law and drop its threat to prosecute Americans.\u00a0Sanctions against the ICC will work; persuasion will not.\"",

Israeli leaders are guilty of defending their citizens from genocidal terrorists. France and the Netherlands were the first to confirm they would arrest PM Netanyahu and the list could reach 124 nations. Democracies beware you could be next.\"",
      "Both the Clinton and George W. Bush administrations branded the ICC a defective judicial system for Americans and rejected joining the international body.",
      "\"The arrest warrants against Netanyahu and Gallant are legally a joke, but they constitute a very serious development,\" Bell said. \"Under Karim Khan\u2019s predecessors as ICC prosecutor, the ICC was merely ineffective. Khan has ushered in an era of political buffoonery in which the court devotes the bulk of its resources to political grandstanding.

Countries should withdraw from the Rome Statute and cease paying dues. They should impose sanctions on the ICC and forbid cooperation with the ICC. And so long as the ICC persists in issuing warrants for persons over whom it has no jurisdiction on trumped-up charges, ICC personnel should face criminal sanctions for attempted kidnapping and support for terrorism.\"",
      "The ICC, which commenced operations in 2002, bases its authority on the signatories of\u00a0the Rome Statute, which outlines four core international crimes that the court will prosecute: genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and crimes of aggression, all of which are \"not subject to any statute of limitations\" but limited to only crimes that occurred after the statute came into force.",
      "When asked if anti-Jewish sentiments animated the ICC warrants, Bell said, \"I do not get the impression that the warrants are due to the ICC judges\u2019 personal antisemitism. The ICC has always preyed on the politically weak: formerly African countries and now the Jewish state. It is widespread antisemitism in the West, especially among progressives, that makes Israel politically weak and vulnerable. The ICC may be bigoted, but the ICC\u2019s attempt to prosecute Israelis despite their legal innocence is really a sign of a much greater institutional moral depravity than mere bigotry.\"",

    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump handed Ron DeSantis a political gift this month when he gave him a U.S. Senate seat to fill.",
      "Just don\u2019t expect the Florida governor to open it before Christmas.",
      "One of Trump's first major picks to fill his Cabinet was Florida Sen. Marco Rubio for secretary of state, as the president-elect stocks his nascent administration with political leaders from the state. The nomination will open up Rubio\u2019s seat, quickly stirring speculation about whom DeSantis would pick and how involved Trump, the state's most famous resident, will be in the process.",
      "Roughly two weeks after the Rubio announcement, however, DeSantis\u2019 team is still working through its options and does not plan to show its hand for at least a month, according to five people familiar with the process.",
      "\u201cThe governor will be conducting a thorough vetting process and interview process in December that will involve several candidates,\u201d a DeSantis adviser told NBC News. \u201cHe\u2019s not in a hurry to make an important decision.\u201d",
      "The governor has said he plans to make his selection by the beginning of January.",
      "In the immediate aftermath of the Rubio pick, two schools of thought emerged: DeSantis could appoint a placeholder who would serve until the terms ends and then run for the Senate himself in 2026 ahead of a likely 2028 presidential bid, or pick someone to serve in the seat for the long term.",
      "On that first choice, there appears to be resolution. DeSantis, two sources tell NBC News, is not likely to seek the Senate seat in 2026 or appoint himself to the spot, which is allowed. DeSantis does not appear poised to head to the Senate and has for now taken his name off the board.",
      "\u201cThe governor is not looking for a placeholder and seems unlikely to pursue the Senate himself,\u201d a Florida Republican close to DeSantis\u2019 team said.",
      "The next layer of intrigue that DeSantis must navigate is whether to placate Trump and his political team by appointing Lara Trump, the president-elect\u2019s daughter-in-law and co-chair of the Republican National Committee. Trump himself has not chimed in directly, but several of his top supporters quickly floated Lara\u2019s name after it was clear Rubio\u2019s seat would become vacant, including Elon Musk, who has been at Trump\u2019s side since election night.",
      "For her part, Lara Trump has done little to downplay the rumors.",
      "\u201cIf I am tapped to serve in another capacity, it truly would be my honor,\u201d she told Fox News over the weekend. \u201cI have not been asked yet, but I certainly would strongly consider it if it is presented to me.\u201d",
      "The Trump political team's pushing for DeSantis to appoint one of its own has once again opened up a complicated dynamic between the governor and the president-elect. The two men had a well-known allegiance after Trump endorsed DeSantis for governor in 2018, but that has since deteriorated after DeSantis unsuccessfully challenged Trump for the GOP presidential nomination in 2024.",
      "Trump, however, has become actively involved in Florida politics, and his presence now complicates many decisions that would ordinarily seem more cut-and-dry.",
      "\u201cLara Trump or not Lara Trump, that\u2019s the biggest question for him at this point,\u201d a longtime Florida Republican and DeSantis ally said. \u201cClearly Trump and his world wants Lara Trump, but does he [DeSantis] do that? Will he cave? It\u2019s unclear.\u201d",
      "The lens through which DeSantis is viewing the decision is relatively straightforward: 2028.",
      "If DeSantis gives Trump his pick, he may be less likely to face fierce pushback from the MAGA base during another potential presidential run. Conversely, if he bucks the president-elect, it could signal an erosion of the public truce the two sides have built since DeSantis left the presidential race in January.",
      "\u201cIt colors everything,\u201d the Florida operative close to DeSantis said. \u201cIf you believe it is important to not cross Trump, and I think most would agree with that, then all these things have to be viewed through that.\u201d",
      "If DeSantis decides not to pick Lara Trump, there is a growing number of potential state-level candidates populating the current short list, including Lt. Gov. Jeanette Nu\u00f1ez, Attorney General Ashley Moody, former House Speaker Paul Renner, Secretary of State Cord Byrd, former House Speaker Jose Oliva and DeSantis chief of staff James Uthmeier.",
      "Each have been staunch DeSantis allies and are well-known Florida Republicans likely to get through the interview and vetting process. Moody, in particular, has stirred speculation because Uthmeier, an attorney and top DeSantis political and policy adviser, has shown interest in being appointed Florida attorney general.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s been pretty open about it, and it\u2019s not a terribly well-kept secret,\u201d a longtime Florida lobbyist said of Uthmeier. \u201cNo idea if he will get there, but it\u2019s clear that\u2019s where he would like to go.\u201d",
      "Uthmeier didn't respond to a request for comment on the attorney general prospect for this article.",
      "DeSantis is not considering any Republicans from Florida\u2019s congressional delegation in large part because of the GOP\u2019s thin majority in the House \u2014 a margin made even smaller by Trump picking lawmakers for his administration, including Florida Rep. Mike Waltz to serve as national security adviser. He also initially nominated former Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz to serve as attorney general; Gaetz has since withdrawn his name from consideration and said he will not return to Congress next year.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think DeSantis wants to impact the Republican majority,\u201d a DeSantis ally familiar with his thinking said. \u201cIf there is a [Florida] member of Congress being considered, I don\u2019t know who that is.\u201d"

      "Which celebrities will be at the event?",
      "The ceremony and the show will be driven by music, with performances by the Backstreet Boys, Jennifer Hudson, the country duo Dan + Shay, Broadway star Megan Hilty, Thalia, known as the Queen of Latin Pop, and more, NBC said in a statement.",

      "NBC News' \"TODAY\" show anchors Savannah Guthrie, Hoda Kotb, Al Roker and Craig Melvin will also appear, it said.",
      "Where is this year's tree from?",
      "This year\u2019s tree is the first to hail from Massachusetts since 1959. It\u2019s a 74-foot tall, 43-foot-wide Norway spruce from West Stockbridge, and it arrived at Rockefeller Center on Nov. 9, according to the website for Rockefeller Center.",
      "This year\u2019s tree weights about 11 tons, it said.",
      "After mid-January, the tree will be donated to the nonprofit organization Habitat for Humanity so its wood can be used to build homes for those in need, NBC said in its statement.",
      "The tree was planted by newlyweds Earl Albert and his late wife, Leslie, in 1967, and he recently honored her memory by donating it to serve as the 2024 Rockefeller Center Christmas tree,\u00a0Albert said in an interview\u00a0in early November.",

      "What is the history of the tree lighting?",
      "The ceremony continues a long tradition.",
      "The first tree was erected at Rockefeller Center in 1931 by workers who pooled their money for the display, according to the tree\u2019s history page. Two years later, the lighting ceremony was born. In 1951, it was televised.",
      "When can I see the tree after the ceremony?",
      "After Wednesday night's event, the tree will be lit from 5 a.m. to midnight through mid-January. It will be lit for 24 hours on Christmas Eve but there will be an early cutoff, 9 p.m., for New Year's Eve, when revelers will fill nearby Times Square, Rockefeller Center said on its website."

    "story": [
      "The Summary",
      "Ancient footprints discovered in Kenya belong to two different species of human relatives who walked on the same ground at the same time, a study found. The prints are thought to belong to the species Homo erectus and Paranthropus boisei. The discovery raises questions about what kind of relationship and interactions the two species had.",
      "Ancient footprints discovered in Kenya belong to two different species of human relatives who walked on the same ground at the same time, a study found.",
      "The prints are thought to belong to the species Homo erectus and Paranthropus boisei.",
      "The discovery raises questions about what kind of relationship and interactions the two species had.",
      "A newly discovered set of footprints in Kenya provides the first evidence that two different species of ancient human relatives walked the same ground simultaneously 1.5 million years ago.",
      "The researchers behind the finding say the footprints belong to the species Homo erectus and Paranthropus boisei and were left within hours or days of one another \u2014\u00a0which opens up new mysteries about what happened when the two crossed paths.",
      "According to a study about the discovery, published Thursday in the journal Science, the footprints were embedded in dried mud near a lake in northern Kenya and buried in sediment at a prominent fossil site. By analyzing the prints\u2019 shapes and strike patterns, researchers found that the two sets were distinct; the best explanation, they concluded, is that two different species left the tracks.",
      "The study adds to a growing understanding among anthropologists and paleontologists that ancient human relatives likely interacted and co-existed. And, by extension, it raises questions about what kind of relationship the species had.",
      "\u201cWe think that these individuals, these two species that were there, probably would have been aware there were members of another species nearby. They would have seen each other and recognized each other as different species, which raises questions about what those interactions would have been like,\u201d said Kevin Hatala, an associate professor of biology at Chatham University and a lead author of the research. \u201cWere they competitors? Were they totally OK with each other being there?\u201d",
      "Although previously discovered fossil skeletons of Homo erectus and Paranthropus boisei showed that both species lived in the region at some point in time, the new finding provides evidence of direct overlap.",
      "It also shows that the two species walked on two feet in very different ways.",
      "While both are human relatives, Homo erectus and Paranthropus boisei featured very different traits, and their fates within the human evolutionary tree took starkly different routes.",
      "Homo erectus had a humanlike anatomy from the neck down. The species used stone tools and might have cooked with fire. Its members had a varied diet that likely included meat. The species eventually spread to Asia, Indonesia and other regions, and survived for more than 1 million years after the newly discovered footprints were made. Homo erectus last appeared in the fossil record a little over 100,000 years ago.",
      "\u201cLots of people have thought they are as good of a candidate as there is to be a direct ancestor of ours,\u201d Hatala said. \u201cThey seem to be a very successful species.\u201d",
      "Paranthropus boisei, meanwhile, featured smaller brains, massive chewing muscles and large molar teeth. William Harcourt-Smith, an associate professor of anthropology at Lehman College who was not involved in the study, said the species likely evolved to eat challenging foods like hard nuts or to grind away at tough, low-quality foods like shrubby plants.",
      "The species did not last on Earth for nearly as long as Homo erectus.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re thought to have gone extinct not too long after this, within the next few hundred thousand years,\u201d Hatala said, referring to the time of the footprints. He added that no one knows for sure what happened, but it\u2019s possible changes in the environment restricted their specialized diets.",
      "The footprints were initially discovered in 2021 in a place called Koobi Fora, while researchers were digging for other fossils. The site is a fossil hotspot because uplifting rock exposes old sedimentary layers at the surface, allowing researchers to access the bones of ancient humans and other animals.",
      "The following year, researchers excavated a set of about 12 footprints that appeared to walk in a line, then found another set of footprints running perpendicular.",
      "\u201cWe think these footprints were made in the mud in this lake shore environment. Something happened to bring sediment in over top of it. It could have been a small flood or a rise in the water level that carried in sediments and buried the footprints soon after they were formed,\u201d Hatala said.",
      "The muddy prints weren\u2019t trampled over by other animals and they showed no sign of cracking before they were buried by sand. The researchers said that means they were left within hours or days of one another.",
      "\u201cThe sediment protected them and prevented them from cracking and allowed them to be entered into the geologic record,\u201d Hatala said.",
      "He and his co-authors think the two species might have been able to co-exist in the area because their diets were so different. It\u2019s also possible they competed for resources and had an antagonistic relationship. The species seem to have lived in the same general area for hundreds of thousands of years.",
      "Harcourt-Smith, who works as a research associate in paleontology at the American Museum of Natural History, said the researchers\u2019 analysis was sound and that the site was unique.",
      "\u201cI really want to stress how unusual it is to have a site like this, how special it is and what a great chance we have to find out more,\u201d he said.",
      "Broadly speaking, Harcourt-Smith added, it has become increasingly clear that various ancient human species interacted across different habitats over the past 7 million years of evolution. The evolutionary pathway to modern humans is filled with side branches and species like Paranthropus boisei, which represent an evolutionary dead end.",
      "\u201cHuman evolution is complicated and messy and there\u2019s lots of experimentation. It\u2019s not a straight line,\u201d he said.",
      "Over the past few decades, scientists have developed genetic and archaeological evidence showing that humans, Denisovans and Neanderthals overlapped and sometimes interbred. The new study doesn\u2019t address interbreeding, but it does show more clearly that even older species overlapped and had more interaction than previously understood.",
      "After the researchers completed their work at the Koobi Fora site, photographing and documenting the footprints in several ways, they covered them up for future generations, said Craig Feibel, another author of the study.",
      "\u201cThey have to carefully rebury it with sediment that won\u2019t damage the footprints so erosion won\u2019t occur,\u201d he said."

    "published": "Thu, 28 Nov 2024 10:00:40 GMT",
    "summary": "Palm Springs became a playground for celebrities, but its development came at the expense of Black and Latino residents pushed into a neighborhood that was destroyed.",
    "story": [
      "An image from Gloria Holland\u2019s childhood remains clear in her mind: a man dressed only in his underwear, standing outside his front door pleading that his house in the Section 14 area of Palm Springs, California, not be demolished. The man ranted for several minutes until a bulldozer leveled the structure and he scampered to safety.",
      "\u201cI was 8 or 9 years old,\u201d Holland, now 70, said from her home outside Atlanta. \u201cIt was the first time I saw a grown man cry. It was traumatizing.\u201d",
      "The man and Holland were among 195 Black and Latino families whose homes were bulldozed and burned to the ground with little-to-no notice in the late 1950s and early \u201960s. The land, owned by Native Americans, had always been coveted by city officials, who wanted Palm Springs\u2019 downtown area to grow with luxury hotels and shops in building up a city known as a celebrity playground about 115 miles east of Hollywood.",
      "\u201cOn Friday, we were notified that we had to take anything we wanted out of the house by Monday \u2014 two days,\u201d Holland said. \u201cThat was it. It was awful.\u201d",
      "In 2022, the Section 14 Survivors Group filed a complaint against the city, seeking restitution for the hundreds of homes lost and lives suddenly upended. Earlier this month, the Palm Springs City Council unanimously voted to approve a multilevel settlement offer to former residents and descendants of those who lived in the Black and Latino neighborhood.",
      "\u201cIt is the responsibility of the city of Palm Springs to compensate individuals for the destruction of personal property,\u201d said council member Lisa Middleton during the hearing. \u201cWe broke something that was yours, and now we need to pay for it.\u201d",
      "As part of the settlement, 1,200 people will share $5.9 million in direct cash payments. The city also agreed to explore naming a community park in honor of the displaced, a public monument to the legacy of the former residents, and to establish a cultural healing center. The City Council also approved $21 million in housing and economic development programs to address past discrimination against its Black and Latino residents, which includes $10 million for a first-time homebuyer assistance program and $10 million to establish a community land trust.",
      "The city will also fund a $1 million small business program designed for \u201cempowering local business initiatives for marginalized communities.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a journey full of emotions, from sadness, anger, frustration to exhilaration,\u201d said Areva Martin, the attorney who represented the Section 14 Survivors for two years in their pursuit for justice. \u201cI knew that the conversation around reparations is a difficult one for a lot of people, particularly older Black people, many of whom have experienced so much racial trauma, but have been conditioned to live with it, not to complain about it, to repress it, and in some ways ignore it.\u201d",
      "To assure the City Council understood the impact of the displacement, Martin said she worked to convince her clients to \u201ctell their stories in ways that they had not before, because many of these people had never said out loud what happened to them. They hadn\u2019t told their children or their grandchildren. They definitely hadn\u2019t talked about it in a public forum. But I knew that to heal and to move forward, we needed to acknowledge the harms of the past.\u201d",
      "Doing so was difficult, Holland said. \u201cGoing through this situation brought up a lot of emotions and memories I had put away in the back of my mind,\u201d she said.",
      "Digging back to the past seemed to traumatize her all over again.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m sure a lot of my neighbors felt the same way,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause they had similar stories and I could look in their faces and see that they were seeing it all over again.\u201d",
      "Holland said her parents tried to shield the extreme nature of the displacement from her and to create normalcy.",
      "\u201cWe were fortunate enough to be building a new home and my mother would take me there to see it under construction,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I wanted my old home back. We had a community there. It was an idyllic place to live. We felt protected. No drugs. No crime. And they just took all that from us.\u201d",
      "Section 14, a square mile piece of land, was owned by the Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians. Because of racial covenants in the 1940, it was among the few places Black and Latino residents could live in Palm Springs. In 1959, the federal government opened up leasing agreements for the Agua Caliente Band and other tribes for up to 99 years, which sparked the interest of commercial real estate developers. Residents worked in various professions to help build and maintain the Palm Springs infrastructure: carpenters, plumbers, construction workers, maids, chefs, gardeners and others in domestic jobs.",
      "Despite that, the city, eyeing luxury tourism, gained control of the land from the tribe through a conservatorship and ordered the fire department to knock down and burn the homes.",
      "In 1969, a California\u00a0attorney general\u2019s report described what happened at Section 14 as a \u201ccity-engineered holocaust.\u201d",
      "Pearl Devers led the Section 14 Survivors group, starting in 2021, demanding that the city pay for the harms of destroying their community. She fought for her parents, who \u201csuffered more than we did,\u201d Devers said. \u201cThe adults lived through that madness. It tore our family apart.\u201d",
      "Her mother was a maid who worked at one time for legendary actor Lucille Ball. Her father built their home in Section 14. But when they were displaced, her father was rejected for a loan to buy another home.",
      "Devers\u2019 mother told her the pressures from redlining and racism led her father to alcohol. \u201cOur family was crushed,\u201d she said. \u201cMy dad never recovered from drinking.\u201d He died at 68.",
      "Devers said her brothers \u201cmissed having their father around,\u201d without getting specific. She said she often wonders what her and family\u2019s life would be like if they were never forced from their homes.",
      "So does Lawrence Williams, 77, who now lives in Columbia, Mississippi. He was \u201c10 or 11\u201d when he opened his front door to a man who operated a yellow bulldozer. Williams got his mother, Lucille McFarland, who was told they had the weekend to pack up before he returned on Monday morning to destroy their home.",
      "\u201cI still remember my mother sitting at that table crying,\u201d he said. \u201cMy mother was a maid and made $1.35 an hour; she didn\u2019t have money to just up and move. She didn\u2019t have a car.\u201d",
      "Williams and his younger brother went to a nearby store and brought back some boxes. They helped their mother pack up what they could. Devers\u2019 mom took Williams\u2019 mother house hunting, but it was difficult. She finally landed a place about 15 miles north of Palm Springs in a man\u2019s hunting trailer that had no bathroom or kitchen. They had to use the bathroom of the neighboring gas station. They endured those conditions for three months before finding a permanent place with more help from Devers\u2019 mother.",
      "\u201cTraumatizing,\u201d Williams said. \u201cI feared that whole summer that I was going to end up having to go to school there, an all-white school. Talking about this is like an old wound that starts bleeding again.\u201d",
      "McFarland, Williams\u2019 mother, is 101 and lives with him in Mississippi. When her son recently told her of the efforts to gain compensation for being displaced, she said, \u201cNo,\u201d her son said. \u201cIt\u2019s too traumatizing for her. She comes from Mississippi and has seen the Klan. Then that happened in California. She\u2019s been traumatized her whole life.\u201d",
      "The settlement has brought a sense of relief. Not the money, the survivors said, but the public acknowledgement of the harms committed.",
      "\u201cComing out victorious means everything for our parents,\u201d Holland said. \u201cThey kept us standing, thinking about them in this fight. I told Pearl, \u2018I don\u2019t think I can go another year with this.\u2019 We were tired, traveling back and forth to California to fight this. It shouldn\u2019t have taken this long to do the right thing.\u201d",
      "Martin, the attorney, said while they all rejoice in the victory, their work isn\u2019t over. They want to make sure all the components of the agreement come to fruition. She calls this case the \u201cjourney of a lifetime.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis was led by folks in their twilight years,\u201d she said. \u201cI mean retired folks, many in wheelchairs, on canes, walkers, failing health, folks who have been marginalized, villainized, forgotten, erased, and for the first time, seeing that their humanity and their dignity was being acknowledged. That\u2019s the victory.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Australian lawmakers on Thursday approved a landmark ban on social media for children under 16 in some of the world\u2019s toughest such controls.",
      "The ban, which aims to address the impact of excessive social media use on children\u2019s physical and mental health, affects social media platforms including X, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat and Reddit, but not YouTube.",
      "The platforms, which bear sole responsibility for enforcement, have one year to figure out how to implement the age limit, which is the highest set by any country. If there are systemic failures to keep children from having accounts, the platforms are liable for fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars ($33 million).",
      "Senators debated the legislation late into the night on the last day of their parliamentary session, which Prime Minister Anthony Albanese\u2019s center-left Labor government had targeted as the deadline for it to pass. The bill, which is also largely supported by the opposition Liberal Party, passed the House of Representatives on Wednesday by a vote of 102 to 13.",
      "Supporters of the ban have cited the effect of harmful depictions of body image on girls and the effect of misogynistic content on boys. Its passage comes after a series of Australian teenagers died by suicide over what their families said was online bullying.",
      "\u201cThe basis for this is that there is a feeling amongst the majority of Australians that social media does more harm than good,\u201d said Rob Nicholls, a senior research associate in media and communication at the University of Sydney.",
      "A YouGov poll released Tuesday found that 77% of Australians support the ban, up from 61% in August.",
      "Other countries have tried to impose limits on social media for children, including the U.S., which requires technology companies to obtain parental consent to collect data from children under 13.\u00a0But the Australian proposal goes further, with no exemptions for parental consent or pre-existing accounts.",
      "Opponents have criticized the Australian ban as too blunt an instrument and said its passage was too rushed.",
      "The bill, which was introduced in Parliament last week, allowed for only one day to submit opinions on it. Sen. Matt Canavan, who opposed the bill, said there had been 15,000 submissions about it during that day and that lawmakers had been able to review only a fraction of them.",
      "\u201cThis is a highly emotional issue and there is an understandable demand for politicians to be seen to be \u2018doing something\u2019 about it,\u201d he said Tuesday in a dissent that was published as part of a Senate committee report. \u201cYet it is also a highly complex area that should be examined carefully not in the hasty fashion that has beset this process.\u201d",
      "Google and Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, had urged Australia to delay the legislation\u2019s passage Tuesday, saying more time was needed to assess the potential impact of the ban. ByteDance, the Chinese company that owns TikTok, also said more consultation was needed.",
      "Elon Musk, the owner of X, blasted the ban last week as \u201ca backdoor way to control access to the Internet by all\u00a0Australians.\u201d",
      "Officials plan to enforce the age cut-off by trialing an age-verification system that could include biometrics or government identification, which no other country has tried, raising privacy concerns.",
      "A Senate committee signed off on the legislation late Tuesday but said social media platforms should find \u201calternative methods for assuring age\u201d rather than forcing users to submit personal information, such as their passports or other digital identification.",
      "Nicholls said the social media platforms would also be fined for failing to destroy personal information as soon as possible after they verifying users\u2019 ages.",
      "Outside the legislature, the ban has come under heavy scrutiny from parents and scholars who say social media can be a crucial source of support for young people, especially those who feel marginalized.",
      "\u201cSocial media provides vital connections for many young Australians, allowing them to access mental health resources, peer support networks, and a sense of community,\u201d Christopher Stone, executive director of Suicide Prevention Australia, said in a statement Wednesday.\u00a0\u201cCutting off this access risks exacerbating feelings of loneliness and isolation.\u201d",
      "The government has said it will ensure that young people have continued access to messaging apps such as WhatsApp, online gaming platforms such as Roblox and essential services related to health and education.",
      "\u201cYoung people, and in particular diverse cohorts, must be at the center of the conversation as an age restriction is implemented to ensure there are constructive pathways for connection,\u201d Sen. Karen Grogan, chair of the Senate committee on environment and communications legislation, said in its report.",
      "So far the government has not done enough to consult with young people, for whom social media is part of daily life, said Leo Puglisi, 17.",
      "\u201cThis is a government that is obviously not made up of teenagers, but it\u2019s making law about social media when they didn\u2019t grow up in the social media age,\u201d said Puglisi, the founder and chief anchor of 6 News Australia, a streaming news channel based in Melbourne that is majority-run by high schoolers.",
      "He said that while he is beyond the age cut-off, the ban would affect his audience, as well as the ability of some of the journalists on his team to do their work.",
      "In addition, he said, \u201cthere is certainly a possibility that every single Australian would need to use some form of ID to have social media. So in reality it would affect me, it would affect absolutely everyone.\u201d",
      "Daniel Angus, a professor of digital communication at Queensland University of Technology, said that the bill was \u201cillogical and uninformed\u201d and that it lacked critical details about how it will be implemented.",
      "The potential harms of social media the government cited are not sufficiently supported by high-quality research, Angus said in an email, noting that children who are disadvantaged, live in rural areas or are from minority groups rely on social media for community, education and advocacy.",
      "\u201cBy imposing a blanket ban, the government overlooks these essential and diverse experiences, thereby exacerbating existing inequalities,\u201d he said.",
      "He also said the exclusion from the ban of anonymous or web-based platforms such as 4chan \u201cparadoxically leaves young people vulnerable to some of the most harmful digital environments.\u201d",
      "The Heads Up Alliance, a grassroots collective of Australian parents seeking more restrictions on children\u2019s use of social media, said the bill was \u201cdeficient,\u201d giving it a grade of D+.",
      "The group said the ban would do nothing to address bullying on messaging apps, which also have \u201chighly addictive\u201d features.",
      "\u201cThese features are likely to end up resulting in the very downsides we are trying to avoid for our children: preoccupation with devices, less sleep, less nature, less sport, less real-life friendships, less concentration, exposure to sexualized content,\u201d the organization said in a statement.",
      "Exposure to sexual predators \u201cwill also remain a real risk\u201d on online gaming platforms and messaging apps, where many children banned from other social media are likely to migrate, the group said, adding: \u201cOur children will be jumping from the frypan into the fire.\u201d"

      "When can I see the tree after the ceremony?",
      "After Wednesday night's event, the tree will be lit from 5 a.m. to midnight through mid-January. It will be lit for 24 hours on Christmas Eve but there will be an early cutoff, 9 p.m., for New Year's Eve, when revelers will fill nearby Times Square, Rockefeller Center said on its website."

      "The film focuses on mega pop-star Bowyn Sykes (Jessica Lord), who has blond hair, bright red lips and often sports a cat-eye. Bowyn is at the height of her career, focused on making music her fans love, baking for fun and not looking for a new boyfriend after being tired of only dating \u201cserious actors and indie rockers.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Drew \"Gonzo\" Gonville (Laith Wallschleger) is one of the best wide receivers in the league who, from the outside, seems like a playboy, but he really loves hanging out with his family and niece.",

      "In \"Christmas in the Spotlight,\" Bowyn and Drew meet backstage at one of her concerts. Drew then attempts to get Bowyn\u2019s attention after their brief meet up backstage by inviting her to a game over social media.",

      "On their first date, which just so happens to be in Bowyn's private jet, the two have a myriad of song lyric interactions relating to Swift's \"I Can Do It With a Broken Heart.\" Bowyn says, \"I'm a tough kid.\" Then, Drew notes, \"You look like you\u2019re having the time of your life.\"",

      "The couple breaks up, but the world is still unaware they were ever together. While Bowyn privately mourns the relationship, the media begins speculating when she will release her next \"catchy break up\" song.",
      "Angry at the media and missing Drew, Bowyn decides to show up at his game and surprise him, sitting in his family box. (Swift and Kelce famously went public after she attended the Chiefs-Bears matchup at Arrowhead Stadium Sept. 24, 2023. She's since become a fixture in the box at Chiefs home games.)",
      "In the film, Drew, who initially wasn't having a great game, immediately turns it around after seeing Bowyn. After he scores a touchdown, Drew strikes Kelce's signature archer pose, which Swift has also made on stage during her aptly-titled song, \"The Archer.\"",

      "While initially heartbroken, Drew finally believes Bowyn after his brother (also a football player) and sister-in-law show him the full video, proving she tried to defend him.",

In 2020, the full, unedited clip was released online.",
      "After the truth is revealed, Drew resigns himself to thinking Bowyn is out of his league.",
      "Before Drew's football game and a Christmas gala he was supposed to host (notably featuring Bowyn as a guest performer), his niece gives him a friendship bracelet for good luck, spelling out an indecipherable mix of letters.",

      "\"I will always be your biggest cheerleader,\" he says, tying back to Swift's \"You Belong With Me\" once more, before asking her, \"Are we doing this?\"",
      "Bowyn responds, \"Let's freaking go\" \u2014 a PG version of a phrase Swift was caught on camera appearing to say after the Chiefs scored a touchdown in September 2023."

      "The documentary and a February 2024 People cover story also reference her alcohol use.

      "Throughout the documentary, multiple family members and Selby share their efforts to prevent Williams from drinking. Empty glasses and alcohol bottles are often shown around her apartment.

      "She fractured her shoulder in 2018",
      "In 2019, Variety reported that Williams fractured her shoulder in December of 2018, delaying her return to the show following the holidays. Williams was originally scheduled to return to the show on Jan. 7 but had to delay her return by a week to focus on recovery.",
      "She has lymphedema, especially in her feet",
      "In the documentary, Williams' lymphedema in her feet takes center stage at certain points. In one scene, she cries out and says she can't stand anymore. In another, she refuses to do exercises with a personal trainer to improve her stability out of fear of falling down.",
      "Lymphedema is a condition where the limbs \u2014\u00a0in Williams' case, her feet and legs \u2014 swell because the lymphatic system doesn't drain properly. Most often, it develops over a person's lifetime. It's not curable, and can be painful and lead to dangerous complications.",
      "\u201cThis is lymphedema,\u201d Williams says in the documentary as the camera shows her swollen feet. \u201cAnd I can only feel now 2% (of my feet). Do you see what this looks like?\u201d",

      "To understand the scene, you have to know what happens in \"Moana 2.\"",
      "In the movie, Moana (Auli\u02bbi Cravalho) and the demi-god Maui (Dwyane Johnson) set sail on yet another quest. This time, they're in search of Motufetu, a hidden land named at the bottom of the sea that her ancestors tried, and failed, to find.",
      "Motufetu is cursed by Nalo (voiced by Tofiga Fepulea\u2019i), a lightning god famous for hating humanity. The curse will be broken if a human reaches the land \u2014 and Moana manages to, becoming a demi-God in the process.",
      "Nalo returns in the mid-credits scene. Previously seen only as a thunderous cloud, this time he's in human form with purple eyes and a lightening aura. He sits in his throne room, frustrated over Moana and Maui breaking his curse. He summons his servant Matangi (Awhimai Fraser), then confronts her about not stopping Moana. Unbeknownst to Nalo, Matangi had helped Moana find Motufetu.",
      "Matangi tells Nalo that she already paid her debt by laying dormant as a guard to the Motufetu portal for thousands of years. In response, Nalo magically puts Matangi in a lightning handcuffs and tells her, \u201cWe\u2019re just getting started.\u201d",
      "As he begins scheming up ideas for vengeance, a familiar voice says, \u201cI can help you with that.\u201d",
      "Out of the shadows, and accompanied by an evil laugh, comes Tamatoa, the giant crab monster from the first movie voiced by Jemaine Clement. But after his brush with Moana, Tamatoa isn't looking as \u201cshiny\u201d as he used to.",
      "Tamatoa sketches out a plan for how he and Nalo can work together to bring down Moana and Maui.",

      "Will there be a \u2018Moana 3\u2019?",

      "While the rest of the world was waiting to see if Taylor Swift would make it to the Super Bowl in Las Vegas from her \u201cEras Tour\u201d concert in Tokyo to watch Travis Kelce, two women were invested in this year\u2019s game for a different reason.",
      "On Super Bowl Sunday, Samantha DiPippo,\u00a0Hallmark\u2019s senior vice president for programming, was at a watch party texting friends and fellow Hallmark executives.",
      "Their eyes were on the Kansas City Chiefs, a centerpiece of the NFL season if not for a star player\u2019s new courtship with the world\u2019s biggest pop performer, then for entering their fourth Super Bowl in five seasons. Those folks at Hallmark, a mainstay for romance lovers, had some ideas. Could another Lombardi Trophy for the Chiefs help bring those ideas to fruition?",
      "They were about to see \u2014 and the game was a nail-biter. The San Francisco 49ers held on to an early lead, 10-3, going into halftime. After Kansas City pulled ahead in the third quarter, the score was tied 19-19 by the fourth, sending the championship game into overtime.",
      "DiPippo\u2019s phone was blowing up with messages from her team. Then, thanks to the \u201cpower of the Chiefs,\u201d and, she says, \u201ca little bit of magic,\u201d Kansas City won 25-22 after a touchdown pass from quarterback Patrick Mahomes to wide receiver Mecole Hardman.",
      "\u201cCandice (DiLavore, senior manager at Hallmark) and I are just texting back and forth thinking, \u2018I hope this happens. I hope this happens,\u2019\u201d DiPippo recalls.",
      "\u201cAs it got closer and closer, I was like, \u2018Are we making a movie?\u2019\u201d",
      "The answer to that question became a resounding yes. That movie is Hallmark\u2019s \u201cHoliday Touchdown: A Chiefs Love Story,\u201d premiering on the network Nov. 30. The film was shot over a period of about 15 days on location in Kansas City, including three days at Arrowhead Stadium.",

      "Hallmark executive Samantha DiPippo",
      "TODAY visited the set of the film in July to meet the stars and see Jenna Bush Hager make her film debut with a cameo. This was all while witnessing firsthand the hundreds of extras, dozens of Christmas trees and four football fields worth of lights to make, in the words of DiPippo, \u201cthe largest movie that Hallmark Channel\u2019s ever done.\u201d",
      "A match made in Hallmark heaven",
      "\u201cHoliday Touchdown\u201d was announced in June as part of Hallmark\u2019s 2024 \u201cCountdown to Christmas\u201d lineup, which included a new partnership between the Chiefs and Hallmark.",
      "You\u2019re forgiven if you thought this movie would follow the true-to-life plot laid out by Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce\u2019s romance, though.",
      "For the uninitiated, the Swift-Kelce timeline looks like this: In September 2023, Swift attended a Chiefs home game after rumors that Swift and tight end Travis Kelce were an item. Kelce notably had attended her \u201cEras Tour\u201d show in Kansas City just months before, and after the concert, used his podcast to tell the world that he tried (and failed) to give Swift his number.",
      "The rest, as many know, is history.",
      "Though Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce\u2019s story produced an audience with an appetite for more football romance, \u201cHoliday Touchdown\u201d isn\u2019t about a player and a pop star (Lifetime has that movie); this follows a Chiefs employee and an NFL super fan.",
      "The screenwriter of \u201cHoliday Touchdown,\u201d Julie Sherman Wolfe, who\u2019s written more than 20 films for Hallmark, says she\u2019s always wanted to write \u201ca big football movie.\u201d The offer for this project came just a week after the Super Bowl, when her team, the 49ers, experienced that crushing defeat.",
      "When tackling the script, Wolfe says she leaned into her own family\u2019s unique superstitions and traditions.",
      "\u201cIt really was coming from a place in my heart about what we love the most about the game. I guess I would love people to know that you don\u2019t have to be a Chiefs fan to enjoy this movie,\u201d Wolfe says. \u201cThe Chiefs are in the movie, and it is about them, but it\u2019s about more than that. It\u2019s about things that are bigger than a team. It\u2019s about your team.\u201d",
      "\u201cHoliday Touchdown\u201d first introduces Alana (Hunter King) and her family of Chiefs super fans who run a merch store. In comes Derrick (Tyler Hynes), who\u2019s in charge of fan engagement for the Chiefs and oversees the annual fan of the year contest (which is real, by the way). Alana\u2019s family is, of course, in the running.",
      "Though Wolfe says one doesn\u2019t have to love the Chiefs to appreciate the movie, its cameos will elate those who do: NFL mom Donna Kelce, Chiefs head coach Andy Reid and players Mecole Hardman, Clyde Edwards-Helaire and George Karlaftis all appear.",
      "The film even took inspiration from a real job in the Chiefs org. Jayne Martin has been the vice president of fan experience for 23 seasons. She says she is \u201cbridging the gap between the team and our fans.\u201d",
      "In March, Wolfe spoke with Martin to go over the premise of the storyline. They touched on Martin\u2019s job responsibilities and walked through potential scenarios that the film\u2019s leading man might encounter.",
      "\u201cIt was very important for (Wolfe) to ensure that the narrative was realistic,\u201d Martin says.",
      "Wolfe also brought aspects of her own football fandom to the plot. Alana\u2019s last name, Higman, came from her friend\u2019s maiden name, in honor of her family of Chiefs fans. Derrick\u2019s last name meanwhile is Young \u2014 a nod to the Chiefs\u2019 Super Bowl competitors.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s for Steve Young from the 49ers,\u201d Wolfe says. \u201cI had to put something in there.\u201d",
      "Then there\u2019s the Higmans\u2019 lucky Chiefs hat, which drives a subplot. Alana\u2019s family has a superstition: The Chiefs only go to the Super Bowl when that old beanie is worn by a family member on Christmas. Derrick doesn\u2019t believe it though \u2014 so when the hat goes missing, things go awry.",
      "Originally, Wolfe\u2019s draft referenced a vintage Chiefs baseball hat. After they sent a couple pages of the script to the Chiefs, DiPippo recalls one of the team\u2019s executives saying, \u201cI\u2019m reading this, and I\u2019m just thinking of my grandpa. My grandfather had a vintage Chiefs winter hat, and he would wear it all the time while he was shoveling snow, and that\u2019s my memory of him.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m reading it, I\u2019m in my kitchen crying, and I text one of our other execs, and I said, \u2018It\u2019s a winter hat now, it\u2019s a winter hat now!\u2019\u201d DiPippo says.",
      "The Taylor Swift of it all",
      "It\u2019s undeniable that NFL experienced in 2023 season what has been dubbed the \u201cTaylor Swift effect,\u201d or the increase in exposure and female audience that follows the famous singer.",
      "\u201cThe magic, the romance of the Taylor Swift and Kelce union really got people in that romance mood \u2014 and romance plus football, right?\u201d Wolfe says.",
      "Exactly. For Hallmark, project ideas really started flowing in December 2023, after a pair of commercials leaned into just that.",
      "The first was a Hallmark ad, which aired Christmas Day on ESPN and stars Wolfe herself. In it, she sits at her computer as if typing a screenplay and lists the many ways the 2023 NFL season played out like a Hallmark movie, from \u201cincredible stories\u201d to \u201cunexpected romance.\u201d",
      "Then in January, the Chiefs released a postseason commercial titled \u201cFalling for Football,\u201d which is framed as a spoof trailer for a Hallmark-esque film about a diehard NFL fan who works at a Chiefs gift shop. (Sound familiar?) Hynes plays that fan, and Donna Kelce notably makes a cameo.",
      "DiPippo says the ESPN ad was a \u201cgreat catalyst\u201d to \u201cHoliday Touchdown.\u201d Then \u201cFalling for Football,\u201d which she calls a \u201clittle bit of a love letter to Hallmark,\u201d helped inspire the premise of the movie.",
      "Hynes says that when the Chiefs approached him for the \u201cFalling for Football\u201d commercial, it felt a little more \u201ctongue in cheek.\u201d But starring in \u201cHoliday Touchdown\u201d required him to treat the type of film spoofed in the commercial with integrity.",
      "\u201cThis is a legitimate Hallmark movie that is filled with all the heart, sincerity, warmth and joy that these movies always have,\u201d says Hynes, who has been in more than 15 Hallmark films, including six in the 2024 season.",
      "Martin says Chiefs fan demographics have changed since Swift first appeared at Arrowhead Stadium and is now about 57% female. \u201cHoliday Touchdown\u201d is an example of an attempt to reach and engage that new audience with the Chiefs and the NFL as a whole, Martin says.",
      "\u201cI honestly feel like everything about this movie was meant to happen when it happened.\u201d",
      "Screenwriter Julie Sherman Wolfe",
      "Though DiPippo believes Hallmark\u2019s partnership with the Chiefs could have happened without Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce \u2014 \u201cIt\u2019s 100% a pure Hallmark movie at heart,\u201d she says \u2014 Wolfe believes\u00a0a little of fate was still at play.",
      "\u201cI honestly feel like everything about this movie was meant to happen when it happened. It was meant to be,\u201d Wolfe says. \u201cThey got the right people and the right time and Travis and Taylor, and everything happened the way it was meant to happen for this movie.\u201d",
      "While appearing on TODAY Nov. 27, Hynes said it's \"impossible\" for the Swift-Kelce inspiration \"to not find its way into the movie.\"",
      "\"We're telling a multigenerational family story,\" he said. \"It feels like something quintessentially Hallmark while still servicing the people who want to see a big football movie.\"",
      "Christmas in July",
      "While \u201cHoliday Touchdown\u201d strays from Kelce and Swift's relationship, being part of the film is surreal for star Hunter King, who identifies as a Swiftie and has her own \u201cinvisible string\u201d connection to it all.",
      "Kelce and Swift\u2019s storybook romance notably started after he attended an \u201cEras Tour\u201d concert in Kansas City. On July 7, King attended a Kansas City show with her sister, actor Joey King, who appeared in Swift\u2019s \u201cMean\u201d music video in 2011, then in \u201cI Can See You\u201d almost 13 years later. At that July 7 concert, Joey King joined Swift onstage.",
      "\u201cThe day that we started filming I think was almost exactly a year later,\u201d Hunter King says. \u201cSo I was like, \u2018Wait a second. It really is a full circle moment for me.\u2019\u201d",
      "The production kicked off shrouded in secrecy. Casting was \u201cincredibly difficult,\u201d DiPippo says, because they couldn\u2019t share many details about the project, and \u201ceverything had NDAs.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is the most secretive we\u2019ve ever had to be on any project,\u201d DiPippo says.",
      "So when production started up around Kansas City in July, it drew a crowd. In addition to Arrowhead Stadium, \u201cHoliday Touchdown\u201d was filmed in the suburb of Independence, Missouri. The local pizzeria Square Pizza was transformed into a fictional barbecue restaurant called Norma & Nic\u2019s, managed by Donna Kelce\u2019s character. Inside, garlands with red ornaments bordered the ordering counter. Chiefs memorabilia hung on the walls, and wreaths decorated every door.",
      "The entire production involved about two dozen Christmas trees used in rotation \u2014 including 18 used in one day \u2014 as well as more than 400 yards of lights of \u201cevery color ornament bulb you can imagine,\u201d according to Daniel King, \u201cHoliday Touchdown\u2019s\u201d production designer.",
      "Most behind the scenes were met with challenges, like set decorator Christi Whiteley, who was in charge of decorating and re-decorating up to 20 trees over the course of a few days, and property master Hunter Nelson, who made sure edible props like holiday meals and gingerbread houses were preserved at certain temperatures.",
      "And speaking of temperatures \u2014 the July heat was a hurdle for everyone.",
      "At Arrowhead, about 1,000 extras filmed inside the stadium, wearing parkas, scarves and other winter gear as the temperature reached 99 degrees, though felt more like 102, according to the Weather app.",
      "Hunter King filmed the Arrowhead Stadium scenes with an ice pack in her pants, a neck fan and an undershirt fan. On a discomfort scale of 1 to 10, Hunter King says filming in the sun felt like a 9.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s mostly the sweaters and then the coat over it, and in this heat and in the humidity, that\u2019s what really, really cranks it up a notch,\u201d she says.",
      "The heat didn\u2019t deter fans, though. At one point, while filming in Independence, there were about 70 people watching and standing in the sun, DiPippo recalls.",
      "\u201cThey were coming in Chiefs gear. There were kids, there were grandparents. It was just so cute to see how excited they were just because we\u2019re filming in their town,\u201d she says.",
      "TODAY\u2019s Jenna Bush Hager, who makes a cameo as a sports journalist, wore a heavy wool coat paired with a sweater-like tank top and white trousers. While rehearsing her scene on the field of Arrowhead, crew members held up umbrellas for the actors. One of the director\u2019s last calls before \u201caction\u201d was the cue to put on jackets. The first thing each actor did after hearing \u201ccut\u201d was rip those coats off.",
      "Chiefs players Mecole Hardman, Clyde Edwards-Helaire and George Karlaftis appear in the film during a game scene, so they got to dress in their Chiefs uniforms.",

    "published": "Tue, 26 Nov 2024 14:43:31 GMT",
    "summary": "\"Wicked's\" director and costume designer say why Dorothy's ruby red slippers from \"The Wizard of Oz\" are silver in \"Wicked.\"",
    "story": [
      "The ruby slippers worn by Judy Garland in the 1939 classic \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d became nearly as iconic as the film itself. So why were the slippers silver in \u201cWicked\u201d?",
      "Some sharp-eyed fans noticed the change in the film adaptation of the Broadway show starring Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo, based on Gregory Maguire\u2019s 1995 novel \u201cWicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West.\u201d",
      "And as it turns out, the choice to include the silver slippers was actually staying true to the original source text: In L. Frank Baum\u2019s book \u201cThe Wizard of Oz,\u201d the magic slippers were, in fact, silver.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re not ruby,\u201d \u201cWicked\u201d costume designer Paul Tazewell said in an interview with People. \u201cIn the book, they were these odd little silver boots.\u201d",
      "Tazewell explained he took what happened in Maguire\u2019s novel as a starting point for his creation that ended up in the film.",
      "In \u201cWicked\u201d the book, Nessarose is described as wearing iridescent shoes that seem to \u201cpulse with hundreds of reflections and refractions.\u201d Glinda later enchants the shoes to help Nessarose walk (though in the Broadway play, Elphaba is the one to cast the spell).",
      "Marissa Bode, who plays Nessarose in \u201cWicked,\u201d ultimately wears silver heels with swirls and sparkles in the film, paying homage to the original while also wearing something unique to the film, Tazewell said.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s the idea of Cinderella and the glass slipper, and then it\u2019s like how we make shoes a myth and how we\u2019ve indulged them into our fantasy fairytale storytelling,\u201d he said.",
      "In the 1939 film, the move from silver to sparkly red was a stylistic change made to emphasize the contrast between the yellow brick road and Dorothy\u2019s gorgeous heels.",
      "\u201cFor the Technicolor movie, costumers created ruby red shoes to show up more vividly against the yellow-brick road,\u201d reads the Smithsonian description of a pair of the ruby slippers used in the film and now housed in the museum in Washington, D.C. Garland wore several pairs when making \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d; another of them is currently up for auction.",
      "\u201cWicked\u201d director Jon M. Chu also weighed in on the change in an interview with Variety, when he was asked if it was true that MGM, which produced \u201cThe Wizard of Oz,\u201d had the copyright for both the ruby slippers and the yellow brick road. (TODAY has not independently confirmed MGM\u2019s copyrights.)",
      "\u201cWe had boundaries of what we could reference or not. We never use the ruby slippers,\u201d Chu explained. \u201cNessa has on crystal slippers as in the Frank L. Baum book, Gregory Maguire book and the show.\u201d",
      "He continued: \u201cI don\u2019t think the phrase \u2018yellow brick road\u2019 is copywritten, but definitely the shape of the road is. We couldn\u2019t do the spiral. We had to do a circle that continues to show it\u2019s not where the road ends.\u201d",
      "Some eagle-eyed viewers may have noticed an Easter egg paying homage to \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d when Glinda, played by Grande, briefly grabs a pair of sparkly red slippers while she\u2019s performing \u201cPopular\u201d in the film.",
      "She gifts the shoes to Elphaba, portrayed by Erivo, promising her she\u2019ll do everything she can to help make the future Wicked Witch of the West the most well-liked girl at Shiz.",
      "It turns out the creators of \u201cWicked\u201d have had the power to change the color of the iconic slippers all along, my dear."

      "The road to victory, however, was a long time coming. Goodall initially tried out for the show in 2009, but he didn\u2019t make the cut. He eventually tried out again, thanks to encouragement from his wife, Angela, whom he married several days prior to the Sept. 24 season finale.",

He was anxious, but his nerves would melt away when his time to shine came.",

      "With hundreds of people working to rebuild a structure so intimately tied to French art, history and culture, it felt natural to start a choir, said Stephanie Duch\u00eane, a conservation scientist and chemical engineer who helped form the Notre-Dame Compagnons Choir, or Notre Dame Companions, nearly two years ago.",
      "Much like the building and rebuilding of a cathedral, a small army of individuals needs to work in unison to create extraordinary music.",

It will be part of a weekslong celebration marking the long-awaited reopening.",

      "But as extreme weather becomes more the norm and temperatures rise across the planet, what is supposed to be a critical year for funding mitigation efforts has instead turned out to be an especially frustrating one.",
      "Nearly 50,000 people from 200 countries \u2014 including, for the first time, the Taliban rulers of Afghanistan \u2014 were in Azerbaijan for this year\u2019s United Nations Climate Change Conference, with the goal of reaching a critical deal on climate finance. The conference was set to end\u00a0Friday but negotiations over funding extended into the weekend.",
      "A draft of a deal to help the world adapt to and deal with climate change released at the conference, known as COP29, pledged $250 billion annually by 2035 from wealthy countries to poorer ones. While rich nations say it\u2019s realistic and about the limit of what they can do, it is less than a quarter of the number requested by developing nations struck hardest by extreme weather.",
      "The conference was already shadowed by the victory of President-elect Donald Trump, who withdrew the United States from the Paris Agreement climate change treaty the first time he was president and has vowed to do so again. The atmosphere had also been dampened by poor attendance by world leaders, particularly from wealthy nations.",
      "Developing countries are seeking $1 trillion a year by the end of the decade, much of it from developed economies, to transition to green energy and adapt to extreme weather driven by climate change.",
      "As the World Meteorological Organization says 2024 is on track to be the hottest year on record, some experts are so worried they are calling for a completely new approach. In an open letter published last week, signatories including former U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said the whole framework of U.N. climate talks is \u201cno longer fit for purpose.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe can choose to be proactive about climate, and the time for being proactive is rapidly shrinking,\u201d said Ruth Townend, a senior research fellow at the London-based think tank Chatham House who attended the conference. \u201cOr we can choose to be reactive, which is much more expensive, much harder and has a higher human cost.\u201d",
      "Some of the highest human costs will be paid by smaller nations that are disproportionately affected by climate change, including Pacific Island nations whose existence is threatened by rising seas. But with COP29 weighed down by geopolitics and domestic turmoil, some were reluctant to attend at all.",
      "Deepening divides",
      "Top leaders from a number of major economies were notably absent in Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan.",
      "They included President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping, leaders of the two biggest carbon emitters. Though British Prime Minister Keir Starmer did attend, most other leaders of the Group of Seven leading industrialized countries did not, including French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba.",
      "While the bulk of the work happens among lower-level negotiators during long nights in windowless rooms, the presence of heads of state has symbolic value, Townend said.",
      "\u201cIt is really disappointing to see that world leaders haven\u2019t shown up in force in solidarity,\u201d she added.",
      "Despite his physical absence, one person whose presence has been felt here is Trump.",
      "U.S. officials have sought to reassure conference attendees after Trump\u2019s victory.",
      "While Trump \u201cmay put climate action on the back burner,\u201d U.S. climate envoy John Podesta said, \u201cthe work to contain climate change is going to continue.\u201d",
      "U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said states, cities, nongovernmental organizations and companies are still \u201call-in\u201d on pursuing climate goals. She also noted that 80% of the funding from Biden\u2019s two signature bills, the Inflation Reduction Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, has gone to Republican districts including to promote the manufacturing of electric vehicles, wind turbines and solar panels.",
      "She said Trump could slow, but not stop, U.S. climate efforts.",
      "\u201cIt would be political malpractice to undo those opportunities when people are just now getting hired,\u201d Granholm told NBC News. Some 400,000 people have been hired because of the bills, she added.",
      "Even companies that stand to benefit from Trump\u2019s pledge to loosen restrictions on oil and gas exploration have expressed concern. Darren Woods, chief executive of Exxon, said he hoped the Trump administration would take a \u201ccommon sense approach\u201d to reducing emissions and remain in the Paris Agreement.",
      "Meeting the goals under the agreement, which include keeping global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) over pre-industrial temperatures, could cost as much as $8 trillion annually, according to a report released last week by the Independent High Level Expert Group on Climate Finance.",
      "Who foots the bill?",
      "Nations that are highly affected by climate change despite being relatively small emitters themselves have grown frustrated with major polluting countries they see as shirking responsibility for helping them cover the costs and trying to hold back their development in the name of environmental protection.",
      "The host of the conference, Azerbaijan President Ilham Aliyev, struck a tone of defiance in his keynote address, saying countries like his should not be castigated for exporting fossil fuels, especially by the U.S. and other wealthy nations that continue to rely on them.",
      "Aliyev and others whose countries have developed more recently, many of which were colonized by the West, say they should not be punished economically for the past emissions of wealthier nations.",
      "\u201cWho created this pollution that we have? It\u2019s 120 years of industrial revolution,\u201d Saudi Arabia\u2019s climate envoy, Adel Al-Jubeir, said.",
      "Lord Adair Turner of Britain, who chairs a global coalition known as the Energy Transitions Commission, said the Saudi climate envoy was living in a \u201cdiplomatic fantasy land.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor Saudi Arabia to say \u2014 with its level of per capita income \u2014 that it\u2019s a developing country is an insult to true developing countries like in sub-Saharan Africa,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cWe are going to have to have financial flows not just from rich developed countries in the classic sense in the G7, but also from the rich countries of the Middle East and indeed also from China.\u201d",
      "Though China industrialized later than many of the world\u2019s biggest polluters, analysts from the U.K.-based Carbon Brief said during the conference that China had surpassed the European Union as the world\u2019s second-biggest historical emitter after the United States.",
      "The infighting has only further exasperated Pacific Island nations such as Papua New Guinea, whose Prime Minister James Marape said in August that it would boycott the Baku conference as \u201ca protest at the big nations\u201d that continue emitting while balking at paying.",
      "Marape did eventually send a delegation under pressure from activists.",
      "Even as many world leaders skipped the conference or tried to, it also had first-time attendees from Taliban-led Afghanistan. Though the Taliban have struggled to gain international recognition over their rollback of women\u2019s rights and other abuses, Afghanistan is one of the countries most vulnerable to climate change.",
      "The agriculture-reliant country has been pushed into a \u201cperil position,\u201d said Asadullah Jawid, an assistant professor at the American University of Afghanistan who has studied the effects of climate change on the country\u2019s farmers.",
      "\u201cDecades of war and instability, economic challenges, devastated infrastructure and an impoverished workforce have left Afghanistan with few resources for climate adaptation initiatives,\u201d he said.",

    "published": "Mon, 25 Nov 2024 14:07:42 GMT",
    "summary": "The 2024 World Chess Championship is set to kick off this week, a showdown between 18-year-old Gukesh Dommaraju of India and reigning champion Ding Liren of China.",
    "story": [
      "One of the world\u2019s biggest sporting competitions got underway Monday morning, with reigning champion Ding Liren taking game 1 of the World Chess Championship against 18-year-old phenom Gukesh Dommaraju.",
      "While the world championship is still considered chess' marquee event, the absence of Norway\u2019s Magnus Carlsen, the five-time champion who declined to defend his title in 2022, looms large.",
      "Grandmaster David Howell, a close friend of Carlsen\u2019s who is also one of the official match commentators in Singapore, believes the world championship still holds a special place in the chess world, but said this year is unique.",
      "\u201cFor a long time, it\u2019s been the one thing that defines what has been otherwise quite a disorganized tournament system,\u201d Howell said. \u201cNormally, the world championship is very successful at finding and celebrating the best player in the world. It\u2019s still got a lot of prestige, but this year it\u2019s a bit of a strange one.\u201d",
      "In some ways, the $2.5 million showdown between Liren, a soft-spoken assassin from China, and Gukesh, an up-and-coming prodigy from India, should be the biggest world championship yet.",
      "A chess boom during the pandemic has made the game more popular than ever, but that surge of interest has mainly been felt online. Chess.com now boasts 190 million users worldwide, up from 51 million in January 2020. The world\u2019s biggest chess platform told NBC News that 1 in 10 Americans have an account. Chess.com is also busy organizing its own money-spinning tournaments, slowly encroaching on the game\u2019s governing body, the International Chess Federation, also known as FIDE.",
      "That\u2019s led to a growing discussion over whether the championship format \u2014 14 games that often last more than three hours each \u2014 still works for a game that is often embracing quicker matches.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a big debate over whether it needs to be modernized, or whether it\u2019s still the most efficient way of finding the best player in the world,\u201d Howell said. \u201cI still think it does a fantastic job at that. It\u2019s no one\u2019s fault that the world No. 1 has stepped aside.\u201d",
      "The legacy of Magnus Carlsen",
      "Carlsen, who has dominated the chess world for over a decade, vacated the title in 2022, citing a lack of motivation. While Ding technically succeeded Carlsen, the Norwegian remains the consensus best player in the world and the sport\u2019s most marketable figure.",
      "Known as the \u201cGOAT\u201d (a popular acronym for the \u201cgreatest of all time\u201d), Carlsen has been a towering presence in chess since his teenage years. His last title defense, a dramatic series against Russia\u2019s Ian Nepomniachtchi in 2021, drew record-breaking online audiences. At the height of the chess boom fueled by the pandemic and Netflix\u2019s \u201cThe Queen\u2019s Gambit,\u201d Carlsen seemed poised to turn chess into a mainstream spectator sport.",
      "However, in 2022 Carlsen\u2019s image took a hit when he was drawn into a cheating scandal. Carlsen implied grandmaster Hans Niemann, then a teenager and one of the game\u2019s rising young stars, cheated when he beat him at the Sinquefield Cup. It led to a $100 million lawsuit before the players settled in August last year and said they had moved on from their rift. The terms of the settlement have not been made public.",
      "Howell noted that it\u2019s not particularly rare for the world chess championship to be without the game\u2019s top player.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s happened throughout history,\u201d he said. \u201cThere have been several cases of a player being world champion, but maybe not being the strongest on paper. Thinking back, there was Max Euwe, maybe [Vasily] Smyslov, [Tigran] Petrosian and then [Vladimir] Kramnik later on. They weren\u2019t the No. 1 at the time, but they were the world champion.\u201d",
      "The stakes for Ding and Gukesh",
      "Beyond Carlsen\u2019s absence, the game of chess and its upcoming championship also face some broader challenges, including geopolitical tensions and questions about the form of one of the competitors.",
      "The most immediate challenge is Ding. The reigning champ is a move-calculating machine. But as he prepares for the biggest test of his career, Ding has at times looked badly out of sorts.",
      "Ding claimed the championship in 2023 after a dramatic match against Nepomniachtchi. The series was tied 7-7 after three weeks, with Ding recovering from a terrible start to clinch a comeback victory. It was a proud moment for China and affirmed its status as a chess superpower. But since then, the 32-year-old\u2019s form has gone from bad to worse.",
      "After taking a nine-month break, Ding returned to competition with disappointing results. His performance at Norway Chess in June was particularly alarming after he lost four games in a row \u2014 an unprecedented showing for a world champion. Ding has looked anxious at times, and his results have seen him slump to world No. 23 in the latest FIDE rankings.",
      "Ding admitted to mental health challenges, revealing how self-doubt and anxiety have affected his game.",
      "Facing Ding in this year\u2019s championship is Gukesh, a prodigy aiming to become the youngest world champion in history. Gukesh represents a new wave of Indian talent inspired by Viswanathan Anand, India\u2019s first world champion, who won the title in 2007 to break Russia\u2019s stranglehold over the sport.",
      "In stark contrast to Ding\u2019s struggles, Gukesh has been in serene form. In September, he led India to its first-ever team gold at the Chess Olympiad in Budapest, scoring an impressive 9/10. Currently ranked 18 places above Ding, Gukesh has overtaken his rival as the favorite.",
      "Politics and power struggles",
      "Adding to the intrigue is the championship\u2019s political backdrop. Chess likes to present itself as a major world sport, but it remains one of the few still dominated by Russian leadership. FIDE, the international chess federation, is headed by Arkady Dvorkovich, a former Russian deputy prime minister.",
      "Despite global sanctions following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, FIDE has retained strong ties to Moscow, fueling criticism that the game is a tool of Russian soft power.",
      "Russia\u2019s influence on chess is long-standing. For decades, Soviet and Russian players dominated the world championship, with only a few exceptions like Bobby Fischer and Anand breaking the mold. This year, however, there are no Russian contenders in the final, a rarity that underscores the shifting landscape of global chess. Nepomniachtchi is the sole Russian in the top 10.",
      "Howell points to \u201ca clear shift\u201d over the past 10 years away from Russia and toward China and India.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know how many resources are going into chess in China. It\u2019s very much a mystery. But in India, a huge amount of government support and sponsorship is funding chess. It\u2019s not a coincidence that there\u2019s a golden generation emerging right now. So in terms of dominance, India seems to be the new Russia.",
      "\u201cThis is the battle of Asia,\u201d Howell added. \u201cIt is the two superpowers, India and China, battling it out. They\u2019re not going to be the first Asian world champions, but it\u2019s still huge for growing the game in India, which is probably the biggest chess economy right now.\u201d",
      "The 14-game match will run until Dec. 12 (or 13 if tiebreaks are needed). The FIDE World Chess Championship is presented by Google, with online coverage and commentary provided by FIDE and Chess.com."

      "KYIV, Ukraine \u2014 More than 700,000 homes and businesses were without power across a frigid Ukraine early Thursday after Russia launched a widespread missile and drone attack on the country\u2019s energy sector.",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin said the \u201ccomplex strike\u201d was a retaliation for Ukraine\u2019s using American-made ATACMS missiles to strike inside Russia. Despite the widespread civilian impact, he claimed, without evidence, that the assault targeted military sites.",
      "Air raid sirens began to ring out late Wednesday and blared for more than nine hours. People across the country took refuge in bomb shelters, subway stations and even their own bathrooms, waiting out the bombardment alongside strollers, pets and what few blankets they could carry.",
      "The power grid was targeted just as cold weather begins to bite, a tactic that Ukrainian officials and Western analysts say Russia deliberately deploys. The temperature is forecast to stay below 35 degrees Fahrenheit all of Thursday, with fog in the air and snow already covering Kyiv\u2019s roofs.",
      "\u201cIt was about 6 a.m. I was sleeping and heard a very loud explosion in my dream,\u201d said Valeria Grinchuk, 24, a makeup artist in the city of Lutsk. \u201cI just ran into the corridor with my cats and immediately heard two more explosions,\u201d at which point the power went out, she added.",
      "\u201cI couldn\u2019t see what was on the news and so didn\u2019t know what to expect,\u201d she said. Grinchuk, who has a gas stove, said \"we've gotten used to it a little\" but described the conditions as \"very uncomfortable.\"",
      "\u201cI feel very strong hatred, and I still can't get in my head the fact that this is all reality,\u201d she said. \u201cI don't understand how with so much beauty in the world you can make people's lives such hell.\u201d",
      "The physical discomfort of the outages is compounded by the uncertainty of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s looming inauguration on Jan. 20. His reluctance to commit support for Ukraine brings a huge degree of uncertainty to the conflict, just as Russia is making its fastest battlefield gains since the early days of the 2022 invasion.",
      "It was Russia\u2019s 11th attack on Ukraine\u2019s energy sector this year, officials said. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called it a \u201cvery vile escalation of Russian terrorist tactics.\u201d",
      "Ukraine said it had detected 188 incoming \u201cattack targets,\u201d including 57 cruise missiles fired from Tupolev Tu-95 bombers, 28 Kalibr cruise missiles fired from ships in the Black Sea and 97 Iran-designed Shahed drones, according to a post by the Armed Forces of Ukraine.",
      "\u201cAgain, energy system is under a massive attack from the enemy,\u201d Ukraine\u2019s energy minister, Herman Halushchenko, wrote on social media. \u201cAttacks on energy facilities are taking place all over Ukraine.\u201d",
      "Zelenskyy said the attacks included cluster munitions, which \u201cmake it much more difficult for our rescuers and energy workers to eliminate the consequences of the impact.\u201d",
      "President Joe Biden called the attack \u201chorrific\u201d in a statement Thursday that aimed to reassure Ukraine of U.S. support.",
      "\u201cThis attack is outrageous and serves as yet another reminder of the urgency and importance of supporting the Ukrainian people in their defense against Russian aggression,\u201d Biden said.",
      "\u201cEarlier this year, and at my direction, the United States began prioritizing air defense exports so they go to Ukraine first,\u201d he added. \u201cThe Department of Defense has delivered hundreds of additional air defense missiles to Ukraine, as a consequence of this decision, and further deliveries are underway.\u201d",
      "Putin gave details of the attack at a summit in Kazakhstan of the Russian-led Collective Security Treaty Organization.",
      "\u201cI repeat once again that these strikes on our part were in response to unrelenting strikes onto the Russian territory with the U.S. ATACMS missiles,\u201d he said. \u201cAs I have said many times, there will always be a response from our part.\u201d",
      "He derided the way Ukraine \"nags its masters for other weapons.\"",
      "Ukraine has made no secret of its desire for more Western assistance, making the case that Kyiv is defending not just itself but all of Europe and the West against Kremlin aggression. After the attack, Zelenskyy reiterated calls for his allies to provide more military assistance.",
      "\u201cEach such attack proves that air defense systems are needed now in Ukraine, where they save lives, and not in storage bases,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is especially important in the winter, when we have to protect our infrastructure from targeted Russian strikes.\u201d",
      "Ukraine\u2019s existing air defenses were able to bring down more than 100 of the incoming projectiles, the army said, but dozens got through.",
      "Worst hit were several western regions that do not often face Russian attack. As of Thursday morning, 523,000 homes and businesses in the Lviv region were without power, Gov. Maksym Kozytskyi wrote on Telegram.",
      "In neighboring Volyn, 215,000 customers were without electricity, Gov. Ivan Rudnytskyi, wrote, after a transformer substation was hit in the regional capital, Lutsk. Other outages were reported in the Khmelnytskyi, Ivano-Frankivsk, Zhytomyr and Rivne oblasts, with many schools telling children to study at home.",
      "In Cherkasy, entrepreneur Elena Bondarenko, 52, endured a night of \u201csirens, drones, then you don\u2019t sleep listening to every sound and monitoring news. It was scary and unpleasant,\u201d she said.",
      "She and her husband have endured power cuts before. This time they faced hours more without electricity, and another outage was scheduled in the evening as the grid tries to cope with the destruction.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to live like that. It ruins all your life. It ruins the order of life and any plans you make,\u201d she said of the blackouts. \u201cEverything that is happening now is awful. Well, a human can adjust to everything, but I don\u2019t want to get used to it. Is it even possible to live like that?\u201d",
      "In Kyiv, officials said, anti-aircraft guns intercepted all inbound targets, although falling debris caused damage in the Dniprovskyy and Darnytskyy districts, damaging a truck and buildings in an industrial area.",
      "The Energy Ministry said in an online post that \u201cpower engineers are working to provide backup power schemes where possible. They have already begun restoration work where the security situation allows.\u201d",
      "The Russian Defense Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the attack, which came hours after Trump said he would nominate retired Gen. Keith Kellogg to serve as his special envoy for Ukraine and Russia.",
      "Kellogg has suggested he could condition U.S. military aid to Kyiv on its participation in peace talks with Russia.",
      "The U.S. has provided $70 billion in military aid to Ukraine, more than any other country. Trump has repeatedly declined to commit to continuing the assistance, instead saying he would finish the war before his inauguration \u2014 without saying how."

    "summary": "Ancient footprints discovered in Kenya belong to two different species of human relatives who walked on the same ground at the same time 1.5 million years ago, a study found.",
    "story": [
      "The Summary",
      "Ancient footprints discovered in Kenya belong to two different species of human relatives who walked on the same ground at the same time, a study found. The prints are thought to belong to the species Homo erectus and Paranthropus boisei. The discovery raises questions about what kind of relationship and interactions the two species had.",
      "Ancient footprints discovered in Kenya belong to two different species of human relatives who walked on the same ground at the same time, a study found.",
      "The prints are thought to belong to the species Homo erectus and Paranthropus boisei.",
      "The discovery raises questions about what kind of relationship and interactions the two species had.",
      "A newly discovered set of footprints in Kenya provides the first evidence that two different species of ancient human relatives walked the same ground simultaneously 1.5 million years ago.",
      "The researchers behind the finding say the footprints belong to the species Homo erectus and Paranthropus boisei and were left within hours or days of one another \u2014\u00a0which opens up new mysteries about what happened when the two crossed paths.",
      "According to a study about the discovery, published Thursday in the journal Science, the footprints were embedded in dried mud near a lake in northern Kenya and buried in sediment at a prominent fossil site. By analyzing the prints\u2019 shapes and strike patterns, researchers found that the two sets were distinct; the best explanation, they concluded, is that two different species left the tracks.",
      "The study adds to a growing understanding among anthropologists and paleontologists that ancient human relatives likely interacted and co-existed. And, by extension, it raises questions about what kind of relationship the species had.",
      "\u201cWe think that these individuals, these two species that were there, probably would have been aware there were members of another species nearby. They would have seen each other and recognized each other as different species, which raises questions about what those interactions would have been like,\u201d said Kevin Hatala, an associate professor of biology at Chatham University and a lead author of the research. \u201cWere they competitors? Were they totally OK with each other being there?\u201d",
      "Although previously discovered fossil skeletons of Homo erectus and Paranthropus boisei showed that both species lived in the region at some point in time, the new finding provides evidence of direct overlap.",
      "It also shows that the two species walked on two feet in very different ways.",
      "While both are human relatives, Homo erectus and Paranthropus boisei featured very different traits, and their fates within the human evolutionary tree took starkly different routes.",
      "Homo erectus had a humanlike anatomy from the neck down. The species used stone tools and might have cooked with fire. Its members had a varied diet that likely included meat. The species eventually spread to Asia, Indonesia and other regions, and survived for more than 1 million years after the newly discovered footprints were made. Homo erectus last appeared in the fossil record a little over 100,000 years ago.",
      "\u201cLots of people have thought they are as good of a candidate as there is to be a direct ancestor of ours,\u201d Hatala said. \u201cThey seem to be a very successful species.\u201d",
      "Paranthropus boisei, meanwhile, featured smaller brains, massive chewing muscles and large molar teeth. William Harcourt-Smith, an associate professor of anthropology at Lehman College who was not involved in the study, said the species likely evolved to eat challenging foods like hard nuts or to grind away at tough, low-quality foods like shrubby plants.",
      "The species did not last on Earth for nearly as long as Homo erectus.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re thought to have gone extinct not too long after this, within the next few hundred thousand years,\u201d Hatala said, referring to the time of the footprints. He added that no one knows for sure what happened, but it\u2019s possible changes in the environment restricted their specialized diets.",
      "The footprints were initially discovered in 2021 in a place called Koobi Fora, while researchers were digging for other fossils. The site is a fossil hotspot because uplifting rock exposes old sedimentary layers at the surface, allowing researchers to access the bones of ancient humans and other animals.",
      "The following year, researchers excavated a set of about 12 footprints that appeared to walk in a line, then found another set of footprints running perpendicular.",
      "\u201cWe think these footprints were made in the mud in this lake shore environment. Something happened to bring sediment in over top of it. It could have been a small flood or a rise in the water level that carried in sediments and buried the footprints soon after they were formed,\u201d Hatala said.",
      "The muddy prints weren\u2019t trampled over by other animals and they showed no sign of cracking before they were buried by sand. The researchers said that means they were left within hours or days of one another.",
      "\u201cThe sediment protected them and prevented them from cracking and allowed them to be entered into the geologic record,\u201d Hatala said.",
      "He and his co-authors think the two species might have been able to co-exist in the area because their diets were so different. It\u2019s also possible they competed for resources and had an antagonistic relationship. The species seem to have lived in the same general area for hundreds of thousands of years.",
      "Harcourt-Smith, who works as a research associate in paleontology at the American Museum of Natural History, said the researchers\u2019 analysis was sound and that the site was unique.",
      "\u201cI really want to stress how unusual it is to have a site like this, how special it is and what a great chance we have to find out more,\u201d he said.",
      "Broadly speaking, Harcourt-Smith added, it has become increasingly clear that various ancient human species interacted across different habitats over the past 7 million years of evolution. The evolutionary pathway to modern humans is filled with side branches and species like Paranthropus boisei, which represent an evolutionary dead end.",
      "\u201cHuman evolution is complicated and messy and there\u2019s lots of experimentation. It\u2019s not a straight line,\u201d he said.",
      "Over the past few decades, scientists have developed genetic and archaeological evidence showing that humans, Denisovans and Neanderthals overlapped and sometimes interbred. The new study doesn\u2019t address interbreeding, but it does show more clearly that even older species overlapped and had more interaction than previously understood.",
      "After the researchers completed their work at the Koobi Fora site, photographing and documenting the footprints in several ways, they covered them up for future generations, said Craig Feibel, another author of the study.",
      "\u201cThey have to carefully rebury it with sediment that won\u2019t damage the footprints so erosion won\u2019t occur,\u201d he said."

      "Supporters of the ban have cited the effect of harmful depictions of body image on girls and the effect of misogynistic content on boys. Its passage comes after a series of Australian teenagers died by suicide over what their families said was online bullying.",
      "\u201cThe basis for this is that there is a feeling amongst the majority of Australians that social media does more harm than good,\u201d said Rob Nicholls, a senior research associate in media and communication at the University of Sydney.",
      "A YouGov poll released Tuesday found that 77% of Australians support the ban, up from 61% in August.",
      "Other countries have tried to impose limits on social media for children, including the U.S., which requires technology companies to obtain parental consent to collect data from children under 13.\u00a0But the Australian proposal goes further, with no exemptions for parental consent or pre-existing accounts.",
      "Opponents have criticized the Australian ban as too blunt an instrument and said its passage was too rushed.",
      "The bill, which was introduced in Parliament last week, allowed for only one day to submit opinions on it. Sen. Matt Canavan, who opposed the bill, said there had been 15,000 submissions about it during that day and that lawmakers had been able to review only a fraction of them.",
      "\u201cThis is a highly emotional issue and there is an understandable demand for politicians to be seen to be \u2018doing something\u2019 about it,\u201d he said Tuesday in a dissent that was published as part of a Senate committee report. \u201cYet it is also a highly complex area that should be examined carefully not in the hasty fashion that has beset this process.\u201d",
      "Google and Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, had urged Australia to delay the legislation\u2019s passage Tuesday, saying more time was needed to assess the potential impact of the ban. ByteDance, the Chinese company that owns TikTok, also said more consultation was needed.",
      "Elon Musk, the owner of X, blasted the ban last week as \u201ca backdoor way to control access to the Internet by all\u00a0Australians.\u201d",
      "Officials plan to enforce the age cut-off by trialing an age-verification system that could include biometrics or government identification, which no other country has tried, raising privacy concerns.",
      "A Senate committee signed off on the legislation late Tuesday but said social media platforms should find \u201calternative methods for assuring age\u201d rather than forcing users to submit personal information, such as their passports or other digital identification.",
      "Nicholls said the social media platforms would also be fined for failing to destroy personal information as soon as possible after they verifying users\u2019 ages.",
      "Outside the legislature, the ban has come under heavy scrutiny from parents and scholars who say social media can be a crucial source of support for young people, especially those who feel marginalized.",
      "\u201cSocial media provides vital connections for many young Australians, allowing them to access mental health resources, peer support networks, and a sense of community,\u201d Christopher Stone, executive director of Suicide Prevention Australia, said in a statement Wednesday.\u00a0\u201cCutting off this access risks exacerbating feelings of loneliness and isolation.\u201d",
      "The government has said it will ensure that young people have continued access to messaging apps such as WhatsApp, online gaming platforms such as Roblox and essential services related to health and education.",
      "\u201cYoung people, and in particular diverse cohorts, must be at the center of the conversation as an age restriction is implemented to ensure there are constructive pathways for connection,\u201d Sen. Karen Grogan, chair of the Senate committee on environment and communications legislation, said in its report.",
      "So far the government has not done enough to consult with young people, for whom social media is part of daily life, said Leo Puglisi, 17.",
      "\u201cThis is a government that is obviously not made up of teenagers, but it\u2019s making law about social media when they didn\u2019t grow up in the social media age,\u201d said Puglisi, the founder and chief anchor of 6 News Australia, a streaming news channel based in Melbourne that is majority-run by high schoolers.",
      "He said that while he is beyond the age cut-off, the ban would affect his audience, as well as the ability of some of the journalists on his team to do their work.",
      "In addition, he said, \u201cthere is certainly a possibility that every single Australian would need to use some form of ID to have social media. So in reality it would affect me, it would affect absolutely everyone.\u201d",
      "Daniel Angus, a professor of digital communication at Queensland University of Technology, said that the bill was \u201cillogical and uninformed\u201d and that it lacked critical details about how it will be implemented.",
      "The potential harms of social media the government cited are not sufficiently supported by high-quality research, Angus said in an email, noting that children who are disadvantaged, live in rural areas or are from minority groups rely on social media for community, education and advocacy.",
      "\u201cBy imposing a blanket ban, the government overlooks these essential and diverse experiences, thereby exacerbating existing inequalities,\u201d he said.",
      "He also said the exclusion from the ban of anonymous or web-based platforms such as 4chan \u201cparadoxically leaves young people vulnerable to some of the most harmful digital environments.\u201d",
      "The Heads Up Alliance, a grassroots collective of Australian parents seeking more restrictions on children\u2019s use of social media, said the bill was \u201cdeficient,\u201d giving it a grade of D+.",
      "The group said the ban would do nothing to address bullying on messaging apps, which also have \u201chighly addictive\u201d features.",
      "\u201cThese features are likely to end up resulting in the very downsides we are trying to avoid for our children: preoccupation with devices, less sleep, less nature, less sport, less real-life friendships, less concentration, exposure to sexualized content,\u201d the organization said in a statement.",
      "Exposure to sexual predators \u201cwill also remain a real risk\u201d on online gaming platforms and messaging apps, where many children banned from other social media are likely to migrate, the group said, adding: \u201cOur children will be jumping from the frypan into the fire.\u201d"
