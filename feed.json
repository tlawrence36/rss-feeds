      "Lawyers for rapper A$AP Rocky will make the defense case Friday at his Los Angeles trial, where he's charged with two felony counts of assault with a semiautomatic firearm",
      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 A$AP Rocky 's lawyers will make their case and try to establish a counternarrative Friday at his trial in Los Angeles, where the hip-hop star and fashion mogul is charged with firing a gun at a former friend on a Hollywood street in 2021.",
      "They plan to call to the stand rapper A$AP Twelvyy, who, like both the defendant and the man he's charged with shooting, was a member of the A$AP Mob, a group of young artists and creators that formed at a New York high school nearly 20 years ago.",
      "Twelvyy was one of two members of the crew who accompanied Rocky to a meetup with A$AP Relli, with whom he had a long-simmering beef that came to a head, he said, when Rocky fired a gun at him.",
      "Twelvyy is expected to testify that Rocky fired a starter pistol that only shoots blanks, which he carries as a prop for security. The defense contends that the phony gun answers many questions about the case, including why Relli only had grazed knuckles and no other injuries.",
      "The potentially confusing set of \u201cA$AP\u201d names have become familiar to people in the courtroom, and most likely the jury, through the approximately three days of Relli's testimony, which makes up the bulk of prosecutors' case, rested on Thursday.",
      "Rocky has pleaded not guilty to two felony counts of assault with a semiautomatic firearm, and if convicted on both, he can legally get up to 24 years in prison.",
      "Rihanna, the superstar singer who is Rocky\u2019s longtime partner and the mother of their toddler sons, slipped into the courtroom Thursday afternoon and sat in Rocky\u2019s section after several days of absence. She had her hair up and wore glasses with a tan trenchcoat on a rainy day in LA.",
      "The defense has not said whether Rocky will take the considerable risk of going on the stand himself, which he is not legally required to do. He already opted to take a significant risk by turning down the prosecution's pre-trial offer of a recommended sentence of just 180 days in jail and other relatively minor penalties in exchange for a guilty plea on one count.",
      "Raised in Harlem, the Grammy nominee had his mainstream breakthrough when his first studio album went to No. 1 on the Billboard 200 in 2013.",
      "But his role as a fashion maven has almost eclipsed his music. He is set to be a celebrity co-host on fashion's biggest night, the Met Gala, in May.",
      "The suits he wears in the courtroom and the overcoats he wears outside it have become fodder for discussion and inspired a New York Times story on his style.",
      "A publicist for Yves Saint Laurent sent a news release, of the kind usually reserved for red carpets, saying that one day in court he was wearing an \u201cYves jacket in wool chine,\u201d a \u201cshirt in silk crepe de chine\u201d and \u201chigh-waisted pants in wool chine.\u201d",
      "His fashion sense even came up in phone recordings played in court, in which a person purported to be Relli declares that Rocky was \u201cnot a true gangster\u201d and that \u201cthis is the case of Dior.\u201d",
      "The defense has already brought one witness it was allowed to call early, an internet branding consultant who worked with both Rocky and Relli. He recorded phone calls, purportedly with Relli saying his main intention was to get millions from Rocky, and the criminal case didn't matter.",
      "Relli said in his testimony that the recordings were fake.",
      "But prosecutor John Lewin established that everything Relli said in them was consistent with his testimony.",

      "The Westminster Kennel Club dog show is back for a 149th year",
      "NEW YORK -- The Westminster Kennel Club dog show is back for a 149th year \u2014 and back at New York's Madison Square Garden for the first time since early 2020.",
      "It's a happy homecoming for the United States' most prestigious canine event, which moved to venues outside Manhattan in recent years because of the coronavirus pandemic and then other considerations. But organizers longed to return to the self-described World\u2019s Most Famous Arena.",
      "\u201cIf you love dogs and you want to see the very best dogs from all around the world competing for the top prize of best in show at Westminster, just be there,\u201d club President Donald Sturz said. For fans who can't be there in person, Fox Sports is showing the event's various components on FS1 and FS2 and streaming some on the network's website and app; Westminster is streaming some others. The competition spans Saturday, Monday and Tuesday, with best in show awarded around 11 p.m. Tuesday on the East Coast.",
      "Might Mercedes, the German shepherd who was Westminster\u2019s runner-up last year, become top dog this time? Or could this be the year for Monty the giant schnauzer, who was a Westminster finalist the last two years, won the American Kennel Club\u2019s big show in December and is currently the sport's top-ranked dog? Will the prize go to another high-ranking dog \u2014 or a dark horse?",
      "Here are the basics on Westminster and the dog show world it epitomizes.",
      "It begins Saturday morning at the Javits Center convention hall with agility and obedience championships and some demonstration events, including Westminster's first experiment with flyball. That's essentially a canine relay race that involves running a course of jumps and retrieving a ball.",
      "The traditional, breed-by-breed judging \u2014 what show folk call \u201cconformation\u201d \u2014 unfolds Monday and Tuesday. First-round competition, where dogs are judged against others of their breed, happens during the daytime at the Javits Center. Then, in what are essentially semifinals, each breed winner is judged against others within its \u201cgroup\u201d of dozens of breeds at Madison Square Garden in the evenings. In the final round, the seven group winners compete for best in show Tuesday night.",
      "At each level, judges decide which dog in the ring best matches the ideal, or \u201cstandard,\u201d for its own breed.",
      "About 2,500 dogs from 201 breeds and varieties (subsets of breeds) are signed up to compete.",
      "Hailing from every U.S. state and 12 other countries, contestants include such familiar breeds as golden retrievers and such rarities as sloughis. No doodles, though. At least for now, those poodle mixes aren't recognized as purebreds by the American Kennel Club, the governing body for Westminster and many other U.S. dog shows.",
      "Dachshunds are the best-represented breed, with 52 entered.",
      "The agility and obedience contests involve a few hundred more dogs, including mixed-breed ones. Last year a border collie-papillion combination named Nimble became the first mixed-breed winner in the agility trial\u2019s decade-long history.",
      "First, breeders determine which puppies are physically and temperamentally suited for showing. Those pups are raised, trained and groomed to put their best paw forward in the show ring. \u201cBeginner puppies\u201d can start competing in AKC shows at 4 months.",
      "Some owners exhibit their own dogs where and when they can. Others have professional handlers who crisscross the country to compete most weekends, sometimes with multiple pooches.",
      "Trying for a national ranking is known as \u201ccampaigning\u201d a dog, and no wonder. As in politics, hopefuls \u2014 or, here, their owners and handlers \u2014 may gather intel about rivals\u2019 plans and either seek or avoid a face-off. They may weigh a particular judge's record. Some even run full-page ads in dog magazines to congratulate, salute and promote their animals.",
      "All Westminster dogs are champions, as measured by their sport's complicated point system. But yes, there are stats, kept by the Canine Chronicle magazine.",
      "Besides Monty and Mercedes, entrants include Vito, a pug who won the National Dog Show televised Thanksgiving Day, along with 2024 Westminster semifinalists Comet the shih tzu and Louis the Afghan hound. There's a high-ranking otterhound, representing one of the country's rarer breeds, and a big-winning wire fox terrier, whose breed won more than any other at Westminster.",
      "Still, show cognoscenti often say victory goes to \u201cthe dog on the day,\u201d meaning the one that has the performance of a lifetime.",
      "And regardless which dog the judge chooses, others sometimes win the audience's heart. Among the crowd faves over the years: a Sussex spaniel who sat up straight on his hind legs before the judge; a treat-seeking Leonberger who gnawed at his handler\u2019s pocket while going around the ring; and a shiba inu shown by a 10-year-old girl.",
      "Wire fox terriers have taken the top prize 15 times, most recently in 2019. Poodles of various sizes have 11 wins. A miniature poodle named Sage won last year.",
      "Many breeds haven't won yet, including such favorites as the French bulldog and Labrador retriever. But never say never: Two of the last three winners have been firsts for their breeds: the petit basset griffon Vend\u00e9en and the bloodhound.",
      "Bragging rights, ribbons and trophies. There are no cash prizes, though the agility and obedience winners each get to direct a $5,000 Westminster donation to a training club or the American Kennel Club Humane Fund.",
      "Animal rights activists routinely protest outside, and sometimes inside, the show. During last year's final round, someone carrying a sign reading \u201cboycott breeders\u201d tried to climb into the ring. The demonstrator was quickly intercepted and arrested.",
      "The Westminster club says it promotes responsible dog ownership and celebrates all canines while highlighting the \u201cpreservation\u201d of breeds with particular traits.",

    "story": [
      "Federal government payments for subscriptions to media outlets have become the latest target of President Donald Trump's spending hawks",
      "NEW YORK -- Federal government payments to news outlets like Politico, The New York Times and The Associated Press for subscriptions or to license content are in the crosshairs of Trump administration spending hawks, with the president on Thursday calling it potentially \u201cTHE BIGGEST SCANDAL OF THEM ALL.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s the latest in a series of skirmishes with the media, long a target of Donald Trump and his supporters. The Defense Department last week evicted NPR, NBC, the Times and Politico from their Pentagon workspaces, and Trump has continued to criticize CBS\u2019 \u201c60 Minutes\u201d for its handling of an interview with former opponent Kamala Harris last fall. Free press advocates are also concerned about Trump\u2019s plans for the media outlet Voice of America, whose charter guarantees its editorial freedom.",
      "This time, though, is a bit different. By linking federal government spending to the media, Trump has bundled two of his long-favored political targets into one rhetorical package \u2014 denouncing a common practice as untoward while offering no supporting evidence for his assertions.",
      "On Wednesday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the government had paid more than $8 million for Politico subscriptions and that Elon Musk's government efficiency team \u201cis working on canceling those payments.\u201d That quickly set off a social-media maelstrom and a hunt by online sleuths for other evidence of taxpayer spending on the news.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. government must stop paying for media subscriptions. Now,\u201d Richard Grenell, Trump's special mission envoy, posted on X.",
      "Trump, on his Truth Social platform, complained about payments to the \u201cFAKE NEWS MEDIA\u201d for creating good stories about Democrats. \u201cDid the New York Times receive money??? Who else did??? THIS COULD BE THE BIGGEST SCANDAL OF THEM ALL,\u201d he wrote.",
      "And at a national prayer breakfast at the Capitol on Thursday morning, Trump touted the efforts to look into the media spending. \u201cWe\u2019re catching them left and right,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019re catching them. We\u2019re catching them to a point where they don\u2019t know what the heck is going on. They can\u2019t believe they\u2019re getting caught.\u201d",
      "Politico, in a statement to readers from CEO Goli Sheikholeslami and Editor-in-Chief John Harris, said Thursday that it is not getting a government subsidy.",
      "\u201cIt is a transaction \u2014 just as the government buys research, equipment, software and industry reports,\" they said. \"Some online voices are deliberately spreading falsehoods. Let's be clear: Politico has no financial dependence on the government and no hidden agenda. We cover politics and policy \u2014 that's our job.\"",
      "It has not been unusual for governments, federal and state, to subscribe to major media outlets to keep up on important or strategic issues. The U.S. State Department, for example, may depend on international news reporting for clarity on incidents happening in countries where the United States has interests. Specialists in an agency like the Department of Transportation follow trade publications for industry trends.",
      "The Politico Pro service helps government and private sector customers \"track policy, legislation and regulations in real time with news, intelligence and a suite of data products,\" the company said. It would not discuss how many subscriptions it has sold, or the prices.",
      "The New York Times said it earned less than $2 million last year through government subscriptions, which are offered at a discounted rate. Through one arrangement, the Times gives access to more than 1 million active and retired military members and their families.",
      "\u201cThese officials and other public servants are simply seeking to better understand the world through our independent journalism, like millions of other Americans,\u201d spokesman Charlie Stadtlander said.",
      "Musk, also a frequent critic of the mainstream media and the owner of a platform that in many ways competes with it, retweeted one message on X that complained about the AP \u201craking in millions of dollars in government money for years.\u201d",
      "\u201cNot for long,\" Musk added. \u201dThis is obviously a huge waste of taxpayer money.\"",
      "AP spokeswoman Lauren Easton said that \u201cthe U.S. government has long been an AP customer \u2014 through both Democratic and Republican administrations. It licenses AP's nonpartisan journalism, just like thousands of news outlets and customers around the world. It's quite common for governments to have contracts with news organizations for their content.\u201d",
      "The outlet would not reveal how much it is earning in federal government contracts.",
      "Separately, Musk's focus on the USAID agency has threatened some $268 million in congressionally-authorized funding aimed at offering training and support to some 6,200 independent journalists working around the world, including in war-torn Ukraine, said the organization Reporters Without Borders.",
      "Denying the money \u201cwill create a vacuum that plays into the hands of propagandists and authoritarian states,\u201d said Clayton Weimers, executive director of Reporters Without Borders' USA branch.",

A 911 call from a friend of someone in the house reported armed intruders inside, police said.",
      "The robbers knew the address because a day earlier, Pop Smoke had posted a photograph on social media of a gift bag he had received and the address was on a label, authorities said.",

His novel will bring back Dr. Wilbur Larch from \u201cThe Cider House Rules,\u201d but otherwise features a new set of characters.

      "A Texas crisis communications specialist has sued Blake Lively for defamation",
      "A Texas crisis communications specialist has sued Blake Lively for defamation after the actor pulled him into her legal fight with co-star and director Justin Baldoni over their film, \u201cIt Ends With Us.\u201d",
      "Jed Wallace and his company, Street Relations, filed the $7 million lawsuit in federal court in Texas on Tuesday. It says he had nothing to do with any campaign to harm Lively's reputation as she alleged in a court filing.",
      "Wallace is not among the defendants in Lively's federal lawsuit against Baldoni, his production company and publicists, in which she alleges sexual and other harassment during the production and a campaign to smear her after it. The crisis specialist is named in the court papers and the New York Times story published on the day the series of legal battles began in December when Lively filed a complaint.",
      "Lively\u2019s lawyers said in a statement that Wallace\u2019s lawsuit \u201cis not just a publicity stunt.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt is transparent retaliation in response to allegations contained within a sexual harassment and retaliation complaint that Ms. Lively filed with the California Civil Rights Department,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWhile this lawsuit will be dismissed, we are pleased that Mr. Wallace has finally emerged from the shadows, and that he too will be held accountable in federal court.\u201d",
      "In a filing last week in Hays County, Texas, that seeks a deposition from Wallace, Lively alleges he was used by publicists working with Baldoni to weaponize \u201ca digital army around the country, including in New York and Los Angeles, to create, seed, manipulate, and advance disparaging content that appeared to be authentic on social media platforms and internet chat forums.\u201d",
      "Wallace's lawsuit says neither he nor his company \"had anything to do with the alleged sexual harassment, retaliation, failure to investigate or aiding and abetting the alleged harassment or alleged retaliation.\u201d",
      "It says the actor's Texas filing \u201cconceded that Lively has no facts supporting the allegations she made against Wallace and Street,\" which is why she now seeks to investigate the extent of his conduct.",
      "After Lively sued Baldoni, he filed his own federal lawsuit against her and her husband, \u201cDeadpool\u201d star Ryan Reynolds, accusing them of defamation and extortion and seeking at least $400 million in damages.",
      "Baldoni had already sued The New York Times for libel, and his former publicist filed a lawsuit taking Lively's side.",
      "\u201cIt Ends With Us,\u201d an adaptation of Colleen Hoover\u2019s bestselling 2016 novel that begins as a romance but takes a dark turn into domestic violence, was released in August, exceeding box office expectations with a domestic total of nearly $150 million. The success was followed by near constant turmoil over its production and promotion."

    "published": "Wed, 05 Feb 2025 15:47:43 -0500",
    "summary": "A mother is called to her child&rsquo;s school for an urgent meeting with his teachers in the Norwegian film &ldquo;Armand,&quot; which opens in theaters Friday",
    "story": [
      "A mother is called to her child\u2019s school for an urgent meeting with his teachers in the Norwegian film \u201cArmand,\" which opens in theaters Friday",
      "A mother is called to her child\u2019s school for an urgent meeting with his teachers in the Norwegian film \u201cArmand,\u201d a riff on a claustrophobic courtroom thriller set in a primary school classroom.",
      "The film, which won the best first feature prize at Cannes last year, dolls out bits and pieces of information slowly and purposefully, building not a solid set of answers but a web of complications and ambiguities. It is a strange and fascinating experience that may be a bit frustratingly inconclusive but is never not compelling.",
      "Even the inciting incident is withheld from the audience for a time. We\u2019re thrown into a conversation between a junior teacher, Sunna (Thea Lambrechts Vaulen), an administrator type Asja (Vera Veljovic) and the school\u2019s principal, Jarle (\u00d8ysten R\u00f8ger). Asja and Jarle are entrusting Sunna to lead this conversation (though they'll have to join eventually). None of them are even quite sure what exactly happened, whether it was innocent or malicious, or what to do if they can get to the bottom of it. Jarle advises Sunna to treat it soberly, whatever that\u2019s supposed to mean.",
      "Not even Armand\u2019s mother Elisabeth ( \"The Worst Person in the World's\"Renate Reinsve ) gets a hint as to what the meeting is about. She\u2019s a famous actress whose career has come to a halt and who has been tabloid fodder recently. Elisabeth arrives at the classroom first and wants answers, understandably. Sunna must awkwardly delay providing any information until the other parents arrive to Elisabeth\u2019s increasing frustration. Sunna even stammers something reassuring that it\u2019s not too bad. She is, of course, lying because the accusation is serious and beyond any of their depths. Armand\u2019s classmate Jon has apparently told his parents, Sarah (Ellen Dorrit Petersen) and Anders (Endre Hellestve) that Armand has sexually abused and threatened him. They\u2019re both 6-year-olds.",
      "These aren\u2019t just schoolmates either but cousins and that\u2019s only the tip of the iceberg of trauma and shared history in this room, haunted by characters who aren\u2019t even present: Armand and his dead father, Thomas. Neither of the kids is shown through the duration, and there\u2019s much debate over whether 6-year-olds would use the language that the adults allege.",
      "\u201cArmand\u201d is the directorial debut of writer-director Halfdan Ullmann T\u00f8ndel, who has the daunting pressure of being a descendant of cinema royalty. As if making a movie isn\u2019t hard enough on its own, T\u00f8ndel\u2019s grandparents are Liv Ullmann and Ingmar Bergman. And perhaps because of that \u201cArmand\u201d pushes away from the conventions of a straightforward, talky character study and plays with our perception of reality. Twice Elisabeth breaks into choreographed dance \u2014 both expressions of her emotional state and one of which takes a particularly sinister turn.",
      "One might expect that two unexpected dance sequences would be the standouts in a film, but \u201cArmand\u201d has another. It\u2019s also a release, in a way. After a while of back and forth, debates, reveals and non-starters, Elisabeth breaks out into uncontrollable laughter. This stretches on for several agonizing, astonishingly impressive minutes of mad exertion. It\u2019s really quite an acting marvel from Reinsve \u2014 and everyone else in the scene watching it all play out. A broken fire alarm that goes off sporadically helps keep the atmosphere nice and tense, as does Asja\u2019s random nose bleeds that always seem to derail pivotal decision-making moments.",
      "\u201cArmand\u201d engages in some stylish wheel spinning, broken up by some revelations and cathartic moments. And yet every time you feel like you have a grasp on the situation, something else arises that seems to undermine it. Ambiguity and inconclusiveness can be satisfying in cinematic storytelling, but this feels a little too underbaked either way. Ideas are introduced and abandoned, or not fleshed out well. Why, exactly, has she stopped working, for instance. And what\u2019s the story behind Anders\u2019 and Elisabeth\u2019s relationship? It\u2019s a promising debut from T\u00f8ndel, nonetheless \u2014 a film that will keep you engaged if not entirely satisfied.",
      "\u201cArmand,\u201d an IFC Films release in theaters Friday, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for \u201csexual material and some language.\u201d Running time: 116 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four."

      "The irony shouldn\u2019t be lost on anyone that \u201cNo Other Land,\u201d a documentary about the systemic demolition of Palestinian homes in the West Bank, cannot find a cinematic home, either with a distributor or a major U.S. streamer",
      "The irony shouldn\u2019t be lost on anyone that \u201cNo Other Land,\u201d a documentary about the systemic demolition of Palestinian homes in the West Bank, cannot find a cinematic home, either with a distributor or a major U.S. streamer.",
      "Producers have opted to self-distribute this powerful, pointed look at Israel's policies in seized land despite the movie earning an Oscar nomination and wins at the Berlin International Film Festival, Gotham Awards and Los Angeles Film Critics Association Awards. \u201cNo Other Land\u201d is, in its nature, a piece of advocacy. There are no both-sidesing explored here. The filmmakers \u2014 a Palestinian-Israeli collective of four directors \u2014 make it clear they hope documenting their plight will get the United States to pressure Israel to stop the destruction.",
      "The documentary is largely told from the perspective of Basel Adra, an activist born in Masafer Yatta, a collection of villages in the southern mountains of the occupied West Bank. The Israelis have ordered Palestinians off the land to make room for a military training ground.",
      "Shot between 2019 and 2023 \u2014 filming ended before the Israel-Hamas war exploded \u2014 the bulldozers arrive and never stop, protected by soldiers and ripping through simple concrete homes. The residents retreat to caves, albeit with high-def TV connections. Then they try to rebuild, often under the stealth of night. Then the bulldozers return.",
      "\u201cThey destroy us slowly. Every week, a home,\u201d goes the narration. \u201cEvery week a new family must decide: Endure, or leave their land.\u201d",
      "Adra and Palestinian co-writer and co-director Hamdan Ballal are joined by an Israeli journalist, Yuval Abraham, who arrives in Masafer Yatta with the cinematographer Rachel Szor. Abraham is asked point blank on his arrival: \u201cWhat do you think about what your country is doing to us?\u201d His answer: \u201cI think it\u2019s a crime.\u201d",
      "It is a wrenching movie to see: Soldiers, with vague permission from a court that Palestinians have no say in, push old women and children, not answering their pleas to stop and merely waving away residents whose families have lived in the region since the 1830s. The residents can't vote and their license plates set them apart from Israelis. They're hoping enough likes on social media can change their plight.",
      "We see women carrying out their rugs from rubble and children bewildered as their outhouse is knocked down.",
      "\u201cWe have no other land,\u201d says one resident, giving the documentary its name. At one point, a playground is demolished. At another, a school. Then a well is filled with concrete and water lines are cut with a chainsaw. Sometimes, nearby Israeli settlers attack as soldiers stand by.",
      "The Palestinians are unarmed, except for cellphone cameras, which the soldiers clearly hate. When they march \u2014 a ragtag group with a banner reading \u201cPalestinian Lives Matter\u201d \u2014 they are met with stun grenades.",
      "Shaky cellphone footage of military altercations mix with archive footage, TV newscasts and dreamy, languid shots of dusty villages at night lit by naked bulbs. Sometimes current day images melt to those of a generation ago, when in home movies we see Adra's father protesting the same injustices, a never-ending cycle. His first memory is his father\u2019s first arrest.",
      "\u201cNo Other Land\u201d is a piece of resistance but also humanization. When Adra is about to be arrested, his mother says what mothers regularly do: \u201cGo wear a warmer coat,\u201d she counsels. Palestinian children laugh as they play games in the street, throw snowballs in winter and sway gleefully from makeshift swings.",
      "\u201cI hope we\u2019ll change this bad reality,\u201d says Adra at the end. \u201cI hope,\u201d chimes in Abraham.",
      "\u201cNo Other Land,\u201d in movie theaters in select cities, is not rated but has language and violence throughout. Running time: 95 minutes. Three and a half stars out of four."

      "Plishka died Monday at a hospice in Wilmington, North Carolina, his wife, Sharon Thomas, said Wednesday.",
      "His Met career spanned generations, from a debut as the Monk alongside Renata Tebaldi, Sherrill Milnes and Rosalind Elias in Ponchielli\u2019s \u201cLa Gioconda\u201d on Sept. 21, 1967, to his final appearance in Puccini\u2019s \u201cLa Boh\u00e8me\u201d on March 10, 2018.",
      "Plishka recalled his debut during a 2012 interview with The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cThese were idols. They were all gods for me,\u201d he said. \u201cThe thing I remember is my costume. I remember under my arms, I was so nervous the perspiration came flowing out like a fire hydrant.\u201d",
      "He sang 88 roles at the Met, and his performance total ranks ninth in the company\u2019s history. While many were as a comprimario, a supporting part surrounding the stars, he sang all three bass roles in Mussorgsky\u2019s \u201cBoris Godunov,\u201d Philip II in Verdi\u2019s \u201cDon Carlo\u201d and for his 25th anniversary with the company the title role in Verdi\u2019s \u201d\u2018Falstaff.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs great as \u2018Don Carlo\u2019 was, the \u2018Falstaff\u2019 really leaves everything in the dust because of the personality of the character and the music. For me, that was the top of the hill,\u201d he said. \u201cI love what I\u2019ve done over the years. I sort of jokingly say it beats working for a living.\u201d",
      "Born Aug. 28, 1941, Plishka grew up in Old Forge, Pennsylvania, and moved with his family to Paterson, New Jersey,. when he was 16. He attended Eastside High School and was directed toward opera by a teacher after he performed Jud Fry in \u201cOklahoma!\u201d Plishka majored in music at Montclair State College and made his opera debut at the Paterson Lyric Opera Theater.",
      "After singing with the Met\u2019s national touring company, he debuted in that 1967 performance. In 1971, he was the Sacristan in Puccini\u2019s \u201cTosca\u201d on the night conductor James Levine made his Met debut.",
      "Plishka said that during rehearsals for those 1971 performances, baritone Peter Glossop pointed to the inexperienced singer and said sarcastically: \u201cThat\u2019s a Sacristan?\u201d By 2012, Plishka said a colleague praised him in rehearsal for making the small role memorable, saying \u201cNow that\u2019s a Sacristan!\u201d",
      "\u201cIt only took 40 years to grow into the part,\u201d Plishka said with a laugh.",
      "He sang with other companies, most notably Milan's Teatro alla Scala, London's Royal Opera and the New York City Opera, and sang the Grand Inquisitor in \u201cDon Carlo\u201d at the 1988 Salzburg Festival. But the vast majority of his career was at the Met. He announced his retirement in 2012, but the Met persuaded him to return for 30 additional performances as the landlord Benoit and Musetta's admirer Alcindoro in \u201cLa Boh\u00e8me\u201d from 2016 to 2018.",
      "Plishka's first wife, the former Judith Colgan, died in 2004, and they had three sons who all predeceased him: Paul Jr., Jeffrey and Nikolai.",
      "Jeffrey was charged in 2009 in Wayne County, Pennsylvania, with the 1991 killing of a 24-year-old camp counselor near a Poconos waterfall. He was acquitted the following year.",

      "For the first time, the Oscars will be streamed live on Hulu. You can also watch via Hulu Live TV, YouTubeTV, AT&T TV and FuboTV. With authentication from your provider, you can watch on ABC.com and the ABC app.",
      "For the first time, Conan O'Brien is hosting the Academy Awards. O'Brien, the late night host turned podcaster and occasional movie star, said upon the announcement: \u201cAmerica demanded it and now it\u2019s happening: Taco Bell\u2019s new Cheesy Chalupa Supreme. In other news, I\u2019m hosting the Oscars.\"",
      "The wildfires that consumed large parts of Los Angeles in early January led some to call for the cancellation of the Academy Awards. The academy twice postponed the announcement of nominations but never pushed the March 2 date of the ceremony. Academy leaders have argued the show must go ahead, for their economic impact on Los Angeles and as a symbol of resilience.",
      "Organizers have vowed this year\u2019s awards will \u201ccelebrate the work that unites us as a global film community and acknowledge those who fought so bravely against the wildfires.\u201d",
      "Still, the fires have curtailed much of the usual frothiness of Hollywood's awards season. The film academy canceled its annual nominees luncheon.",
      "For many involved in the Oscars, the fires have been felt acutely. O'Brien's Pacific Palisades home survived but his family has been unable to go back to it. O'Brien's assistant and podcast co-host Sona Movsesian lost her home.",

Though the academy initially said it would bring back the \u201cfab five\" style of presenting the acting awards, with five previous winners per category, organizers has reportedly abandoned those plans for this year's ceremony.",
      "The academy has announced that unlike previous years, the original song nominees will not be performed this time. That doesn't mean there won't be music, though. \u201cWicked,\u201d one of the biggest box-office hits of 2024, could feasibly figure into the Oscar plans.

Its star, Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n, made history by becoming the first openly trans actor nominated for an Oscar.",
      "But no nominee has had a rockier post-nominations Oscar campaign. After old offensive tweets by Gasc\u00f3n were uncovered, the actress issued an apology. The fallout, though, has badly damaged a movie that was already a divisive contender, and led Netflix to radically refocus its flagging campaign.",

      "If you tune into the \u201cPuppy Bowl\u201d on Sunday, you\u2019ll likely see a key person\u2019s influence \u2014 even if you don\u2019t actually see her",
      "NEW YORK -- If you tune into the \u201cPuppy Bowl\u201d on Sunday, you'll likely see a key person's influence \u2014 even if you don't actually see her.",
      "Victoria Schade is a dog trainer and novelist who's the show\u2019s lead puppy trainer and wrangler. She's the one making sure the shelter pups have a conflict-free contest and that they're captured at their most adorable \u2014 all from off-camera.",
      "It is Schade who gets the puppies to look up during the \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d or run through a tunnel to get to the field for the starting lineups. She\u2019s on the lookout for possible conflicts or nervous dogs.",
      "\u201cMy responsibilities include ensuring puppy happiness and safety during gameplay,\u201d she says. \u201cSo if there\u2019s any moment where a puppy looks like they\u2019re overwhelmed or they just need a break, I\u2019ll step out and give them a little break on the sideline.\u201d",
      "Schade has been working with the doggies on the Animal Planet show for 19 years and is believed to be the longest serving member of the \u201cPuppy Bowl\u201d crew. She also works the kitten halftime show and calls filming both her favorite week of the year.",
      "\u201cI think she is one of the most dedicated, hardest working people out there in the business,\u201d says \u201cPuppy Bowl\u201d referee Dan Schachner, now in his 14th year. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t ever seem to run out of energy. She never says no to a request and there\u2019s always brightness and sunshine from her with every step.\u201d",
      "Schade has coached hundreds of dogs over the years but never adopted one from the show \u2014 until now. She took home Boris \u2014 known on the show as Mr. Pickles \u2014 from Dallas Dog rescue. \u201cI saw star quality. So this was the year,\u201d she says.",
      "Early on, Schade was responsible for recruiting and selecting the puppies, a task now that leans on animal rescue groups and shelters throughout the country. These days, she's the lead trainer.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re seeing the puppy looking up at the camera, I\u2019m typically right there with the treat,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of treats and funny noises. And that does the trick.\u201d",
      "This year, Schade is stepping out from the sidelines and joining Schachner on camera for an hour-long pre-game kickoff show, which features a doggie combine and a draft. Other show highlights include segments with Dan Smyers, from superstar country duo Dan + Shay, and Kansas City Chiefs defensive tackle Derrick Nnadi.",
      "Schade has developed some very special animal-related skills over the years, including anticipating when one of the players needs to relieve itself.",
      "\u201cOne of my \u2018Puppy Bowl\u2019 skills is reading butts. So I know when a puppy is going to go to the bathroom and I\u2019ll typically say like, \u2018Watch out in the 20-yard-line, we\u2019re going to have a deposit\u2019 and everyone\u2019s ready to go with that cleanup.\u201d",
      "The \u201cPuppy Bowl\u201d made its debut as counter-programming to the Super Bowl in 2005. Dogs score touchdowns on a gridiron carpet when they cross the goal line \u2014 any goal line \u2014 with a toy in their mouth.",
      "The show is really just an excuse to spend time watching adorable, clumsy pups play with chew toys, wag their tails furiously and lick the camera. A deeper reason is to encourage animal adoption.",
      "According to the ASPCA, approximately 390,000 shelter dogs are euthanized each year and 2 million shelter dogs are adopted.",
      "Most of the puppies are usually adopted by airtime, since the show was filmed in the fall. But the point is to show that animals just like the ones on the show can be found at any shelter at any time.",
      "This year's three-hour television event this year will feature 142 rescue puppies from 80 shelters across 40 states \u2014 and one from Nicaragua, a Chihuahua-German shepherd. There will be 11 special needs dogs.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the most amount we\u2019ve ever had,\" says Schachner. \"Look out for Jolene, who is a pitbull mix that\u2019s in a wheelchair. Look out for a three-legged Boston terrier from New York City. And my personal favorite, is Sprinkle, who is a blind and deaf Aussie. So it\u2019s just incredible to watch them play.\u201d",
      "The inaugural \u201cPuppy Bowl\u201d was watched by nearly 6 million viewers. Last year, 12.6 million viewers tuned in. In comparison, this year\u2019s Golden Globes attracted 9.3 million.",
      "Schade, whose first book was \u201c Bonding With Your Dog \u201d and who then pivoted to writing pet-oriented novels, like \u201cLife on the Leash\u201d and \u201cDog Friendly,\u201d is a wealth of information about our four-legged friends.",
      "She advises dog owners to learn to read the body language of their pet, to try to understand what they're trying to say. Like tail-wagging \u2014 how tight? And where is the tail positioned?",
      "Schade is a big advocate for positive reinforcement and science-based training, not the so-called alpha dog approach, which uses intimidation or force.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no need to be the alpha, which has been debunked anyway. You are your dog's ally. You\u2019re their friend. You\u2019re their No. 1. And it\u2019s a relationship based in compassion and understanding.\u201d",
      "That means load up on treats. She advocates keeping them in your pocket and consistently using them as rewards for good behavior, especially when potty training.",
      "\u201cI cannot stress it enough: When you think you\u2019re treating enough, treat more because, especially during puppyhood, it is such a critical learning period and every interaction is a chance to teach something.\u201d",

      "\u201cKinda Pregnant,\" starring Amy Schumer as a woman who fakes a baby bump, is a kinda throwback comedy",
      "We have by now become accustomed to the lengths some movie characters will go to keep a good comedy lie going. But it\u2019s still a special kind of feat when Amy Schumer, playing a baby-mad single woman who fakes a baby bump in \u201cKinda Pregnant,\u201d is so desperate to maintain the fiction that she shoves a roast turkey up her dress.",
      "You might be thinking: This is too ridiculous. The stuffing, alone. But if we bought \u201cSome Like it Hot\u201d and \u201cMrs. Doubtfire,\u201d I see no reason to quibble with the set-up of \u201cKinda Pregnant,\u201d a funny and often perceptive satire on motherhood, both real and pretend.",
      "\u201cKinda Pregnant,\u201d which debuted Wednesday on Netflix, is a kinda throwback comedy. Like \u201c40-Year-Old Virgin\u201d and \u201cWedding Crashers,\u201d you can basically get the movie just from its title.",
      "But like any good high-concept comedy, \u201cKinda Pregnant\u201d is predominantly a far-fetched way for its star and co-writer, Schumer, to riff frankly on her chosen topic. Here, that\u2019s the wide gamut of pregnancy experience \u2014 the body changes, the gender reveal parties, the personal jealousies \u2014 all while mixing in a healthy amount of pseudo-pregnant pratfalls.",
      "It\u2019s been a decade since Schumer was essentially launched as a movie star in the 2015 Judd Apatow-directed \u201cTrainwreck.\u201d But \u201cKinda Pregnant,\u201d which Schumer wrote with Julie Paiva, almost as adeptly channels Schumer\u2019s comic voice \u2014 the one that made the sketch series \u201cInside Amy Schumer\u201d so great.",
      "The movie\u2019s opening flashes back to Lainey (Schumer) as a child playing with dolls and imagining herself a mother-to-be. So committed is she to the role that Lainey, in mock-labor, screams at her friend and then politely apologies: \u201cSorry, but the expectant mother often lashes out at her support system.\u201d",
      "But as middle age approaches, Lainey, a high school teacher in Brooklyn, isn\u2019t close to her dream. At the dinner where she suspects \u2014 no, is so certain that she tears open the desert looking for a ring \u2014 that her longtime boyfriend (Damon Wayans Jr.) is going to pop the question, he instead asks her to join a threesome. Back at school, Lainey\u2019s school lesson on \u201cRomeo and Juliet\u201d turns darkly cynical.",
      "Things are even worse when Lainey\u2019s married best friend (Jillian Bell) divulges that she\u2019s pregnant. \u201cGet rid of it!\u201d blurts Lainey before apologizing. When the pair later go clothes shopping, Lainey absentmindedly tries on belly padding. The saleswoman is instantly nice to her, offering a burrito and a foot rub. \u201cWho\u2019s the father?\u201d she asks. \u201cDoor dash,\u201d responds Lainey before adding, \u201cdriver.\u201d",
      "Much of the fun in \u201cKinda Pregnant\u201d is watching Lainey come up with increasingly ridiculous lies as she tries to pull off the pregnant act. (After accidentally picking Thanksgiving as her time of inception, Lainey digs a deeper hole by suggesting it happened at \u201ca Black Friday Eve sale.\u201d)",
      "But the ruse becomes more difficult when she, during a pregnant workout class, meets a woman (Brianne Howey, refreshingly authentic) she genuinely likes and wants to be friends with. Even more complicated: Lainey starts falling for another guy she first meets at a coffee shop ( Will Forte ).",
      "In a movie filled with funny people (others include Urzila Carlson as a guidance counselor, and Alex Moffat as a idiotic father-to-be) Forte is an especially good presence in \u201cKinda Pregnant.\u201d For a performer of such madcap absurdity, Forte fits in remarkably naturally in a more rom-com setting. He\u2019s also got a wonderfully ridiculous occupation, even by rom-com standards, driving a Zamboni in Central Park.",
      "You can probably guess how \u201cKinda Pregnant\u201d goes from here. Director Tyler Spindel, nephew to Adam Sandler (a producer on the film), doesn't do anything to advance the movie comedy, a languishing proposition in recent years with few big-screen exceptions. But he crucially gives his performers plenty of space to be themselves, and Lainey's desperate desire to have a family comes across as both over-the-top and genuine. If \u201cKnocked Up\u201d captured the comedy of getting unexpectedly pregnant, \u201cKinda Pregnant\u201d embodies the pain of wishing you were.",
      "\u201cKinda Pregnant,\u201d a Netflix release, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for sexual content, language throughout and drug use. Running time: 97 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four."

      "An Arkansas organist is marking the 275th anniversary of Johann Sebastian Bach's death by playing all of the German composer's organ works, but he's doing it one lunch break at a time",
      "LITTLE ROCK, Ark. -- It was hushed inside a 140-year-old cathedral on the outskirts of Little Rock's downtown as about five dozen people sat in the pews during a recent lunch break in January.",
      "The nave filled with the sounds of the Gothic church's pipe organ, and a screen showed a man performing the works of Johann Sebastian Bach. Those gathered weren't there for church, but for the third concert in a series Colin MacKnight is performing over the next year to commemorate the 275th anniversary of Bach's death.",
      "MacKnight, Trinity Episcopal Cathedral's music director, is performing all of Bach's organ works throughout 2025 \u2014 one lunch break at a time. The ambitious plan entails performing 18 hours of music in half-hour increments nearly every Wednesday.",
      "\u201cI've wanted to for a really long time because it's, I think, the most thorough way of immersing myself in the brilliance of Johann Sebastian Bach,\u201d MacKnight said one morning as he rehearsed in the empty cathedral the day before a concert.",
      "The concerts in Little Rock are among several events around the world this year commemorating the German composer\u2019s legacy and the anniversary of his death.",
      "MacKnight, who is from Bethesda, Maryland, has been music director at Trinity for three years. He said the first time he remembers hearing Bach was at a relative's funeral when he was about 12 years old.",
      "\u201cSomething about hearing it that time just really mesmerized me and that was the beginning of my love of Bach,\u201d he said.",
      "The 31-year-old's hands move easily between the four keyboards of the organ console, flanked by knobs controlling different sounds that are assembled into various combinations.",
      "Underneath, his feet press on the pedalboards \u2014 combining to create the notes of Bach's works. MacKnight, who has played the organ since he was 16, acknowledges how dizzying the sight of the instrument can be for newcomers.",
      "\u201cIf you don't know what you're looking at, it's a little overwhelming, like an airplane console,\u201d he said.",
      "MacKnight's concerts \u2014 which are free and open to the public \u2014 are also mini-lessons for those who come, with a glossary of terms like concerto and fugue included in the program. In between pieces, MacKnight gives audience members some background on Bach and his organ works.",
      "\u201cThese pieces are in the unfortunate category of being much, much harder than they sound,\u201d he says.",
      "Generally regarded as one of the greatest composers of all time, Bach is known in particular for his organ works and their heavy use of pedals and complex structures. Few organists perform the composer's complete organ works, given the difficulty and quantity of the music.",
      "They include Grammy-winning organist Paul Jacobs, who taught MacKnight at the Juilliard School. Jacobs performed an 18-hour nonstop concert of Bach's organ works to mark the 250th anniversary of the composer's death in 2000.",
      "The free concerts so far have drawn a mix of church members, classical music aficionados and newcomers who say they want a quiet break from the daily bustle.",
      "\u201cI like the complexity of the music and the power of the organ, which stirs me internally,\u201d said Barry Coplin, a member of the church who has attended two of MacKnight\u2019s concerts.",
      "Ben Wiley, who lives about 30 minutes away, is a classical music fan who was attending his third of MacKnight\u2019s shows and said he appreciates being able to hear Bach\u2019s works in half-hour increments.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a good way to be able to get it done in short bursts, to be able to absorb it better and come back to get the next batch,\u201d he said.",
      "MacKnight is also performing a 100-minute concert of Bach's most extensive organ work \u2014 the Clavier-Ubung III, sometimes referred to as the German Organ Mass \u2014 on July 28, the day the German composer died in 1750 at 65.",
      "The Rev. Thomas Alexander, a priest at Trinity, said the concerts allow the public to enjoy MacKnight's talents, come together and learn more about Bach in a way they normally wouldn't be able to.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like reading someone's complete collection of novels. You get to really get to know someone in a comprehensive way,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cBut it also builds a sense of community.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "The New Jersey man charged with severely injuring author Salman Rushdie in a 2022 knife attack is standing trial in New York",
      "MAYVILLE, N.Y. -- In 2022, Salman Rushdie was about to deliver a lecture before a live audience in western New York when a man ran towards him and plunged a knife into the author\u2019s hand as he raised it in self-defense.",
      "\u201cAfter that there are many blows, to my neck, to my chest, to my eye, everywhere,\u201d Rushdie recalled in a memoir that followed. \u201cI feel my legs give way, and I fall.\u201d",
      "In the coming weeks, Rushdie is expected to return to the same New York county to recount the experience as one of the first witnesses in the trial of the man charged with wielding the knife that day, Hadi Matar.",
      "Jury selection got underway Tuesday. Matar, 27, of Fairview, New Jersey, has pleaded not guilty to charges of attempted murder and assault.",
      "Under different circumstances, Rushdie\u2019s book, which details his account of that day and his recovery, might offer important evidence in the Aug. 12, 2022, attack that left the 77-year-old blind in his right eye and his hand permanently damaged.",
      "But \u201cthis isn\u2019t a back alley event that occurs unwitnessed in a dark alley,\u201d said Chautauqua County District Attorney Jason Schmidt following a pretrial hearing. \u201cThis is something that was recorded, it was witnessed live by thousands of people.\u201d",
      "Jurors will be shown video of the attack, as well as photos and documentation, and an estimated 15 witnesses are expected to take the stand. Judge David Foley said once jury selection is complete, the trial would take up to a week and a half.",
      "Matar\u2019s lawyer, Nathaniel Barone, has not explained how he plans to defend his client and has clapped back at critics who question why Matar did not take a plea deal.",
      "\u201cThat's not what this is about. It's about due process,\" Barone said. \u201cIt's about receiving a fair trial ... If someone wants to exercise those rights, they're entitled to do that.\"",
      "In a separate indictment, federal authorities allege that Matar was motivated by a terrorist organization\u2019s endorsement of a fatwa, or edict, calling for Rushdie\u2019s death. A separate trial on the federal charges \u2014 terrorism transcending national boundaries, providing material support to terrorists and attempting to provide material support to a terrorist organization \u2014 will be scheduled in U.S. District Court in Buffalo.",
      "Foley asked potential jurors Tuesday whether they could fairly consider a case involving someone of Muslim descent or with strong religious beliefs. All indicated they could.",
      "But finding jurors who have not already formed an opinion was proving harder.",
      "Nearly all of the 27 men and women being screened Tuesday said they knew about what happened to Rushdie, either from news reports or acquaintances, and several said they had formed opinions that are unlikely to change based on what they hear at trial",
      "Matar's attorney sought unsuccessfully to move the trial out of Chautauqua County last year, citing pretrial publicity and potential prejudice against people of Middle Eastern descent among the small rural county's mostly white residents.",
      "Rushdie spent years in hiding after the late Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued the fatwa in 1989 after publication of the novel \u201cThe Satanic Verses,\u201d which some Muslims consider blasphemous. In the federal indictment, authorities allege Matar believed the edict was backed by the Lebanon-based militant group Hezbollah and endorsed in a 2006 speech by the group\u2019s then-leader, Hassan Nasrallah.",
      "But jurors in the Chautauqua County case are unlikely to hear about the fatwa, according to Schmidt. He has said he doesn\u2019t anticipate needing to show Matar\u2019s possible motive to get a conviction on the state charges.",
      "\u201cFrom my standpoint, this is a localized event. It\u2019s a stabbing event. It\u2019s fairly straightforward,\u201d Schmidt said. \u201cI don\u2019t really see a need to get into motive evidence, whether that\u2019s applicable or not applicable and what that consists of. I\u2019d like to avoid all of that.\u201d",
      "Barone, the defense attorney, said jurors should be screened for prejudice nonetheless, given the discussions of the fatwa during previous court proceedings.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve talked about the reason why this alleged crime supposedly occurred was because of this book involving Muslims, all that. So it\u2019s kind of like the barn door\u2019s been opened,\u201d he said.",
      "Matar was born in the U.S. but holds dual citizenship in Lebanon, where his parents were born. Rushdie is a native of India who lived for years in London. He became a U.S. citizen in 2016.",
      "Matar has been held without bail since his arrest after being subdued by onlookers who rushed the amphitheater stage. The event\u2019s moderator, Henry Reese, co-founder of City of Asylum in Pittsburgh, was also wounded."

      "LOS ANGELES -- A former friend who alleges rapper A$AP Rocky fired a gun at him in 2021 testified Monday that no one involved in the incident gave him any indication the firearm might have been fake \u2014 as the defense contends \u2014 until the day this trial started.",
      "The testimony from the trial\u2019s key witness, who goes by A$AP Relli, came at the end of a long, frustrating slog on the stand in a Los Angeles courtroom that drove him to shout, \u201cYou're annoying, bro!\u201d and much more at the lead defense attorney.",
      "In its re-direct questioning on Monday, the prosecution pushed back against the idea that for security Rocky carried a starter pistol that only shot blanks.",
      "Deputy District Attorney Paul Przelomiec showed Relli texts from after the incident in which he told Rocky \u201cU try killing me\u201d and that Rocky had tried to take him from his daughter.",
      "\u201cAt any point did he respond to your text messages to tell you it was a fake gun?\u201d The prosecutor asked Relli, who testified his knuckles were grazed in the incident.",
      "\u201cNo,\u201d he responded. He said the same of the two mutual friends who had been there.",
      "The testimony was the first time the jury heard how late the prop gun defense was revealed, despite more than three years passing and several days of testimony at a preliminary hearing in 2023.",
      "Rihanna, the superstar singer who is Rocky\u2019s longtime partner and the mother of his two toddler sons, was not in the courtroom after being in the audience to support him for the trial\u2019s previous three days.",
      "Rocky has pleaded not guilty to two felony counts of assault with a semiautomatic firearm, charges that with a conviction carry a maximum penalty of 24 years in prison.",
      "A day earlier, the hip-hop star was up a Grammy Award for the third time at a ceremony just two miles away, but lost to one of the night\u2019s big winners, Kendrick Lamar.",
      "Relli who first took the stand on Wednesday, had been often evasive and just as often angry under cross-examination from Rocky's lawyer.",
      "That came to a head Monday as the defense got a chance to ask its last set of questions before he was excused.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not on trial. I\u2019ve been here for five days, dealing with this man,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been looking stupid for five days.\u201d",
      "He ignored the judge\u2019s warnings not to make such statements.",
      "\u201cYou think you\u2019re slick!\u201d he shouted at Tacopina moments later. \u201cAnd I\u2019m on to you! You\u2019re not going to keep tripping me up! You\u2019re not slick!\u201d",
      "Last week, Relli had angrily declared that recordings of phone calls the defense played for him about getting money from Rocky were faked. Defense lawyers contend the only reason Relli went to police about the incident was so he could extract money from Rocky in the civil case he has also filed.",
      "On Monday, the man who recorded those calls, Wally Sajimi, took the stand as an out-of-order witness for the defense, and the jurors heard the recordings themselves.",
      "In one of them, a voice resembling Relli's says he'll stop participating in the criminal case as soon as he gets paid.",
      "\u201cOnce I walk away, when I get my cash, the case will get way weaker,\" says the recording that Sajimi testified he made in 2022. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be hard for the DA to find me. Because I\u2019m going to be on another island.\u201d",
      "Sajimi testified that he builds websites for artists and brands, and has worked with both Rocky and Relli, but said he is much closer to Rocky, who he considers a friend."

      "A woman from New Zealand says in lawsuits that British author Neil Gaiman sexually assaulted her repeatedly when she worked as a babysitter and nanny for him and his wife",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- A woman from New Zealand has filed three civil lawsuits against best-selling British author Neil Gaiman and his wife, accusing Gaiman of repeatedly sexually assaulting her while she was working as the couple's babysitter and nanny.",
      "Scarlett Pavlovich filed the lawsuits in federal court in Wisconsin, Massachusetts and New York on Monday.",
      "The Associated Press doesn\u2019t identify people who say they have been sexually assaulted unless they publicly identify themselves. Pavlovich identified herself in an interview with New York Magazine, which published an article in January detailing allegations of assault, abuse and coercion leveled by eight women.",
      "Pavlovich alleges in the lawsuits that she was homeless and living on a beach when she met Palmer in Auckland, New Zealand, in 2020. Pavlovich was 22 years old at the time.",
      "According to the lawsuits, Gaiman's wife, Amanda Palmer, invited Pavlovich to the couple's home on Waiheke Island. Pavlovich began running errands for the couple, babysitting their son and helping with chores, eventually becoming the couple's nanny.",
      "Gaiman first sexually assaulted her the night they met in February 2022, according to the lawsuits. The assaults continued but she kept working for the couple because she was broke and homeless and Gaiman had told her he would help her writing career, according to the lawsuits.",
      "When she told Palmer about the assaults, Palmer told her that more than a dozen women had told her in the past that Gaiman had sexually abused them, according to the lawsuits.",
      "The assaults didn't stop until Pavlovich told Palmer she was going to kill herself, the lawsuits said. She left the family and became homeless again, although the documents say Gaiman eventually paid her for her work caring for the couple's child and helped cover her rent for a few months.",
      "Palmer knew of Gaiman's sexual desires and presented Pavalovich to him knowing he would assault her, according the lawsuits. Pavlovich alleges Gaiman and Palmer violated federal human trafficking prohibitions and seeks at least $7 million in damages.",
      "After the New York Magazine article was published, Gaiman released a statement in January denying he had ever engaged in non-consensual sex. The allegations of four of the women were previously broadcast in July in a Tortoise Media podcast.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m far from a perfect person, but I have never engaged in non-consensual sexual activity with anyone. Ever,\u201d Gaiman posted on the social media platform Tumblr.",
      "Representatives for Gaiman and Palmer did not immediately respond to requests for comment Monday and online court records did not list attorneys representing them in the suits. Pavlovich\u2019s attorneys stated in the filings that Gaiman, author of such bestsellers as \u201cCoraline\u201d and \u201cThe Sandman\u201d series, is a resident of Menomonie, Wisconsin. But they\u2019re unsure if Palmer resides in Massachusetts or New York.",
      "Pavlovich told New York Magazine that she filed a police report in January 2023 accusing Gaiman of sexual assault. Police have not confirmed whether Gaiman was ever under investigation.",
      "Gaiman has worked with numerous publishers over the years. Two of them, HarperCollins and W.W. Norton, have said they have no plans to release his books in the future. Others, including Bloomsbury, have so far declined comment.",
      "Dark Horse Comics announced in January that it would no longer release its illustrated series based on Gaiman's novel, \u201cAnansi Boys.\u201d The seventh of eight editions was released earlier that month.",
      "Disney has paused a planned adaptation of Gaiman\u2019s \u201cThe Graveyard Book,\u201d while Netflix is still scheduled to release a second season based on \u201cThe Sandman.\u201d"

      "People who make a habit of sleeping on the job comprise a secret society of sorts within the U.S. labor force",
      "NEW YORK -- They snooze in parking garages, on side streets before the afternoon school run, in nap pods rented by the hour or stretched out in bed while working from home.",
      "People who make a habit of sleeping on the job comprise a secret society of sorts within the U.S. labor force. Inspired by famous power nappers Winston Churchill and Albert Einstein, today's committed nap-takers often sneak in short rest breaks because they think the practice will improve their cognitive performance but still carries a stigma.",
      "Multiple studies have extolled the benefits of napping, such as enhanced memory and focus. A mid-afternoon siesta is the norm in parts of Spain and Italy. In China and Japan, nodding off is encouraged since working to the point of exhaustion is seen as a display of dedication, according to a study in the journal Sleep.",
      "Yet it's hard to catch a few z's during regular business hours in the United States, where people who nap can be viewed as lazy. The federal government even bans sleeping in its buildings while at work, except in rare circumstances.",
      "Individuals who are willing and able to challenge the status quo are becoming less hesitant to describe the payoffs of taking a dose of microsleep. Marvin Stockwell, the founder of PR firm Champion the Cause, takes short naps several times a week.",
      "\u201cThey rejuvenate me in a way that I\u2019m exponentially more useful and constructive and creative on the other side of a nap than I am when I\u2019m forcing myself to gut through being tired,\u201d Stockwell said.",
      "Sleep is as important to good health as diet and exercise, but too many people don\u2019t get enough of it, according to James Rowley, program director of the Sleep Medicine Fellowship at Rush University Medical Center.",
      "\u201cA lot of it has to do with electronics. It used to be TVs, but now cellphones are probably the biggest culprit. People just take them to bed with them and watch,\u201d Rowley said.\u201d",
      "Napping isn\u2019t common in academia, where there\u2019s constant pressure to publish, but University of Southern California lecturer Julianna Kirschner fits in daytime naps when she can. Kirschner studies social media, which she says is designed to deliver a dopamine rush to the brain. Viewers lose track of time on the platforms, interrupting sleep. Kirschner says she isn\u2019t immune to this problem \u2014 hence, her occasional need to nap.",
      "The key to effective napping is to keep the snooze sessions short, Rowley said. Short naps can be restorative and are more likely to leave you more alert, he said.",
      "\u201cMost people don\u2019t realize naps should be in the 15- to 20-minute range,\u201d Rowley said. \u201cAnything longer, and you can have problems with sleep inertia, difficulty waking up, and you\u2019re groggy.\u201d",
      "Individuals who find themselves consistently relying on naps to make up for inadequate sleep should probably also examine their bedtime habits, he said.",
      "Mid-afternoon is the ideal time for a nap because it coincides with a natural circadian dip, while napping after 6 p.m. may interfere with nocturnal sleep for those who work during daylight hours, said Michael Chee, director of the Centre for Sleep and Cognition at the National University of Singapore.",
      "\u201cAny duration of nap, you will feel recharged. It\u2019s a relief valve. There are clear cognitive benefits,\u201d Chee said.",
      "A review of napping studies suggests that 30 minutes is the optimal nap length in terms of practicality and benefits, said Ruth Leong, a research fellow at the Singapore center.",
      "\u201cWhen people nap for too long, it may not be a sustainable practice, and also, really long naps that cross the two-hour mark affect nighttime sleep,\u201d Leong said.",
      "Experts recommend setting an alarm for 20 to 30 minutes, which gives nappers a few minutes to fall asleep.",
      "But even a six-minute nap can be restorative and improve learning, said Valentin Dragoi, scientific director of the Center for Neural Systems Restoration, a research and treatment facility run by Houston Methodist hospital and Rice University.",
      "While workplace dozing is uncommon in the U.S., some companies and managers encourage it. Will Bryk, founder of AI search startup Exa, swears by 20-minute power naps and ordered two sleeping pods for employees to use in his company's San Francisco office.",
      "Ice cream maker Ben & Jerry\u2019s has had a nap room in its Vermont headquarters for a couple of decades, and a handful of employees use it, company spokesman Sean Greenwood said. \u201cEmployees who feel taken care of are much more likely to use this responsibly,\" he said.",
      "Arianna Huffington, the celebrity author who co-founded the news website Huffington Post, became an advocate of a good night\u2019s sleep and occasional naps after she collapsed from exhaustion in 2007. She installed a nap room at her former company, now called HuffPo, and at Thrive Global, a wellness technology company where she serves as founder and CEO.",
      "\u201cIf people have been up all night because of a sick child or a delayed flight, if they have the opportunity to nap, ... then they will be much more productive and creative for the rest of the day instead of dragging themselves or trying to boost their energy through multiple coffees or cinnamon buns,\u201d Huffington said in an email.",
      "Kirsten Perez, 33, is a devoted napper. She used to use her lunch break at work to catch a few winks in her car. When she got her own office, she closed the door for a siesta while sitting at her desk.",
      "Nowadays, working from home as a marketing manager at Nvidia, the Atlanta resident usually takes her daily nap in bed. She sets an alarm for 15 minutes, falls asleep within a minute and wakes up 30 seconds before the alarm rings.",
      "\u201cI can tell when my reasoning, my mood are dropping, just kind of feeling the drag of the day,\u201d Perez said. In those situations, she asks herself, \u201c\u2018Do I have a chunk of time in the next hour or so?\u2019 And then I\u2019ll figure out when I can find 15 minutes and find myself horizontal.\u201d",
      "Naps are accepted and even a necessity in some occupations. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention encourages naps for nurses working night shifts. But many nurses can't sleep at the hospitals where they work because they're too busy and aren't given access to beds.",
      "Nurses \"regularly struggle to have sufficient time to use the bathroom or go outside for fresh air, no less take a nap,\" Michelle Morris, spokesperson for the National Nurses United union, said.",
      "Some companies are trying to fill the void. Inspired by his mother who worked as a nurse, Neil Wong founded Nap York, which offers sleeping pods in Manhattan and Queens that can be rented for about $27 an hour.",
      "His regular customers include super-commuters, UPS drivers, a security guard who works two full-time jobs, and doctors who work at nearby hospitals. Nap York also gives half-off prices to essential workers such as police officers, firefighters and emergency medical service personnel.",
      "\u201cIn this society, you really only have two place to sleep: you have your bed at home and you have a hotel room you can probably get for 100 bucks,\u201d Wong said. \u201cThere\u2019s really no third space that\u2019s quiet, that provides some privacy, where you can also rest.\u201d",

      "Dairy cattle in Nevada have been infected with a new type of bird flu that's different from the version that has spread in herds since last year",
      "Dairy cattle in Nevada have been infected with a new type of bird flu that's different from the version that has spread in U.S. herds since last year, Agriculture Department officials said Wednesday.",
      "The detection indicates that distinct forms of the virus known as Type A H5N1 have spilled over from wild birds into cattle at least twice. Experts said it raises new questions about wider spread and the difficulty of controlling infections in animals and the people who work closely with them.",
      "\u201cI always thought one bird-to-cow transmission was a very rare event. Seems that may not be the case,\u201d said Richard Webby, an influenza expert at St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital.",
      "A version of the H5N1 bird flu virus known as B3.13 was confirmed in March after being introduced to cattle in late 2023, scientists said. It has infected more than 950 herds in 16 states. The new version, known as D1.1, was confirmed in Nevada cattle on Friday, according to USDA. It was detected in milk collected as part of a surveillance program launched in December.",
      "\u201cNow we know why it's really important to test and continue testing,\u201d said Angela Rasmussen, a virus expert at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada, who helped identify the first spillover.",
      "The D1.1 version of the virus was the type linked to the first U.S. death tied to bird flu and a severe illness in Canada. A person in Louisiana died in January after developing severe respiratory symptoms following contact with wild and backyard birds. In British Columbia, a teen girl was hospitalized for months with a virus traced to poultry.",
      "At least 67 people in the U.S. have been infected with bird flu, mostly those who work closely with dairy or cattle, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "USDA officials said they would post genetic sequences and other information about the new form of the virus to a public repository later this week. Scientists said that would be key to understanding whether the spillover was a recent event or whether the virus has been circulating, perhaps widely, for longer.",
      "\u201cIf this turns out to have been something that crossed into cattle a couple months ago, a couple months is a long time not to detect it,\u201d said Michael Worobey, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Arizona who has studied the H5N1 virus in cattle.",
      "He added that it's important for federal officials to share promptly information about a virus that has the potential to trigger a pandemic that could \u201cmake COVID seem like a walk in the park.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt's a vital part of national security, global security, the well-being of people, of animals and of businesses in the U.S.,\u201d Worobey added.",

      "A Wisconsin couple is suing Walgreens and a pharmacy benefits company alleging their son died because he couldn't afford a sudden $500 jump in the cost of his asthma medication",
      "LA CROSSE, Wis. -- A Wisconsin couple is suing Walgreens and a pharmacy benefits management company, alleging that their son died because he couldn't afford a sudden $500 spike in his asthma medication.",
      "Shanon and William Schmidtknecht, of Poynette, filed their lawsuit in federal court in Milwaukee on Jan. 21, a year to the day that their son Cole died at age 22.",
      "According to the lawsuit, Cole Schmidtknecht suffered from asthma all his life. He managed it with daily doses of the medication Advair Diskus and its generic equivalents, which he ingested through an inhaler.",
      "He stopped at a Walgreens pharmacy in Appleton on Jan. 10, 2024, to refill his prescription and was told the cost had jumped from $66 to $539 out-of-pocket. Unable to afford the new cost, he left the pharmacy without the medication. He tried to manage his condition with his rescue inhaler but suffered a fatal asthma attack days later, according to the lawsuit.",
      "The Schmidtknechts allege that pharmacy benefits management company OptumRX violated Wisconsin law by raising the cost of the medication without a valid medical reason and failing to provide 30 days' advance notice of drug price increases.",
      "Pharmacy benefits managers act as intermediaries between health insurance companies, prescription drug companies and pharmacies. Optum Rx services prescription claims for more than 66 million people across the United States, according to the lawsuit.",
      "The lawsuit alleges that the Walgreens pharmacy staffers failed to offer Cole any workarounds to obtain his usual medication. They told him there were no cheaper alternatives or generic medications available, they didn't contact OptumRx to request an exception on Cole's behalf, and they didn't ask Cole's doctor to request an exception for him, his parents contend.",
      "The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages.",
      "\u201cThe conduct of both OptumRx and Walgreens was deplorable,\u201d one of the family's attorneys, Michael Trunk, said in a statement. \u201cThe evidence in this case will show that both OptumRx and Walgreens put profits first, and are directly responsible for Cole\u2019s death.\"",
      "OptumRx spokespeople didn't immediately reply to Wednesday messages seeking comment. In a statement last April extending sympathy to the family, the company said that a review of Cole's claims showed that on the day he visited the pharmacy, he did buy a different asthma medication, generic Albuterol, for a $5 co-pay on Jan. 10 \u2014 a medication that it says he also obtained in October 2023. His case was handled \u201cconsistent with industry practice and the patient's insurance plan design,\u201d the company said.",
      "Trunk, though, said Wednesday that the $5 generic prescription Cole filled was for his rescue inhaler, not the Advair Diskus inhaler that he took daily. He said Cole was not able to fill his Advair Diskus prescription because it had suddenly become too expensive.",
      "Walgreens officials didn't immediately respond to a Wednesday email seeking comment on the lawsuit."

      "In 2021 and 2022, the maternal death rate for Black women was about 2.6 times higher than white women.",
      "The data suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic, at its peak, impacted all pregnant women. But \u201conce we went back to \u2018usual activities,\u2019 then the impact of systemic racism and unequal access (to medical care) ... came right back into place,\u201d said Dr. Amanda Williams, interim medical director for the March of Dimes.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's report Wednesday on the 2023 deaths was drawn from death certificates. The CDC counts women who died while pregnant, during childbirth and up to 42 days after birth. Accidental deaths are excluded.",
      "The report found:",
      "\u2014 The maternal death rate for white women dropped from 19 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2022 to 14.5 per 100,000 in 2023.",
      "\u2014 The rate for Black women went from 49.5 to a little above 50, though the report says that increase was not statistically significant.",

      "\u2014 The rate for Asian Americans fell from about 13 to about 11.",
      "In total, 669 women died in 2023 during pregnancy or shortly after childbirth, the CDC reported. That\u2019s down from 817 deaths in 2022 and 1,205 in 2021, when it was the highest in more than 50 years.",
      "Excessive bleeding, blood vessel blockages and infections are leading causes of maternal deaths.",
      "Among those infections is COVID-19. The coronavirus and its complications proved dangerous to pregnant women. And, in the worst days of the pandemic, burned out physicians may have added to the risk by ignoring pregnant women\u2019s worries, experts say.",
      "COVID-19\u2019s overall impact on pregnancies declined as the pandemic subsided and as hospitals and birthing centers returned to normal operations.",
      "Also, the federal Medicaid program expanded to cover postpartum care for up to 12 months, instead of just seven weeks. That helped more moms recover and made them healthier for the next time they tried to have a baby, Williams said.",
      "The number of maternal deaths is also tied to the number of pregnancies. U.S. births have been declining, and fewer pregnancies contributes to fewer pregnancy-related deaths, noted Eugene Declercq, a maternal deaths researcher at Boston University.",
      "CDC officials refused an Associated Press request to talk to a report author.",
      "The government is still receiving and processing death reports from last year. But Declercq said his analysis of available data suggests the number of 2024 maternal deaths may end up about the same as 2023.",

      "She's not the only one, Brian Bond, the CEO of PFLAG, said on a conference call with reporters. \u201cWe are receiving a drumbeat of calls from parents whose kids' care is being canceled.\u201d",
      "The ACLU and Lambda Legal, who are representing the plaintiffs, want a judge to put the order on hold. In a court filing Tuesday, they said Trump's executive orders are \u201cunlawful and unconstitutional\u201d because they seek to withhold federal funds previously authorized by Congress and because they violate antidiscrimination laws. The challenge also says that the order infringes on the rights of parents.",
      "Like legal challenges to state bans on gender-affirming care, they also argue that the policy discriminates because it does not prohibit federal funds for the same treatments when they're not used for gender transition.",
      "The White House did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday.",
      "Some health providers immediately paused providing the coverage while they assess how the order affects them. New York Attorney General Letitia James, who has repeatedly battled Trump in court, told hospitals in her state Monday that it would violate the law to stop offering gender-affirming care to people under 19.",
      "Josh Block, an ACLU lawyer on the case, said that medical providers should continue gender-affirming care for people under 19. \u201cIt should not take either a protest, a letter from the attorney general or a TRO,\u201d or temporary restraining order from the court for them to do so.",
      "Trump's approach on transgender policy represents an abrupt change from the Biden administration, which sought to explicitly extend civil rights protections to transgender people.",
      "Trump has used strong language, asserting in the order on gender-affirming care that \"medical professionals are maiming and sterilizing a growing number of impressionable children under the radical and false claim that adults can change a child\u2019s sex.\u201d",
      "Alex Sheldon, executive director of GLMA, the doctors group in the legal challenge, said there are established medical standards for caring for transgender youth. \u201cNow, an extreme political agenda is trying to overrule that expertise, putting young people and their providers in danger,\" Sheldon said in a statement. \"We are confident that the law, science, and history are on our side.\u201d",
      "In addition to the orders on health care access and defining the sexes as unchangeable, Trump has also signed orders that open the door to banning transgender people from military service and set up new rules about how schools can teach about gender.",
      "Legal challenges have already been filed on the military order and a plan to move transgender women in federal prisons to men's facilities. Others are expected to be filed, just as there have been challenges to a variety of Trump's policies.",
      "Researchers have found that fewer than 1 in 1,000 adolescents receive the care, which includes treatments such as puberty blockers, hormone treatments and surgeries \u2014 though surgery is rare for children.",
      "As transgender people have gained visibility and acceptance in some ways, there's been vehement pushback. At least 26 states have passed laws to restrict or ban the care for minors. The U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments last year but has not yet ruled on whether Tennessee's ban on the care is constitutional.",

      "North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein has asked state legislators to double their spending to date on Hurricane Helene recovery and approve it now",
      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) \u2014 North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein asked state legislators Monday to roughly double their spending so far on recovery from Hurricane Helene, warning that waiting will cause more business closings, housing construction delays and students falling behind.",
      "Speaking in a mountain county hit by the historic flooding, the new Democratic governor said he wants his $1.07 billion request enacted now by the Republican-controlled General Assembly \u2014 rather than wait for the two-year budget that starts in July, for which he'll make an additional Helene appeal.",
      "At a news conference at a food bank in Mills River, about 260 miles (420 kilometers) west of Raleigh, Stein said the funds are urgently needed in the first half of the year \u201cso that people can get their lives back together.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf we do not act, some businesses will not be here in the summer, and we will miss an entire building season before the winter weather comes again,\u201d he warned, calling the funds a high priority.",
      "The largest chunks of his proposal, which contains no tax increases, would fund grants for struggling businesses; help repair and rebuild homes; clean up farm debris; fix private bridges and roads; and replace revenues spent or lost by local governments. There's also money for summer school in districts that lost at least 15 instructional days shortly after Helene's rampage last September.",
      "\u201cWe can ensure that our students are set up for long-term academic success.,\u201d Stein said. \u201cAll of these components are necessary to building a safer, stronger and more resilient western North Carolina, and they are needed now.\u201d",
      "The state legislature already appropriated last fall well over $900 million for relief and rebuilding efforts and earmarked a couple of hundred million more for that purpose in the future. New House Speaker Destin Hall has said getting bipartisan early-session Helene funding bill to Stein's desk was a top priority.",
      "Advancing Monday's package could provide an early test for Stein, who was sworn in last month, in his efforts to find consensus with Hall and Senate leader Phil Berger. While Republicans control both chambers, they are one seat short of a veto-proof majority.",
      "GOP Rep. Jake Johnson of Polk County, who served on a bipartisan Helene advisory committee organized by Stein last year, spoke at the news conference with an optimistic tone.",
      "\u201cWe will start reviewing the governor\u2019s proposed budget and figuring out how we can get these dollars to people who need them the most right now,\u201d Johnson said.",
      "Berger spokesperson Lauren Horsch said Monday that the Senate is reviewing Stein\u2019s proposal and anticipates considering Helene legislation in the coming weeks. Even with the money already put toward the recovery, Horsch added, \u201cthere is still more we can do.\u201d",
      "North Carolina state officials reported over 100 deaths from Helene with 74,000 homes and thousands of miles in both state-maintained and private roads damaged. The state budget office estimated that Helene caused a record $59.6 billion in damages and recovery needs. Congressional legislation approved in December and other federal actions are projected to provide over $15 billion to North Carolina for rebuilding.",
      "Helene made landfall last Sept. 26 in Florida\u2019s Big Bend and swept far inland, upending life throughout the Southeast. Officials have warned that rebuilding from the widespread loss of homes and property would be lengthy and difficult.",
      "Stein's request to spend money currently sitting in two reserves emphasizes speed.",
      "The $150 million sought for a home reconstruction, repair and buyout program is designed so such work can begin immediately while awaiting the distribution from Washington of similar housing assistance, which could take a year. The state program could assist at least 225 of 5,100 homes estimated to need rebuilding, Stein\u2019s request says.",
      "Stein also wants $150 million for two business grant programs designed to provide up to $75,000 to companies that suffered significant sales and economic losses, it physical damages.",
      "Stein said on Monday that \u201ctaking on additional business debt is simply not the answer for small businesses that are already struggling.\u201d",
      "In a special session last week, Tennessee lawmakers approved Gov. Bill Lee\u2019s $470 million package offering further aid for communities ravaged by Helene in the northeast part of that state. The package will help local governments cover loan interest on recovery costs, fuel agricultural and business recovery, fund disaster-related unemployment aid, and pay for rebuilding a badly damaged high school.",

      "Officials are investigating the source of the outbreak. Ebola is spread by contact with bodily fluids of an infected person or contaminated materials. Symptoms include fever, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle pain and at times internal and external bleeding.",
      "Responding to this outbreak could prove difficult because Kampala has a highly mobile population of about 4 million. The nurse who died had sought treatment at a hospital just outside the capital and later traveled to Mbale in the country\u2019s east, where he was admitted to a public hospital.

      "The confirmation of Ebola in Uganda is the latest in a series of outbreaks of viral hemorrhagic fevers in the east African region. Tanzania declared an outbreak of the Ebola-like Marburg disease last month, and Rwanda in December announced that its own outbreak of Marburg was over.",
      "Scientists don\u2019t know the natural reservoir of Ebola, but they suspect the first person infected in an outbreak acquired the virus through contact with an infected animal or eating its raw meat.",
      "Ebola was discovered in 1976 in two simultaneous outbreaks in South Sudan and Congo, where it occurred in a village near the Ebola River, after which the disease is named."

      "NEW YORK -- New York Attorney General Letitia James on Monday told hospitals that they would be violating state law if they stop offering gender-affirming care for people under age 19 in response to an executive order from President Donald Trump aimed at curtailing federal funding for such treatments.",

      "\"Regardless of the availability of federal funding, we write to further remind you of your obligations to comply with New York State laws,\" her letter reads.",

      "GOMA, Congo -- Hundreds of wounded people have poured into overcrowded hospitals in Goma, a major city in eastern Congo, as fighting rages on between government forces and the Rwanda-backed rebels who seized the city of around 2 million people.",
      "\u201cThey will get infected before we can treat them all,\u201d said Florence Douet, an operating room nurse at Bethesda Hospital, as she attended to patients with varying degrees of injuries.",
      "Since the start of the M23 rebels' offensive on Goma on Jan. 26, more than 700 people have been killed and nearly 3,000 have been wounded in the city and its vicinity, officials say. Bethesda Hospital alone said it receives more than 100 new patients each day, overstretching its capacity of 250 beds.",
      "Bethesda is one of several hospitals in Goma that The Associated Press visited that has inadequate personnel and supplies. The city hosts many of the close to 6.5 million people displaced by the conflict, which is one of the world\u2019s largest humanitarian crises.",
      "As more people arrived at the hospitals with gunshot or shrapnel wounds, many were forced to share beds while others lay on the floor, writhing in pain as they waited for medical attention.",

      "The M23 rebels are backed by some 4,000 troops from neighboring Rwanda, according to U.N. experts, far more than in 2012, when they first captured Goma before withdrawing under international pressure. They are the most potent of the more than 100 armed groups vying for control in Congo\u2019s mineral-rich east, which holds vast deposits critical to much of the world\u2019s technology.",
      "Unlike in 2012, the rebels say they now plan to march to Congo\u2019s capital, Kinshasa, 1,000 miles (1,609 kilometers) away, describing the country as a failed state under President F\u00e9lix Tshisekedi.",
      "The fighting in Congo has connections with a decadeslong ethnic conflict. M23 says it is defending ethnic Tutsis in Congo. Rwanda has claimed the Tutsis are being persecuted by Hutus and former militias responsible for the 1994 genocide of 800,000 Tutsis and others in Rwanda. Many Hutus fled to Congo after the genocide and founded the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR) militia group.

      "\"We removed 48 bullets yesterday,\u201d Johnny Kasangati, a surgeon, said Friday as he examined a patient under a tent.",
      "Kyeshero is also severely overcrowded, hitting more than 200% of its capacity on some days, according to Joseph Amadomon Sagara, a project coordinator for Doctors Without Borders, which runs the hospital.",
      "In the past, hospitals in Goma could transport wounded patients by boat to South Kivu's main Bukavu city, 180 kilometers (111 miles) to the south, but transport across Lake Kivu was suspended during the rebellion and roads have been mostly cut.",
      "The fighting in and around Goma has also disrupted supply chains, leading to shortages in medical supplies that aid groups rely on. Some of it previously entered the city through its international airport, which is now under rebel control.",
      "\u201cGoma was cut off from the world. It was a total blackout,\" said Virginie Napolitano, Goma's emergency coordinator for Doctors Without Borders.",
      "The aid group's stockpiles, along with those of other groups, have been looted.",
      "\"We\u2019re getting by with what we had in the cabinets, but I don\u2019t know for how long,\u201d Napolitano said.",

      "Over the past 15 months, Israel\u2019s campaign against Hamas in retaliation for the militants\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel has decimated Gaza\u2019s health sector, leaving most of its hospitals out of operation even as more than 110,000 Palestinians were wounded by Israel\u2019s bombardment and ground offensives, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry.",
      "Remaining facilities are unable to perform many crucial treatments or specialized surgeries for wounds or diseases. Mohammed Zaqout, the director of hospitals in Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry, said more than 6,000 patients were ready to be evacuated abroad, and more than 12,000 patients were in urgent need of treatment. He said the small numbers set to be evacuated will not cover the need, \u201cand we hope the number will increase.\u201d",
      "Rafah is Gaza\u2019s only crossing that does not enter into Israel. Israeli forces closed the crossing in early May after seizing it during an offensive on the southern city. Egypt shut down its side of the passage in protest.",
      "Even before the Gaza war began, the Rafah crossing represented a crucial escape valve from the territory, where a 15-year Israeli-Egyptian blockade aimed at containing Hamas undermined health facilities and impoverished the population. Palestinians routinely applied for permission to travel outside the territory for lifesaving treatments not available in Gaza, including chemotherapy.",
      "It took some diplomatic gymnastics to reopen the crossing and overcome security disputes between Israeli, Egyptian and Palestinian officials. Hamas had overseen the border since 2007, when it took control of Gaza from its rival, the internationally recognized Palestinian Authority, or PA, after winning parliamentary elections in 2006.",
      "Israeli troops remain at the Rafah crossing and in the Philadelphia Corridor, a band of land running the length of the border. Israel has refused to allow Hamas to resume management of the crossing, accusing it of smuggling weapons through tunnels under the border, though Egypt says it destroyed the tunnels from its side and stopped smuggling years ago. Israel also refuses to allow the Palestinian Authority to officially run the crossing.",
      "Instead, the crossing will be staffed by Palestinians from Gaza who previously served as border officers with the PA, but they will not be allowed to wear official PA insignia, a European diplomat said, speaking on condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to brief the media. Israel has screened the officers to ensure they have no affiliation with Hamas, the European diplomat added.",
      "European Union monitors will also be present, as they were before 2007.",
      "Negotiations on the second phase of the deal \u2014 which calls for a permanent ceasefire, full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and the release of any remaining hostages \u2014 are supposed to begin Monday. Israel has resisted the notion that the PA would control postwar Gaza."

      "GENEVA -- The World Health Organization chief asked global leaders to lean on Washington to reverse President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw from the U.N. health agency, insisting in a closed-door meeting with diplomats last week that the U.S. will miss out on critical information about global disease outbreaks.",
      "But countries also pressed WHO at a key budget meeting last Wednesday about how it might cope with the exit of its biggest donor, according to internal meeting materials obtained by The Associated Press. A German envoy, Bjorn Kummel, warned: \u201cThe roof is on fire, and we need to stop the fire as soon as possible.\u201d",
      "For 2024-2025, the U.S. is WHO\u2019s biggest donor by far, putting in an estimated $988 million, roughly 14% of WHO\u2019s $6.9 billion budget.",
      "A budget document presented at the meeting showed WHO\u2019s health emergencies program has a \u201cheavy reliance\u201d on American cash. \u201cReadiness functions\u201d in WHO\u2019s Europe office were more than 80% reliant on the $154 million the U.S. contributes.",
      "The document said U.S. funding \u201cprovides the backbone of many of WHO's large-scale emergency operations,\u201d covering up to 40%. It said responses in the Middle East, Ukraine and Sudan were at risk, in addition to hundreds of millions of dollars lost by polio-eradication and HIV programs.",
      "The U.S. also covers 95% of WHO's tuberculosis work in Europe and more than 60% of TB efforts in Africa, the Western Pacific and at the agency headquarters in Geneva, the document said.",
      "At a separate private meeting on the impact of the U.S. exit last Wednesday, WHO finance director George Kyriacou said if the agency spends at its current rate, the organization would \u201cbe very much in a hand-to-mouth type situation when it comes to our cash flows\u201d in the first half of 2026. He added the current rate of spending is \u201csomething we're not going to do,\" according to a recording obtained by the AP.",
      "Since Trump\u2019s executive order, WHO has attempted to withdraw funds from the U.S. for past expenses, Kyriacou said, but most of those \u201chave not been accepted.\u201d",
      "The U.S. also has yet to settle its owed contributions to WHO for 2024, pushing the agency into a deficit, he added.",
      "WHO's executive board, made up of 34 high-level envoys including many national health ministers, was expected to discuss budget matters during its latest session, which opens Monday and is set to run through Feb. 11.",
      "Last week, officials at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were instructed to stop working with WHO immediately.",
      "WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told the attendees at the budget meeting that the agency is still providing U.S. scientists with some data \u2014 though it isn't known what data.",
      "\u201cWe continue to give them information because they need it,\u201d Tedros said, urging member countries to contact U.S officials. \u201cWe would appreciate it if you continue to push and reach out to them to reconsider.\u201d",
      "Among other health crises, WHO is currently working to stop outbreaks of Marburg virus in Tanzania, Ebola in Uganda and mpox in Congo.",
      "Tedros rebutted Trump\u2019s three stated reasons for leaving the agency in the executive order signed on Jan. 20 \u2014 Trump's first day back in office. In the order, the president said WHO mishandled the COVID-19 pandemic that began in China, failed to adopt needed reforms and that U.S. membership required \u201cunfairly onerous payments.\"",
      "Tedros said WHO alerted the world in January 2020 about the potential dangers of the coronavirus and has made dozens of reforms since \u2014 including efforts to expand its donor base.",
      "Tedros also said he believed the U.S. departure was \u201cnot about the money\u201d but more about the \u201cvoid\u201d in outbreak details and other critical health information that the United States would face in the future.",
      "\u201cBringing the U.S. back will be very important,\" he told meeting attendees. \"And on that, I think all of you can play a role.\u201d",
      "Kummel, a senior advisor on global health in Germany's health ministry, described the U.S. exit as \u201cthe most extensive crisis WHO has been facing in the past decades.\u201d",
      "He also asked: \u201cWhat concrete functions of WHO will collapse if the funding of the U.S. is not existent anymore?\u201d",
      "Officials from countries including Bangladesh and France asked what specific plans WHO had to deal with the loss of U.S. funding and wondered which health programs would be cut as a result.",
      "The AP obtained a document shared among some WHO senior managers that laid out several options, including a proposal that each major department or office might be slashed in half by the end of the year.",
      "WHO declined to comment on whether Tedros had privately asked countries to lobby on the agency's behalf.",
      "Some experts said that while the departure of the U.S. was a major crisis, it might also serve as an opportunity to reshape global public health.",
      "Less than 1% of the U.S. health budget goes to WHO, said Matthew Kavanagh, director of Georgetown University\u2019s Center for Global Health Policy and Politics. In exchange, the U.S. gets \u201ca wide variety of benefits to Americans that matter quite a bit,\u201d he said. That includes intelligence about disease epidemics globally and virus samples for vaccines.",
      "Kavanagh also said the WHO is \"massively underfunded,\u201d describing the contributions from rich countries as \u201cpeanuts.\u201d",

      "Israel says it has begun preparations for the departure of large numbers of Palestinians from the Gaza Strip in line with President Donald Trump\u2019s plan for the territory",
      "CAIRO -- Israel said on Thursday it has begun preparations for the departure of large numbers of Palestinians from the Gaza Strip in line with President Donald Trump's plan for the territory. Officials meanwhile said Egypt has launched an diplomatic blitz behind the scenes to try and head off the plan.",
      "The Trump administration has already dialed back aspects of the proposal after it was widely rejected internationally, saying the relocation of Palestinians would be temporary. U.S. officials have provided few details about how or when the plan would be carried out.",
      "In a social media post on Thursday, Trump said Israel would turn Gaza over to the United States after the war and that no U.S. soldiers would be needed for his plan to redevelop it.",
      "The Palestinians have vehemently rejected Trump's proposal, fearing that Israel would never allow refugees to return. Egypt has warned that an expulsion of Palestinians would destabilize the region and undermine its peace treaty with Israel, a cornerstone of stability and American influence for decades.",
      "Saudi Arabia, another key U.S. ally, has also rejected any mass transfer of Palestinians and says it will not normalize relations with Israel \u2014 a key goal of the Trump administration \u2014 without the creation of a Palestinian state that includes Gaza.",
      "Trump and Israeli officials have depicted the proposed relocation from war-ravaged Gaza as voluntary, but the Palestinians have universally expressed their determination to remain in their homeland.",
      "Trump and Israeli officials have not said how they would respond if Palestinians refuse to leave. But Human Rights Watch and other groups say the plan, if implemented, would amount to \u201cethnic cleansing,\u201d the forcible relocation of the civilian population of an ethnic group from a geographic area.",
      "Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said he has ordered the military to make preparations to facilitate the emigration of large numbers of Palestinians from Gaza through land crossings as well as \u201cspecial arrangements for exit by sea and air.\u201d",
      "There were no immediate signs of such preparations on the ground.",
      "Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi has not publicly responded to Trump's stunning proposal that most of Gaza's population of 2.3 million Palestinians be relocated and the United States take charge of rebuilding the territory. Israel's 15-month campaign against the militant Hamas group had reduced large parts of Gaza to rubble before a fragile ceasefire took hold last month.",
      "But Egyptian officials, speaking Wednesday on condition of anonymity to discuss the closed-door talks, said Cairo has made clear to the Trump administration and Israel that it will resist any such proposal, and that the peace deal with Israel \u2014 which has stood for nearly half a century \u2014 is at risk.",
      "One official said the message has been delivered to the Pentagon, the State Department and members of the U.S. Congress. A second official said it has also been conveyed to Israel and its Western European allies, including Britain, France and Germany.",
      "A Western diplomat in Cairo, also speaking anonymously because the discussions have not been made public, confirmed receiving the message from Egypt through multiple channels. The diplomat said Egypt was very serious and viewed the plan as a threat to its national security.",
      "The diplomat said Egypt rejected similar proposals from the Biden administration and European countries early in the war, which was sparked by Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 attack into southern Israel. The earlier proposals were broached privately, while Trump announced his plan at a White House press conference alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.",
      "Trump said he wanted to \u201cpermanently\u201d resettle most of Gaza's population in other countries and for the United States to take charge of clearing debris and rebuilding Gaza as a \u201cRiviera of the Middle East\" for all people. He did not rule out the deployment of U.S. troops there.",
      "U.S. officials later appeared to walk it back, saying the relocation of Palestinians would be temporary and that Trump had not committed to putting American boots on the ground or spending American tax dollars in Gaza.",
      "The Egyptian officials said their government does not believe the Palestinians need to be relocated for reconstruction to proceed and is committed to the creation of a Palestinian state in Gaza, the West Bank and east Jerusalem, territories Israel seized in the 1967 Mideast war.",
      "Israel's government is opposed to Palestinian statehood and has said it will maintain open-ended security control over both Gaza and the occupied West Bank. Israel annexed east Jerusalem in a move not recognized by most of the international community and considers the entire city its capital.",
      "Last week, Egypt hosted a meeting of top diplomats from Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates \u2014 which was the driving force behind the 2020 Abraham Accords Trump brokered with Israel. All five Arab nations rejected the transfer of Palestinians out of Gaza or the West Bank.",
      "In an editorial on Thursday, Egypt\u2019s main state-run daily, Al-Ahram, warned that \u201cthe Arab countries' independence, their peoples\u2019 unity and their territorial integrity are under grave threat.\u201d",

      "The attacks in areas where Jewish people live have provoked an outpouring of condemnation \u2014 and a fraught and complicated debate about who\u2019s to blame. But in a rare moment of unity, Australia\u2019s federal lawmakers on Thursday advanced hate crime laws almost unanimously.",

And although how groups define antisemitism and Islamophobia differs, the numbers the organizations cite all show a rise in incidents.",
      "Antisemitic episodes in the two biggest cities, Sydney and Melbourne \u2014 home to 85% of Australia\u2019s Jewish population \u2014 have drawn the highest profile because they\u2019re severe, unusual and public.",

      "Investigators are examining whether criminals for hire were paid by foreign actors to carry out the recent attacks, leaders of the taskforce said in January. They did not specify what foreign interests they believed were responsible.",
      "Days later, officials said the 12 arrested by the taskforce don't share the antisemitic ideology expressed by their crimes, underscoring suggestions that the acts were orchestrated abroad.",
      "The revelations were strange \u2014 but not unprecedented, analysts said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not completely new, the connection between ideological groups and criminal groups,\u201d said Matteo Vergani, a researcher of hate and extremism with Deakin University. \u201cWhat\u2019s new is that it usually happens in relation to larger scale terrorist attacks. So that is surprising.\u201d",
      "Lawmakers in speeches this week said the Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas had provoked a outburst of antisemitism at levels Australia had not registered before.",

      "\u201cBut I think the real danger we see here with linking this spate of antisemitic incidents to the Palestine solidarity movement is that that sort of language breeds division, breeds anti-Palestinian racism, breeds Islamophobia and is also bad for Jews as well,\u201d she said.",

      "By all measures, anti-Jewish hate has spiked across the U.S., Europe and the United Kingdom since October 2023 \u2014 even though many leaders have denounced it \u2014 prompting tens of thousands of Jews to leave Europe, according to some figures.",
      "However, Australia\u2019s situation had distinctive factors, analysts said. One was the claim that the primary agitators could be based abroad.",
      "Another was the shock of such hate in a country far from the Middle East where a small community of Jews \u2014 fewer than 120,000 people, or about 0.5% of the population \u2014 has lived relatively peacefully, said Wertheim.",
      "Australia\u2019s restrictive gun laws might have led the perpetrators to commit vandalism crimes, Vergani said. Semiautomatic rifles were outlawed in Australia after a gun massacre in 1996.",
      "But the episodes have also driven a fraught political climate ahead of a national election due by May 17.",
      "Antisemitic attacks have led national news and prompted daily questions for Albanese \u2014 and claims of inaction from his main political opponent, conservative Liberal party leader Dutton. Meanwhile, Dutton\u2019s detractors have lambasted him for politicizing the crimes \u2014 a charge he has rejected \u2014 and for urging a freeze on visas for Palestinians fleeing the war.",

      "De Sarno\u2019s tenure was marked by a return to more essential silhouettes and wardrobe basics that sought broader public appeal \u2014 but ultimately had disappointing sales. Kering earnings have been slipping, with third quarter revenues down 15% to 3.8 billion euros as Gucci revenue plunged 26% to 1.6 billion euros. Kering announces its full-year earnings next week.",

      "MOSUL, Iraq -- For over 850 years, the leaning minaret of the Great Mosque of al-Nuri stood as an iconic landmark in the Iraqi city of Mosul until it was destroyed by the Islamic State group in 2017.",
      "Nearly eight years after IS militants were driven out of the city, the minaret has been rebuilt as part of a massive internationally-funded reconstruction project in the historic city.",
      "Saad Muhammed Jarjees, who lives in Mosul\u2019s Old City, remembered how he used to look at the Al-Hadbaa Minaret from the window of his house every day \u2014 and how his heart sank when it fell.",
      "\u201cDuring the Islamic State occupation, I would look at it every morning and see their flag flying on top,\u201d he recalled. \u201cWe longed for the day that flag would come down \u2014 it would mean we were liberated.\"",
      "\u201cThen one morning, we woke up to find the entire minaret gone,\u201d he said.",
      "UNESCO, the U.N.\u2019s scientific, educational and cultural organization, worked alongside Iraqi heritage and Sunni religious authorities to reconstruct the minaret using traditional techniques and materials salvaged from the rubble.",
      "For residents of Mosul, the restoration is deeply personal.",
      "\u201cThis mosque is considered the identity of Mosul\u2019s people,\u201d said Mohammed Khalil Al-Assaf, an imam in the city. \u201cWhen we came here today to see the Al-Hadbaa Minaret, we were reminded of beautiful past memories in this holy mosque.\u201d",
      "An official reopening of the minaret is expected to take place in the coming weeks with Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani in attendance.",
      "\u201cThe Al-Hadbaa Minaret is one of the most symbolic sites for the people of Mosul, and today this symbol is completely brought back to life,\u201d said Ruwaid Allayla, Director of the State Board of Antiquities and Heritage.",
      "\u201cThe heritage authority ensured the use of original materials for reconstruction to preserve its exceptional value and authenticity and keep it on UNESCO\u2019s World Heritage list.\" Allayla said.",
      "Omar Taqa, the site engineer for Al-Hadbaa Minaret and the Great Al-Nuri Mosque, detailed the difficulties of rebuilding a site so severely damaged by war.",
      "\u201cSome of the biggest challenges in the reconstruction of Al-Hadbaa Minaret included the removal of war remnants that were mixed with the rubble and separating the artifacts from the debris,\u201d Taqa said.",
      "The team also needed to conduct detailed engineering and historical studies to design a site that would preserve the essence of the original, he said.",
      "On a visit to the city on Wednesday, UNESCO Director-General Audrey Azoulay toured the minaret and the al-Nuri Mosque and other restored sites including the al-Hadbaa Minaret and the al-Tahira and al-Sa'aa churches.",
      "\u201cThis intervention in a post-conflict environment was unprecedented in its complexity,\u201d she said. \u201c80% of the Old City had been destroyed. When our first team arrived on-site in 2018, they were faced with a field of ruins.\u201d",
      "UNESCO mobilized $115 million for the reconstruction project, with large shares coming from the United Arab Emirates and the European Union, Azoulay said.",
      "The reconstruction push has also aimed to restore the city's Christian sites. In 2003, Mosul's Christian population stood at around 50,000. Many of them fled after IS seized control of Mosul in 2014.",
      "Today, less than 20 Christian families remain as permanent residents in the city. Others who fled to Irbil and other surrounding areas have not returned to their homes in Mosul but commute there for church on Sundays.",
      "At al-Tahira Church, which was also restored, Mar Benedictus Younan Hanno, Archbishop of Mosul for Syriac Catholics, said the reconstruction is about more than just buildings.",
      "\u201cThe main goal of rebuilding churches today is to revive the history that our ancestors lived,\u201d Hanno said. \u201cWhen Mosul Christians come to this church, they remember the place where they got educated and baptized, and the place where they prayed. This could possibly give them an incentive to return.\u201d",
      "Azoulay said that the sound of church bells ringing and church choirs singing in Mosul again sends a powerful message.",
      "\u201cIt sends the message that the city is returning to its true identity, which is a plural identity,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very important sign of hope that this church was rebuilt by Iraqi people, mostly Muslims, who are happy to restore it for this community.\"",
      "UNESCO\u2019s experience in Mosul will shape its approach to restoring other cultural sites in war-torn areas -- including neighboring Syria, which is now starting to emerge from nearly 14 years of civil war after the fall of former President Bashar Assad.",
      "\u201cThis initiative is also a legacy for UNESCO,\u201d Azoulay said. \u201cOur organization has acquired new expertise in post-conflict situations that it will be able to replicate in other crisis situations.\u201d",
      "Azoulay declined to comment on UNESCO\u2019s specific plans for Syria. But she told the AP that the work its done to support Mosul \"is something we would love to do elsewhere, if political and security conditions allow.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe wounds of this city will take a long time to heal,\u201d Azoulay said. \u201cbut this is a beautiful start.\u201d"

      "TEHRAN, Iran -- TEHRAN, Iran (AP) \u2014 Iran has inaugurated its first drone-carrier warship, saying the vessel is capable of operating in oceans far from its mainland, the official IRNA news agency reported Thursday.",
      "The report said the vessel, manned by the paramilitary Revolutionary Guard\u2019s navy, can carry several squadrons of drones as well as helicopters and cruise missiles. Named Shahid Bagheri, it's capable of launching cruise missiles, IRNA said.",
      "With a 180-meter-long runway for drones, the vessel can travel up to 22,000 nautical miles without needing to refuel in ports. The report said it was converted from a commercial ship and would increase Iran\u2019s power of deterrence.",

      "Chief of the Guard\u2019s navy Adm. Ali Reza Tangsiri said it took more than two years to build the warship from the commercial vessel.",
      "The report said the ship also has a hospital and facilities such as a gym for its crew.",
      "Iran has long vowed to boost its presence on seas worldwide. Since 1992, Iran began a military self-sufficiency plan under which it claims the production of its own submarines, jet fighters and military tanks."

      "Rights groups are demanding criminal charges be brought against members of Greece\u2019s coast guard over a deadly 2023 migrant shipwreck",
      "ATHENS, Greece -- Rights groups are demanding criminal charges be brought against members of Greece\u2019s coast guard over a deadly 2023 migrant shipwreck, after the country's ombudsman released a report noting \u201cclear indications\u201d that officers had overlooked the danger posed by the boat that sank.",
      "The Adriana, a massively overcrowded fishing trawler, had been heading from Libya to Italy with an estimated 500-750 people on board when it sank in international waters west of Pylos in western Greece in June 2023. Only 104 people survived, while 82 bodies were recovered. The rest went down with the trawler in one of the deepest parts of the Mediterranean.",
      "An independent investigation by Greece\u2019s ombudsman into the shipwreck concluded this week that there were \u201cclear indications\u201d that eight senior coast guard officers should face disciplinary action for overlooking the dangers posed by the trawler.",
      "The coast guard, which had been notified about the boat by Italian authorities, had been shadowing the vessel for hours as it sailed in international waters but within Greece\u2019s area of responsibility for search and rescue.",
      "At the time, the coast guard said the Adriana's captain had insisted he did not want assistance and wanted to continue sailing to Italy. But several survivors said passengers had been calling for help repeatedly, and said that the boat capsized during an attempt by the Greek coast guard to tow it.",
      "The ombudsman said Monday its report noted \u201ca series of serious and reproachable omissions in the search and rescue duties by senior officers of the Hellenic Coast Guard which constitute clear indications\u201d for establishing a case against the officers for endangering the lives of the Adriana\u2019s passengers.",
      "The independent body began its own investigation in November 2023 after \u201cthe direct refusal of a disciplinary investigation by the Coast Guard,\u201d it said.",
      "The Shipping and Island Policy Ministry, under whose jurisdiction the coast guard lies, rejected the ombudsman\u2019s report, accusing it of \u201cattempting to shift the conversation from the criminal smuggling networks to the members of the coast guard, who fight day and night for the protection of the country.\u201d",
      "It accused the report of frequently favoring versions of events that called into question the coast guard\u2019s actions \u201cwithout the slightest credible evidence.\u201d",
      "\u201cAt a time when irregular migration is causing global concern, the government remains steadfastly committed to a strict but fair policy of guarding the country\u2019s borders,\u201d the statement said.",
      "Rights groups hailed the ombudsman\u2019s report, and blasted the government\u2019s reaction. The ministry\u2019s statement \u201cis a monument of hypocrisy but also a confession it will continue to cover up the crime,\u201d said the Movement United Against Racism and the Fascist Threat, or KEERFA, which called for a protest rally outside a naval court in the Greece's main port city of Piraeus Thursday evening.",
      "Lawyers representing some of the survivors filed a request with the Piraeus naval court in December seeking criminal charges to be brought against members of the search and rescue operation.",
      "\u201cThe transparency of administrative action and the attribution of responsibilities, where applicable, for the deadly Pylos shipwreck is an elementary legal demand, inextricably linked to the respect of the rule of law,\u201d Ombudsman Andreas Pottakis said in a statement. \u201cAs is the thorough investigation of any other incident connected to the violation of the right to life, health and physical integrity.\u201d",

      "Swedish police say the shooter who killed 10 people in the country\u2019s worst mass shooting was connected to the adult education center where he opened fire with at least one rifle-like weapon",
      "OREBRO, Sweden -- The shooter who earlier this week killed 10 people in Sweden\u2019s worst mass shooting was connected to the adult education center where he opened fire with at least one rifle-like weapon, law enforcement officials said Thursday.",
      "Authorities said the gunman, who has not yet been officially identified, may have attended school there before Tuesday's violence on the school campus west of Stockholm. The shooter was later found dead with three guns, 10 empty magazines and a large amount of unused ammunition next to his body, officials told a news conference.",
      "It was not clear how he died but officials said officers did not return his gunfire.",
      "The school, Campus Risbergska, offers primary and secondary educational classes for adults age 20 and older, Swedish-language classes for immigrants, vocational training, and programs for people with intellectual disabilities. It is on the outskirts of Orebro, about 200 kilometers (125 miles) from Stockholm.",
      "Some 130 officers arrived Tuesday after alarms summoned them to the school to find chaos across the campus. They described the scene as an \u201cinferno\u201d and believe the gunman turned his weapon toward them as they entered the building.",
      "\"Dead people, injured people, screams and smoke,\" local police chief Lars Wir\u00e9n said during the news conference. \u201cMany people running inside and outside the premises.\u201d",
      "Officers found at least five people, all over age 18 with serious gunshot wounds. Two of them remained in intensive care Thursday in serious but stable condition. The other three were in stable condition after surgery.",
      "A sixth person was treated for minor injuries.",
      "Police were forced to search the large school \u2014 17,000 square meters (182,986 square feet) \u2014 to ensure there were no other casualties.",
      "Investigators had not uncovered a definitive motive behind the bloodshed by Thursday. Police said there were no warnings beforehand, and they believe the perpetrator acted alone. Authorities said there were no suspected connections to terrorism at this point.",
      "In Orebro, a town of 160,000 that's considered Sweden's seventh-largest municipality, Thursday brought more sadness but still few answers.",
      "\u201cIt has been two days of shock and grief,\u201d John Johansson, chairman of the town's municipal board, told The Associated Press. \"We are still asking questions of why, still wondering what has happened. The outpouring of grief and togetherness has been enormous.\u201d",
      "King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia, as well as Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson, visited Orebro on Wednesday and attended a memorial service. The Swedish Football Association pledged to begin its future international matches with a moment of silence.",
      "Mourners elsewhere in the the Scandinavian nation, where gun violence at schools is very rare, struggled to process the thought of mass violence in their own country.",
      "\"\u201cThis is not a Swedish problem, it\u2019s a problem that we have seen throughout the world,\u201d Johansson said.",
      "The shooting's online presence has prompted friends of Orebro resident Petter Jorman, a 60-year-old father whose son previously attended the school, to call and text him asking \u201chow are you? Are you OK? I know you live close.\u201d",
      "The shooting started Tuesday afternoon, after many students had gone home following a national exam. Survivors scrambled for cover as shots rang out, sheltering behind or under whatever they could find to escape the gunman and the gore. One woman with children feared she might never see them again, while another used her friend\u2019s shawl to staunch the bleeding of a man who\u2019d been shot in the shoulder.",
      "\u201cThose were the worst hours of my life. I did not know if I would get shot there and then, or in 10 minutes. You simply waited,\u201d Hellen Werme, 35, told the Expressen newspaper.",
      "While gun violence at schools is very rare in Sweden, people were wounded or killed with other weapons such as knives or axes in several incidents in recent years.",
      "Authorities said the shooter had licenses for four weapons, three of which were found next to his body. Police have seized the fourth.",
      "In order to possess a firearm legally, applicants must obtain a weapon license and demonstrate that it will be used for an acceptable purpose, such as hunting or target shooting, and not be misused. Applicants must also submit previously obtained hunting or target shooting certificates. Hunting certificates require people to pass a training course, while target shooters must be certified as active and experienced members of clubs.",
      "In Sweden, a country of roughly 10.5 million people, there were just over 660,000 registered gun owners at the beginning of 2024, according to the Swedish news agency TT. Those registered owners had some 2 million guns, objects that are considered firearms and weapon parts that require a permit.",
      "TT reported that 1.6 million of those guns are registered for hunting, and another 176,000 for target-shooting.",
      "All weapons must be stored in secure cabinets approved by the police. Applications for fully automatic weapons or one-handed weapons are only granted for exceptional reasons, and such permits are generally time-limited.",
      "Permits are revoked if the weapon is modified to be substantially different from its original function.",

      "Snake catcher Dylan Cooper arrived that afternoon. Stein helped rake away mulch as Cooper bagged 102 pregnant and newborn snakes.",
      "\u201cJust seeing that amount in one group, it gives you a bit of the shudders,\u201d Stein said Friday.",

      "Kerewaro said the largest haul he\u2019d heard of in a similar snake removal job was 30 non-venomous carpet pythons. Pythons hatch from eggs while red-belly blacks give birth.",
      "\u201cYou can get a decent number like that when the babies are hatching,\u201d Kerewaro said. \u201cBut to have this many venomous snakes, no one\u2019s come across it.\"",

      "A week later, Kerewaro still has the snakes, which are a protected species. Government authorities gave him permission on Thursday to release them into a national park.",

      "\u201cWe are witnessing the rise of nationalism and protectionism, the pursuit of narrow interests and the decline of common cause,\u201d Ramaphosa said at Parliament in Cape Town. \"This is the world that we, as a developing economy, must now navigate.",

      "That part of the speech was met with applause and cheers by members of Parliament and others attending South Africa's version of the State of the Union.",
      "Ramaphosa and his government have spent much of the week defending their country's reputation and its legal processes after Trump posted on Sunday on his Truth Social platform that he would stop all U.S. funding to South Africa because it was \u201cconfiscating land, and treating certain classes of people VERY BADLY,\u201d without saying who. Trump wrote that the country's leadership was engaged in a \u201cmassive Human Rights VIOLATION\u201d that was being ignored by the media.",
      "He said the South African government was \"doing some terrible things, horrible things,\u201d again without providing specifics.",
      "Trump's comments seemed to be in reference to a law South Africa passed last month that allows the government to expropriate land from private parties. Ramaphosa and his government have defended it as being aimed at unused land or land that can be redistributed for the public good and said there are legal protections to stop any land being taken arbitrarily. They said no land has been confiscated.",
      "Ramaphosa's spokesperson said the claims by Trump, and related criticism of South Africa by his billionaire advisor Elon Musk \u2014 who was born in the country \u2014 were \u201cmisinformation.\u201d Musk, who left South Africa in the late 1980s, has long criticized its current government as being anti-white and has claimed that the law is designed to take land away from the white minority.",
      "Trump's claims about South Africa \u2014 some of them inaccurate \u2014 came soon after he ordered a 90-day freeze on most global aid, threatening hundreds of millions of dollars the U.S. gives South Africa for its HIV/AIDS program, the largest in the world.",
      "Ramaphosa said in his speech that the freeze on aid was concerning, and South Africa was looking at ways to keep its essential HIV/AIDS services running.",
      "His 90-minute speech was largely about domestic issues, though, and he announced his government would spend $50 billion over the next three years to improve South Africa's infrastructure, building roads, bridges and dams, and modernizing seaports and airports. The new infrastructure will \u201cpower our economy,\u201d Ramaphosa said."

It stunned American allies and other global powers and even flummoxed members of Trump\u2019s own party. The reaction in Israel was starkly different.",
      "The idea of removing hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from Gaza \u2014 once relegated to the fringes of political discourse in the country \u2014 has found fertile ground in an Israeli public traumatized by Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023, attacks and grasping for ways to feel secure again after the deadliest assault in their country\u2019s history.",
      "Jewish Israeli politicians across the spectrum either embraced the idea wholeheartedly or expressed openness to it.

And they say the departures should be voluntary, perhaps an acknowledgment of claims by critics, among them the U.N. secretary-general, that forced expulsions could amount to \u201cethnic cleansing.\u201d",
      "And many others, including liberal Israelis and Palestinian citizens of Israel, voiced opposition to it. The liberal daily Haaretz, in an editorial Thursday, urged Israelis to \u201coppose transfer.\"",
      "\u201cEven if Trump disregards international law, it\u2019s crucial to remind Israelis that the forced expulsion or transfer of civilians violates international humanitarian law, constitutes a war crime and amounts to a crime against humanity,\u201d the editorial said.",
      "In a joint Washington news conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday, Trump said he envisioned the U.S. taking control of the Gaza Strip, having its people relocate to other places and rebuilding the war-battered coastal enclave into the \u201cRiviera of the Middle East.\u201d",
      "The proposal sparked outrage in the Middle East, including in Egypt and Jordan, two close U.S. allies at peace with Israel that Trump has suggested take in the Palestinians.",
      "Netanyahu, meanwhile, called Trump\u2019s plan \u201cremarkable\u201d and the \u201cfirst good idea\u201d that he had heard.",
      "\u201cThe actual idea of allowing first Gazans who want to leave, to leave. I mean, what\u2019s wrong with that?\u201d Netanyahu told Fox News. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz took it a step further, asking the military to craft a plan for a potential exodus. Katz has given few details on how such a plan would work.",
      "Even Netanyahu's rivals indicated openness.",
      "Benny Gantz, a former defense minister and centrist opposition figure, said Trump\u2019s proposal showed \u201ccreative, original and intriguing thinking.\u201d Opposition leader Yair Lapid, also a centrist, told Israeli Army Radio \u201cin general, it\u2019s good.\u201d Both said the details and practicability of the plan were complicated and needed to be studied, and they urged Trump and Netanyahu to focus on freeing the hostages who remain in Gaza.",
      "For Palestinians, Trump's proclamation triggered painful memories of the expulsion or flight from their homes in what is now Israel in the 1948 war that led to its creation. It also resurfaced the trauma of further displacement wrought by the 1967 Mideast war, when Israel occupied the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.",
      "Staying steadfast on their land is a key component of the Palestinian identity. In fact, many Palestinian refugees dream of returning to the lands in Israel from which they were originally displaced \u2014 something Israel says would threaten its existence as a Jewish majority state.",
      "Segev says the concept of driving people off their land is not foreign to the Israeli consciousness. He says Israel's founding leaders felt they needed to clear Palestinians off the land to ensure the security and stability of the state.",
      "But in modern Israel, the idea has been promoted only by fringe elements, most prominently the slain radical Rabbi Meir Kahane. The American-born Kahane's views got him banished from the Israeli parliament and led the U.S. to outlaw his group, the Jewish Defense League.",
      "Now, however, Kahane's once radical positions are the mainstay of far-right political parties, including one led by a disciple of his, that have been key to Netanyahu\u2019s rule. They were thrilled to have someone as powerful as Trump adopt their idea, which they have billed as \u201cvoluntary emigration,\u201d a term the Palestinians say is a euphemism for forced transfer. Trump\u2019s backing will likely embolden these hard-liners.",
      "When Hamas attacked on Oct. 7, Israelis were already in a yearslong shift away from support for Palestinian statehood and many had adopted an approach, promoted by Netanyahu, that the conflict was unsolvable and could only be managed through sporadic wars and military operations.",
      "The shock of Hamas\u2019 attack \u2014 militants killed 1,200 and took about 250 hostages, parading some through Gaza to cheering crowds \u2014 brought the Palestinian issue back to the fore and prompted in Israelis an openness to more radical ideas as long as they help restore a sense of security.",
      "Sefi Ovadia, a broadcaster on a popular Israeli talk radio morning show, told his audience Thursday that he had \u201cmoral reservations\u201d to the idea before Oct. 7, but that since the attack, he no longer does. Ben Caspit, a widely read columnist, wrote in the Maariv daily that \u201cevery Israeli, barring the most delusional ones on the outer reaches of the left, ought to welcome this initiative.\u201d",
      "Trauma from Hamas' attack has prompted many Israelis to believe that a way to end the Palestinian-Israeli conflict is to \u201cremove Gaza from the equation,\" said Shmuel Rosner, a senior fellow at the Jewish People Policy Institute, a Jerusalem think tank.",
      "\u201cIt was a fringe idea in Israel before Oct. 7 and in some cases it was an illegitimate idea,\u201d Rosner said of Trump's plan. \u201cOct. 7 changed everything.\"",

      "Now some face a new challenge: the decision by U.S. President Donald Trump to freeze for 90 days the aid provided by Washington.",
      "The aid, which came directly from or via the partners of the U.S. Agency for International Development, as well as from other entities funded by the U.S. government, was a source for some of their grant money.",
      "\u201cObjectively, it\u2019s a very bad thing,\u201d an activist with Center-T, a prominent Russian trans group, told The Associated Press, speaking on condition of anonymity for safety reasons. \u201cOrganizations could have done much more significant things if it weren\u2019t for this situation.\u201d",
      "Members of Russian and Belarusian rights groups and independent media organizations described varying effects of the action, from \u201cbad\u201d to \u201cunpleasant.\u201d Many get funding elsewhere, like private donations or other grants, but some said they don't know which of their partners are linked to U.S. aid and whether more will withdraw support.",
      "Some Russian organizations said they'll still operate but will cut expenses and possibly plans, adding they knew of others in bigger jeopardy.",
      "OVD-Info, a Russian rights group that tracks political arrests and offers legal aid, is largely funded by \u201cprivate donations from a large number of people,\u201d so the freeze \u201chas little direct and immediate impact,\u201d said OVD-Info spokesman Dmitry Anisimov, but other groups that help it with certain activities are affected.",
      "\u201cWithout their existence, our work will become significantly more difficult,\u201d he said, and those in need of assistance will be affected, too.",
      "An editor of an independent Russian news outlet operating in exile echoed Anisimov and also cited crowdfunding as one reliable revenue sources. The editor spoke on condition of anonymity for security reasons.",
      "The outlet lost less than 10% of the budget in frozen grants, the editor said, adding: \u201cYes, it\u2019s hard, unpleasant, difficult, but we\u2019re not on the brink of imminently shutting down. We\u2019re not even on the brink of laying people off\u201d.",
      "Center-T, whose core staff moved abroad after the Russian Supreme Court designated what it called the LGBTQ+ \u201cmovement\u201d as extremist, effectively outlawing all LGBTQ+ activism, also lost only a fraction of funding, its staffer said.",
      "\u201cWe are, possibly, in one of the luckiest positions, because we almost didn\u2019t have U.S. funding,\u201d they said.",
      "Kovcheg \u2014 Russian for \u201carc\u201d \u2014 a group helping Russians fleeing abroad with shelter, legal and psychological support, training and other support, lost 30% of its budget after Trump\u2019s action, said its founder, Anastasia Burakova.",
      "The funds were allocated for future projects, as well as various improvements, she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame\u201d they won\u2019t happen, but otherwise, Kovcheg is \u201cmore or less stable\u201d, thanks to crowdfunding and advertising, Burakova added.",
      "Burakova, who formerly headed a legal aid group in St. Petersburg backed by exiled tycoon-turned-opposition-figure Mikhail Khodorkovsky, cited repressive laws and regulations that make it harder for critical and independent groups to get funding from Russians.",
      "Most Russian rights groups and independent news outlets have been designated as \u201cforeign agents\u201d by the Russian authorities -- a label that turns potential donors away with its negative connotation. Russia has banned advertising with them.",
      "Others have also been labeled \u201cundesirable,\u201d a category that outlaws any dealings with groups so designated, exposing donors to prosecution.",
      "Many had to move their teams abroad after Russia invaded Ukraine to avoid the ever-widening crackdown.",
      "But, \u201cthe more you\u2019re being beaten and banned, the more you adapt and stop counting on just one thing\" for your funding, Burakova said.",
      "In light of the aid freeze, Khodorkovsky and Russian philanthropist Boris Zimin this week offered $600,000 to affected Russian and Ukrainian projects.",
      "It's not clear how much U.S. aid Russian organizations were receiving and how much of that could be offset by Khodorkovsky's and Zimin's funding.",
      "\u201cOf course, it wouldn\u2019t be enough,\u201d Zimin said, but \u201cmany of these projects are very important, especially, I think, media (projects). I consider it my duty to support them at least for some time.\u201d",

      "Pro-democracy forces from Belarus told AP the frozen U.S. aid they were receiving -\u2013 about $30 million -\u2013 accounts for over half of all of their Western funding. It comes from both USAID, either directly or through partners, and entities like the U.S.-government funded National Endowment for Democracy. Dozens of nongovernmental organizations and several independent media groups are on the brink of closure, they said.",
      "Opposition leaders recently prepared a report for Western governments, outlining the effects of the freeze, according to a person close to Belarusian opposition leaders. The person spoke on condition of anonymity for security reasons.",
      "Without Western-supported independent media and pro-democracy forces, Belarus and Russia \u201cwill likely fill the void by strengthening state propaganda and authoritarian control in Belarus, allowing pro-Kremlin narratives to dominate the minds of Belarusians,\u201d the person said.",
      "An activist from the Belarusian Association of Journalists said that out of 30 large Belarusian media groups working abroad, six said they lost funding completely and are on the brink of closing. The activist spoke on condition of anonymity because of security concerns.",
      "According to the opposition's report, $1.7 million in U.S. aid is frozen -\u2013 more than half of all foreign aid to independent media forced to flee Belarus after authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko unleashed a widespread crackdown on dissent in 2020.",
      "Now, small independent newsrooms are laying off employees to avoid closing, the activist said: \u201cIf a newsroom stops operating, resuming later is almost impossible, which sets the media apart from other beneficiaries of U.S. aid,\u201d the activist said.",
      "A YouTube show, \u201cA Regular Morning,\u201d with videos regularly drawing over 100,000 views, said it was shutting down but asked for donations and said it would keep going through March.",
      "\u201cWe have already found ourselves in situations where the continuation of the project was not obvious, but each time we found a way to continue the work, because we understood that Belarusians need to hear reasonable voices,\u201d its journalists said.",
      "The activist believes dozens of media projects will inevitably cease.",
      "Rights groups also are affected. According to the person close to opposition leaders, 60-80 groups face possible mass layoffs, ending programs or closing for good.",
      "The person expects that \u201cprograms to support political prisoners will be drastically cut, Belarusian youth will lose access to alternative educational programs, and activists will lose their platforms.\u201d",
      "There are over 1,200 political prisoners in Belarus, according to Viasna, the country\u2019s leading human rights group, whose imprisoned founder Ales Bialiatski won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2022.",
      "Thousands of activists, including some freed from prison, have moved abroad, and groups that received U.S. funding were helping them and their families.",

      "DHAKA, Bangladesh -- Bangladesh's new government is struggling to deal with a host of issues, including a stumbling economy and human rights violations, left behind by the ouster of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina six months ago. Hasina fled to India in August after a student-led uprising ended her 15-year rule, and an interim government led by Nobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus took the helm, backed by the influential military.",
      "Hasina's Awami League recently announced plans for protests in February, including a general strike. This infuriated student activists and anti-Hasina groups, who on Wednesday stormed and demolished the historic home of her father, Bangladesh's independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.",

      "Her family members are staying out of Bangladesh, along with many party leaders and former ministers. Others are either in prison or hiding.",
      "The interim government has arrested thousands of Hasina\u2019s supporters and has banned the student wing of her party, the Bangladesh Chhatra League. In late January, New York-based Human Rights Watch cited \u201ca disturbing pattern of security force abuses\u201d that reemerged after Hasina\u2019s ouster, this time targeting supporters of her party, including journalists.",
      "The interim government established six commissions to reform sectors including the electoral system, the rule of law and public administration. The government is now scrutinizing their reports submitted recently to share with public in coming weeks.",
      "But major political players like the Bangladesh Nationalist Party led by former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia have called for an initial set of reforms, followed by an urgent election. The BNP says long-term reforms should be carried out under an elected government.",
      "Human Rights Watch urged the interim government to establish legal detention practices and repeal laws used to target critics. The Yunus-led government scrapped the abusive Cyber Security Act, used to crush freedom of speech, but replaced it with an ordinance that contains many of the same harmful provisions, HRW said.",
      "An association of editors and rights groups has accused the new government of systematically suppressing independent media, but the authorities say there has been no intimidation. Two media freedom groups, the Committee to Protect Journalists and Reporters Without Borders, have urged the government to ensure fair trials and uphold procedural rights for journalists.",
      "The Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council has accused the interim government of failing to protect religious and ethnic minorities from attacks and harassment. The government denies the allegation, saying most of the killings and other attacks were for \u201cpolitical reasons\u201d and not related to any communal violence.",

      "BEIRUT -- The head of the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees said Thursday that while an Israeli ban has not yet forced the agency to cease operations, it faces an \u201cexistential threat\u201d in the long run.",
      "\u201cI have been very clear that despite all the obstacles and the pressure the agency is under, our objective is to stay and deliver until we are prevented to do so,\u201d Philippe Lazzarini, commissioner general of the U.N. Relief and Works Agency, also known as UNRWA, said in an interview with The Associated Press during a visit to Beirut.",
      "Israel last week formally banned UNRWA from operating on its territory. As a result, Lazzarini said, international staff have had to leave East Jerusalem because their visas expired, but in Gaza and the West Bank there has been no immediate impact on operations.",
      "Even in East Jerusalem, he said, health care and other services provided by UNRWA \"are continuing, though not necessarily at the same scope it used to be.\u201d",
      "UNRWA is also likely to face increased pressure from the United States under the new Trump administration.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump in recent days proposed permanently resettling the approximately 2 million Palestinians in Gaza in neighboring Arab countries and suggested the United States taking long-term control of Gaza.",
      "Lazzarini called the proposal \u201ctotally unrealistic,\u201d adding, \u201cWe are talking about forced displacement. Forced displacement is a crime, an international crime. It\u2019s ethnic cleansing.\u201d",
      "Trump announced Tuesday that Washington will not resume funding for UNRWA \u2014 which had already been halted since January 2024 when the Biden administration stopped it following accusations by Israel that UNRWA staffers in Gaza took part in the Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas-led attack on southern Israel that sparked the war in Gaza.",
      "Israel had alleged that 19 out of UNRWA\u2019s approximately 13,000 staff in Gaza took part in the attack. UNRWA said it fired nine staffers after an internal U.N. investigation found evidence that they could have been involved.",
      "While several other donor countries also suspended funding at the time, all but the U.S. decided to resume funding.",
      "Lazzarini called the loss of U.S. support \u201ca challenge,\u201d but said the agency is appealing to Gulf Arab countries and other donors to increase their contributions. He described his agency as the target of a \u201cmassive disinformation campaign\u201d with a politically motivated objective of dismantling it.",
      "UNRWA's opponents believe the agency has prolonged the Israeli-Palestinian conflict by giving refugee status to the descendants of Palestinian refugees who fled or were forced from their homes in what is now Israel in 1948, thus maintaining for them, in theory, the right of return.",
      "Lazzarini said those who think that UNRWA can simply be dissolved and its responsibilities handed over to other institutions are mistaken.",
      "UNRWA provides aid and services \u2014 including health and education \u2014 to some 2.5 million Palestinian refugees in Gaza and the occupied West Bank and east Jerusalem, as well as 3 million more in Syria, Jordan and Lebanon. Since the Israel-Hamas war began in October 2023, it has been the main lifeline for a population reliant on humanitarian aid in Gaza.",
      "Lazzarini said that while replaceable by a functioning public institution, UNRWA provides essential public services that no other U.N. agency offers on such a scale. It has served as a \u201csubstitute in the absence of the state for the Palestinian refugees,\u201d he said. He argued that the only way to end the agency's mandate is as part of a political process resulting in a Palestinian state alongside Israel, so that \u201cat the end of this process, the agency can hand over its services to an empowered Palestinian institution.\u201d",
      "The alternative, he said, is to \u201clet the agency implode and abruptly end its activities, which would mean additional suffering for one of the most destitute populations in the region.\u201d"

      "WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration's Justice Department has disbanded a Biden-era program aimed at seizing the assets of Russian oligarchs as a means to punish Russia for its invasion of Ukraine.",
      "The move to disband Task Force KleptoCapture is one of several moves undertaken by the Justice Department under the new leadership of Attorney General Pam Bondi that presage a different approach toward Russia and national security issues.",
      "The department also ended the Foreign Influence Task Force, which was established in the first Trump administration to police influence campaigns staged by Russia and other nations aimed at sowing discord, undermining democracy and spreading disinformation. The U.S. government in the run-up to the 2024 presidential election aggressively moved to disrupt propaganda campaigns by Russia, which officials have assessed had a preference for Trump.",
      "In a memo addressed to all employees Wednesday \u2014 the first day of Bondi's tenure \u2014 the attorney general's office stated that \u201cattorneys assigned to those initiatives shall return to their prior posts, and resources currently devoted to those efforts shall be committed to the total elimination of Cartels and TCOs\u201d \u2014 an acronym for Transnational Criminal Organizations.",

Under the policy change, prosecutors were directed to focus criminal enforcement on acts of more traditional espionage rather than registration violations.",
      "Despite the disbanding of the task force, Trump administration officials, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have called for a more aggressive stance on Russia.

      "The lawsuit, filed in Albany, New York, lists Attorney General Letitia James and other state officials as defendants. Messages seeking comment were sent to the defendants.",
      "According to a release, West Virginia Attorney General JB McCuskey led the coalition of states against the New York state Climate Change Superfund Act, which requires payments for damage allegedly done from 2000 to 2018.",
      "The law requires major fossil fuel companies to pay into the fund over the next quarter-century based on their past gas emissions.",
      "\"This lawsuit is to ensure that these misguided policies, being forced from one state onto the entire nation, will not lead America into the doldrums of an energy crisis, allowing China, India and Russia to overtake our energy independence,\u201d McCuskey said in a release.",

      "All the big swings on Wall Street show again how little investors control",
      "NEW YORK -- All of Wall Street's big recent swings show again how little investors control. When it comes to tariffs, inflation or how much profit Big Tech companies make, investors have very little sway.",
      "That's why it pays to exert control where possible, and for investors, that means keeping expenses in check. When the S&P 500 loses 2% anyway, why lose more by owning a mutual fund or exchange-traded fund that tries to mimic it and then tacks on higher fees to do so?",
      "Fortunately for investors, finding lower-fee funds has become easier every year as the industry feels pressure to compete for investors. Across all U.S. stock mutual funds, investors are paying about 42 cents in fees for every $100 invested, according to the latest 2023 data from Investment Company Institute. That's down by more than half from 99 cents in 2000.",
      "And the momentum is continuing. Earlier this week, fund giant Vanguard said it was reducing expenses across 168 classes of mutual funds and ETFs, calling it the largest fee cut in the company's nearly 50-year history. The investment firm said the reductions will save its fund investors more than $350 million this year alone.",
      "\"Lower costs enable investors to keep more of their returns, and those savings compound over time,\u201d said Salim Ramji, Vanguard\u2019s chief executive officer.",
      "Most funds advertise their fees as something called an expense ratio. It shows what percentage of a fund's total dollars go toward covering its annual expenses. A lower number is generally better. Most expense ratios will be below 1%, and some funds even boast of zero expense ratios.",
      "Vanguard's cuts from earlier this week took the expense ratio of its Total International Stock fund ETF down to 0.05% from 0.08%, for example."

    "story": [
      "The Hawaii Supreme Court is scheduled to hear about insurance issues tying up a potential $4 billion Maui wild fire settlement",
      "HONOLULU -- Hawaii's Supreme Court is set to hear arguments Thursday over insurance issues that are tying up a potential $4 billion settlement over Maui's catastrophic 2023 wildfire, the deadliest in the U.S. in more than a century.",
      "The massive inferno decimated the historic town of Lahaina, killing more than 100 people, destroying thousands of properties and causing an estimated $5.5 billion in damage. Soon afterward, attorneys began lodging hundreds of lawsuits.",
      "A settlement was announced last summer, but insurance companies held out, insisting that they should have the right to go after the defendants separately to recoup money paid out to policyholders.",
      "Here are things to know about the settlement and the issues that could thwart the deal:",
      "A few days before the one-year anniversary of the Aug. 8, 2023, fire, Gov. Josh Green announced that seven defendants accused of causing the tragedy had agreed to pay $4 billion to resolve claims by thousands of people.",
      "Attorneys representing the individual plaintiffs agreed to the deal amid fears that main defendant Hawaiian Electric, the power company blamed for sparking the blaze, could be on the brink of bankruptcy. Other defendants include the state, Maui County and Kamehameha Schools, the largest private landowner in Hawaii.",
      "Victims' attorneys acknowledged that $4 billion wasn't enough to make up for what was lost but said the deal was worth accepting, given Hawaiian Electric's limited assets.",
      "Attorneys for the victims asked Judge Peter Cahill to bar insurance companies from going after the defendants separately to recoup money \u2014 a requirement that was key to the settlement. Cahill agreed, saying insurers could seek reimbursement only from the $4 billion pool the defendants have already agreed to pay.",
      "That didn't sit well with a group of about 200 property and casualty insurers that remain holdouts to the settlement. So far they have paid more than $2.3 billion to people and businesses and expect to pay $1 billion more. They want to be able to pursue their own claims against the defendants.",
      "Cahill has asked the state high court questions about subrogation, or how insurance companies can go about recouping money.",
      "Among the issues before the court is whether state laws controlling health care insurance reimbursement also apply to casualty and property insurance in limiting companies' ability to pursue independent legal action against those held liable.",
      "It's not clear when the justices will issue a ruling.",
      "A last-minute deal between victims' lawyers last week averted a separate trial over how to split the $4 billion between individual plaintiffs and others covered by a class-action lawsuit. Some victims had been ready to take the witness stand, while others submitted pre-recorded testimony describing pain made all the more fresh by the recent destruction in Los Angeles.",
      "Common in the insurance industry, subrogation is a legal process that allows an insurance company to pursue a party that caused a covered loss. It's one way companies recover the amount of claims paid to policyholders.",
      "Insurance companies say subrogation is a way to offset costs associated with a catastrophic event so premiums won\u2019t have to go up. The process isn't for natural disasters such as hurricanes, but for when there is someone at fault.",
      "Hawaii's governor has previously denounced subrogation.",
      "When insurance companies collect huge profits and no disasters occur, they don't send refunds back to policyholders, Green noted in comments quoted in court filings. But when a tragedy does happen, they look to recoup their payments to the victims.",
      "\"It\u2019s fundamentally unfair, and they call it subrogation,\u201d he said.",
      "The insurance industry has been unfairly villainized as outsiders taking resources from the community while those responsible for the fires won\u2019t be held accountable, Vincent Raboteau, an attorney representing the insurers, told Cahill during a hearing last year.",
      "Insurance lawyers have said they want to hold the defendants accountable and aren\u2019t trying to get in the way of fire victims getting settlement money.",
      "Origin and cause investigations are \u201ctime-intensive and costly,\" lawyers said in a court brief of insurers who \u201cassume the burden of these investigations,\u201d and take on the risk of those costs.",
      "Insurers promptly paid claims, which are helping victims rebuild, the brief said: \u201cFor many wildfire victims, payment of claims by their insurer provided quick access to desperately needed funds.\u201d",
      "Not for a while.",
      "If the state Supreme Court agrees that an insurance company can sue defendants directly, \u201cthat would likely destroy the global settlement agreement,\u201d said Jacob Lowenthal, an attorney representing individual plaintiffs. The plaintiffs would go back to Cahill's courtroom to figure out trial dates for their lawsuits.",
      "If the justices rule the other way, the settlement could head toward finalization, putting in motion an administrative process for doling out money.",
      "It's possible that whichever side loses will seek review at the U.S. Supreme Court.",

The average rate on a 30-year mortgage briefly fell to a 2-year low just above 6% last September, but has been mostly rising since then, echoing a sharp rise in the 10-year Treasury yield, which lenders use as a guide for pricing home loans.",
      "The yield, which was at 3.62% in mid-September, reached 4.79% three weeks ago amid fears inflation may remain stubbornly higher than the Fed\u2019s 2% target.

      "A lag of a month or two usually exists between when a contract is signed and when the home sale is finalized, which makes pending home sales a bellwether for future completed home sales.",
      "For those hoping that mortgage rates will retreat significantly, economists say that\u2019s unlikely.",
      "Forecasts mostly call for the average rate on a 30-year mortgage to remain above 6% this year, with some economists including an upper range as high as 6.8%.",
      "The Federal Reserve left its benchmark interest rate unchanged last week after cutting it three times in a row to close 2024, a sign of a more cautious approach as the Fed seeks to gauge where inflation is headed and what policies the Trump administration will pursue."

      "Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos, which are south of China and share borders with Thailand, have became major centers of online scam operations where people lured by false advertising of well-paid jobs are trafficked to secretive compounds where they are forced to work by criminal groups that run online scams targeting people all over the world.",

      "Panama President Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino has rejected the U.S. State Department\u2019s claim that his country had reached a deal allowing U.S. warships to transit the Panama Canal for free",
      "PANAMA CITY -- Panamanian President Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino on Thursday denied the U.S. State Department\u2019s claim that his country had reached a deal allowing U.S. warships to transit the Panama Canal for free.",
      "Mulino said he had told U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth on Wednesday that he could neither set the fees to transit the canal nor exempt anyone from them and that he was surprised by the U.S. State Department\u2019s statement suggesting otherwise late Wednesday.",
      "\u201cI completely reject that statement yesterday,\u201d Mulino said during his weekly press conference, adding that he had asked Panama\u2019s ambassador in Washington to dispute the State Department\u2019s statement. He was scheduled to speak with U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday.",
      "On Wednesday evening, the U.S. State Department said via X that \u201cU.S. government vessels can now transit the Panama Canal without charge fees, saving the U.S. government millions of dollars a year.\u201d",
      "The Panama Canal Authority put out its own terse statement later Wednesday night saying it had \"not made any adjustments\u201d to the fees.",
      "Mulino said the U.S. statement \u201creally surprises me because they\u2019re making an important, institutional statement from the entity that governs United States foreign policy under the president of the United States based on a falsity. And that\u2019s intolerable.\u201d",
      "U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who met with Mulino and canal administrators and visited the critical trade route earlier this week, said on Thursday from the Dominican Republic that he had no confusion about his discussions with Panama, but \u201cI respect very much the fact that Panama has a process of laws and procedures that they need to follow.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe United States has a treaty obligation to protect the Panama Canal if it comes under attack,\" Rubio said. \"That treaty obligation would have to be enforced by the armed forces of the United States, particularly the U.S. Navy. I find it absurd that we would have to pay fees to transit a zone that we are obligated to protect in a time of conflict.\u201d",
      "Rubio had carried a message from Trump that China\u2019s influence at the canal was unacceptable.",
      "Rubio had told Mulino that Trump believed that China\u2019s presence in the canal area may violate a treaty that led the United States to turn the waterway over to Panama in 1999. That treaty calls for the permanent neutrality of the American-built canal.",
      "Canal administrators said they were open to discussing giving U.S. warships priority in crossing the canal, but did not say they had considered waiving fees.",
      "Mulino said via X that he was scheduled to speak to Trump on Friday.",
      "Since 1998, U.S. warships, including submarines, have transited the Panama Canal 994 times. They accounted for just 0.3% of the canal\u2019s traffic during that period. The canal received $25.4 million in total fees for those crossings, according to data from the canal authority.",
      "The fees charged to U.S. warships and those from other nations are based on the ship\u2019s displacement tonnage, or the weight of the water displaced by the vessel. The measure is different than that used to charge commercial vessels.",
      "Mulino said Thursday that both Panama\u2019s constitution and laws regulating the Canal Authority make clear that neither the government nor the authority can waive fees. \u201cIt\u2019s a constitutional limitation,\u201d he said.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s threats to impose 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada have left many cities along Mexico's northern border in limbo",
      "CIUDAD JU\u00c1REZ, Mexico -- As soon as the sun glints over miles of border fence dividing the United States and Mexico, the engines of cargo trucks packed with auto and computer parts roar to life along border bridges and bleary-eyed workers file into factories to assemble a multitude of products geared toward the U.S. market.",
      "For more than half a century, this daily rhythm has helped fuel the heartbeat of a transnational machine that generated more than $800 billion in trade between the U.S. and Mexico in 2024 alone.",
      "Over the past year, however, President Donald Trump's threatened 25% tariffs against Mexico and Canada have plunged manufacturing hubs all along the northern Mexican border into limbo, a state that persists despite a one-month reprieve to which Trump agreed on Monday.",
      "Tariffs would cripple Mexican border economies that are reliant on factories churning out products for the U.S. \u2014 auto parts, medical supplies, computer components, myriad electronics \u2014  and likely thrust the country into a recession, economic forecasters have warned. Some workers wonder how much longer they'll have jobs, while business leaders say the uncertainty has already led many investors to start tightening their purse strings.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a conflict between governments and we\u2019re the ones most affected,\u201d said 58-year-old truck driver Carlos Ponce, leaning against his rig at the customs border crossing between Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez and El Paso, Texas. \u201cTomorrow, who knows what will happen?\u201d",
      "Ponce, who was driving a truck full of car shock absorbers, said he's spent the past 35 years moving goods across the border, just as his father did before him. Now, he's unsure how much longer that will last.",
      "Manufacturing in export-oriented assembly plants known as maquiladoras are the heart of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez's economy, with 97% of its goods going to the U.S., according to figures from Mexico's Economic Ministry.",
      "The factories were born in the 1960s in an attempt to boost economic development in northern Mexico and lower prices for U.S. consumers. The maquiladora program later took off after the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, was signed in 1994. The agreement was supplanted by a similar pact, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, negotiated between the three countries during Trump's first term.",
      "Today, neon signs with the dollar-to-peso exchange rate flash across the city, a reminder of the close ties binding both sides of the border.",
      "\u201cEverything that happens in the United States: its economic, social policy \u2026 directly affects us because companies here in Mexico depend on what they sell in the United States,\u201d said Thor Salayandia, head of his family's auto-parts manufacturing facility in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez. \"The United States also needs Mexico to keep manufacturing, but they\u2019re not seeing things like that.\u201d",
      "This week, workers and business leaders alike breathed a sigh of relief when Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum announced she had negotiated with Trump to delay tariffs one month.",
      "\u201cNow, we're buying time,\u201d Salayandia said.",
      "Workers here assemble everything from auto parts to computer panels to T-shirts emblazoned with the American flag, logos of popular U.S. football teams and slogans such as \u201cProud to be a federal employee.\u201d",
      "Parts can cross the border multiple times before the final product is sold to U.S. consumers. That economic interdependence has left many in the city struggling to imagine a future without it. One U.S. company said it would likely have to move part of its manufacturing in the city to the U.S., but at a sharp cost.",
      "Antonio Ruiz, a compliance officer at Tecma, a U.S. firm that helps foreign companies set up shop along the border, said his was among a number of businesses to call emergency meetings over the weekend as economic forecasters warned that the tariffs could drive Mexico into a recession.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to be prepared for something that has never happened before,\u201d Ruiz said. \u201cAs much as you want to prepare for it, the best you can do is prepare to brace yourself in the short term.\u201d",
      "Salayandia and economists warn that any sort of tax could lead to cascading unemployment and rising prices on both sides of the border. In Mexico, they say, it could also spur a rise in violence in border areas by pushing the unemployed into the hands of drug cartels, as well as an increase in Mexican migration to the U.S.",
      "Manuel Sotelo, a leader of Mexico\u2019s National Chamber of Freight Transportation who owns a fleet of trucks that cross the border every day, sees the tariff threats as more of a political power move than a future economic reality.",
      "\"Both countries would be paralyzed,\" said Sotelo, who sat at a desk covered with local newspapers carrying bold headlines on the tariffs, a Trump bobblehead positioned behind him. \u201cLet's say he did slap a 25% tariff (on Mexico), what would they do during the Super Bowl without avocados?\u201d",
      "On the other hand, Sotelo acknowledges that the tariff talk has already inflicted some damage. He and other business leaders say that over the past year they've watched investment dip in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez because of political uncertainty, as investors hesitate to funnel their money into businesses that could collapse with the stroke of a pen in Washington.",
      "While Trump's election has been the primary driver of that uncertainty, June elections in Mexico and a controversial judicial reform carried out by Mexico's governing party have added to it. Sotelo said he saw a 7% drop in business last year, and only expects that to continue until lingering tariff threats are resolved.",
      "One collective of maquiladoras in the city says it has seen at least three factories halt production.",
      "\u201cEvery time we hear this discourse from political leaders, the people running our governments, it sends shock waves through the border,\u201d Salayandia said. \"Because the border is a global thermometer. Our products go all over the world. Those companies will go look in other parts of the world where they offer conditions to keep competing.\u201d",

      "Federal government payments for subscriptions to media outlets have become the latest target of President Donald Trump's spending hawks",
      "NEW YORK -- Federal government payments to news outlets like Politico, The New York Times and The Associated Press for subscriptions or to license content are in the crosshairs of Trump administration spending hawks, with the president on Thursday calling it potentially \u201cTHE BIGGEST SCANDAL OF THEM ALL.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s the latest in a series of skirmishes with the media, long a target of Donald Trump and his supporters. The Defense Department last week evicted NPR, NBC, the Times and Politico from their Pentagon workspaces, and Trump has continued to criticize CBS\u2019 \u201c60 Minutes\u201d for its handling of an interview with former opponent Kamala Harris last fall. Free press advocates are also concerned about Trump\u2019s plans for the media outlet Voice of America, whose charter guarantees its editorial freedom.",
      "This time, though, is a bit different. By linking federal government spending to the media, Trump has bundled two of his long-favored political targets into one rhetorical package \u2014 denouncing a common practice as untoward while offering no supporting evidence for his assertions.",
      "On Wednesday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the government had paid more than $8 million for Politico subscriptions and that Elon Musk's government efficiency team \u201cis working on canceling those payments.\u201d That quickly set off a social-media maelstrom and a hunt by online sleuths for other evidence of taxpayer spending on the news.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. government must stop paying for media subscriptions. Now,\u201d Richard Grenell, Trump's special mission envoy, posted on X.",
      "Trump, on his Truth Social platform, complained about payments to the \u201cFAKE NEWS MEDIA\u201d for creating good stories about Democrats. \u201cDid the New York Times receive money??? Who else did??? THIS COULD BE THE BIGGEST SCANDAL OF THEM ALL,\u201d he wrote.",
      "And at a national prayer breakfast at the Capitol on Thursday morning, Trump touted the efforts to look into the media spending. \u201cWe\u2019re catching them left and right,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019re catching them. We\u2019re catching them to a point where they don\u2019t know what the heck is going on. They can\u2019t believe they\u2019re getting caught.\u201d",
      "Politico, in a statement to readers from CEO Goli Sheikholeslami and Editor-in-Chief John Harris, said Thursday that it is not getting a government subsidy.",
      "\u201cIt is a transaction \u2014 just as the government buys research, equipment, software and industry reports,\" they said. \"Some online voices are deliberately spreading falsehoods. Let's be clear: Politico has no financial dependence on the government and no hidden agenda. We cover politics and policy \u2014 that's our job.\"",
      "It has not been unusual for governments, federal and state, to subscribe to major media outlets to keep up on important or strategic issues. The U.S. State Department, for example, may depend on international news reporting for clarity on incidents happening in countries where the United States has interests. Specialists in an agency like the Department of Transportation follow trade publications for industry trends.",
      "The Politico Pro service helps government and private sector customers \"track policy, legislation and regulations in real time with news, intelligence and a suite of data products,\" the company said. It would not discuss how many subscriptions it has sold, or the prices.",
      "The New York Times said it earned less than $2 million last year through government subscriptions, which are offered at a discounted rate. Through one arrangement, the Times gives access to more than 1 million active and retired military members and their families.",
      "\u201cThese officials and other public servants are simply seeking to better understand the world through our independent journalism, like millions of other Americans,\u201d spokesman Charlie Stadtlander said.",
      "Musk, also a frequent critic of the mainstream media and the owner of a platform that in many ways competes with it, retweeted one message on X that complained about the AP \u201craking in millions of dollars in government money for years.\u201d",
      "\u201cNot for long,\" Musk added. \u201dThis is obviously a huge waste of taxpayer money.\"",
      "AP spokeswoman Lauren Easton said that \u201cthe U.S. government has long been an AP customer \u2014 through both Democratic and Republican administrations. It licenses AP's nonpartisan journalism, just like thousands of news outlets and customers around the world. It's quite common for governments to have contracts with news organizations for their content.\u201d",
      "The outlet would not reveal how much it is earning in federal government contracts.",
      "Separately, Musk's focus on the USAID agency has threatened some $268 million in congressionally-authorized funding aimed at offering training and support to some 6,200 independent journalists working around the world, including in war-torn Ukraine, said the organization Reporters Without Borders.",
      "Denying the money \u201cwill create a vacuum that plays into the hands of propagandists and authoritarian states,\u201d said Clayton Weimers, executive director of Reporters Without Borders' USA branch.",

      "The Hong Kong government said in a statement that Hongkong Post was in talks with the U.S. postal administration but further clarification was still needed on certain matters, including over a tariff. It reiterated its strong disapproval over the U.S. imposition of additional duty on Hong Kong products, urging the U.S. to take \u201curgent actions to rectify its wrongdoing.\"",
      "The U.S. post office had announced Tuesday that it would no longer accept parcels from China, including the city, after the U.S. imposed an additional 10% tariff on Chinese goods and ended a customs exception that allowed small-value parcels to enter the U.S. without paying tax.",
      "It reversed course Wednesday but gave no reason, saying it would work with Customs and Border Protection to implement a collection process for the new tariffs to avoid delivery disruptions.",
      "Although the ban was short-lived and the U-turn came within the same day for those who live in Hong Kong time zone, it confused those who wanted to post to the U.S. from the trading hub.",

      "In the days after last week's plane collision in Washington, Pete Muntean was a fixture on the air at CNN",
      "NEW YORK -- Summoned from his couch to cover last week's plane disaster in Washington, CNN's Pete Muntean rushed in for the first of 24 live reports over the next 48 hours. At one point, he used a model airplane and helicopter to demonstrate. At another, he called President Trump \u201cunhinged\u201d for speculating that diversity in hiring contributed to the crash.",
      "Even regular viewers may have wondered: Who is Pete Muntean, anyway?",
      "As CNN's aviation correspondent and a pilot who has flown near where the collision that killed 67 people took place, Muntean illustrates the changes in what used to be an important specialty in journalism.",
      "Precise numbers are hard to come by. But simply by the content out there, there are fewer reporters concentrating solely on what is a complex and technical beat, both because of how the business has changed and the relative safety of flying.",
      "\u201cI realized that planes weren't crashing and I needed a new beat,\u201d said Bill Adair, a former reporter who wrote a book, \u201cThe Mystery of Flight 427: Inside a Crash Investigation,\u201d about a 1994 plane crash in western Pennsylvania that killed 132 people. \u201cThat's a good thing.\u201d",
      "Adair switched to politics, and later created the fact-checking website PolitiFact.",
      "Muntean, 36, was born for his job. Both of his parents were pilots, and he kept his passion for aviation even after his mother, Nancy Lynn, died when the plane she was flying in a Virginia air show crashed. Muntean was 18 at the time and witnessed it; he was the show's MC.",
      "Shortly after, he flew his first solo flight. He keeps a plane at a small Maryland airport now and takes to the sky when time allows.",
      "\u201cI don't think I could ever leave it,\u201d he said. \u201cI love flying more than anything, and the next best thing is talking about it.\u201d",
      "Muntean believes a major part of his job is translation, trying to put into plain English terminology that non-pilots can get lost in. He tries not to be glum about tragedies he occasionally needs to cover. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m the guy who makes people afraid of flying,\u201d he said, \u201cwhich is a real drag.\u201d",
      "Aviation is his beat, but like many reporters who follow the industry now, it's not his sole area of concentration. He covers transportation in general. Tom Costello covers aviation for NBC News, but he also covers transportation, cybersecurity, space travel and economics. Jon Scott's main job is as a news anchor for Fox News but, as a pilot, he's involved in major aviation stories.",
      "The New York Times splits things up: Niraj Chokshi covers aviation and transportation, Mark Walker follows the National Transporation Safety Board and Christine Chung follows the airline industry from a consumer perspective. David Koenig was airlines writer for The Associated Press until his recent retirement; the AP says his job will be filled.",
      "\u201cThere are a lot of good reporters that cover aviation, but they are fewer than ever,\u201d said Jon Ostrower, who has covered the industry for CNN and The Wall Street Journal and is now editor-in-chief of The Air Current, a subscription-based aviation news service.",
      "The news industry's economic struggles means there are less specialists in general in newsrooms. With safety a major component of the aviation beat, the fact that the last major U.S. commercial air crash before last week came in 2009 means there is less to do.",
      "\u201cI sympathize with editors,\u201d Adair said. \u201cIf you have limited resources, there is not a lot of merit in putting a reporter on a beat where things are working well.\u201d",
      "Airline ownership consolidation means there are fewer reporters at regional newspapers knowledgeable about the industry because they have to follow the local company, Ostrower said. That assumes there are even many reporters at hollowed-out newspapers to do that.",
      "There's also much more flight tracking information easily available to the public through services like Flightradar24 and ADS-B Exchange than in years past. While helpful for journalists, that also increases the preponderance of armchair investigators clogging the Internet with less-than-informed theories, Ostrower said. And entities that offered training for reporters on aviation issues, including companies like Boeing and Pratt & Whitney, don't do it anymore, he said.",
      "To some experts, the shrinking of ranks on the aviation beat wasn't necessarily apparent after the Washington crash. Where it's likely to be noticed is in the weeks and months after, when the time comes to closely examine mechanical issues and policies that might need to be changed to prevent a recurrence.",
      "Who will be watching to see what lessons are learned?",
      "\u201cWe've witnessed the dismantling of the department store approach to news,\u201d said veteran science reporter Miles O'Brien. \u201cEveryone has a little boutique now. You can find experts, but it is incumbent upon the consumer to find trusted sources.\u201d",
      "O'Brien and Ostrower have something in common: they've both been laid off by CNN. Cutbacks may have taken O'Brien's regular job, but producers come calling when news happens \u2014 so much so that he was put on a retainer by his old employer.",
      "He's made a handful of appearances following the Washington crash. When not on the air, O\u2019Brien has been closely watching how Muntean \u2014 his former intern \u2014 covers the aviation beat.",

The program has completed some major projects but also raised concerns about debt and environmental impact.",
      "Panama\u2019s decision to walk away from it was seen as a concession to the U.S. over the canal after U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned Panamanian leader Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino on Sunday that Panama must immediately reduce what President Donald Trump says is Chinese influence over the canal area or face potential retaliation from the United States.",
      "Mulino has rejected pressure from the new U.S. government to discuss ownership of a waterway that is vital to global trade.",
      "Despite that, some believe Panama may be open to a compromise under which canal operations on both sides are taken away from the Hong Kong-based Hutchison Ports company, which was given a 25-year no-bid extension to run them. An audit into the suitability of that extension is already underway and could lead to a rebidding process.",
      "A drop in water levels in the canal due to drought has slowed transit through the canal, raising further complaints from Trump, although the delays appear to have nothing to do with China.",

      "\"The formation of three independent, industry-leading companies builds on the powerful foundation we have created, positioning each to pursue tailored growth strategies, and unlock significant value for shareholders and customers,\u201d Honeywell Chairman and CEO Vimal Kapur said in a statement.",
      "Honeywell had said in December that it was considering spinning off its aerospace division. The public announcement arrived about one month after Elliott Investment Management revealed a stake of more than $5 billion in the aerospace, automation and materials company. Elliott had been pushing for the Charlotte, North Carolina, company to separate its automation and aerospace businesses.",
      "The board of Honeywell International Inc. had been exploring strategic options for the company since earlier in 2024.",
      "The company, which makes everything from eye solution to barcode readers, has been seeking ways to make itself more nimble. Over the past year and a half, just after Kapur took over as CEO, Honeywell has announced plans for the advanced materials business spinoff, entered into an agreement to sell its personal protective equipment business, and made several acquisitions.",
      "The separation of the automation and aerospace technologies businesses is expected to be completed in the second half of 2026. The spinoff of the advanced materials business is anticipated to be completed by the end of this year or early next year.",
      "Like Honeywell, other U.S. conglomerates have been pressured by shareholders to simplify their structures, allowing each segment of the company to move more freely and adapt to changes in their respective markets.",
      "Iconic CEOs like Jack Welch of General Electric spent years building corporate American behemoths with the belief that with scale came power. Yet those massive companies were forced to compete with upstarts with a narrow focus and a more clearly defined set of goals.",
      "Investors also wanted a more clear view of the priorities within each division, which became more murky as the companies grew.",
      "In 2015 metals maker Alcoa said that it was splitting into two independent companies, separating its bauxite, aluminum and casting operations from its engineering, transportation and global rolled products businesses.",
      "GE announced in 2021 that it was dividing itself into three public companies focused on aviation, health care and energy. At the time, the move was viewed as a potential signal of the end of conglomerates as a whole thanks to the move toward a digital economy.",
      "Shares fell almost 3% before the market opened Thursday."

      "A judge has ruled that a Georgia railroad can buy land against the will of property owners to build a track",
      "ATLANTA -- A judge has ruled that a Georgia railroad can buy land against the will of property owners to build a track, rebuffing a challenge that a libertarian group hoped could make it harder to use eminent domain to take property.",
      "Fulton County Superior Court Judge Craig Schwall Sr. ruled Tuesday that the Sandersville Railroad could condemn a 200-foot (60-meter) wide strip of property running 4.5 miles (7.3 kilometers) to build a rail line serving a rock quarry and other users. Landowners fighting the railroad had appealed a Georgia Public Service Commission ruling allowing the land taking.",
      "Schwall kept a freeze on construction for now, with landowners saying they would appeal to the Georgia Supreme Court.",
      "The case matters because private entities need to condemn private land for railroads and facilities including pipelines and electric transmission lines.",
      "The Sandersville Railroad, owned by an influential Georgia family, wants to connect the quarry to the CSX railroad at Sparta, allowing products to be shipped widely. Sparta is a mostly Black rural town about 85 miles (135 kilometers) southeast of Atlanta in one of Georgia's poorest counties.",
      "Sandersville has agreements to buy some of the 18 parcels it needs. But other owners say losing a strip of property would spoil land they treasure, and that some families have owned for a century.",
      "\u201cEvery day that Sandersville isn\u2019t coming onto our land and starting to build is a good day,\u201d Diane Smith, one of the owners, said in a statement. \u201cBut we won\u2019t rest easy until we know for sure that they\u2019ll never be able to take our land from us.\u201d",
      "Brian Brodrick, a lawyer for the railroad, urged opposed property owners in a Thursday statement \u201cto return to the negotiating table so we can bring new opportunities and channels of trade to all the citizens of Hancock County and the region.\" He said the spur would have \u201cminimal impacts\u201d on neighbors.",
      "Some people in the rural neighborhood think the railroad would enable expansion at a quarry owned by Heidelberg Materials, a publicly traded German firm. They dislike the quarry because it generates noise, dust and truck traffic.",
      "Supporters say if the railroad is built, the quarry will move its operation farther from houses, trains will reduce trucks on roads and the railroad will build berms to shield residents.",
      "Railroads have long had the power of eminent domain, but Georgia law says such land seizures must be for \u201cpublic use.\u201d Opponents targeted the project by saying it would only benefit the quarry. The Sandersville Railroad says there are other users, including a company located at the quarry that blends gravel and asphalt for paving. Several companies have said they would truck products to load them onto the new line, saying they want access to markets served by CSX.",
      "Schwall found the railroad met the public use standard, saying it was necessary for the \u201cfunctioning\u201d of Sandersville and \"also serves a public purpose because it will provide a channel of trade in east middle Georgia.\u201d",
      "The group representing opponents, the Institute for Justice, hoped to use the case to chip away at eminent domain, the power to legally take private land while paying fair compensation.",
      "The libertarian-leaning legal group lost a landmark 2005 case allowing the city of New London, Connecticut, to take land from one private owner and transfer it to another private owner for economic development. Schwall cited that case in his ruling.",
      "\u201cWe remain committed to proving to the courts that a private railroad\u2019s desire to build a speculative new line entirely for the benefit of a handful of private companies is not a public use under the U.S. and Georgia constitutions and Georgia\u2019s eminent domain laws,\u201d Institute for Justice attorney Bill Maurer said in statement."

      "People who make a habit of sleeping on the job comprise a secret society of sorts within the U.S. labor force",
      "NEW YORK -- They snooze in parking garages, on side streets before the afternoon school run, in nap pods rented by the hour or stretched out in bed while working from home.",
      "People who make a habit of sleeping on the job comprise a secret society of sorts within the U.S. labor force. Inspired by famous power nappers Winston Churchill and Albert Einstein, today's committed nap-takers often sneak in short rest breaks because they think the practice will improve their cognitive performance but still carries a stigma.",
      "Multiple studies have extolled the benefits of napping, such as enhanced memory and focus. A mid-afternoon siesta is the norm in parts of Spain and Italy. In China and Japan, nodding off is encouraged since working to the point of exhaustion is seen as a display of dedication, according to a study in the journal Sleep.",
      "Yet it's hard to catch a few z's during regular business hours in the United States, where people who nap can be viewed as lazy. The federal government even bans sleeping in its buildings while at work, except in rare circumstances.",
      "Individuals who are willing and able to challenge the status quo are becoming less hesitant to describe the payoffs of taking a dose of microsleep. Marvin Stockwell, the founder of PR firm Champion the Cause, takes short naps several times a week.",
      "\u201cThey rejuvenate me in a way that I\u2019m exponentially more useful and constructive and creative on the other side of a nap than I am when I\u2019m forcing myself to gut through being tired,\u201d Stockwell said.",
      "Sleep is as important to good health as diet and exercise, but too many people don\u2019t get enough of it, according to James Rowley, program director of the Sleep Medicine Fellowship at Rush University Medical Center.",
      "\u201cA lot of it has to do with electronics. It used to be TVs, but now cellphones are probably the biggest culprit. People just take them to bed with them and watch,\u201d Rowley said.\u201d",
      "Napping isn\u2019t common in academia, where there\u2019s constant pressure to publish, but University of Southern California lecturer Julianna Kirschner fits in daytime naps when she can. Kirschner studies social media, which she says is designed to deliver a dopamine rush to the brain. Viewers lose track of time on the platforms, interrupting sleep. Kirschner says she isn\u2019t immune to this problem \u2014 hence, her occasional need to nap.",
      "The key to effective napping is to keep the snooze sessions short, Rowley said. Short naps can be restorative and are more likely to leave you more alert, he said.",
      "\u201cMost people don\u2019t realize naps should be in the 15- to 20-minute range,\u201d Rowley said. \u201cAnything longer, and you can have problems with sleep inertia, difficulty waking up, and you\u2019re groggy.\u201d",
      "Individuals who find themselves consistently relying on naps to make up for inadequate sleep should probably also examine their bedtime habits, he said.",
      "Mid-afternoon is the ideal time for a nap because it coincides with a natural circadian dip, while napping after 6 p.m. may interfere with nocturnal sleep for those who work during daylight hours, said Michael Chee, director of the Centre for Sleep and Cognition at the National University of Singapore..",
      "\u201cAny duration of nap, you will feel recharged. It\u2019s a relief valve. There are clear cognitive benefits,\u201d Chee said.",
      "A review of napping studies suggests that 30 minutes is the optimal nap length in terms of practicality and benefits, said Ruth Leong, a research fellow at the Singapore center.",
      "\u201cWhen people nap for too long, it may not be a sustainable practice, and also, really long naps that cross the two-hour mark affect nighttime sleep,\u201d Leong said.",
      "Experts recommend setting an alarm for 20 to 30 minutes, which gives nappers a few minutes to fall asleep.",
      "But even a six-minute nap can be restorative and improve learning, said Valentin Dragoi, scientific director of the Center for Neural Systems Restoration, a research and treatment facility run by Houston Methodist hospital and Rice University.",
      "While workplace dozing is uncommon in the U.S., some companies and managers encourage it. Will Bryk, founder of AI search startup Exa, swears by 20-minute power naps and ordered two sleeping pods for employees to use in his company's San Francisco office.",
      "Ice cream maker Ben & Jerry\u2019s has had a nap room in its Vermont headquarters for a couple of decades, and a handful of employees use it, company spokesman Sean Greenwood said. \u201cEmployees who feel taken care of are much more likely to use this responsibly,\" he said.",
      "Arianna Huffington, the celebrity author who co-founded news website Huffington Post, became an advocate of a good night\u2019s sleep and occasional naps after she collapsed from exhaustion in 2007. She installed a nap room at her former company, now called HuffPo, and at Thrive Global, a wellness technology company where she serves as founder and CEO.",
      "\u201cIf people have been up all night because of a sick child or a delayed flight, if they have the opportunity to nap, ... then they will be much more productive and creative for the rest of the day instead of dragging themselves or trying to boost their energy through multiple coffee or cinnamon buns,\u201d Huffington said in an email.",
      "Kirsten Perez, 33, is a devoted napper. She used to use her lunch break at work to catch a few winks in her car. When she got her own office, she closed the door for an afternoon siesta while sitting at her desk.",
      "Nowadays, working from home as a marketing manager at Nvidia, the Atlanta resident usually takes her daily nap in bed. She sets an alarm for 15 minutes, falls asleep within a minute and wakes up 30 seconds before the alarm rings.",
      "\u201cI can tell when my reasoning, my mood are dropping, just kind of feeling the drag of the day,\u201d Perez said. In those situations, she asks herself, \u201c\u2018Do I have a chunk of time in the next hour or so?\u2019 And then I\u2019ll figure out when I can find 15 minutes and find myself horizontal.\u201d",
      "Naps are accepted and even a necessity in some occupations. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention encourages naps for nurses working night shifts. But many nurses can't sleep at the hospitals where they work because they're too busy and aren't given access to beds.",
      "Nurses \"regularly struggle to have sufficient time to use the bathroom or go outside for fresh air, no less take a nap,\" Michelle Morris, spokesperson for the National Nurses United union, said.",
      "Some companies are trying to fill the void. Inspired by his mother who worked as a nurse, Neil Wong founded Nap York, which offers sleeping pods in Manhattan and Queens that can be rented for about $27 an hour.",
      "His regular customers include super-commuters, UPS drivers, a security guard who works two full-time jobs, and doctors who work at nearby hospitals. Nap York also gives half-off prices to essential workers such as police officers, firefighters and emergency medical service personnel.",
      "\u201cIn this society, you really only have two place to sleep: you have your bed at home and you have a hotel room you can probably get for 100 bucks,\u201d Wong said. \u201cThere\u2019s really no third space that\u2019s quiet, that provides some privacy, where you can also rest.\u201d"

      "U.S. imports of Italian sparkling wine \u2014 90% of that Prosecco \u2014 skyrocketed by 41% in November, after Trump's election, far exceeding consumer demand as importers filled the pipeline for future sales, according to the Union of Italian Wines trade association.",
      "\u201cIt was quite natural at the end of the year to do extra shipments,\u201d said the trade association president, Lamberto Frescobaldi, given the uncertainty over whether tariffs would hit Italian wines or not \u2014 and the likelihood consumers would cut back on such luxuries if tariffs made them too pricey.",
      "\u201cCan we survive without a glass of wine? Yes. Wine is a pleasure,\u2019\u2019 Frescobaldi told The Associated Press this week.",
      "Italian wines were not hit by tariffs during the first Trump presidency, and no tariffs have been announced to date against European partners. Still, Prosecco importers and distributors are taking precautionary measures to protect the market.",
      "Italy exports nearly one-quarter of its wine to the United States, leaving the sector more heavily exposed to possible tariffs than any other Italian export, according to the trade federation. Last year, Italy\u2019s wine exports to the U.S. totaled 1.9 billion euros ($1.97 billion).",
      "Prosecco became the top-selling Italian wine in the United States last year, representing nearly 40% of all sales.",
      "The first signs of market concern showed up even before Trump was elected, with Prosecco shipments to the United States increasing 17% in the first 10 months of 2024. That compares with more modest single-digit increases to the next two markets, Britain and Germany, and far outpacing U.S. consumption which rose just 0.6% in the period.",
      "\u201cIt is an important figure that we did not expect,'' said Giancarlo Guidolin, president of Prosecco DOC consortium, the largest of Italy's three Prosecco-producing consortia. \u201dWe think there was an increase of product in the warehouse.''",
      "One other factor in the higher deliveries may have been a threatened port strike in January, said Dina Opici, chairwoman of the Wine & Spirits Wholesalers of America.",
      "\u201cThat said, obviously taking into consideration that there could be impending tariffs as well, I think it probably gave people a higher comfort level in making that investment,'' Opici said.",

      "LONDON -- The Bank of England is widely expected to cut interest rates for the third time in six months later Thursday, even though inflation remains above its target.",
      "Most economists think the nine-member Monetary Policy Committee will lower the bank's main interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 4.50%, taking it to its lowest level since mid-2023. The base rate helps dictate how expensive it is for individuals to take out a mortgage or a loan, while also influencing the returns offered by banks on savings.",
      "Of particular interest to financial markets is what the bank's accompanying economic forecasts show and the tone of Gov. Andrew Bailey in his ensuing press briefing.",
      "\u201cUntil now, the bank has cut at alternate meetings, but a stagnating economy and declining employment argue for more urgent action,\u201d said Andrew Wishart, senior U.K. economist at Berenberg Bank.",
      "The rate-setting panel is tasked with ensuring that inflation, as measured by the consumer prices index, hits a 2% target over the coming couple years or so.",
      "Though inflation is standing at 2.5% and expected to rise in coming months, partly as a result of business tax increases from the new Labour government, most economists think it will then trend lower towards the target, hence the panel's ability to cut.",
      "Official figures earlier this month showed a surprise decline in the inflation rate to 2.5% in the year to December, largely as a result of easing price pressures in the services sector, which accounts for around 80% of the U.K. economy.",
      "Another potential reason for rate-setters to cut borrowing rates is that economic growth in the U.K. has stagnated, which will likely put downward pressure on inflation.",
      "Inflation is way down from levels seen a couple of years ago, partly because central banks dramatically increased borrowing costs from near zero during the coronavirus pandemic. Prices then started to shoot up, first as a result of supply chain issues and later because of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which pushed up energy costs.",
      "As inflation rates have fallen from multidecade highs, central banks, including the U.S. Federal Reserve have started cutting interest rates, though few, if any, economists think that rates will fall back to the super-low levels that persisted in the years after the global financial crisis of 2008-2009 and during the pandemic."

      "The admission by Southern California Edison over its likely role in the Hurst Fire, which did not destroy any structures or result in any deaths, came in a required filing with state utility regulators.",
      "The utility acknowledged last month that fire agencies are investigating whether its equipment may have started the Hurst Fire, which scorched about 1.25 square miles (3.2 square km) around the Sylmar neighborhood of Los Angeles.",
      "\u201cAbsent additional evidence, SCE believes its equipment may be associated with the ignition of the Hurst Fire,\u201d Thursday\u2019s filing said.",
      "In a second filing, the utility said it is looking into whether an idle transmission line became energized and possibly sparked the deadly Eaton Fire, which devastated Altadena. But it still maintains there\u2019s no evidence that its equipment was responsible for starting that blaze.",

      "PORTLAND, Ore. -- Providence and dozens of doctors at a hospital in Portland, Oregon, have reached a tentative agreement after 27 days of strike, bringing what has been described as the state's largest health care strike closer to a potential end, depending on union ratification.",
      "The tentative agreement with hospital doctors and palliative care physicians working with patients with serious illness or injury at Providence St. Vincent Medical Center was announced by the Oregon Nurses Association union and Providence in news releases late Wednesday night.",
      "Key provisions of the tentative agreement include pay raises, more sick time and a commitment to reform staffing models, the union said.",
      "Ratification votes will begin Thursday, the union said. If ratified, it would be the first contract for the hospital physicians, who formed their union in 2023.",
      "This week, Providence also reached a tentative agreement with nurses at its eight Oregon hospitals. That ratification vote opened Thursday as well.",
      "Meanwhile, doctors, nurses and providers at six women\u2019s health clinics ratified their tentative agreement on Tuesday, and they were set to return to work starting Thursday, Providence said.",
      "The developments came after Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek had requested in-person mediation between the two sides.",
      "In its Wednesday news release, Providence said it was grateful for its team members and their \"unwavering support and hard work during this period, which has enabled us to provide care for our communities.\u201d Providence recruited 2,000 temporary nurses to care for hospital patients during the strike.",
      "The Oregon Nurses Association said it won\u2019t provide further comment until after the ratification vote closes.",
      "Most of the 5,000 people on strike were nurses, but dozens of doctors at Providence St. Vincent in Portland and at the women\u2019s health clinics also participated. The strike came after more than a year of negotiations failed to produce an agreement over wages, benefits and staffing levels."

      "Eligible voters, including those of the diaspora, will cast ballots to elect 120 lawmakers among 26 political groupings and one independent candidate in a vote held from 7 a.m. until 7 p.m. The Serb minority  has 10 secured seats while 10 more are for other minorities.",
      "This is the first time since independence in 2008 that Kosovo's parliament has completed a full four-year mandate. It is the ninth parliamentary vote in Kosovo since the end of the 1998-1999 war between Serbian government forces and ethnic Albanian separatists that pushed Serbian forces out following a 78-day NATO air campaign. Serbia does not recognize Kosovo\u2019s independence, proclaimed in 2008.",

      "Kurti has been at odds with Western powers over some Cabinet actions last year, such as a ban on using the Serbian dinar and transfers from Serbia to citizens of Kosovo who depend on social services and payments. Washington, Brussels and the NATO-led stabilization force KFOR have urged the government in Pristina to refrain from unilateral actions, fearing the revival of inter-ethnic conflict.",
      "The EU suspended funding for some projects almost two years ago. Brussels has already set conditions for the gradual lifting of the temporary measure, linked to Kosovo taking steps to de-escalate tensions in the north, where most of the Serb minority lives.",

      "It's also a target.",
      "The 40-year-old James became the oldest player to score 40 points in an NBA game Thursday night, putting up a season-high 42 in the Los Angeles Lakers' 120-112 victory over the Golden State Warriors.",
      "James passed the record held by Michael Jordan, his idol and the only other NBA player to score 40 after his 40th birthday.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m old, that\u2019s my take,\u201d James said when asked about his latest achievement. \u201cI need a glass of wine and some sleep, that\u2019s what I think.\u201d",
      "Jordan did it for the Washington Wizards just three days after turning 40 in February 2003. James is 38 days removed from his 40th birthday last Dec. 30 \u2014 and it seems highly unlikely this will be the last time he hits the mark, since the top scorer in NBA history is still playing phenomenal basketball deep in his record-tying 22nd NBA season.",
      "This feat is a remarkable bookend for James as well: He also is the youngest player in NBA history to score 40 points in a game.",
      "James first hit the mark 88 days after his 19th birthday on March 27, 2004, scoring 41 as a rookie for the Cleveland Cavaliers against the New Jersey Nets.",
      "\u201cThroughout my journey, anytime I\u2019ve been named or put in a category of whatever the case, to cross paths with the greats is always humbling,\u201d James said. \u201cJust to know where I come from and I love the game so much, so it\u2019s pretty cool.\u201d",
      "James also grabbed a season-high 17 rebounds and added eight assists while carrying the Lakers down the stretch against the Warriors and 36-year-old Stephen Curry, who put up 37 points in defeat.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve run out of words and superlatives and descriptions to capture what he\u2019s doing at this stage of his career and at this age,\u201d Lakers coach JJ Redick said. \u201cIt continues to be remarkable. It really does, and he really led us tonight. AR having an off shooting night, and we needed all of that offense from LeBron.\u201d",
      "James is still making NBA history while he waits to begin his new partnership with Luka Doncic, who watched his new teammate's domination from the bench for the second straight game since arriving in a trade with Dallas. Doncic is likely to make his Lakers debut on Monday night at home against Utah.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t wait, because everything I do on the floor, he has the ability to do it or do it even better,\u201d James said. \u201cThat\u2019s how great he is. Even at his young age, 25, he\u2019s such a unique player. He\u2019s a special player, a generational talent, so I\u2019m super-appreciative to be able to share the floor with him and then watch him do his thing.\u201d",
      "James was outstanding all night against the Warriors. He scored 18 points in the second quarter in a spree highlighted by three 3-pointers in 38 seconds \u2014 the third from the Lakers' logo at midcourt. He basked in a standing ovation from the Lakers crowd while teammate Rui Hachimura placed an imaginary crown on his head.",
      "James then stepped up down the stretch when the Lakers' 26-point lead dwindled to five in the fourth quarter. Golden State trailed by only six when James drained his sixth 3-pointer of the night with 1:08 to play, and he followed it with a half-court assist to Hachimura for a dunk that essentially sealed the win with 49 seconds left.",
      "James didn't quite manage a triple-double against the Warriors, falling just short for the second straight game. He is the second-oldest player in NBA history to record a triple-double, and he's still about 90 days too young to break the record set by Karl Malone in 2003.",
      "James has 10 triple-doubles this season, each one making him the second-oldest player to accomplish the feat.",

We crafted this, we floated this, and it\u2019s been received well. I\u2019m sure there\u2019ll be some pushback. Our point (to detractors) is give us something better if you don\u2019t like it.\u201d",
      "The proposal has carveouts. A coach can use a charged timeout to get the player back on the field during the current possession. A player injured by a hit that results in a penalty would be exempt. Also, the one player on offense and one on defense with a green dot on his helmet, indicating he's allowed to receive radio communication from the sideline, can re-enter after one play.",
      "Injuries perceived to be feigned became such a hot topic in the Southeastern Conference last season that commissioner put out a November memo admonishing teams. \u201cAs plainly as it can be stated: Stop any and all activity related to faking injuries to create time-outs,\u201d he wrote.",
      "The NCAA Football Rules Committee will meet the last week of February in Indianapolis, and the issue will be front and center. If the AFCA's proposal passes and is approved in the spring by the Playing Rules Oversight Panel, it would go into effect next season.",
      "NCAA supervisor of officials Steve Shaw said Division I conference officiating coordinators gave their support during their annual meeting in Irving, Texas, last week. Shaw showed the coordinators a video montage of players feigning injuries, sometimes laughably so.",

      "One of the clips shows a player with what appears to be a cramp.",
      "\u201cThe trainer walks him out and the guy has this huge grin on his face,\u201d Shaw said. \u201cThe trainer makes him lay down and he does the typical stretching his leg out. The trainer is grinning at him, and (the player) pops right back up and he's up in the coaches' grouping to go back into the game.\u201d",
      "Bohl said the biggest offenders are rotational players, like defensive linemen and running backs.",
      "\u201cThey look over to the sideline and the coach is pointing down, and they fall down and another guy goes in,\u201d Bohl said. \u201cBy having that player have to sit out a whole possession, a coach, the ones skirting the rules are going to look and say, \u2018Do I really want to disadvantage my team by losing a rotational player?\u2019\u201d",
      "Bohl said if action isn't taken to eliminate fake injuries, the problem will get worse because coaches will decide if there is no deterrent, they are at a disadvantage if they don't have their players engage in the behavior as well.",
      "Bohl said the AFCA proposal might not be perfect, but it should decrease the number of egregious instances of players faking injuries.",

      "Carl Edwards and Ricky Rudd had very little overlap in their respective NASCAR careers",
      "CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Carl Edwards and Ricky Rudd had very little overlap in their respective NASCAR careers.",
      "Edwards only entered the elite Cup Series in 2004 \u2014 a mere 67 races before Rudd ended his 32-year career \u2014 so the two never got a chance to know one another.",
      "But two things tie Edwards and Rudd together \u2014 when each decided to retire, both essentially vanished from the NASCAR scene, and, on Friday night they will return to their old racing community as inductees of the NASCAR Hall of Fame.",
      "Edwards and Rudd are among five being celebrated Friday night as the newest members of the NASCAR Hall of Fame.",
      "Rudd made his first re-appearance in 2024 when Roger Penske tried to wrangle all living Indianapolis Motor Speedway winners for a photo at the track to celebrate the 30th anniversary of The Brickyard. Many of his former competitors were shocked to see him on the Yard of Bricks; it was the first time most had seen Rudd since his final Cup Series race in 2007.",
      "Rudd, who doesn't go to the race track because he doesn't feel there's any role or reason for him to be there, told The Associated Press he was surprised by the warm reception he received at Indianapolis that day.",
      "\u201cThink about it, we went to 30 some races, went to the same towns, stayed in the same \u2014 we called it the \u2018trailer park\u2019 \u2014 so it's like moving out of a neighborhood,\" said Rudd, whose 1997 Brickyard victory was one of 23 career Cup wins.",
      "\u201cAnd you come back to that neighborhood and there are a lot of familiarities. Walking through the garage at Indy, it was really neat reconnecting again with many of those guys,\u201d Rudd said.",
      "Edwards abruptly retired after the 2016 season, at the age of 36, after losing out on a second opportunity to win a Cup championship with a controversial title-deciding season finale. He told the AP he didn't call it a retirement at the time because he left himself room to possibly just take a one-year break.",
      "But just like Rudd, Edwards left NASCAR in his rearview mirror. He was in the wind until he was named one of NASCAR's 75 Greatest drivers, an event that was celebrated at Darlington Raceway in 2023. Edwards joined the Fox Sports television booth for part of that day's race \u2014 where he turned out to be a spectacular broadcaster \u2014 and caught the audience up on what he'd been doing the past seven years.",
      "And just like Rudd, he was astonished at the reception.",
      "\u201cI understand now when people say \u2018NASCAR is a family,\u201d\u2019 Edwards told the AP. \u201cI finally get it. I do. When I walked away, I really thought \u2018I\u2019m giving this up completely. I'm giving up the sport, the opportunity to drive and a lot of friendships.' I'm shocked that NASCAR invited me back in this way. For the first time, I truly feel like it is part of a family.\u201d",
      "Neither Edwards nor Rudd won a Cup title, but they left memorable marks on NASCAR.",
      "Rudd was one of the toughest drivers of all time \u2014 he used duct tape to keep his swollen and bruised eyes open to ensure he wouldn't miss the Daytona 500 after suffering serious injuries in a wreck the week before \u2014 and his 788 consecutive Cup starts was a longtime NASCAR record broken by Jeff Gordon's 797.",
      "But what else would you expect from Rudd, who as one of five kids growing up in Chesapeake, Virginia, was a self-proclaimed \u201cemergency-room regular.\u201d He was pretending to be Superman when he jumped off the roof when he was 5, was the only kid in town to ride a pony in his backyard, and was so determined to do all the dangerous actions his friends were scared to do, he figured he'd one day be a Hollywood stuntman.",
      "He instead found his way into NASCAR. He ran for small teams, for big teams, his own team \u2014 10 different owners, in all. Rudd was one of the best road racers of his time and earned six of his victories, including the Brickyard, driving for Rudd Performance Motorsports.",
      "Rudd was the 1977 Cup Series Rookie of the Year, finished a career-best second in points in 1991, and scored at least one win in 16 consecutive seasons, tied for the third-longest streak in Cup Series history.",
      "\u201cYou set out your goals and it really was \u2018Try to win every race,\u2019\" Rudd said. \u201cI didn't really look at the big picture, so my career goal was always just to win every race I could.\u201d",
      "Edwards entered NASCAR at its financial heyday \u2014 maybe the toughest time in history to break into the sport. Edwards was a substitute teacher trying to be a racer and handed out business cards at tracks that read: \u201cIf you\u2019re looking for a driver, you\u2019re looking for me.\"",
      "Jack Roush gave him his break and Edwards climbed from Trucks, to the Xfinity Series and finally Cup while captivating the audience with backflips off his winning car.",
      "He once ran across the finish line at Talladega Superspeedway just to complete the event after his car had sailed into the fence on the final lap as he raced Brad Keselowski for the win.",
      "On the track, he eventually left Roush to join Joe Gibbs Racing for a better chance to win an elusive Cup title. He'd lost the 2011 Cup in a heartbreaking tie-breaker to Tony Stewart. And he was leading the finale in 2016 when a questionable late caution set up a final restart and Edwards was wrecked.",
      "And then he quit.",
      "Edwards just simply walked away from a career that produced 72 wins across the three national series, and 28 were in Cup and included the Coca-Cola 600 and the Southern 500. But he also had two of the cruelest championship defeats, both in NASCAR's playoff system.",
      "Edwards occasionally pops up doing rescue and recovery work in his home state of Missouri, where he's long been courted to run for public office and doesn't rule it out. He's never totally transparent about why he truly left NASCAR \u2014 some will never be convinced it was because he felt NASCAR cheated him out of two titles \u2014 but he's always been an extremely private person and remains that way as he heads into the Hall of Fame.",
      "He doesn't offer much about how he spends his days, he just says he keeps busy, and prefers to talk more broadly about his career and current life. He says he plans to be at the track some in 2025, and that he'd be interested in television work.",
      "One thing Edwards, who is a pilot, did reveal is that he's become a serious sailor and captained (with a crew) his own ship abroad. He's been building a boat the last three years that he intends to sail all over the world with his family.",
      "He's truly content.",
      "\u201cI used to think that I worked really hard and I did all this stuff and it was because of all my dedication and persistence,\" Edwards said. \u201cNow, the more I see at 45 years old, after living a little bit more of life, it is simply that I was the most blessed person on early. All the pieces fell into place for me to get to do something that I only dreamed about. I'm truly just realizing how fortunate I am.\u201d",

      "For the Americans, the goal is to win medals this weekend \u2014 and they have realistic chances to do so in no fewer than three events. But it's also clear that eyes and minds are starting to drift toward February 2026, when the next Olympic sliding races are held in either Italy (if a track gets built) or on USA Luge's home track in Lake Placid, New York.",
      "\u201cThe Olympics is my focus,\" three-time women's singles Olympic slider Summer Britcher said. \u201cIt has been my focus for a long time. But I don\u2019t view it as a distraction from other races like world championships or World Cups. I view it as in collaboration with them. Every World Cup and world championships is an opportunity to see how things are trending, to work on our equipment, to work on racing well. And it\u2019s all building towards the Olympics.\u201d",
      "As always, Germany is the nation to catch \u2014 44 medals so far in World Cup races this season are the most of any nation, six more than an Austrian team that seems to be peaking at exactly the right time in the Olympic cycle. Latvia has 11 medals so far this season and the U.S. is fourth with nine.",
      "The majority of the American medals this season have been claimed by the women's doubles team of Chevonne Forgan and Sophia Kirkby \u2014 winners of four medals in doubles races and part of more medal performances in relays. At this rate, they seem like locks to make their Olympic debuts next winter.",
      "On a team filled with Olympic veterans and proven sliders \u2014 Britcher and Emily Sweeney have been among the best in the women's singles world for years, Tucker West has one of the fastest men's starts on the circuit \u2014 Forgan and Kirkby are quickly proving themselves. They're young and exuberant, which is clear from the glitter adorning their faces on race days and just how excited they get on the medal stand.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one of the most important things to make sure we\u2019re still having fun,\" Forgan said. \u201cObviously, this season has been our best season so far results-wise. We\u2019ve kind of been having to remind ourselves, when it\u2019s getting kind of tough and it\u2019s getting kind of serious and we\u2019re really pushing, that we are having fun and we love what we do. And I think that really carries us through a lot of the difficulties that come with being on the road so much and how intense the competition can get.\u201d",
      "The world championship mixed doubles and mixed singles races were set for Thursday, with three competitions \u2014 men\u2019s doubles, women\u2019s doubles and women\u2019s singles \u2014 on Friday. The championships close on Saturday with men\u2019s singles and the team relay.",
      "The relay is fast becoming a favorite for the U.S. squad, since it brings men's singles, women's singles, women's doubles and men's doubles sleds together in the same event.",
      "\u201cFrom Day 1, Team USA is drilled into you and we are Team USA at our core,\" Sweeney said. \"And the way that we come together during relays is something that\u2019s pretty special.\u201d",

      "\u201cI went to him after he made first-team All-Pro, and I went to him and I congratulated him, and I said, \u2018Man, you deserve this,\u2019\u201d Roseman said. \u201cAnd he said, \u2018Be honest, did you think there was any shot at this?\u2018",
      "\u201cI said, \u2018(heck) no,\u2019\u201d Roseman said to roaring laughter.",
      "Hey, who can blame him? The 28-year-old Baun\u2019s signing was barely a blip on the offseason transactions wire compared to more ballyhooed deals with running back Saquon Barkley \u2014 a smashing success \u2014 and linebacker Bryce Huff \u2014 a $51 million bust. The Saints took Baun in the third round of the 2020 draft and he did little to distinguish himself for a team well out of the NFL spotlight, with a combined 12 starts and 88 tackles over four seasons.",
      "In his first season in Philly, Baun is a finalist for the AP NFL Defensive Player of the Year award.",
      "The Saints let him walk, but the Super Bowl is far from any type of revenge game for Baun to show up in his old stadium and show his former team and fans what they missed.",
      "He took the fall for his shortcomings in New Orleans.",
      "\u201cKind of getting in my own way,\u201d Baun said. \u201cI had great coaches, it was a great scheme. But I kind of blame myself for getting in my own way. I think just the new environment, the new coaching staff, the new people around me kind of gave me a new opportunity and a new perspective on my career.\u201d",
      "Baun got out of his head and into a fresh start in Philadelphia.",
      "In New Orleans, Baun was primarily an edge defender who failed to crack the starting lineup and played only a handful of snaps each game. The Eagles moved Baun to inside linebacker and he instantly found new life under Fangio's scheme that forced him into being a run stopper and pass rusher on the blitz. He had 151 total tackles, including 93 solo.",
      "Take this assessment of Baun's career from Fangio in May.",
      "\u201cHe really didn\u2019t play a whole lot of defense there, but he was inside some, more outside,\u201d he said. \u201cWe think he can play inside, and I have not seen anything so far that says otherwise.\"",
      "Consider him a fast learner.",
      "Baun was a smash hit straight out of the gate with 15 tackles in a season-opening win against Green Bay. He even sealed the 34-29 win with a sack on the last play of the game.",
      "He was a bit overshadowed in that one by the other new free agent in town. That Barkley guy scored three touchdowns.",
      "Like Barkley, Baun never slowed down.",
      "He had had 11 tackles and a sack in a win over Carolina. He forced a fumble in the third that set up a score, one of five turnovers for the Eagles, and had two tackles for losses in December against Washington. In Philadelphia's playoff win over Green Bay, Baun was the first Eagles linebacker with an interception in a playoff game since DeMeco Ryans in 2014.",
      "Baun went from a bargain-bin afterthought to a free-agent All-Pro linebacker in hot demand this offseason, sure to parlay his career year into long-term financial security.",
      "Roseman has built a career on salary cap creativity and might need to summon all his experiences to find a way to keep Baun an Eagle. Back at his appearance at Kelce's show, Roseman ended his story with Baun on a pointed note that the Eagles took a chance on him: \u201cPlease remember that when we do your contract.\u201d",
      "Baun could potentially end two tenures in New Orleans. But that's a worry for another day for him \u2014 one he hopes comes with a Super Bowl ring.",
      "\u201cI don't really want to get into the free agency,\u201d he said. \u201cWe're here for the Super Bowl. I'm focused on this team right now and I am where my feet are.\u201d",

      "Dealing with the absence of star freshman Liam McNeeley for much of January and some inconsistent play, the two-time defending national champion UConn Huskies looked like a title contender in their first game in February with a win at Marquette",
      "STORRS, Conn. -- There might not be a team happier to see January in the rear-view mirror than two-time defending national champion UConn.",
      "On the way to a second straight title during the 2023-24 season, not only did the Huskies go undefeated in January, but they never trailed by double digits in those eight games.",
      "What a difference a year makes. With four starters selected in the 2024 NBA Draft and an injury sidelining talented freshman Liam McNeeley, UConn had to battle its way through every game in January. The No. 19 Huskies needed overtime to win at home against a Butler team with one Big East win. Just over a week later, the Huskies figured to have an easier team when a DePaul team that recently snapped a 39-game regular-season conference losing streak came to Connecticut. The Huskies had to overcome a 14-point deficit before winning by 11.",
      "That game was part of a stretch when the Huskies trailed by at least 10 points four times in seven games. Even the five wins in January were a bit of a grind.",
      "\u201cIt is stressful to play at UConn,\u201d coach Dan Hurley said. \"When you are not as good as we have been, it is uncharted territory for Alex (Karaban), Samson (Johnson), Hassan (Diarra), Solo (Ball), Jaylin (Stewart) and Jayden (Ross). They are not used to playing as many games like this, they are used to dominance. I think even the new guys \u2014 Tarris (Reed Jr.) and Aidan (Mahaney), it is a different kind of pressure when you play at a place like UConn.\"",
      "A turning point for UConn seemed to come late in the first half and the second half of the Jan. 29 game against DePaul. The Huskies used that momentum to look like a team that came into the season as one of the favorites to win the national title by winning at Marquette a few days later.",
      "\u201cIt helped us tremendously,\u201d Ball said. \u201cThe more we got to be together and work as one, it turned the game around. We had a big turnaround, we were down (14) in the first half and we ended up turning it around and winning by 11. The last 26 minutes were UConn basketball.\u201d",
      "More \"UConn basketball' was on display when the Huskies went on the road and won against a top-10 Marquette team in its first game in February. Even that game showed some of the flaws of this year's UConn team.",
      "The Huskies committed 25 turnovers and allowed Marquette to come down with 17 offensive rebounds. Led by a career-high 25 points from Ball, the Huskies shot 59% in the game and 63% on 3-pointers en route to the 77-69 victory.",
      "\u201cIt was a testament to the shooting numbers,\u201d Hurley said. \"There was a stretch in the second half when we weren\u2019t desperate enough or urgent enough. It has been the story of the season. These are things that we haven\u2019t done this year that our past teams have done.",
      "\u201cI am proud of the win but we don\u2019t play with that tenacity that our past teams have played with. We got bailed out by Solo had a crazy shooting night and Alex hit a late shot-clock (shot).\u201d",
      "Hurley thought it was going to be a struggle following the departures of Stephon Castle, Donovan Clingan, Tristen Newton and Cam Spencer. However, he didn't think the journey would be quite this bumpy.",
      "\u201cWhat we are trying to do is incredibly hard,\u201d Hurley said. \"The former national champs that went back-to-back, they returned their whole team or at least all the stars from their team. What we did last year going back-to-back with only returning two starters, nobody had done that before. Now we are trying to do something that has never been done before, it is not going to be easy.\"",
      "The good news is that McNeeley could be back when UConn plays at home against No. 12 St. John's on Friday night.",
      "\u201cWhen Liam was on the court, we were playing to a top-12 level,\u201d Hurley said. \u201cHis absence has caused a lot of problems for this team that this team can\u2019t overcome at this point. We just have to find a way to battle until we get whole again.\u201d",
      "With nearly a week off since the Marquette game, ailing point guard Diarra and McNeeley should be among the UConn players who will benefit additional recovery time.",
      "UConn went 3-5 in January during the 2022-23 season and turned things around in time to win the national title. Time will tell if the Huskies can follow that script once again.",

And as you can tell, he has no problems running around and working on that leg.\u201d",

      "\u201cYou will see one little squirrel, he gone. He sees a little toy, he gone. He sees multiple people, he\u2019s gone,\u201d said Nnadi, who likes to refer to Parsnip as Parsnickety. \u201cBut the second we get that laser focus, he\u2019s gonna be phenomenal.\u201d",
      "\u201cPuppy Bowl\u201d is recorded in advance. Since its filming, Parsnip has been adopted, Mollentine said. The pup is now 7 months old.",
      "Nnadi has been working for a few years to help get dogs into loving homes in the area by paying fees for more than 500 successful adoptions so far. He has partnered with organizations including The Humane Society and KC Pet Project.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s very important for a lot of these dogs that don\u2019t really see or have an opportunity to have a forever home,\" Nnadi said.",
      "Nnadi said his work with animal shelters began when he adopted his first dog, Rocky.",
      "\u201cHe was a very timid dog. A lot of things I was not really fond of how his living arrangements was were. He wasn\u2019t around that many people with dark lighting and everything,\u201d Nnadi said. \u201cIt\u2019s just made me really kind of empathize how kind of a lot of dogs go through it and their life trying to survive.\u201d",
      "He said he helped Rocky build confidence to become the \u201chappy-go-lucky dog\u201d he is today.",
      "\u201cI feel like everybody needs at least one furry friend in their life,\u201d Nnadi said.",
      "Mollentine said her organization, which has a shelter in Kansas City, Kansas, is grateful for Nnadi's help prompting adoptions. The Humane Society of Greater Kansas City has been in operation since 1912.",
      "Puppy Bowl XXI premieres Sunday at 2 p.m. EST on Animal Planet \u2014 shortly before Nnadi takes the field with the Chiefs for Super Bowl LIX."

He pleaded guilty last year to bank and tax fraud after he was accused of stealing money to cover his growing gambling bets and debts with an illegal bookmaker, in addition to $325,000 worth of baseball cards and his own dental bills.",
      "The case affected arguably the world\u2019s most famous baseball player \u2014 who previously pitched for the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim \u2014 and stoked an international media frenzy.

      "\u201cHis years-long theft of funds from Mr. Ohtani and the myriad lies he told to Mr. Ohtani\u2019s agents and financial advisors to cover up his theft represent a calculated betrayal of the very person he was hired to help,\u201d prosecutors wrote in court papers.",
      "They want Mizuhara to pay $17 million in restitution to Ohtani and $1 million to the Internal Revenue Service.",

Mizuhara takes responsibility for his actions and expects to be deported to his native Japan after serving time, Freedman wrote while asking for a sentence of one and a half years.",
      "Mizuhara was born in Japan and moved to California with his parents when he was 6. He struggled to learn English but eventually did, and he returned to Japan in 2013 to become an interpreter for a Japanese baseball team and later for Ohtani, according to court filings.",
      "The two formed a tight-knit bond, and Mizuhara moved with Ohtani in 2018 to the U.S., where he took on numerous errands for the player such as grocery shopping, Freedman wrote.",
      "Inside baseball, Mizuhara stood by Ohtani\u2019s side for many of the athlete's career highlights, from serving as his catcher during the Home Run Derby at the 2021 All-Star Game, to being there for his two American League MVP wins and his record-shattering $700 million, 10-year deal with the Los Angeles Dodgers.",
      "Off the field, Mizuhara was Ohtani\u2019s friend and confidant. He famously resigned from the Los Angeles Angels during the 2021 MLB lockout so he could keep speaking to Ohtani, and he was rehired after a deal was struck.",
      "Last year, Ohtani and the Dodgers won the World Series, and the baseball star won his third Most Valuable Player award.",

      "One of the men tried to delete the photos from a cellphone as police pulled them over in Ohio, but investigators were able to recover the pictures and included some of them in a new federal complaint filed by an FBI agent that was unsealed Wednesday.",
      "The investigation has spanned several states and led to the arrests of six people. Federal authorities say it's a story involving South American burglary crews that have been targeting upscale homes around the country and a fencing operation run out of a New York City pawn shop.",
      "In court documents, investigators haven't publicly connected the Dec. 9 burglary at Burrow's home in Cincinnati to other thefts reported at other high-profile athletes' houses, but the complaint released Wednesday said there were similarities in many of the break-ins and the investigation is ongoing.",
      "\u201cIn recent months, several agencies across the United States have shared information via email regarding these burglaries,\u201d the complaint said. \u201cThese agencies have had burglaries ... wherein professional athletes were the victims. Many of these cases share similar fact patterns.\u201d",
      "Thieves also have pilfered luxury items from the homes of quarterback Patrick Mahomes and tight end Travis Kelce of the Kansas City Chiefs and NBA players Luka Doncic of the Dallas Mavericks and Mike Conley Jr. of Minnesota.",
      "On Wednesday, three of the four men already accused by local authorities of burglarizing Burrow's home were indicted by a federal grand jury in Cincinnati on charges of transporting stolen goods interstate and falsifying records related to the same burglary. It wasn't immediately known whether they had retained lawyers who could respond to the allegations.",
      "The Clark County public defenders' office in Ohio, which has represented the four men in the state case, did not immediately return phone and email messages. All four men are from Chile and are in the county illegally, officials said.",
      "Also Wednesday, two other men charged with running a fencing operation in New York City selling stolen items from burglaries around the country pleaded not guilty through their attorneys in federal court in Brooklyn. Investigators alleged one of the men was linked through phone records to one of the men charged in the Burrow home theft.",
      "Those two men, Dimitriy Nezhinskiy and Juan Villar, were identified by authorities in court documents released Tuesday. Villar\u2019s lawyer, Lauriano Guzman Jr., declined to comment after court Wednesday. A message seeking comment was sent to Nezhinskiy\u2019s attorney.",
      "Prosecutors said a large amount of suspected stolen property was found at the two men\u2019s pawn shop in Manhattan and at storage units in New Jersey belonging to Nezhinskiy.",
      "Federal investigators said South American burglary crews, many in the country illegally or overstaying visas, have been targeting expensive homes next to green spaces, walking trails, golf courses and undeveloped land. They typically have been breaking in through rear windows or glass doors, on the second floor when possible, and targeting jewelry and designer accessories while leaving other valuables behind, authorities said.",
      "That's pretty much what happened at Burrow's home, despite a security team watching the property while Burrow and the Bengals were in Dallas playing the Cowboys. Someone at Burrow's house discovered it had been ransacked and a bedroom window was broken.",
      "The homeowners association gave police a video of a camera on a trail next to Burrow\u2019s house that showed a man walking through the woods with what appeared to be a piece of luggage.",
      "In the criminal complaint released Wednesday, an FBI agent wrote that authorities tracked the suspects to a hotel in Fairborn, Ohio, near Dayton, using cellphone location data and license plate readers. Investigators said they matched data from cell towers to the locations of a vehicle of interest identified by the license plate readers.",
      "Local prosecutors said four men were later taken into custody during a traffic stop \u2014 Jordan Francisco Quiroga Sanchez, 22; Alexander Esteban Huaiquil-Chavez, 24; Bastian Alejandro Orellana Morales, 23; and Sergio Andres Ortega Cabello, 38. Sanchez, Morales and Cabello were indicted by the federal grand jury Wednesday.",
      "According to federal agents, Sanchez and Cabello told police that they were vacationing in Ohio to see the snow. Huaiquil-Chavez said he was visiting Ohio with the others but did not know their real names, the complaint said. Chavez acknowledged buying a glass-breaking tool at a Home Depot, but didn't say why, the document said.",
      "Authorities said they later found multiple photographs on the men's phones showing items stolen from Burrow's home.",

    "published": "Thu, 06 Feb 2025 13:22:27 -0500",
    "summary": "Jimmy Butler has gotten his wish",
    "story": [
      "Jimmy Butler has gotten his wish",
      "Jimmy Butler got what he wanted. He's being traded out of Miami and got a new contract in the process.",
      "The Heat and the Golden State Warriors have agreed on a deal that sends Butler to the Bay Area, a person with knowledge of the talks said Wednesday. Butler helped carry the Heat to the NBA Finals twice, long before a hostile breakup that saw him suspended three times by the team in January.",
      "Golden State is making it happen by moving Andrew Wiggins, Dennis Schroder, Kyle Anderson, Lindy Waters and first-round draft compensation out in the deal, said the person, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the trade has not gotten league approval.",
      "Wiggins and Anderson are headed to Miami; it's unclear if Anderson will be staying with the Heat. Schroder is getting moved to Utah \u2014 where the Warriors, coincidentally, were Wednesday night \u2014 and Josh Richardson is heading from Miami to Detroit along with Waters. Also on the move: P.J. Tucker, who was just traded to Utah and briefly was set to return to Miami, where he played in 2021-22. As the trade continued evolving Thursday, Tucker was being moved to Toronto and Davion Mitchell was headed to the Heat.",
      "It took a lot, but Butler got his wish.",
      "\u201cMy brother, man. I\u2019m going to miss him, for sure,\" said Heat forward Nikola Jovic, who looked up to Butler. \u201cI think a lot of guys here will. He\u2019s someone who did a lot for this franchise.\u201d",
      "The Heat will get a protected first-rounder from Golden State; for now, that is a pick in this year's draft though that could change based on final terms. And ESPN reported that Butler has already agreed on a two-year extension with the Warriors, one that would be worth around $113 million.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m really happy that he got what he wanted,\u201d Jovic said. \u201cThat bag\u2019s kinda really big.\u201d",
      "Mark down March 25: Golden State at Miami, the first time Butler could play again in South Florida.",
      "Golden State becomes Butler\u2019s fifth team, after stints in Chicago, Minnesota, Philadelphia and Miami. His arrivals were celebrated in all four cities, and his departures weren\u2019t exactly smooth in any of them.",
      "With the Warriors, he joins Stephen Curry and Draymond Green \u2014 two players who were part of all four recent Golden State championship teams and have hopes of getting back to title contention again.",
      "The Warriors had a closed-door meeting in the locker room Wednesday as news of the trade was getting out; coach Steve Kerr met with the team during the period that the room is typically open to reporters before games. Golden State wound up falling to Utah 131-128.",
      "\u201cOur guys were in the locker room getting ready to play and all of a sudden we\u2019re saying goodbye,\" Kerr said.",
      "Butler\u2019s breakup with the Heat brewed for months. The primary issue was money; he was eligible for the two-year, $113 million extension and the Heat never offered it, largely because he missed about 25% of the team\u2019s games in his Miami tenure.",
      "The relationship was broken beyond repair at the end. When Butler said he didn\u2019t expect to find on-court joy with the Heat again in early January, he was suspended for seven games as the last straw on a list of what the team called detrimental conduct.",
      "It kept getting worse: Butler was suspended three times in January alone, the second a two-game ban for missing a team flight, the last an indefinite one that followed him leaving shootaround early after learning he wasn\u2019t going to start a Jan. 27 game against Orlando. That was the end.",
      "\u201cThere was a lot said by everybody, except for me, to tell you the truth,\u201d Butler said after his first game back following the first suspension. \u201cWe\u2019ll let people keep talking. ... The whole truth will come out.\u201d",
      "The Heat said Butler asked for a trade, which caused them to changed course from team president Pat Riley\u2019s December vow not to trade him; when the first suspension was announced, the Heat said they were trying to make a trade happen.",
      "Butler is averaging 17 points per game this season. He had one of the best statistical games in Heat history against Detroit on Dec. 16 \u2014 35 points, 19 rebounds and 10 assists.",
      "It was never the same again. In his six appearances following that Detroit game, including one where he departed in the first quarter with illness, Butler averaged 9.5 points, 2.7 rebounds and 4.2 assists.",
      "Wiggins, the No. 1 pick in the 2014 draft, has averaged 18.5 points in 11 seasons \u2014 first with Minnesota, then Golden State. He is someone that Kerr has raved about at times this season, and when Wiggins was good the Warriors were usually really good. Golden State was 8-3 this season when Wiggins scored at least 23 points.",
      "\u201cWiggs is one of my favorite players I\u2019ve ever coached,\" Kerr said. \"Just a beautiful soul, just a wonderful human being. And we don\u2019t hang that (championship) banner in '22 without him. Everything he brings every single day, the laughter, the smile, the joy, just a wonderful human being. And so, I\u2019m going to miss him.\u201d",
      "Butler joined Miami in 2019 to fill Dwyane Wade\u2019s spot as the star of the team, the face of the franchise. He was an All-Star twice in Miami, helped the Heat to the NBA Finals in the bubble in 2020 and then as a No. 8 seed in 2023 and turned in some epic postseason performances. There have been 18 40-point games in Heat playoff history; Butler is responsible for eight of them, including a team-record 56 against Milwaukee in 2023.",
      "The last time Butler spoke publicly as a Heat player was at a padel tournament on Jan. 25. \u201cI love this city with everything that I have,\u201d he said that day.",
      "Two days later, he was suspended by the Heat for the third and final time.",

      "President Donald Trump is ready to take his fight against transgender athletes to the International Olympic Committee",
      "President Donald Trump is ready to take his fight against transgender athletes to the International Olympic Committee.",
      "Trump said Wednesday during a signing ceremony for an executive order aimed at banning transgender athletes from women's sports that his administration wants the IOC to \u201cchange everything having to do with the Olympics and having to do with this absolutely ridiculous subject\" ahead of the 2028 Summer Games in Los Angeles.",
      "The order empowers the Secretary of State's office to pressure the IOC to amend standards governing Olympic sporting events \u201cto promote fairness, safety and the best interests of female athletes by ensuring that eligibility for participation in women\u2019s sporting events is determined according to sex and not gender identity or testosterone reduction.\u201d",
      "The order also calls for the Secretary of State and the Department of Homeland Security to \u201creview and adjust, as needed, policies permitting admission to the United States of males seeking to participate in women\u2019s sports.\u201d There is no evidence that male athletes have competed in women's Olympics events.",
      "Outgoing IOC President Thomas Bach said in December that Olympic organizers were \u201cvery confident\u201d they could work with the Trump administration. The president initially backed Los Angeles during his first administration when the city bid for the 2024 Games that were awarded to Paris.",
      "Officials with the LA28 organizing committee did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "LA28 organizing committee chairman Casey Wasserman reportedly met with Trump in Florida last month before Trump\u2019s second term began, with Wasserman saying afterward both were looking forward to delivering a successful Games.",
      "The IOC has largely stayed out of the discussion around transgender athletes, letting the international governing bodies for each sport set the parameters for gender participation.",
      "The rules can run the gamut. Entities like World Aquatics have very strict guidelines, while World Triathlon rules are more liberal.",
      "The IOC's stance could change considerably in the near future following Bach's retirement. Among the candidates to replace Bach is former track star Sebastian Coe, now the leader of World Athletics. Coe has been a strong proponent of limiting participation in female sports to cisgender women.",
      "Two years ago, track and field under Coe banned transgender athletes from international competition \u2014 adopting the same rules as swimming \u2014 and adopted new regulations requiring some athletes to undergo hormone-suppressing treatment for six months before competing to be eligible.",
      "The rhetoric around transgender athletes heated up at the Paris Olympics last summer, with Trump eagerly entering the fray.",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump frequently misgendered two Olympic female boxers as men and said their ability to participate in the Paris Games was \u201cdemeaning to women\u201d even though both Imane Khelif of Algeria and Li Yu-ting of Taiwan were assigned female at birth and identify as women.",
      "Trump referenced both athletes again on Wednesday.",
      "\u201cThey had two women or two people that transitioned and both of them won gold medals and they won them very convincingly,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBut all of that ends today because with this executive order, the war on women\u2019s sports is over.\u201d",
      "The question going forward is what kind of leverage the United States can use to influence the IOC. Given the volatile nature of the issue, Trump's order could begin a groundswell among international federations for the IOC to come up with a uniform standard.",

      "Amazon has reported better-than-expected revenue and profits for the holiday shopping period",
      "Amazon on Thursday reported better-than-expected revenue and profits for the holiday shopping period, but its stocks dipped in after-hours trading due to disappointing guidance for the current quarter.",
      "The Seattle-based e-commerce and technology company said its revenue for the October-December period totaled $187.8 billion, a 10% jump compared with the same period in 2023. Profits came out to $20 billion while earnings per share reached $1.86, higher than the $1.49 that analysts surveyed by FactSet had anticipated.",
      "But the company said it expected revenue for the current quarter to be between $151 billion and 155.5 billion, lower than the $158.56 billion that analysts were expecting. The guidance anticipates \u201can unusually large, unfavorable impact\u201d from foreign exchange rates, it said.",
      "Amazon is the biggest online shopping destination in the U.S. and has long been a beneficiary of consumer spending during the holidays. As it has done in recent years, the company in October began offering promotions intended to lure early holiday shoppers. It advertised other discounts during the three-month period, including on major sales days such as Black Friday and Cyber Monday.",
      "Amazon on Thursday reported it saw $75.5 billion in revenue for its online shopping business, up 7% from the same period in 2023.",
      "Across the retail industry, holiday sales in November and December were better than expected compared with the previous year as lower inflation on holiday goods enticed shoppers to buy, according to The National Retail Federation. Online shopping also saw record sales levels, Adobe Analytics reported in January.",
      "Sales for Amazon Web services, the company\u2019s prominent cloud computing unit, rose 19% during the fourth quarter. But it fell slightly below analysts expectations.",
      "Amazon is one of the biggest players in the competitive tech race around generative artificial intelligence. Like other tech companies, it has ramped up investments in the technology and is spending billions to expand data centers that support AI and cloud computing. The company is also spending money on other equipment, including its own computer chips and those developed by Nvidia. It has also rolled out its own AI models and integrated the generative AI into other parts of its business.",
      "In the fourth quarter, Amazon reported spending $27.8 billion on property and equipment, significantly higher than the same period in 2023. During a call with analysts on Thursday, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said capital expenditures for the quarter came out to $26.3 billion, most of which was geared towards AI and AWS.",
      "\u201cWe think virtually every application that we know of today is going to be re-invented with AI inside of it,\u201d Jassy said. \u201cI think both our business, our customers and shareholders will be happy medium-to-long term that we're pursuing the capital opportunity and the business opportunity in AI.\u201d",
      "Jassy added during the call that Amazon, like many others, was \u201cimpressed\u201d by DeepSeek, the Chinese artificial intelligence company whose chatbot recently became the most downloaded app in the U.S.",
      "Amazon's quarterly report comes as the retail industry is absorbing a new 10% tariff President Donald Trump imposed on Chinese imports on Tuesday. Tariffs on Canada and Mexico have been put on hold for about a month.",
      "Trump also threw out a trade exemption that allowed low-value shipments from China to bypass duties, a loophole that had given an advantage to China-founded e-commerce firms, such as Shein and Temu.",
      "The new tariffs could benefit Amazon by increasing costs for its competitors. But it would also impact Chinese sellers who connect with American consumers on the company\u2019s shopping platform. Furthermore, it could raise prices on a recently-launched online storefront that Amazon set up to ship low-cost products directly from China. The storefront, called Amazon Haul, was Amazon\u2019s answer to Shein and Temu.",
      "Additionally, analysts from Morgan Stanley wrote in a Monday note that Amazon's first-party retail business, though which the company sells products purchased from manufacturers, has the highest exposure to the tariffs. The analysts estimate 25% of the merchandise sold through that business comes from China."

    "story": [
      "Brazilian students returned to class this week with a new task: staying away from their smartphones under a new law restricting the use of devices in schools",
      "SAO PAULO -- Brazilian students returned to class this week with a new task: staying away from their smartphones as a new law restricting their use in schools took effect.",
      "President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva signed a bill in January limiting smartphone access at schools, in line with a trend seen in the U.S. and Europe. It applies to public and private schools, and applies to classrooms and the halls.",
      "Phones are still allowed for educational purposes, with the teacher\u2019s permission, and when needed for the student's accessibility and health. Schools can set their own guidelines, such as whether students can keep phones in backpacks or store them in lockers or designated baskets.",
      "Before the federal law, most of Brazil's 26 states \u2014 including Rio de Janeiro, Maranhao and Goias \u2014 had already applied some restrictions to phone use in schools. As of 2023, nearly two-thirds of Brazilian schools had some limitations, with 28% banning them entirely, according to a survey last year by the Brazilian Internet Steering Committee.",
      "But rules varied between states and between schools, and authorities and administrators struggled with enforcement.",
      "That may have contributed to support for federal legislation from across the political spectrum \u2014 both allies of leftist Lula and the far-right former President Jair Bolsonaro. A survey released in October by Brazilian pollster Datafolha said that almost two-thirds of respondents wanted to ban smartphone use by children and teenagers at schools. More than three-quarters said those devices do more harm than good to their children.",
      "Porto Seguro, a nearly 150-year-old private school in Sao Paulo, prohibited smartphones in classrooms last year and encouraged students to disconnect completely once a week. This year, it expanded its ban to include hallways, requiring students to keep their phones in lockers for the entire school day, including breaks.",
      "\u201cStudents were having trouble concentrating,\" school principal Meire Nocito said in an interview Thursday. \u201cThere was also the issue of social isolation. Many students who used technology excessively would isolate themselves during breaks, interacting only through social media.\u201d",
      "\u201cBanning cellphone use has helped create a space for social interaction, fostering relationships and teaching students to navigate conflicts, which are a natural part of human interactions. It has been very positive,\u201d she added.",
      "Brazil\u2019s Ministry of Education said in a statement Monday that the restriction aims to protect students\u2019 mental and physical health while promoting more rational use of technology.",

      "Radio jets like this are not uncommon in our cosmic neighborhood. But they've been elusive in the distant early universe \u2014 until now \u2014 because of the obscuring cosmic microwave background left over from the Big Bang.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s only because this object is so extreme that we can observe it from Earth, even though it\u2019s really far away,\u201d lead author Anniek Gloudemans of the National Science Foundation's NoirLab said in a statement.",

    "story": [
      "Lawmakers in the House are proposing to ban the Chinese artificial intelligence app DeepSeek from U.S. government devices",
      "WASHINGTON -- A bipartisan duo in the the U.S. House is proposing legislation to ban the Chinese artificial intelligence app DeepSeek from federal devices, similar to the policy already in place for the popular social media platform TikTok.",
      "Reps. Josh Gottheimer, D-N.J., and Darin LaHood, R-Ill., on Thursday introduced the \u201cNo DeepSeek on Government Devices Act,\" which would ban federal employees from using the Chinese AI app on government-owned electronics. They cited the Chinese government's ability to use the app for surveillance and misinformation as reasons to keep it away from federal networks.",
      "\u201cThe Chinese Communist Party has made it abundantly clear that it will exploit any tool at its disposal to undermine our national security, spew harmful disinformation, and collect data on Americans,\" Gottheimer said in a statement. \u201cWe simply can\u2019t risk the CCP infiltrating the devices of our government officials and jeopardizing our national security.\"",
      "The proposal comes after the Chinese software company in January published an AI model that performed at a competitive level with models developed by American firms like OpenAI, Meta, Alphabet and others. DeepSeek purported to develop the model at a fraction of the cost of its American counterparts. The announcement raised alarm bells and prompted debates among policymakers and leading Silicon Valley financiers and technologists.",
      "The churn over AI is coming at a moment of heightened competition between the U.S. and China in a range of areas, including technological innovation. The U.S. has levied tariffs on Chinese goods, restricted Chinese tech firms like Huawei from being used in government systems and banned the export of state of the art microchips thought to be needed to develop the highest end AI models.",
      "Last year, Congress and then-President Joe Biden approved a divestment of the popular social media platform TikTok from its Chinese parent company or face a ban across the U.S.; that policy is now on hold. President Donald Trump, who originally proposed a ban of the app in his first term, signed an executive order last month extending a window for a long term solution before the legally required ban takes effect.",
      "In 2023, Biden banned TikTok from federal-issued devices.",
      "\u201cThe technology race with the Chinese Communist Party is not one the United States can afford to lose,\u201d LaHood said in a statement. \u201cThis commonsense, bipartisan piece of legislation will ban the app from federal workers\u2019 phones while closing backdoor operations the company seeks to exploit for access. It is critical that Congress safeguard Americans\u2019 data and continue to ensure American leadership in AI.\u201d",
      "The bill would single out DeepSeek and any AI application developed by its parent company, the hedge fund High-Flyer, as subject to the ban. The legislation includes exceptions for national security and research purposes that would allow federal employers to study DeepSeek.",
      "Some lawmakers wish to go further. A bill proposed last week by Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., would bar the import of export of any AI technology from China writ large, citing national security concerns."

      "Scientists say they\u2019ve cracked the code for boiling the perfect egg",
      "NEW YORK -- Scientists say they've cracked the code for boiling the perfect egg.",
      "It's a recipe you can test for yourself \u2014 though the timing isn't ideal with soaring egg prices in the United States from a bird flu outbreak.",
      "The perfect boiled egg has a velvety yolk paired with a soft, solid white.",
      "Achieving this balance can be a challenge because the yolk cooks at a lower temperature than the white. Hard boiling an egg can yield a chalky yolk, while cooking low and slow can produce jelly-like, undercooked whites.",
      "Researchers cooked hundreds of eggs and used math to tackle this runny conundrum. One equation dealt with how heat travels between a hot surface and an egg; another captured how the egg's contents morph from liquid to solid with a gel-like state in between.",
      "Their final recipe involves transferring eggs in a steamer basket every two minutes between two bowls of water \u2014 one boiling and the other lukewarm at 86 degrees Fahrenheit (30 degrees Celsius) \u2014 for a total of 32 minutes before cooling under running water and peeling.",
      "\u201cYou could definitely do this at home with half a dozen eggs or so,\" said Gregory Weiss, a chemist at the University of California, Irvine, who was not involved with the research.",
      "In the method proposed by the researchers, dubbed periodic cooking, the egg whites heated and cooled until fully set. The yolk, on the other hand, held firm at a constant temperature and cooked until creamy.",
      "\u201cYou can almost spread it, like on bread,\u201d said study author Emilia Di Lorenzo from the University of Naples Federico II.",
      "To confirm they had cooked up something new, the researchers tested the chemical makeup of the prepared eggs and served them to a panel of eight tasters alongside traditional boiled eggs.",
      "The research was published Thursday in the journal Communications Engineering.",
      "This new technique could mean more time in the kitchen compared to a standard hard-boiled egg, said food scientist Joanne Slavin from the University of Minnesota. But the blend of textures on the tongue could be worth the extra time.",
      "\u201cThis is a slower process to get a better outcome,\u201d said Slavin, who had no role in the study.",

      "Despite causing minimal damage, the earthquake activity has prompted an exodus of thousands of residents and seasonal workers, mostly evacuating to the Greek mainland by ferry.",
      "Experts say the seismic activity is unrelated to volcanic activity in the Aegean Sea, but are still unable to say whether the swarm could lead up to a more powerful earthquake.",
      "\u201cWe are not yet in a position to say that we are seeing any evidence that would lead to the sequence slowly coming to a conclusion,\u201d Vassilis K. Karastathis, a seismologist and director of research at National Observatory of Athens, told reporters. \u201cWe are still in the middle of the road, we haven\u2019t seen any easing, any sign that it\u2019s heading towards a regression.\u201d",
      "The earthquake epicenters are concentrated in a growing cluster between the islands of Santorini, Anafi, Amorgos, and Ios.

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Google is scrapping some of its diversity hiring targets, joining a lengthening list of U.S. companies that have abandoned or scaled back their diversity, equity and inclusion programs.",
      "The move, which was outlined in an email sent to Google employees on Wednesday, came in the wake of an executive order issued by President Donald Trump that was aimed in part at pressuring government contractors to scrap their DEI initiatives.",
      "Like several other major tech companies, Google sells some of its technology and services to the federal government, including its rapidly growing cloud division that\u2019s a key piece of its push into artificial technology.",
      "Google's parent company, Alphabet, also signaled the shift in its annual 10-K report it filed this week with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In it, Google removed a line included in previous annual reports saying that it\u2019s \u201ccommitted to making diversity, equity, and inclusion part of everything we do and to growing a workforce that is representative of the users we serve.\u201d",
      "Google generates most of Alphabet's annual revenue of $350 billion and accounts for almost all of its worldwide workforce of 183,000.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re committed to creating a workplace where all our employees can succeed and have equal opportunities, and over the last year we\u2019ve been reviewing our programs designed to help us get there,\" Google said in a statement to The Associated Press. \"We\u2019ve updated our 10-K language to reflect this, and as a federal contractor, our teams are also evaluating changes required following recent court decisions and executive orders on this topic.\u201d",
      "The change in language also comes slightly more than two weeks after Google CEO Sundar Pichai and other prominent technology executives \u2014 including Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Apple CEO Tim Cook and Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg \u2014 stood behind Trump during his inauguration.",
      "Meta jettisoned its DEI program last month, shortly before the inauguration, while Amazon halted some of its DEI programs in December following Trump's election.",
      "Many companies outside of the technology industry also have backed away from DEI. Those include Walt Disney Co., McDonald's, Ford, Walmart, Target, Lowe's and John Deere.",
      "Trump's recent executive order threatens to impose financial sanctions on federal contractors deemed to have \u201cillegal\u201d DEI programs. If the companies are found to be in violation, they could be subject to massive damages under the 1863 False Claims Act. That law states that contractors that make false claims to the government could be liable for three times the government\u2019s damages.",
      "The order also directed all federal agencies to choose the targets of up to nine investigations of publicly traded companies, large non-profits and other institutions with DEI policies that constitute \u201cIllegal discrimination or preference.\u201d",
      "The challenge for companies is knowing which DEI policies the Trump administration may decide are \u201cillegal.\u201d Trump\u2019s executive order seeks to \u201cterminate all discriminatory and illegal preferences, mandates, policies, programs\u201d and other activities of the federal government, and to compel federal agencies \u201cto , combat illegal private-sector DEI preferences, mandates, policies, programs, and activities.\u201d",
      "In both the public and private sector, diversity initiatives have covered a range of practices, from anti-discrimination training and conducting pay equity studies to making efforts to recruit more members of minority groups and women as employees.",
      "Google, which is based in Mountain View, California, has tried to hire more people from underrepresented groups for more than a decade but stepped up those efforts in 2020 after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis triggered an outcry for more social justice.",
      "Shortly after Floyd died, Pichai set a goal to increase the representation of underrepresented groups in the Mountain View, California, company's largely Asian and white leadership ranks by 30% by 2025. Google has made some headway since then, but the makeup of its leadership has not changed dramatically.",
      "The representation of Black people in the company's leadership ranks rose from 2.6% in 2020 to 5.1% last year, according to Google's annual diversity report. For Hispanic people, the change was 3.7% to 4.3%. The share of women in leadership roles, meanwhile, increased from 26.7% in 2020 to 32.8% in 2024, according to the company's report.",
      "The numbers aren't much different in Google's overall workforce, with Black employees comprising just 5.7% and Latino employees 7.5%. Two-thirds of Google's worldwide workforce is made up of men, according to the diversity report.",

      "Smartphones are useful tools for everyday life but they\u2019re privy to nearly everything about you, including all the places you\u2019ve been",
      "LONDON -- Smartphones are useful tools for everyday life, but they're privy to nearly everything about you, including all the places you've been \u2014 if you let them.",
      "When you use a map app to find the new restaurant your friend recommended, or your phone's browser to check the price of something you saw while window shopping, you could be unwittingly allowing your phone to track your location and share that information with others.",
      "Phones use various signals to find your location, including cell tower pings, Wi-Fi access points, Bluetooth and GPS.",
      "Sometimes your phone needs to know your location to provide a useful service, like telling the Uber driver where to pick you up. But in other cases, there\u2019s little justification for tracking your whereabouts, which then can be exploited by apps, ad services or even hackers.",
      "\u201cFrom fitness tracking to navigation, every location ping potentially reveals details about our routines and movements \u2013 which could be risky in the wrong hands,\" said Darren Guccione, CEO of Keeper Security. \u201cUsers should turn on location tracking only when necessary, such as during navigation, emergencies or sharing updates with trusted contacts, and disable it immediately afterward.\"",
      "Experts warn location data could be used to track people who visit abortion clinics. Or \"a disgruntled ex could use location sharing to stalk someone, or a current, abusive partner could force you into location sharing as a means of control,\u201d said David Ruiz, senior privacy advocate at cybersecurity company Malwarebytes.",
      "Here are some tips to make sure location tracking is kept to a minimum:",
      "Head to your phone's control panel to check permissions.",
      "iPhone users can go to the Privacy & Security tab, and then to Location Services to check settings for individual apps. It's not a good idea to let apps always use your location in the background, according to cybersecurity experts. Instead, get the app to either ask first before using your location, use it only while you've got the app open, or even never let it use your location.",
      "While you're in Location Services, you might notice little arrows that indicate which apps have used your location. Purple means recently, while grey indicates the past 24 hours.",
      "It's a little different for Android phones because there are so many different versions by various device manufacturers. In general, go to settings, and then tap the Location icon, which lets you turn it on or off for all apps.",
      "To tweak settings for individual apps, tap App location permissions, where you'll get choices similar to those in iOS.",
      "Apple has other tools to cut down on third-party tracking that might include location information. On the iPhone's Privacy & Security setting, under the Tracking tab, there's a toggle to Allow Apps to Request to Track. With this switched off, any new app requests will be automatically denied and they will also be stopped from accessing your phone's ad identifier.",
      "Privacy experts recommend blocking your Google or Apple device\u2019s in-house ad identifier, which enables third-party tracking on most devices for better ad targeting.",
      "On iPhones, go to the Privacy setting then scroll down to Apple Advertising, and then switch off Personalized Ads. On newer Android phones, go to the Privacy setting, then to Ads, where you can tap Delete Advertising ID.",
      "Whether you use Android or iOS, they both have settings to allow precisely pinpointing your location by combining wireless signals with data from onboard sensors such as the gyroscope, accelerometer and barometer. This helps to estimate the phone's position if, for example, you're inside a building blocking a GPS signal.",
      "One reason to use this function is to show someone you're meeting exactly where you are. Google says its signals are randomized so they can\u2019t be associated with a specific person or account. In any case, you might not want every app to know this, so you can tell your phone to only share its general location.",
      "On Android phones, turn off the Location Accuracy setting for all apps. On iPhones, switch it on or off for individual apps.",
      "Along with app permissions for your device, it's also a good idea to check your Google account. Google was forced to be more transparent about its location tracking practices after a 2018 Associated Press story that found the company continued to track people\u2019s location data even after they opted out of such tracking by disabling a feature the company called \u201clocation history.\u201d",
      "Go to myaccount.google.com and then to the Data & Privacy section, where you'll find the Location History controls. Under recent changes, the history will be deleted after three months, though you can change that default setting.",
      "Popular smartphone web browsers like Safari or Chrome could give away your location, so try using one that that doesn't store information about you, like DuckDuckGo, Firefox Focus or Ecosia.",
      "If a privacy-focused browser needs to access your location through your IP address, they will ask first. It will also let you easily delete your cookies and other web browsing data.",
      "Phones or tablets can also be tracked with Apple's Find My or Google's Find My Device features for recovering lost devices. You can turn this feature off if you think someone has gained access to your Apple or Google account.",
      "Some cybersecurity websites recommend using airplane mode, but it doesn\u2019t always shut off all signals so you shouldn't rely on it.",
      "A signal-blocking Faraday pouch would be a better bet, but be sure to test it to make sure it's actually jamming all signals. And, keep in mind, you'll need to take the device out of the bag to use it.",
      "There are so many possible ways for smartphones \u2014 and other devices like smartwatches \u2014 to track our location that it's hard to provide an exhaustive checklist.",
      "Our default relationship with apps, companies, and platforms is for them to track us, \"which absolutely makes it harder for us to scrutinize all the channels through which our data is being sent,\" said Ruiz.",
      "\u201cThe unfortunate truth is that, to shut everything down, we have to go into our device settings and check each app, line by line, and make individual decisions for how those apps collect our location data,\" said Ruiz. \u201cIt\u2019s either that, or turn off all location data entirely,\" which could result in inconveniences like having to manually enter your address on ride-hailing apps, or not getting live directions from mapping apps, he said.",

      "Hundreds of papyrus scrolls were found in the 1750s in the remains of a lavish villa at the Roman town of Herculaneum, which along with neighboring Pompeii was destroyed when Mount Vesuvius erupted in A.D. 79.",
      "The library of what\u2019s called the Villa of the Papyri has the potential to add immeasurably to knowledge of ancient thought if the scrolls, which have been rolled up into the size of a candy bar, could be read.",
      "The heat and volcanic ash from Vesuvius destroyed the town and preserved the scrolls, but in an unreadable state, turning them into charred fragile blocks that disintegrate if unrolled physically.",
      "Scholars and scientists have worked for more than 250 years on ways to decipher the scrolls, the vast majority of which are held in the National Library of Naples.",
      "In 2023, several tech executives sponsored the \u201cVesuvius Challenge\u201d competition, offering cash rewards for efforts to decipher the scrolls with machine learning, computer vision and geometry.",
      "On Wednesday, the challenge announced a \u201chistoric breakthrough,\u201d saying researchers had managed to generate the first image of the inside of one of the three scrolls held at Oxford University\u2019s Bodleian Library.",
      "University of Kentucky computer scientist Brent Seales, co-founder of the Vesuvius Challenge, said the organizers were \u201cthrilled with the successful imaging of this scroll.\u201d He said it \u201ccontains more recoverable text than we have ever seen in a scanned Herculaneum scroll.\u201d",
      "The scroll was scanned by Diamond Light Source, a lab at Harwell, near Oxford, that uses a particle accelerator known as a synchrotron to create an intensely powerful X-ray.",
      "Scientists then used AI to piece together the images, search for ink that reveals where there is writing, and enhance the clarity of the text. The process led to a 3D image of the scroll that allowed experts to unroll it virtually, using a process called segmentation.",

      "Toyota Motor Corp. also announced it will start producing batteries for EVs, hybrids and plug-ins at a new $14 billion facility in North Carolina, with shipping starting for North American models in April.",
      "The moves highlight Toyota\u2019s aggressive push in electric cars, a sector where some critics have said it\u2019s fallen behind rivals like Tesla and BYD at a time when the Chinese EV market is booming and the world's concerns about sustainability are increasingly crucial.",
      "Toyota is setting up a company in Jinshan district in southwest Shanghai for that effort, with production of the new Lexus EVs starting in 2027.",
      "Initial production capacity there totals 100,000 vehicles a year, which will create about 1,000 jobs, the world\u2019s top automaker said. The battery plant in the U.S. will create some 5,000 jobs, according to Toyota.",
      "Toyota\u2019s push also comes as worries grow around Asia about a potential trade war brewing after President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on Chinese goods and China retaliated with tariffs to take effect next week.",
      "\u201cWe have always tried to be a company that will be loved wherever we do our business. That has never waffled,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Yoichi Miyazaki told reporters without addressing the tariffs.",
      "Also Wednesday, Toyota reported fiscal third quarter profit jumped 61% from the previous fiscal year to 2.19 trillion yen ($14 billion), on 12.4 trillion yen ($81 billion) sales, up 3% on-year.",
      "Toyota officials said sales were recovering from the drop earlier this fiscal year after some production was suspended over a certification scandal in Japan.",
      "Last year, Toyota acknowledged wide-ranging fraudulent testing, including the use of inadequate or outdated data in crash tests, incorrect testing of airbag inflation and engine power checks. The wrongdoing did not affect the safety of the vehicles, and only affected production in Japan.",
      "Toyota revised its profit forecast for the full fiscal year through March 2025 to 4.5 trillion yen ($29 billion) from the previous projection for a 3.6 trillion yen ($24 billion) profit, thanks to the positive effect of the foreign exchange rate and cost reduction efforts. The new projection still falls short of what Toyota racked up the previous fiscal year at 4.9 trillion yen.",
      "The new company in China is part of Toyota\u2019s drive to meet the high demand for EVs in China, according to Toyota. Toyota already has China FAW Group Co. and Guangzhou Automobile Group Co. as its longtime partners in China, and those will continue unchanged, he said.",

      "A sweeping new U.S. tariff on products made in China is expected to increase the prices American consumers pay for a wide array of products",
      "A sweeping new U.S. tariff on products made in China is expected to increase the prices American consumers pay for a wide array of products, from the ultra-cheap apparel sold on online shopping platforms to toys and electronic devices such as computers and cellphones.",
      "An additional 10% tariff on all Chinese goods took effect Tuesday, while the U.S. Postal Service announced it will stop accepting parcels inbound from China and Hong Kong until further notice.",
      "The previous day, President Donald Trump agreed to pause his threatened tariffs against Mexico and Canada for 30 days following negotiations on Trump's demands for the North American nations to take steps to reduce illegal immigration and the flow of drugs such as fentanyl into the U.S.",
      "After failing to get a similar White House reprieve, China struck back with retaliatory tariffs on some U.S. goods that are set to begin next week.",
      "The sheer volume and variety of the China-made merchandise sold in the U.S. means residents would probably see the prices of many typically inexpensive items tick higher if the tit-for-tat tariffs persist.",
      "These are some of the products most likely to be impacted:",
      "The U.S. imported about $427 billion worth of goods from China in 2023, the most recent year with complete data, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Consumer electronics, including cellphones, computers and other tech accessories, make up the biggest import categories.",
      "China is a dominant production engine for tech gear, including for American companies like Apple that have their products assembled in the country. In 2023, China accounted for 78% of U.S. smartphone imports and 79% of laptop and tablet imports, the Consumer Technology Association trade group reported.",
      "The tariffs also may affect how much consumers pay for typically inexpensive clothing, shoes and kitchen items like pots and pans, as well as the big-ticket items, such as appliances, furniture and auto parts.",
      "Jay Salaytah, 43, who runs his own auto repair shop in Detroit, said he bought some pieces of equipment sooner than he might have, anticipating they would cost more if Trump implemented his campaign promise to use import tariffs as a tool to promote U.S. manufacturing.",
      "\u201cI knew the costs were going to go up, and these are manufactured in China,\u201d Salaytah said of a probe test light he purchased before Tuesday's tariff went into effect.",
      "In addition to imposing a new tariff on Chinese imports, Trump\u2019s executive order also suspended a little-known trade exemption that allowed goods worth less than $800 to come into the U.S. duty-free. The order left open the possibility for the loophole to still be used with shipments from other countries.",
      "The trade rule, known as \u201cde minimis,\u201d has existed for nearly a century. It came under greater scrutiny in recent years due to the rapidly growing number of low-cost items coming into the U.S. from China, mainly from prominent China-founded online retailers such as Shein, Temu and Alibaba\u2019s AliExpress.",
      "Former President Joe Biden\u2019s administration proposed a crackdown on the loophole in September, but the rules did not take effect before Biden left office.",
      "Shein and Temu have gained global popularity by offering a quickly updated assortment of ultra-inexpensive clothes, accessories, gifts and gadgets shipped mostly from China, allowing the two e-commerce companies to compete on the home turf of American companies.",
      "Seattle-based Amazon is trying to compete with them through an online storefront that mimics their business model by offering cheap products shipped directly from China.",
      "Chinese exports of low-value packages soared to $66 billion in 2023, up from $5.3 billion in 2018, according to report released last week by the Congressional Research Service. In the U.S., Temu and Shein comprise about 17% of the discount market for fast fashion, toys and other consumer goods, the report said.",
      "It\u2019s unclear. Under de minimis, Shein, Temu and AliExpress could bypass taxes collected by customs authorities. But under the changes effective Tuesday, company shipments from China will now be subject to existing duties plus the new 10% tariff imposed by Trump, analysts said.",
      "\u201cThe vast majority of these orders are valued less than $800, which means all or virtually all of them are going to get caught in that,\u201d Youssef Squali, an analyst at Truist Financial, said.",
      "Juozas Kaziukenas, founder of e-commerce intelligence firm Marketplace Pulse, said he thinks the price increases on platforms like Shein and Temu will be \u201cpretty small\u201d and the products they sell will remain cheap. However, the rule change is likely to result in delivery delays since the packages now have to go through customs, Kaziukenas said.",
      "The new tariffs will also hit third-party sellers on Amazon that import products from China, according to Squali. He expects sellers to eat some of the costs and pass the rest onto customers, which he thinks could result in percentage price increases in the mid-single digits. Other e-commerce sites that host businesses, such as Etsy, are also going to be impacted, Squali said.",
      "Temu, which is owned by China\u2019s PDD Holdings, has previously said its growth did not depend on the de minimis policy. Though most of its products are shipped from China, Temu has been recruiting Chinese merchants to store inventory in the U.S., a move that experts said would allow it to not be as exposed to changes around the trade rule.",
      "In January, China also introduced measures to help cross-border e-commerce build overseas warehousing by offering them tax rebates or tax exemptions",
      "The day after November's U.S. presidential election, Brieane Olson, CEO of teen clothing chain PacSun, went to Hong Kong to meet with factory executives to figure out ways to prepare for Trump\u2019s tariff plan.",
      "Roughly 35% to 40% of PacSun\u2019s garments are made in China, even as the chain has accelerated moves to diversify with suppliers in countries like Cambodia and Vietnam.",
      "But Olson said Trump's 10% tariff on Chinese goods was less extreme than the company anticipated. For now, PacSun doesn\u2019t plan to increase prices on its products or move its manufacturing of knitwear and denim out of China.",
      "Toys are another category of consumer products that relies heavily on imports from China. Greg Ahearn, the president and CEO of The Toy Association trade group, said he thinks toy companies that source in China are going to absorb the cost of the new tariff in the short term.",
      "Eventually, those price hikes will be moved onto the consumer, Ahearn said.",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Google's digital ad sales continued to grow at a healthy clip during the holiday season, but that wasn't enough to offset investors' worries about whether its big bet on artificial intelligence will be lucrative as once envisioned.",
      "The October-December results released Tuesday by Google parent Alphabet Inc. showed the company is continuing to reap even more profits from its dominant search engine and other peripheral services.",
      "Alphabet earned $26.5 billion, or $2.15 per share, during last year\u2019s final quarter, a 28% increase from the same time during the previous year. Revenue rose 12% from the previous year to $96.5 billion. The earnings eclipsed analyst forecasts of $2.13 per share, but the revenue fell slightly below projections, according to FactSet Research.",
      "More importantly, revenue growth in the Google Cloud division tethered to the AI craze wasn't as robust as had been anticipated.",
      "That letdown contributed to a more than 8% drop in Alphabet's stock price after the numbers came out. The downturn reversed a recent rally that had elevated Alphabet's shares to a new all-time high earlier Tuesday during the regular trading session.",
      "\u201cThe reaction underscores concerns that rivals like Microsoft, with its OpenAI partnership, are better positioned to convert AI hype into revenue,\u201d said Investing.com analyst Jesse Cohen.",
      "But the AI-generated overviews that Google has been increasingly displaying in at the top of its search results appeared to be helping to bring in more advertising. Google's ad sales climbed 11% from the previous year to $72.5 billion to exceed analyst estimates.",
      "\u201cThe early signs suggest that AI is working for Google,\u201d said Jim Yu, CEO of BrightEdge, which helps websites rank higher in search results. \"What it does for Google is keep more of the digital experience happening within its search engine. And by the time they send someone to another site, shoppers and readers have already gotten further down their journey. So that visitor is worth a lot more to an advertiser.\u201d",
      "But Google also has spending billions of dollars on its AI expansion, a huge investment that some investors are questioning after t he Chinese startup DeepSeek found an effective way to deploy similar technology at a fraction of the cost. Alphabet is expecting its ongoing AI expansion to increase its capital from about $60 billion last year to $75 billion this year.",
      "Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai sought to reassure investors all that spending will pay off during a Tuesday conference call by emphasizing the way AI is helping to boost Google's fortunes by attracting more search traffic and making other services more popular.",
      "\u201cThe company is in a great rhythm and cadence, building, testing and launching products faster than ever before,\u201d Pichai said.",
      "Before the fourth-quarter results came out, Google made a change that in its AI principles signaling it may be more open to selling the technology in areas that it had previously indicated it would avoid. The revised principles removed previous commitments not to deploy AI in weaponry or surveillance that had been in place since 2018. Pichai didn't address the change during Tuesday's conference call and Google didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The uncertainty over AI isn't the only worry hanging over Google.",
      "The Mountain View, California, company also is facing a regulatory crackdown in the U.S., by far its most lucrative market, raising the specter that its revenue could be undercut.",
      "After weighing the evidence presented during a high-profile trial, a federal judge last year declared Google\u2019s search engine is an illegal monopoly \u2014 a decision that has opened the door for regulators to propose forcing the company to sell its Chrome web browser.",
      "Court hearings on how Google should be punished for its abuses in the search market are scheduled to begin in April, with a decision anticipated before autumn.",
      "Besides the legal assault on its search engine, Google also has been ordered  to tear down the barriers protecting its Play Store  for Android smartphone apps. That ruling is currently on hold while Google appeals. Google is also awaiting a ruling in antitrust trial in Virginia revolving around the technology underlying its digital ad network.",

      "U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers said it was a \u201cstretch\u201d for Musk to claim he will be irreparably harmed if she doesn't intervene to stop OpenAI from moving forward with its transition from a nonprofit research laboratory to a for-profit corporation.",
      "But the judge also raised concerns about OpenAI and its relationship with business partner Microsoft and said she wouldn't stop the case from moving to trial as soon as next year so a jury can decide.",
      "\u201cIt is plausible that what Mr. Musk is saying is true. We\u2019ll find out. He\u2019ll sit on the stand,\u201d she said.",
      "Musk, an early OpenAI investor and board member, sued the artificial intelligence company last year, first in a California state court and later in federal court, alleging it had betrayed its founding aims as a nonprofit research lab benefiting the public good. Musk had invested about $45 million in the startup from its founding until 2018, his lawyer said Tuesday.",
      "Musk escalated the legal dispute late last year, adding new claims and defendants and asking for a court order that would stop OpenAI\u2019s plans to convert itself into a for-profit business more fully. Musk also added his own AI company, xAI, as a plaintiff.",
      "Also targeted by Musk's lawsuit is OpenAI's close business partner Microsoft and tech entrepreneur Reid Hoffman, a former OpenAI board member who also sits on Microsoft's board.",
      "Gonzalez Rogers said she has a high bar for approving the kind of preliminary injunction that Musk wants but hasn't yet ruled on the request.",
      "She has handled a number of tech industry cases including Apple's fight with Epic Games, though she said Tuesday that Musk's case is \u201cnothing like\u201d that one. Then-President Barack Obama appointed her to the federal bench in 2011.",
      "Tuesday's hearing was originally set for January but was postponed after Musk's attorney Marc Toberoff said his house was destroyed in the Pacific Palisades wildfire.",
      "Musk, who did not attend the hearing, has alleged in the lawsuit that the companies are violating the terms of his foundational contributions to the charity.",
      "OpenAI has said Musk\u2019s requested court order would \u201cdebilitate OpenAI\u2019s business\u201d and mission to the advantage of Musk and his own AI company and is based on \u201cfar-fetched\u201d legal claims.",
      "At the heart of the dispute is a 2017 internal power struggle at the fledgling startup that led to Altman becoming OpenAI\u2019s CEO.",
      "He had also sought to be CEO and grew frustrated after two other OpenAI co-founders said he would hold too much power as a major shareholder and chief executive if the startup succeeded in its goal to achieve better-than-human AI known as artificial general intelligence, or AGI. Musk has long voiced concerns about how advanced forms of AI could threaten humanity.",
      "Altman eventually succeeded in becoming CEO and has remained so except for a period in 2023 when he was fired and then reinstated days later after the board that ousted him was replaced.",
      "OpenAI has sought to demonstrate Musk\u2019s early support for the idea of making OpenAI a for-profit business so it could raise money for the hardware and computer power that AI needs.",

      "U.S. and British scientists used photos and data from NASA\u2019s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter to map the area and calculate the path of debris that produced these canyons about 3.8 billion years ago. They reported their findings Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications.",
      "The incoming space rock passed over the lunar south pole before hitting, creating a huge basin and sending streams of boulders hurtling at a speed of nearly 1 mile a second (1 kilometer a second). The debris landed like missiles, digging out two canyons comparable in size to Arizona's Grand Canyon in barely 10 minutes. The latter, by comparison, took millions of years to form.",
      "\u201cThis was a very violent, a very dramatic geologic process,\u201d said lead author David Kring of the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston.",
      "Kring and his team estimate the asteroid was 15 miles (25 kilometers) across and that the energy needed to create these two canyons would have been more than 130 times that in the world\u2019s current inventory of nuclear weapons.",
      "Most of the ejected debris was thrown in a direction away from the south pole, Kring said.",
      "That means NASA\u2019s targeted exploration zone around the pole mostly on the moon's near side won\u2019t be buried under debris, keeping older rocks from 4 billion plus years ago exposed for collection by moonwalkers. These older rocks can help shed light not only on the moon\u2019s origins, but also Earth\u2019s.",
      "Kring said it\u2019s unclear whether these two canyons are permanently shadowed like some of the craters at the moon\u2019s south pole. \u201cThat is something that we\u2019re clearly going to be reexamining,\u201d he said.",
      "Permanently shadowed areas at the bottom of the moon are thought to hold considerable ice, which could be turned into rocket fuel and drinking water by future moonwalkers.",
      "NASA\u2019s Artemis program, the successor to Apollo, aims to return astronauts to the moon this decade. The plan is to send astronauts around the moon next year, followed a year or so later by the first lunar touchdown by astronauts since Apollo.",

      "HONG KONG -- China on Tuesday announced a flurry of retaliatory measures against the U.S., including tariffs on imports of products such as coal, liquefied natural gas products and crude oil, as well as an antitrust probe into Google. It also placed two other U.S. firms on an unreliable entity list that could bar them from investing in China.",
      "China and Google have had a long and entangled relationship going back to the early 2000s.",
      "Here's a look at Google's history in China and what the antitrust probe means for the company:",
      "Google launched Chinese-language search engine google.cn in 2006. It was censored to comply with Beijing\u2019s laws, and in 2009, was a major search engine in China with about 36% market share.",
      "In 2010, in response to a cyberattack and an increasing unwillingness to comply with censorship rules, Google said it was no longer willing to block search results and shut down its Chinese search engine, redirecting users to its Hong Kong site instead.",
      "Beijing later blocked Google services under its Great Firewall censorship system, including its email service Gmail, as well as its Chrome browser and search engine, making it inaccessible to users in mainland China.",
      "China typically blocks most Western internet platforms, such as Google, as well as social media platforms including Facebook and Instagram.",
      "Although Google services are not accessible in China, the company still maintains a presence in the country, primarily focused on sales and engineering for its advertising business. It also has employees working on services including Google Cloud and customer solutions.",
      "Google maintains offices in the major Chinese cities Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen.",
      "China\u2019s State Administration for Market Regulation said Tuesday it was investigating Google on suspicion of violating antitrust laws.",
      "While regulators did not provide further details, the announcement came minutes after the 10% tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump came into effect.",
      "As there are few details on what exactly Google is being investigated for, the immediate impact on Google operations is unclear, although its current status is unlikely to be affected by the probe, which could takes months.",
      "Google did not immediately comment on the investigation.",
      "Some experts believe that the antitrust investigation is likely to center around Google\u2019s Android operating system for smartphones and used as a bargaining chip in the U.S.-China trade war.",
      "John Gong, a professor of economics at the University of International Business and Economics, said that the investigation could be related to Google\u2019s dominance in the Android business, as virtually all smartphone brands apart from Apple and Huawei would have to pay licensing fees to Google to use the Android system on their devices.",
      "\u201cNow, this time, Google is put on the chopping board. But I think it\u2019s still an investigation, right? It hasn\u2019t reached a decision yet,\u201d said Gong, adding, \"I think it\u2019s very much negotiable.\u201d",
      "Huawei developed its own HarmonyOS operating system after it was placed on the U.S. entity list \u2014 foreign individuals, companies and organizations deemed a national security concern \u2014 in 2019, which prevented it from doing business with U.S. firms including Google.",
      "Google has been accused of violating antitrust law in other countries, including those in the European Union, South Korea, Russia, India and Turkey, for allegedly abusing its market dominance.",

      "Google went to appeals court Monday in an attempt to convince a three-judge panel to overturn a jury\u2019s verdict declaring its app store for Android smartphones as an illegal monopoly and block the penalties imposed by a federal judge to stop the misbeha...",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Google went to appeals court Monday in an attempt to convince a three-judge panel to overturn a jury's verdict declaring its app store for Android smartphones as an illegal monopoly and block the penalties imposed by a federal judge to stop the misbehavior. Video game maker Epic Games, which brought the case alleging Google's Play Store has been abusing its stranglehold over the Android app market, countered with arguments outlining why both the verdict and punishment should be affirmed to foster more innovation and lower prices.",
      "In a nearly hour-long presentation in San Francisco's Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, Google lawyer Jessica Ellsworth explained why the company believes the judge overseeing a month-long trial in 2023 improperly allowed the market in its case to be defined differently than it had in a similar antitrust trial revolving around Apple's antitrust trial in 2021.",
      "Ellsworth also asserted the trial shouldn't have been decided by a jury in the first place because Google exercised its consent to that process and demanded the case be decided by a judge instead, as had the trial by Apple.",
      "Epic, the maker of the popular Fortnite video game, filed separate antitrust cases against Apple and Google on the same day in August 2020 and culminated in dramatically different outcomes. Unlike the jury in Google's trial in San Francisco, U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez-Rogers largely sided with Apple in an 185-decision that defined the Play Store and Apple's iPhone app store as part of a broader competitive market.",
      "Ellsworth told the appeals court that U.S. District Judge James Donato improperly allowed Epic to turn the Google trial into a \u201cdo-over\u201d that excluded the Apple app store as a rival in the market definition that led to the jury's verdict in its case.",
      "\"You can't just lose an issue that was fully litigated the first time (in the Apple case) and then pretend it didn't happen,\" Ellsworth said. She said the competition that Google and Apple engage in while making the two operating systems that power virtually all of the world's smartphones \u201csufficiently disciplines\u201d their actions in the app market.",
      "But the appeals judges indicated they believed the market definitions could differ in the separate app store cases because Apple bundles all its software and the iPhone together \u2014 creating what has become known as a \u201cwalled garden\u201d \u2014 while Google licenses the Android software that includes its Play Store a wide variety of smartphone makers.",
      "\u201cThere are clearly some factual differences between the Android world and Apple world,\u201d Judge Danielle J. Forrest told Ellsworth.",
      "Judge Gabriel Sanchez also sounded skeptical about Google's claims about being lumped with an improper market definition in its trial.",
      "\u201cEven if Google vigorously competes with Apple (in smartphone operating systems), that doesn't mean it can't create a different ecosystem where it's a monopolist,\u201d Sanchez interjected during Ellsworth's presentation.",
      "Epic attorney Gary Bornstein painted Google's arguments as a desperate and unfounded effort to preserve the system that boosts Google's profits with price-gouging commissions ranging from 15% to 30% on in-app purchases flowing from software downloaded through the Play Store.",
      "The penalties that Donato imposed in October and subsequently postponed while Google pursues its appeal would impose a series of sweeping changes that include making the Play Store's entire library of 2 million apps available to potential competitors \u2014 a move expected to result in lower commission rates.",
      "The appeals court hasn't set a timeline for issuing a ruling in the Play Store case, but it typically takes several months before a decision is reached.",
      "Google is also currently facing other potential penalties that could include being forced to sell its Chrome web browser after a judge in another antitrust trial ruled its ubiquitous search engine is an illegal monopoly, too.",
      "In Monday's two-hour hearing Bornstein contended that Google never tried to define the Android app market during the trial the way it presented it during its appeal and reminded the three-judge panel that the bar should be set high before reversing a jury's verdict and the ensuing punishment ordered by a lower court judge.",
      "\u201cThe benefit of the doubt does not go to the wrongdoer,\u201d Bornstein said.",
      "The judges seemed more troubled by Donato's decision to stick with a jury trial after the case changed shortly before the Epic trial when Google settled lawsuits brought by attorneys general across the U.S. and another prominent app developer, Match Group. An agreement for a jury trial had been reached when the attorneys general and Match cases were going to be combined with Epic's, but Google wanted to revert to having a judge decide the outcome after settling some of the claims only to be rebuffed by Donato.",
      "At one point during Bornstein's presentation, Forrest openly mused about the possibility of declaring the verdict as a decision rendered by the equivalent of an advisory jury and sending the case back to Donato for a more lengthy ruling.",
      "That is an approach favored by Ellsworth, who pointed out that the judge's ruling in the Apple app store case spanned nearly 200 pages while the jury in the Google trial \u201cwere asked eight questions and they offered 14 words defining a relevant market.\u201d",
      "But Bornstein urged the appeals court to resort to giving Donato a \u201chomework assignment\u201d that would give Google more time to profit from its illegal conduct.",

    "story": [
      "The number of monarch butterflies spending the winter in the western United States dropped dramatically this year even as federal officials move to extend protections for the beloved pollinator",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- The number of monarch butterflies spending the winter in the western United States has dropped to its second-lowest mark in nearly three decades as pesticides, diminishing habitat and climate change take their toll on the beloved pollinator.",
      "Here's what to know:",
      "Monarch butterflies, known for their distinctive orange-and-black wings, are found across North America. Monarchs in the eastern United States spend their winters in Mexico and are counted by the World Wildlife Fund, which has yet to release data for this year. Monarchs west of the Rocky Mountains typically overwinter along the California coast.",
      "The Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation has been counting western overwinter populations along the California coast, northern Baja California and inland sites in California and Arizona for the last 28 years. The highest number recorded was 1.2 million in 1997. The organization announced Friday that it counted just 9,119 monarchs in 2024, a decrease of 96% from 233,394 in 2023. The total was the second-lowest since the survey began in 1997. The record-low was 1,901 monarchs in 2020.",
      "The survey noted that a site owned by The Nature Conservancy in Santa Barbara that saw 33,200 monarchs last winter hosted only 198 butterflies this year.",
      "Monarchs across the continent face mounting threats, chief among them vanishing milkweed, the host plant for the insect's caterpillars. The plant has been disappearing before a combination of drought, wildfires, agriculture and urban development, according to Monarch Joint Venture, a group that works to protect monarchs. Pesticides have contaminated much of the remaining plants, according to the Xerces Society.",
      "It's unclear what caused such a sharp drop-off in the western population in just one year, said Emma Pelton, an endangered species biologist with the Xerces Society. The monarch population is already small, she said, and triple-digit heat in the western states last year may have slowed breeding.",
      "Monarchs suffer when the mercury gets up to 100 degrees Fahrenheit (37.7 Celsius) and any temperatures above 108 degrees Fahrenheit (42.2 degrees Celsius) are lethal to the insects, Pelton said. The western states saw a heat wave in July that drove temperatures in some areas well past 100 degrees. Palm Springs, for example, hit a record 124 degrees Fahrenheit (51.1 degrees Celsius) on July 5. Another heat wave cooked northern California in early October, with multiple cities breaking heat records.",
      "Pelton said that it's too early to tell what long-term impact the dramatic losses might have on the overall western monarch population. Insects do have the potential for exponential growth, Pelton said. After bottoming out at 1,901 butterflies in 2020, the population rebounded to 247,246 insects the following year, an increase of nearly 13,000%. The year after that the survey recorded 335,479 monarchs.",
      "\"This is bad news,\" Pelton said of the 2024 population drop. \u201cBut we have seen incredible recovery. this doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re not going to have western monarchs. It's hopefully a wake-up call that a bad year can set them back pretty significantly.\u201d",
      "The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announced in December 2024 that it was working to list monarchs as threatened, a move that would prohibit anyone from killing, transporting them or making changes that would render their property permanently unusable for the species, such as eradicating all milkweed from the land. The listing also would protect 4,395 acres (1,779 hectares) in seven coastal California counties that serve as overwinter sites for western monarchs.",
      "A public comment period on the proposal is set to end in March. The agency has until December to officially list the monarch as threatened if officials decide to move forward.",
      "Earthjustice, an environmental law firm, petitioned the Environmental Protection Agency in December 2024 to mandate testing pesticide effects on insects such as bees, moths and butterflies.",

      "Some of the sites were back online Monday, but data analysts say it's not clear exactly what was removed or changed.",

      "It sparked \u201ca mad scramble right now\u201d to grab copies of whatever federal data was posted before, O'Hara said.",
      "While the administration's stated goal was to delete gender and transgender terminology, O'Hara said some researchers worry that other politically charged topics \u2014 such as climate change or vaccines \u2014 might be removed or altered.",
      "A expert panel affiliated with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention demanded a meeting on the deletions.",
      "The committee, chartered by Congress to advise the CDC director, asked the agency's acting director, Susan Monarez, for an explanation about why it had cut off access to datasets \u201cthat allow people across the country to understand the health of their communities.\u201d",
      "The panel had yet to receive a response, said committee member Dr. Joshua Sharfstein, a former federal health official who is now a health policy expert at Johns Hopkins University.",
      "Experts say datasets and summaries were affected, but so too were codebooks that explain different variables. They say they also saw changes to published research that used affected datasets, and even redactions to lists of publications about certain topics.",
      "\u201cThe scale of this is quite stunning,\u201d O'Hara said.",
      "Researchers are still stumbling on what was taken down or changed, she added.",
      "\u201cWe are finding out about omissions when somebody goes searching for it,\u201d O'Hara said.",
      "On Monday, for instance, when a query was made to access certain data from the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s most comprehensive survey of American life, users got a response that said the area was \u201cunavailable due to maintenance.\u201d",
      "The CDC\u2019s official public portal for health data, data.cdc.gov, was taken down entirely on Friday but went back up over the weekend, albeit with a yellow ribbon at the top saying: \u201cCDC\u2019s website is being modified to comply with President Trump\u2019s Executive Orders.\u201d The agency's Youth Risk Behavior Survey data was restored too, but with at least one of the gender columns missing and its data documentation removed.",
      "CDC officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The U.S. statistical system is considered the best in the world and researchers fear that the removals will undermine trust and put the integrity of the data at risk.",
      "\u201cThis sets a really dangerous precedent that any administration can come in and delete whatever they don\u2019t like,\u201d said Beth Jarosz, a senior program director at the Population Reference Bureau. \u201cRegardless of your politics, this should alarm you since this is taxpayer-funded data and it belongs to the public.\u201d",
      "In a joint statement, the presidents of the Population Association of America and the Association of Population Centers called the takedowns \u201cunacceptable\u201d and called on Congress and the Trump administration to restore the datasets.",

      "The outbreak devastated the Pacific island nation in 2019, killing 83 people in a population of 200,000. Vaccination rates were historically low because of poor public health management and the 2018 deaths of two babies whose vaccines were incorrectly prepared, prompting fears that the MMR immunization was unsafe before the nature of the error was discovered.",
      "The government suspended vaccinations for 10 months before the outbreak \u2014 the period when Kennedy visited. His trip was organized by a Samoan anti-vaccine influencer, according to a 2021 blog post by Kennedy.",
      "On Wednesday, Kennedy denied that his visit had fueled anti-vaccine sentiment. A spokesperson didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday.",
      "\u201cAnti-vaxxers from New Zealand came to be with him here,\u201d Ekeroma said. \u201cThat's how I know that his influence can be far-reaching.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen the tissue samples were sent to New Zealand, most of those people did not have measles,\u201d Kennedy told U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat.",
      "Ekeroma, a medical doctor who also holds a doctorate in health, said that the claim was a \u201chuge denial\u201d of the fact that doctors from several countries traveled to Samoa to treat measles patients.",
      "The Samoan official wasn't the health chief during the outbreak, but confirmed key details with his predecessor, he said. Only one autopsy was carried out and no postmortem tissue samples were sent abroad, which was not unusual because measles is a simple disease to diagnose, said Ekeroma.",
      "Blood samples from living patients were sent to Australia and New Zealand, where the public health agency said Monday that testing had confirmed the same strain of measles circulating in New Zealand at the time.",
      "\u201cI went there \u2013 nothing to do with vaccines,\u201d Kennedy said Wednesday. \u201cI went there to introduce a medical informatics system that would digitalize records in Samoa and make health delivery much more efficient.\u201d",
      "Ekeroma rejected that assertion, referring to social media posts by anti-vaccine advocates who posed for photos with Kennedy during his trip. One later wrote on the blog of Kennedy's then nonprofit, Children\u2019s Health Defense \u2014 which has decried MMR vaccines as unsafe \u2014 that during the outbreak he received advice from people assembled by Kennedy encouraging the alternative treatments he was supplying to Samoan families.",
      "In the same blog post, Kennedy recalled meeting Samoa's then prime minister, who he said was \u201ccurious to measure health outcomes following the \u2018natural experiment\u2019 created by the national respite from vaccines.\u201d",
      "In late 2019, Kennedy wrote to the leader, saying that the deaths could have been caused by a measles vaccine \u2014 statements he repeated in written responses to senators' questions following the hearing. He urged the Samoan leader to approach a particular laboratory to investigate the source of the outbreak.",
      "\u201cMy words had nothing to do with vaccine uptake in Samoa or with the 2019 epidemic,\u201d Kennedy said in his written responses.",
      "But Kennedy emboldened anti-vaccine contacts in Samoa, Ekeroma said, and the epidemic was fueled by disinformation in social media posts in the island nation and abroad.",
      "Moelagi Leilani Jackson, a Samoan nurse who worked on the vaccination campaign, told the AP in 2023 that anti-vaccine campaigners \u201cgot louder\u201d after Kennedy\u2019s visit.",
      "\u201cI feel like they felt they had the support of Kennedy,\u201d she said.",
      "However, Ekeroma said that Kennedy's overtures weren't heeded by the nation\u2019s leaders. A vaccination campaign resumed in 2019 and measles vaccines are now compulsory for Samoan children.",
      "If Kennedy is affirmed as the top U.S. health official this week, it would be \u201ca danger to us, a danger to everyone,\u201d Ekeroma said. Kennedy would control U.S. funding for vaccination initiatives and could make affordable vaccines harder for small nations like Samoa to access, the official said.",
      "\u201cIf he\u2019s going to be appointed, then we will have to actually discuss around the Pacific as to how we\u2019re going to try to neutralize his influence in the region,\u201d he added.",

      "House Republicans are working overtime to meet President Donald Trump\u2019s demand for a big budget package",
      "WASHINGTON -- House Republicans are working overtime after a lengthy White House meeting to meet President Donald Trump's demand for a big budget package that includes some $3 trillion in tax breaks, massive program cuts and a possible extension of the nation's debt limit.",
      "Speaker Mike Johnson had GOP lawmakers working into the night ahead of a self-imposed Friday deadline to produce the package, after having blown past an earlier timeline to draft the contours of a bill that could begin making its long journey through Congress to the president's desk.",
      "Trump's message as he popped in and out of the nearly five-hour meeting Thursday at the White House was simple: Get it done.",
      "\u201cWhat he does a really good job at is: Here's the end result that I want,\u201d Rep. Lisa McClain, R-Mich., the House GOP Conference chair, said afterward.",
      "On the list for the emerging budget package from the House GOP: making tax cuts that expire at the end of this year permanent, cutting spending on federal programs and ensuring Trump has enough money to launch his deportation operation and finish building the U.S-Mexico border wall. The package could raise the nation's debt ceiling to allow more borrowing and prevent a federal default.",
      "It's a heavy lift for Congress, and House and Senate GOP leaders have been desperately looking to Trump for direction on how to proceed, but so far the president has been noncommittal about the details \u2014 only pushing Congress for results.",
      "The standoff is creating frustration for Republicans as precious time is slipping and they fail to make progress on what has been their top priority with their party in control in Washington. At the same time, congressional phone lines are being swamped with callers protesting cost-cutting efforts led by billionaire Elon Musk against federal programs, services and operations.",
      "Trump set the tone at the start of Thursday's session, lawmakers said, then left them to hammer out the details. Republican senators are heading Friday to Trump's private Mar-a-Lago club for their own meeting.",
      "\u201cVery positive developments today,\u201d Johnson said once he returned to the Capitol. \u201cWe\u2019re really grateful to the president for leaning in and doing what he does best, and that is put a steady hand at the wheel and get everybody working.\u201d",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters the president and lawmakers discussed \u201ctax priorities of the Trump administration,\u201d including Trump's promises to end federal taxation of tips, Social Security benefits and overtime pay. Renewing tax cuts Trump enacted in 2017 also was on the agenda, she said.",
      "\u201cThe president is committed to working with Congress to get this done,\u201d Leavitt said.",
      "Johnson, R-La., needs almost complete unanimity from his ranks to pass any bill over objections from Democrats. In the Senate, Republicans have a 53-47 majority, with little room for dissent.",
      "House Republicans reconvened in the evening at the Capitol to make sure all the Republicans would be on board with the emerging plan, particularly the spending cuts that have the potential to cause angst among lawmakers as they slice into government services Americans depend on from coast to coast.",
      "The chair of the House Budget Committee, Texas Rep. Jodey Arrington, said his panel is preparing to hold hearings on the package next week.",
      "But as Johnson's timeline has slipped, the Senate is making moves to take charge.",
      "Republicans led by Senate Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota have proposed a two-step approach, starting with a smaller bill that would include money for Trump\u2019s U.S.-Mexico border wall and deportation plans, among other priorities. They later would pursue the more robust package of tax break extensions before a year-end deadline.",
      "Sen. Lindsey Graham, chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, announced that his panel, too, was pushing ahead next week with hearings to kickstart the process.",
      "The dueling approaches between the House and Senate are becoming something of a race to see which chamber will make the most progress toward the GOP's overall goals.",
      "The House GOP largely wants what Trump has called a \u201cbig, beautiful bill\u201d that would extend some $3 trillion in tax cuts and include funding for the president's mass deportation effort and border wall. It includes massive cuts from a menu of government programs \u2014 from health care to food assistance \u2014 to help offset the tax cuts.",
      "The smaller bill Graham is proposing would total some $300 billion and include border money and a boost in defense spending, largely paid for with a rollback of Biden-era green energy programs.",

    "summary": "The inspectors general for at least 17 agencies were terminated in late January, with one such official receiving a letter citing \"changing priorities.\"",

      "The inspectors general for at least 17 agencies were terminated in January.",
      "While it appears that all eyes are on the federal government as President Donald Trump\u2019s second term enters its first full month, many of the offices responsible for keeping the country\u2019s national agencies accountable are finding themselves leaderless.",
      "The inspectors general for at least 17 agencies were terminated in late January, with one such official receiving a two-sentence letter citing \"changing priorities,\" according to a copy of the note obtained by ABC News.",
      "\"It's a very common thing to do,\" Trump told reporters about the firings five days after being inaugurated.",
      "In the press gaggle aboard Air Force One on Jan. 25, Trump continued that he was not firing \"all of them,\" specifically mentioning that Michael Horowitz, the inspector general of the Department of Justice, would be kept.",
      "Concerns have been mounting since from some researchers who wonder what will happen next at internal watchdog offices that have been a staple of Washington accountability for nearly five decades.",
      "\"They have saved our agencies and the American people literally millions and millions and millions of dollars,\" George Washington University professor Kathryn Newcomer told ABC News about the IGs. \"They are saving way more than we are spending on them.\"",
      "Offices of inspector general in their current form date back to 1978, when a federal law allowed for their creation.",
      "\"There were some scandals back in the 60s into the early 70s in which there was fraudulent use of government property,\" Newcomer said.",
      "Then-President Jimmy Carter, who signed the bill into law, described the role of inspectors general as \"perhaps the most important new tools in the fight against fraud,\" according to the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency.",
      "In addition to state and local agencies, there are now more than six dozen federal inspectors general offices at entities of all sizes, from the Department of Defense and the Department of Transportation to the Farm Credit Administration and the National Science Foundation.",
      "\"Inspectors general are essentially in two roles,\" A. Sprightley Ryan, who served as the inspector general for the Smithsonian Institution more than a decade ago, told ABC News. \"They\u2019re sort of like an internal cop and an internal auditor.\"",
      "In recent years, investigative reports from inspectors general have explored staffing challenges at air traffic control centers operated by the Federal Aviation Administration, analyzed whether funds being used to support Ukraine were being properly accounted for and looked into allegations involving the architect of the Capitol.",
      "There are two ways in which federal inspectors general are typically appointed, Ryan explained. For some agencies, their inspector general is appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate, while at other departments, the person is appointed by the individual entity\u2019s leadership.",
      "\"The key is that they are to be independent of partisan influence and independent of undue influence from either the president or the Congress, so they are in this very vulnerable space that they have to walk,\" Newcomer said.",
      "Ryan said that in her time as an inspector general, politics did not play a role.",
      "\"One of the reasons I loved my job at the Smithsonian is that it was essentially non-political,\" she explained.",
      "The removal of inspectors general from their positions came as one of the new administration\u2019s initial actions.",
      "\"I was surprised that it happened so quickly,\" said Robin Kempf, a University of Colorado Colorado Springs associate professor who once worked for the Kansas Office of Medicaid Inspector General. She added that Trump\u2019s dismissals of inspectors general are \"disabling the system of accountability.\"",
      "The firings also occurred not long after a new entity called the Department of Government Efficiency was created through an executive order.",
      "\"President Trump was elected with a mandate from the American people to make this government more efficient,\" White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Wednesday in a media briefing. \"He campaigned across this country with Elon Musk, vowing that Elon was going to head up the Department of Government Efficiency.\"",
      "The exact role of this department, which is known as DOGE, remains uncertain. Led by Elon Musk, this 18-month agenda within the Executive Office of the President has been described to streamline \"federal technology and software to maximize governmental efficiency and productivity,\" according to the executive order.",
      "\"We're going to look at the receipts of this federal government and ensure it's accountable to American taxpayers,\" Leavitt said.",
      "DOGE does not have an inspector general of its own, but Newcomer told ABC News that DOGE would have benefited from partnering with inspectors general.",
      "\"The IGs have the institutional knowledge of where money can be saved,\" Newcomer said. \"They have the institutional knowledge of where are the weaknesses that need to be strengthened so we don't lose more money. They\u2019re the people that the DOGE should have brought in to say, 'Let\u2019s work together. You can help us because you have that institutional knowledge.'\"",
      "With numerous inspectors general now out of work, Ryan said that vacancies in their former offices can impact agency productivity and employee morale.",
      "\"When I first read about DOGE, I laughed,\" Ryan said. \"I was like, OK, so they want to have inspectors general. Well guess what? They already exist, because the purpose of an inspector general office is to promote efficiency [and] effectiveness.\"",
      "In 2018, the Government Accountability Office found inspector general vacancies that resulted in the appointment of an acting or interim replacement did not impact the office\u2019s ability to carry out their duties and responsibilities, but could result in varied response to personnel management and independence of the office with the agency.",
      "\"I've actually been in contact with some of my alums who work in these offices, and they're going to work every day, and are going to continue to work,\u201d Newcomer said. \"The people that are in the acting positions are civil servants who have been in their organizations for a very long time and want to continue providing the good work.\"",
      "While a president can fire an inspector general, the Inspector General Act of 1978 states that terminations can only happen after the plans are communicated to Congress 30 days in advance.",
      "\"It is illegal and it\u2019s unheard of,\" Newcomer said. \"I am hoping that the United States Congress steps up.\"",
      "Congress strengthened the law two years ago, requiring an administration to provide detailed reasoning for terminations of an inspectors general.",
      "\"The notice should explain to Congress exactly why this is happening,\" Kempf told ABC News. \"It's like a political safeguard, so that if Congress feels that this is inappropriate, the president perhaps can change their mind. And that happened during the Reagan administration.\"",
      "In 1981, President Ronald Reagan dismissed more than a dozen inspectors general, yet reversed and hired back at least five inspectors generals after accusations by Republicans and Democrats of politicizing the role, according to The New York Times.",
      "In 2009, just a few months after taking office, President Barack Obama fired Corporation for National and Community Service Inspector General Gerald Walpin. The Project on Government Oversight argued that the process surrounding Walpin's removal should have led to \"teachable moments.\"",
      "President Joe Biden in 2024 notified Congress of his intent to remove the inspector general of the Railroad Retirement Board, Martin Dickman, according to a Congressional Research Service report. He was fired following an investigation into workplace harassment and abuse, according to The Hill.",
      "During Trump\u2019s first term, he dismissed the inspectors general of five departments in the span of six weeks in 2020. In his second administration, Trump nearly tripled his previous terminations of inspectors general in one day.",
      "\"As with any organization, if it\u2019s been decapitated, it\u2019s weaker,\" Ryan said.",
      "Trump said new inspectors general would be installed, telling reporters that these replacement watchdogs will be \"very good.\"",
      "Some Democrats and watchdogs have expressed concern over potential replacements as loyalists, but Newcomer told ABC News, \"It\u2019s not a Democratic thing or Republican thing to say that we want efficient government.\"",
      "\"There'll be just a lot more acting heads of the offices, but people are going to step up,\u201d she added. \"I have faith in the American people, and I have faith in the good civil servants who are going to keep coming to work every day.\"",

    "story": [
      "Several of the president's executive orders concern the transgender community.",
      "The National Collegiate Athletic Association's board of governors voted to update the association's participation policy for student-athletes following President Donald Trump's executive order banning transgender athletes from participating in women's sports.",
      "The new policy only allows student-athletes assigned female at birth to participate in women's sporting competitions. However, student-athletes assigned male at birth will still be allowed to practice with women\u2019s teams and receive benefits, like medical care, while practicing.",
      "An athlete who is undergoing hormone therapy, such as testosterone, is also barred from competing on a women\u2019s team, according to the new policy.",
      "This may impact athletes who do not identify as and would otherwise not be considered transgender.",
      "\"Testosterone can be important in women for bone density and muscle mass, cognitive function, mood, sexual function, and energy,\" according to a 2020 article in the British Journal of General Practice, available through the National Library of Medicine on the National Institutes of Health website. \"Adequate levels of testosterone are important for the maintenance of musculoskeletal health and possibly vascular and brain function.\"",
      "Eliminating transgender women from women's sports was a promise central to Trump's 2024 campaign.",
      "But it's not the only executive order affecting the transgender community -- which is estimated to make up less than 1% of the population over the age of 13.",
      "Trump also recently signed executive orders restricting transgender participation in the military, criminalizing gender-affirming medical care for people under 19, and forbidding the use of nonbinary gender markers on federal documents.",

      "The organization said in its announcement on Thursday that the policy is effective immediately and will apply to all student-athletes regardless of previous eligibility under the organization's past policy.",
      "\u201cWe strongly believe that clear, consistent, and uniform eligibility standards would best serve today\u2019s student-athletes instead of a patchwork of conflicting state laws and court decisions. To that end, President Trump\u2019s order provides a clear, national standard,\" Baker said in the statement.",
      "The announcement also noted that the organization had updated its \"Mental Health Best Practices,\" adding that it \"requires all schools to make mental health services and resources available to all student-athletes consistent with the Mental Health Best Practices.\"",
      "\u201cThe updated policy combined with these resources follows through on the NCAA\u2019s constitutional commitment to deliver intercollegiate athletics competition and to protect, support and enhance the mental and physical health of student-athletes,\u201d Baker's statement continued. \u201cThis national standard brings much needed clarity as we modernize college sports for today\u2019s student-athletes.\u201d",

      "\"I know it's hard to ask for patience. I know it's hard to ask for trust,\" Rubio said, according to a partial transcript of his meet-and-greet with embassy staff that was obtained by ABC News.",
      "Rubio, who was tapped to serve as the acting director of the aid agency, also seemed to acknowledge the administration's haphazard approach to cutting USAID -- which handles foreign aid, disaster relief and international development programs -- saying it was undertaken \"in a manner that we would have preferred to be different, but we're forced to do because of impediments that we would confront.\"",
      "Elon Musk, the head of the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency, said earlier this week he was \"in the process\" of \"shutting down\" the agency with the backing of President Donald Trump, as part of efforts to trim the size of the federal government and eliminate waste.",
      "The Trump administration on Wednesday placed all direct-hire employees at USAID on administrative leave starting Friday, with plans to recall all foreign-based USAID employees back to the U.S. within 30 days.",
      "In the transcript of Rubio's meeting with Guatemalan embassy staff, he says that the ambassador to Guatemala \"handed\" him a list of USAID programs in the country that he said \"align with our U.S. goals and our interests.\" That list was the result of an all-night scramble by staff who were directed to compile it shortly after the secretary arrived in the country, according to an embassy official.",
      "Rubio said that document \"gave us the idea that we should ask the same exercise be conducted by every Mission around the world so that intelligent decisions can be made\" regarding which programs to keep, before the end of Thursday.",
      "The directive has quickly resulted in pushback from some USAID staff stationed abroad, who say the Thursday deadline set by State Department leadership will be extremely difficult for most posts to meet, and that it may be part of a strategy to avoid lawsuits from agency employees that could slow down its dismantling.",
      "\"Absolutely impossible,\" one USAID employee told ABC News. \"Clearly, the 90-day foreign aid review has been compressed to two days.\"",
      "Rubio's remarks came in response to concerns from Haven Cruz-Hubbard, the USAID mission director for Guatemala, who asked about the administration's efforts to curb foreign aid. Rubio insisted that \"the United States is not walking away from foreign aid. It's not.\"",
      "\"I want to tell you that this is not about politics, but foreign aid is the least popular thing Government spends money on,\" Rubio said, according to the transcript. \"And I spent a lot of time in my career defending it and explaining it, but it's harder and harder to do across the board -- it really is.\"",
      "Rubio's private comments generally reflect what he's said publicly about the cuts to foreign aid -- but his sentiments seemed more sympathetic toward the workers whose careers and livelihoods hang in the balance.",
      "\"For those of us in charge of doing the work of foreign policy, we understand [foreign aid] is essential,\" he said.",

      "Democrats argued they needed the pause to see if they could get more information on Patel contending did not provide the committee with information \"essential to our consideration of his nomination.\"",
      "In a letter to Republican chairman Sen. Chuck Grassley, obtained by ABC News, Democratic Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse, Cory Booker and Adam Schiff wrote that Patel has \"repeatedly refused to discuss the testimony he provided to a federal grand jury investigating Donald Trump\u2019s unlawful retention of classified documents, as well as his invocation of his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.\"",
      "\"We regret that you have rejected our efforts to inquire into the first-ever invocation of Fifth Amendment protection by a nominee seeking to lead the FBI,\" they wrote.",
      "The senators said that when they asked Patel to disclose information about his grand jury testimony, he said he could not because it was \"subject to a seal order\" but they said no such order could be identified.",

      "\"Until Mr. Patel discloses the substance of his grand jury testimony, the Committee should similarly draw the adverse inference that he has something to hide; that he invoked the Fifth Amendment because his testimony would have shown that he committed a crime or was in other legal peril, which should be disqualifying for any candidate seeking to be confirmed as FBI Director,\" the senators wrote.",
      "During his  hearing  before the committee last week, Patel testified that he would be impartial but dodged questions about his comments and associations with far-right groups such as QAnon.",

You know, it's one of the reasons we lost the majority. And so do you want to repeat that history, or do you want to do it earlier?

      "\u201cHe has access to a lot of information and no one can say whether he has passed any background evaluation,\" he said. \u201cWhat checks has he undergone to justify this broad access?\u201d",
      "Taff says government is bloated and needs cutting but entrusting such a massive undertaking to Musk suggests, in his mind wrongly, that important government services are equal to business expenditures.",
      "Furthermore, the retired Army veteran who served in Iraq and Afghanistan suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder and spent years appealing the Department of Veterans Affairs' denial of his disability claims.",
      "\u201cYou have people like myself who require veterans' benefits because my body and my mind has been degraded, while Veterans Affairs is already way understaffed,\" Taff said.",
      "\u201cAsk the people now who are on waiting lists like I was,\u201d he said. \u201cI had to fight tooth and nail for six years to get 100% disability.\u201d",
      "\u201cSo, do I feel like trimming needs to be done? Absolutely,\" Taff said. \u201cDo I feel that attacking the infrastructure of the social programs that help people and, to that end, help keep what I can do for the economy afloat? No, that's not the answer.\u201d",
      "Shaw said nothing Trump is doing by delegating the role to Musk breaks the Republican candidate's campaign pledges.",
      "\u201cSomeone is finally holding the gun to their head and saying: \u2018Nope. It\u2019s done. It's over,'\" Shaw said of Musk's aggressive efforts to press for millions of federal employees to consider deferred resignation or retirement with eight months of pay.",
      "\u201cI get the uproar,\u201d Shaw said. \u201cBut you have this moment now and Trump, by handing this job to Musk, is sticking to his promise.\u201d",
      "Shaw attributes the sudden and sweeping action being attempted by Musk to decades of failure by past presidents and Congresses to act.",
      "\u201cMy hope is that they hold the entire government hostage for however long it takes and that Trump says I'm not going to sign a bill that doesn't balance the budget,\u201d Shaw said. \u201cWe're not going to do this anymore.\u201d",
      "Abou says the decision to put Musk in a lead role to slash government spending is an inherent conflict, considering his business ties to the federal government.",
      "\u201cIt seems aimed at helping a very wealthy person preserve his wealth,\u201d said Abou, who is also a part-time personal care assistant.",
      "Musk's aerospace company SpaceX holds billions of dollars in contracts with NASA. The federal aerospace agency has awarded more than $4 billion to Musk's company for two human moon landings, scheduled for later this decade. Also, Musk has been at odds with the Federal Aviation Administration over what he contends is excessive bureaucracy.",
      "\u201cSo, you have someone who is not going to jeopardize his own interests, but is adamant about deep cuts that are going to cost a lot of people their jobs,\u201d Abou said. \u201cEven if some spending cuts are justified, his approach is going to make a lot of people poorer.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "With Democrats in the minority, they'll need some Republican support to pass it.",
      "Given Republican control over the House and Senate, congressional action against Elon Musk encroaching on Americans' data is tough to enact, but Democrats on Capitol Hill nonetheless vowed to take action Thursday.",
      "House Democrats introduced the Taxpayer Data Protection Act to curb Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency from accessing sensitive personal and financial data through the federal government\u2019s payment system.",
      "The bill would require anyone accessing the Treasury Department\u2019s systems to have the appropriate security clearance and have cybersecurity training and to have made an ethics. It would require them to have no financial conflicts of interest and provide criminal penalties if they accessed the systems while being in conflict.",
      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Democratic Whip Katherine Clark vowed that it would help protect Americans. Jeffries also said he expects Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to provide a companion bill in the Senate.",
      "\"We will use every tool at our disposal to protect the interests of the American people, to uphold the Constitution and guard everyday families from this Republican billionaires-first agenda,\" Clark said at a news conference. \"Elon can buy a lot. He's the richest man in the world. The American people and their security is not for sale.\"",
      "Jeffries slammed Musk as a \u201cpuppet master\u201d controlling House Republicans.",
      "However, the Democratic lawmakers acknowledged they would need to work across the aisle to get at least three Republicans to join them to pass their legislation. Leader Jeffries also said he expects Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to provide a companion bill in the Senate.",
      "Representatives Haley Stevens, D-Mich., and Sean Casten, D-Ill., introduced the bill during the News conference. Stevens, a former Treasury Department appointee under former President Barack Obama, said Americans should be alarmed by Musk and DOGE infiltrating federal agencies.",
      "Casten summed up the situation as an illegal constitutional crisis.",
      "\u201cThe actions that Musk and his IT goons have taken, they're illegal, they're clearly illegal, but so far, unprosecuted actions have already compromised millions of Americans' privacy and data security,\u201d he said.",
      "Although the House members appeared to show fire in their opposition to Musk and President Donald Trump, behind the scenes, they are still trying to figure out the most effective plan.",
      "Several congressional Democrats have privately acknowledged to ABC News that without the majority in either the House or the Senate -- they\u2019re hamstrung and have limited options to fight back against the White House.",
      "Democratic members told ABC News they\u2019ve privately pressed Jeffries to focus on the economy, rather than the chaos of this administration.",
      "The minority leader did bring it up during the news conference and accused Republicans of failing to address Americans' needs.",
      "\u201cNot a single bill, not a single idea, not a single initiative to lower the high cost of living. Housing costs in America are too high, child care costs are too high, grocery costs are too high, utility costs are too high, and insurance costs are too high,\" he said.",
      "Meanwhile Thursday, the top Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee called on Republicans to stand with them and oppose DOGE's efforts.",

      "It comes one day after a Maryland judge issued a temporary block on the order.",
      "A federal judge in Seattle has issued a nationwide preliminary injunction against President Donald Trump's executive order on birthright citizenship -- one day after a judge in Maryland also issued a temporary block on the order.",
      "\"It has become ever more apparent that to our president, the rule of law is but an impediment to his policy goals,\" Judge John Coughenour said.",
      "\"The constitution is not something with which the government may play policy games,\" Coughenour added. \"The preliminary injunction is granted on a nationwide basis.\"",
      "Hours later, the Trump administration signaled its intent to appeal the judge's order.",
      "During the hearing, which lasted less than 20 minutes, an attorney representing the state attorneys general argued the preliminary injunction is necessary to protect the plaintiffs in the case.",
      "\"When we ratified the 14th Amendment, we rendered a collective judgment and a promise that would guide our nation into the future,\" the attorney for the state attorneys general said. \"It was a promise that citizenship at birth is beyond the power of the government to take away or destroy. The president and the executive branch cannot alone undo that judgment or that promise.\"",
      "Drew Ensign, an attorney for the Department of Justice, called the interpretation of the citizenship clause by the plaintiff \"demonstrably and unequivocally incorrect\" and argued the citizenship clause applies only \"to those in the allegiance and under the protection of the country.\" The DOJ has argued that a child born in the United States to a mother without legal status cannot receive citizenship unless his or her father is a citizen or green card holder.",
      "When giving his ruling, Coughenour called birthright citizenship \"a fundamental constitutional right.\"",
      "\"There are moments in the world's history when people look back and ask, 'Where were the lawyers, where were the judges?'\" Coughenour said. \"In these moments, the rule of law becomes especially vulnerable. I refuse to let that beacon go dark today.\"",
      "Later on Thursday, the Justice Department filed a notice of appeal in the Western District of Washington, fulfilling Trump\u2019s vow to challenge the order.",
      "\"Obviously, we will appeal it,\" Trump said in the Oval Office last month. \"There's no surprises with that judge.\"",
      "The filing puts the Trump administration on track to bring the case to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, the country\u2019s largest federal appellate court spanning from Arizona to Washington.",
      "The Ninth Circuit has a reputation as a bastion of liberal jurisprudence \u2013 frequently blocking the policies of Republican presidents \u2013 that Trump attempted to reshape during his first term by adding 10 conservative judges to the San Francisco-based court.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Thousands of miles from Elon Musk\u2019s office in the White House complex, a federal worker based in the Pacific Northwest is wondering whether to quit.",
      "Musk, one of President Donald Trump\u2019s most powerful advisers, has orchestrated an unprecedented financial incentive for people to leave their government jobs, promising several months of pay in return for their resignation. The worker, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution, wants to take the money and move overseas.",
      "But she\u2019s worried. What if the offer is too good to be true? What if this is really a covert effort to make a list of disloyal government employees?",
      "Her situation is a microcosm of the uncertainty sweeping through the federal government, which is the country\u2019s single largest employer. More than 2 million workers \u2014 analysts, nurses, scientists, accountants, food inspectors and loan processors \u2014 face a deadline of 11:59 p.m. ET Thursday to decide if they should leave.",
      "The deferred resignation program is part of Trump\u2019s plan to remake the federal government, weakening what allies describe as the \u201cdeep state\u201d that undermined the Republican president during his first term. Administration officials said they can save taxpayer money by presenting employees with \u201ca valuable, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity\" to stop working while still collecting a paycheck until Sept. 30.",
      "On Wednesday, the administration ramped up its pressure on employees to leave, sending a reminder that layoffs or furloughs could come next.",
      "\u201cThe majority of federal agencies are likely to be downsized through restructurings, realignments, and reductions in force,\u201d said the message from the Office of Personnel Management, which has been a nexus of Musk's efforts to downsize the government.",
      "The email said anyone who remains will be expected to be \u201cloyal\u201d and \u201cwill be subject to enhanced standards of suitability and conduct as we move forward.\u201d Some employees could be reclassified to limit civil service protections as well.",
      "\u201cEmployees who engage in unlawful behavior or other misconduct will be prioritized for appropriate investigation and discipline, including termination,\u201d the email said.",
      "Democrats said workers shouldn't accept the deferred resignation program because it wasn't authorized by Congress, raising the risk they won't get paid. Unions have sued to stop Trump's plans, and a judge will consider whether to block the buyout offer at a hearing Thursday afternoon in Boston.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a scam and not a buyout,\u201d said Everett Kelley, president of the American Federation of Government Employees.",

However, she said there were too many red flags, such as a clause waiving the right to sue if the government failed to honor its side of the deal.",
      "Trump put Musk, the world's richest man, in charge of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, which is a sweeping initiative to reduce the size and scope of the federal government.

It\u2019s one of the many tools that he\u2019s using to try to achieve the campaign promise to bring reform to the civil service and changes to D.C.\u201d",
      "The issue was also discussed during a meeting with Department of Agriculture employees, according to another recording obtained by the AP. Marlon Taubenheim, a human resources official, acknowledged that \u201cthese are very trying times\u201d and \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of stress.\u201d",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, we don\u2019t have all the answers,\u201d he said.",

      "For those who remain, she said, \"we\u2019ll just keep plugging along.\u201d",
      "Assurances from administration officials have not alleviated concerns across a range of agencies. Some federal workers said they did not trust the validity of the offers, doubting that Trump has the authority to disburse money. Others point to his record of stiffing contractors as a New York real estate mogul.",
      "Scattered protests have sprung up outside federal buildings, including on Tuesday at the Office of Personnel Management.",

      "Mary-Jean Burke, a physical therapist for the Department of Veterans Affairs in Indianapolis, said she's worried that too many people will leave, jeopardizing health care services.",
      "Burke, who also serves as a union official, said doubts have also been growing over whether to take the offer.",
      "\u201cOriginally, I think people were like, \u2018I\u2019m out of here,'\" she said. But then they saw a social media post from DOGE, which said employees can \"take the vacation you always wanted, or just watch movies and chill, while receiving your full government pay and benefits.\u201d",
      "The message backfired because \"that kind of thing sounded a little bit too good to be true and people were hesitant,\u201d Burke said.",
      "Either way, she said, Trump has achieved his apparent goal of shaking up the federal workforce.",
      "\u201cEvery day, it\u2019s something,\u201d Burke said. \u201cIf he signed up to be a disrupter, he\u2019s doing it.\u201d",

      "A U.S. military plane carrying 104 deported Indian migrants arrived Wednesday in a northern Indian city, the first such flight to the country as part of a crackdown ordered by the Trump administration.",
      "The lawmakers and media reports said the deportees\u2019 arms and legs were shackled while on the aircraft. Parliament's proceedings were adjourned Thursday as the lawmakers chanted slogans and demanded a discussion about the deportation.",
      "Renuka Chowdhury, a lawmaker in the Congress party, said the deportees were \u201chandcuffed, had their legs chained and even struggled to use the washroom.\u201d",
      "Her colleague, Gaurav Gogoi, called it \u201cdegrading.\u201d",
      "Parliament Speaker Om Birla tried to calm the lawmakers, saying the transportation of the deportees was a matter of U.S. foreign policy and that the U.S. \"also has its own rules and regulations.\u201d",
      "One deportee, Jaspal Singh, said their handcuffs and leg chains were taken off only at the Amritsar airport in India.",
      "Singh, 36, said they initially thought they were being taken to another camp in the U.S and only found out about their deportation once on the plane. \u201cThe flight was into 8-9 hours and an officer informed (us) that we are being deported\u201d to India, he said.",
      "The U.S. government usually carries out deportations on commercial and chartered flights. The use of the U.S. military to return people to their home country is a relatively new method that started under the Trump administration.",
      "Opposition lawmakers, including Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, also protested outside the Parliament as they demanded a response from the government. Some wore handcuffs and carried placards that read: \u201cHumans, not prisoners.\u201d",
      "\u201cIndians deserve Dignity and Humanity, NOT Handcuffs,\u201d Gandhi wrote on the social media platform X.",
      "He uploaded a video showing another deportee, Harvinder Singh, as saying they were handcuffed and their feet chained for 40 hours. \"We were not allowed to move an inch from our seats. It was worse than hell,\u201d he said.",
      "Later Thursday, India\u2019s External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar told the Parliament's upper house that U.S. regulations allow for the use of restraints since 2012, both on military and civilian flights. He said the U.S. authorities have informed them that women and children are not restrained.",
      "\u201cThere has been no change, I repeat, no change, from past procedure for the flight undertaken by the U.S.\u201d on Wednesday, he said.",
      "Jaishankar said while the government was engaging the U.S. authorities to \u201censure that the returning deportees are not mistreated,\" India's focus should be on the crackdown on the illegal migration.",
      "Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is to visit Washington next week. President Donald Trump and Modi discussed immigration in a phone call last week and Trump stressed the importance of India buying more American-made security equipment and fair bilateral trade.",
      "A spokesperson at the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi said enforcing immigration laws was critical for the country's national security and public safety.",
      "\"It is the policy of the United States to faithfully execute the immigration laws against all inadmissible and removable aliens,\u201d Christopher Elms said.",
      "New Delhi says it opposes illegal immigration, mainly because it is linked to several forms of organized crime, and it has not objected to the U.S. deporting its citizens.",
      "Recent years have seen a jump in the number of Indians attempting to enter the U.S. along the U.S.-Canada border. The U.S. Border Patrol arrested more than 14,000 Indians on the Canadian border in the year ending Sept. 30, which amounted to 60% of all arrests along that border and more than 10 times the number two years ago.",
      "Media reports indicate that Indians living in the U.S. without papers are mainly from Punjab and Gujarat states. Indians accounted for about 3% of all illegal border crossings in the U.S. in 2024.",

      "A federal judge in Boston will consider a request from 18 states to block President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order ending birthright citizenship for the children of parents who are in the U.S. illegally",
      "BOSTON -- A federal judge in Boston on Friday will consider a request from 18 state attorneys general to block President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order ending birthright citizenship for the children of parents who are in the U.S. illegally.",
      "The hearing comes after a federal judge in Seattle blocked the order Thursday and decried what he described as the administration\u2019s treatment of the Constitution, saying Trump was trying to change it with an executive order. The Seattle ruling in a lawsuit brought by four states and an immigrant rights group followed one by a Maryland federal judge, who on Wednesday issued a nationwide pause on the order in a separate but similar case.",
      "In the Boston case, the state attorneys general, along with the cities of San Francisco and Washington, are asking Judge Leo Sorokin to issue a preliminary injunction.",
      "They argue that the principle of birthright citizenship is \u201censhrined in the Constitution\u201d and that Trump does not have the authority to issue the order, which they called a \u201cflagrantly unlawful attempt to strip hundreds of thousands of American-born children of their citizenship based on their parentage.\u201d",

      "Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba didn\u2019t skimp on the legwork as he prepared for his meeting with President Donald Trump",
      "WASHINGTON -- Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba didn't skimp on the legwork as he prepared for his first meeting with President Donald Trump.",
      "He huddled this week with SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, two executives Trump recently hosted at the White House. He sought advice from his immediate predecessor, Fumio Kishida.",
      "Ishiba even called on the widow of Shinzo Abe, the Japanese prime minister with whom Trump bonded over rounds of golf during his first term.",
      "\u201cIt will be our first face-to-face talks, so I would like to focus on building a personal relationship of trust between the two of us,\u201d Ishiba told reporters before heading to Washington for his White House visit, taking place Friday.",
      "It's a tall order for Ishiba to replicate Trump's relationship with Abe, who resigned as prime minister in 2020 and was assassinated by a gunman as he delivered a campaign speech in 2022. Nevertheless, Ishiba is making it a priority to connect with Trump.",
      "Ishiba, who took office in October, will be just the second world leader to visit the White House during Trump's new term. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu earlier this week was the first hosted by Trump.",
      "Ishiba arrived Thursday evening for his roughly 24-hour visit to Washington. He's expected to spend a little more than two hours with Trump for a working lunch and a joint news conference before making the return trip to Tokyo.",
      "Still, making the whirlwind journey is essential for Ishiba as he looks to ensure that the U.S. and Japan stay on solid footing with the return of Trump and his \u201cAmerica First\u201d worldview. Both countries have been challenged by China's growing economic and military assertiveness in the Pacific and concerns about a nuclear-armed North Korea.",
      "Ishiba will also look to remind Trump \u2014 who has proposed tariffs on both friends and foes in an effort to boost American manufacturing \u2014 about the long-running U.S.-Japan alliance. Japanese companies employ nearly 1 million Americans and have held the top spot for cumulative foreign direct investment into the U.S. over the last five years.",
      "Another sensitive issue Ishiba is prepared to address is Japan's Nippon Steel's efforts to win approval for a $14.1 billion acquisition of the Pittsburgh-headquartered U.S. Steel. President Joe Biden before leaving office last month blocked the deal, citing national security concern. Trump in December said he was \u201ctotally against the once great and powerful U.S. Steel being bought by a foreign company.\u201d",
      "Ishiba isn't necessarily planning on bringing up the deal but has prepped to make a fulsome case for Nippon if Trump raises it, according to a Japanese government official who insisted on anonymity to discuss the leader's private deliberations.",
      "Nippon and U.S. Steel have filed a lawsuit aimed at overturning the blocking of the deal. And Nippon has stepped up its public push, arguing the \u201ctransaction is in line with President Trump\u2019s focus\u201d on manufacturing and \u201ccontributes to President Trump\u2019s goals promoting U.S. investment, creating U.S. jobs, and strengthening U.S. manufacturing.\u201d",
      "Defense spending is also expected to be on the leaders' agenda. Japan has pledged to raise defense spending to 2% of GDP by 2027, or 60% over five years. That level of spending meets the benchmark set for members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Japan cooperates with the NATO alliance but is not a member.",
      "But Trump is pressing NATO and other allies to spend even more on defense, challenging them to raise spending to 5% of their overall economic output \u2014 a benchmark that will be difficult for countries to reach.",
      "Ishiba could remind Trump that Japan is a big supporter of the U.S. defense industry, spending billions of dollars on fighter jets and missile defense systems to try to salve any concerns from the Republican president.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump is actually a good listener, too. Perhaps we (will) have a good chemistry,\u201d Ishiba told reporters earlier this week.",
      "Ishiba invited SoftBank's Son and OpenAI's Altman to his office this week as he prepped for his Trump meeting. The U.S. president last month brought Son, Altman and Oracle CEO Larry Ellison to the White House to spotlight a $500 billion investment for infrastructure tied to artificial intelligence by the three executives' companies.",
      "Ishiba during his meeting told them that he wants Japan and the United States to deepen cooperation in AI to make the world a more peaceful and safer place.",
      "\u201cI think Prime Minister Ishiba certainly sees this is an important and critical opportunity for him to reestablish what were exceptional bonds between President Trump and Japan in the first Trump administration,\u201d said Sen. Bill Hagerty, a Tennessee Republican who served as Trump's ambassador to Japan during his first administration.",
      "Abe was among the few world leaders who developed a bond with Trump during his first term.",
      "Abe built a rapport with Trump over rounds of golf and dinners with their wives at the president's Palm Beach, Florida, resort, Mar-a-Lago. During Trump's 2019 state visit to Japan, Abe took Trump to a sumo wrestling match and arranged for him to be the first leader to meet with Japan's newly enthroned emperor.",
      "Abe and Trump's tight bond was all the more remarkable, because Trump early in his first White House term threatened a \u201cbig border tax\u201d on Japanese automaker Toyota if it built a plant in Mexico and derided Japan for what he deemed insufficient defense spending.",
      "Hagerty, at an event at Washington's Hudson Institute on Thursday, said it might not be a bad idea for Ishiba \u2014 who golfed in high school but has since given up the sport \u2014 to dust off his clubs as he looks to bond with Trump.",
      "\u201cI hope that he takes the golf lessons back up again,\" Haggerty said, \u201cbecause I found golf diplomacy to be a wonderful opportunity for us.\u201d",

      "New York City is trying to deter dangerous \u201csubway surfing\u201d through education programs, but some transportation advocates and lawmakers say it's not enough",
      "NEW YORK -- Ka\u2019Von Wooden loved trains. The 15-year-old had an encyclopedic knowledge of New York City\u2019s subway system and dreamed of becoming a train operator.",
      "Instead, on a December morning in 2022, Ka\u2019Von died after he climbed to the roof of a moving J train in Brooklyn and then fell onto the tracks as it headed onto the Williamsburg Bridge.",
      "He is one of more than a dozen New Yorkers, many young boys, who have been killed or badly injured in recent years while attempting to \u201csubway surf,\u201d a practice that dates back a century but has been supercharged by social media.",
      "Authorities have tried to address the problem with public awareness campaigns and by deploying drones to catch thrill-seekers in the act. But for some, a more fundamental question is not being addressed: Why are kids like Ka\u2019Von able to climb on top of subway cars in the first place?",
      "\u201cWhen Ka\u2019Von died ... literally two weeks later, another child died. And another one. That makes no sense,\u201d his mother, Y\u2019Vonda Maxwell, told The Associated Press, saying transit and law enforcement officials haven\u2019t done enough. \u201cWhy should my child have not been the end?\u201d",
      "Making trains harder to climb, and train surfers more easy to detect with cameras and sensors, could be part of the solution, some experts say. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which operates the subway system, has said it is studying the issue. But it has yet to come forward with proposals to use technology or physical barriers that might make it harder for people to get on top of trains.",
      "Six people died surfing subway trains in the city last year, up from five in 2023.",
      "Tyesha Elcock, the MTA worker who operated the train Ka\u2019Von rode the day he died, is among those who thinks more should be done to prevent deaths.",
      "The first sign of trouble that day was when the train\u2019s emergency brake kicked in, she said.",
      "Elcock discovered Ka'Von's body between the train's seventh and eighth cars. A group of sad-faced teens on the train made it clear what had happened. \u201cDid y\u2019all leave your friend back there?\" she asked them.",
      "Elcock said another operator traveling in the opposite direction saw Ka\u2019Von on the train's roof and reported it over a radio. Because of patchy radio service, she said, she didn't get the warning.",
      "But she thinks an even simpler solution could have saved Ka\u2019Von\u2019s life: locking the doors at the ends of subway cars. That would cut off access to the narrow gaps between train cars where subway surfers use handholds to hoist themselves onto the roof.",
      "\u201cLock it when we\u2019re in service so people can\u2019t climb up and be on top of the train,\u201d Elcock said.",
      "The MTA's leaders have said that they looking into possible ways to prevent subway surfing, including engineering solutions, but the agency declined to make any of its safety experts available for an interview.",
      "In 2023, Richard Davey, then the head of buses and subways for the MTA, said officials were \u201cweighing\u201d the option of locking doors between cars \u2014 which is now done only on a handful of 1980s-era trains. But he said that locking doors \u201cbrings its own risk.\u201d Some New Yorkers have complained that locking the passageways between train cars might prevent them from escaping to another part of the train during an emergency.",
      "Under questioning from City Council members and reporters last year, MTA officials ruled out some other physical interventions, including building more barriers to prevent access to tracks, or putting covers over the gaps between train cars to prevent would-be surfers from climbing up.",
      "\u201cListen, you have to be able to do work on top of a train car,\u201d MTA CEO Janno Lieber said at a news conference, adding that you can\u2019t \u201ccover it with barbed wire.\u201d",
      "The MTA has asked social media companies to take down videos glamorizing subway surfing. It's also promoted public service announcements telling people to \u201cRide inside, stay alive,\" in voices of local teens.",
      "More than 300,000 New York City school children use the subway to get to and from school each day.",
      "The NYPD reported that arrests of alleged subway surfers rose to 229 last year, up from 135 the year before. Most were boys, with an average age of around 14, according to police. The youngest was 9 years old.",
      "Branislav Dimitrijevic, an engineering professor of the New Jersey Institute of Technology, said retrofitting trains to prevent roof access would be expensive.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s so many stories in transportation where things can be fixed, but they cost a lot of money. And then you ask the public, \u2019Are you willing to (pay) for us to fix this? But your taxes would go up tremendously.\u2019 And people say \u2018no,\u2019\u201d Dimitrijevic said.",
      "Dimitrijevic suggested the MTA might be able to install cameras and use artificial intelligence to detect riders trying to climb a train. Andrew Alpert, a non-voting member of the MTA board, said he has been asking the agency about the plausibility of physical sensors but hasn\u2019t gotten a response.",
      "The NYPD has patrolled popular subway surfing routes with drones, but the missions can\u2019t be everywhere at once.",
      "Trains in some other cities, such as Hong Kong and Dubai, aren\u2019t easily climbable. They have streamlined bodies, lack handles on the outside and don\u2019t open between cars.",
      "Some rail systems have resorted to extreme tactics to keep people from riding on top of trains. In Indonesia, railway officials once installed hanging metal flails to try and deter passengers from riding atop train cars to avoid overcrowding. They also tried spraying riders with red paint and hitting them with brooms.",
      "The MTA recently purchased a few new subway cars that don\u2019t have the outdoor gaps exploited by subway surfers, but they represent just a sliver of the number currently in service, and won\u2019t be deployed on lines popular for surfing anytime soon.",

      "NEW ORLEANS -- The archbishop of New Orleans' Catholic Church denies he ousted top leadership at a church-affiliated food bank in Louisiana for refusing to redirect millions of dollars to support clergy sexual abuse settlements, according to a video statement he published this week.",
      "Two fired board members have issued statements saying they were removed last week by Archbishop Gregory Aymond of the Archdiocese of New Orleans after resisting pressure to channel as much as $16 million to support the church's long-running bankruptcy negotiations with hundreds of sexual abuse survivors.",
      "The Second Harvest Food Bank of Greater New Orleans and Acadiana says that it provides upwards of 39 million pounds of food and groceries to hundreds of thousands of families across South Louisiana annually.",
      "CEO Natalie Jayroe, who led the organization for 19 years before being fired, \u201cresolutely refused to reallocate donor funds that are solely intended to help alleviate hunger and food insecurity in south Louisiana,\u201d according to a Jan. 30 statement by dismissed board chair Bert Wilson issued via a public relations firm.",
      "Jayroe did not respond to a request for comment sent via LinkedIn Wednesday.",
      "Wilson expressed \u201ctremendous sympathy\u201d for survivors of clergy abuse but said that taking money from the food bank would be \u201cas morally inappropriate as it is legally unsubstantiated,\u201d based on agreements with donors.",
      "Aymond said he rejected \u201cthe characterizations of the archdiocese as stealing money from the hungry\" in a video posted on his Facebook page Monday.",
      "Aymond said members of the Second Harvest board had repeatedly asked him to withdraw from his position overseeing the nonprofit. The archbishop has the sole power to remove Second Harvest executives and board members, according to the nonprofit\u2019s articles of incorporation, viewed by The Associated Press.",
      "The $16 million was \u201cdiscussed in theory and conversation\u201d as a means for Second Harvest to purchase assets owned by the church and \u201ccompletely separate itself,\u201d Aymond said.",
      "He said the decision to remove the CEO and board members was made because they refused to sign a \u201ctolling agreement\u201d that shielded third-party entities affiliated with the Catholic Church from liability during the bankruptcy negotiations, adding that the deadline to sign was Jan. 31.",
      "In response to Aymond's video, fired board member Nick Karl contended the deadline to sign, set by a court, was actually May 1 and that the Second Harvest executive team had been in the process of reviewing it.",
      "\u201cThat the Archdiocese jumped the gun by terminating three longtime board members and the non-profit\u2019s CEO speaks volumes regarding their motivations,\u201d Karl said.",
      "He said the archbishop made no commitment against drawing on Second Harvest funds to help settle the church's bankruptcy claims in the future.",

Second Harvest's priority is to \u201censure day-to-day operations will remain on schedule and services will continue uninterrupted,\u201d Aymond and Wild said in a joint statement released last week.",
      "Wild did not respond to text messages or phone calls requesting comment Wednesday. Archdiocese of New Orleans Communications Director Sarah McDonald declined to comment.",

      "Aymond has rebuffed calls by survivors of abuse to resign as the New Orleans church has faced federal investigations and scrutiny over its failure to take action on credible allegations against priests going back decades. An investigation by The Associated Press also exposed the role of executives with the NFL's New Orleans Saints in helping the church engage in damage control.",

      "President Donald Trump says he thinks last week\u2019s deadly collision between a passenger jet and Army helicopter wouldn't have happened if the U.S. had a more modern air traffic control computer system",
      "President Donald Trump on Thursday blamed the deadly collision of a passenger jet and Army helicopter last week on what he called an \u201cobsolete\u201d computer system used by U.S. air traffic controllers.",
      "He vowed to replace it after NTSB officials told members of Congress that advanced surveillance technology available on the helicopter was turned off.",
      "Trump said during an event that \u201ca lot of mistakes happened\u201d on Jan. 29 when an American Airlines flight out of Wichita, Kansas, collided with an Army helicopter as the plane was about to land at Ronald Reagan National Airport near Washington, killing all 67 people on board the two aircraft.",
      "Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz said Thursday that NTSB officials in a briefing told senators that the helicopter's Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) \u2014 an aviation surveillance technology that transmits aircraft location and other data to air traffic control and other aircraft \u2014 was off.",
      "\u201cThe reason for turning it off does not seem justified,\" Cruz said. \"And in this instance, this was a training mission, so there was no compelling national security reason for ADS-B to be turned off.\u201d",
      "NTSB officials also told media outlets that the helicopter crew was likely wearing night vision goggles.",
      "In the immediate aftermath of the tragedy, Trump blamed it on diversity hiring programs. But on Thursday, he blamed the computer system used by the country's air traffic controllers.",
      "During a speech at the National Prayer Breakfast at the U.S. Capitol, Trump said the U.S. spent billions of dollars trying to \u201crenovate an old, broken system\u201d instead of investing in a new one. He said in his private jet, he uses a system from another country when he lands because his pilot says the existing system in the U.S. is obsolete.",
      "\u201cI think what is going to happen is we\u2019re all going to sit down and do a great computerized system for our control towers,\u201d he said.",
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy and Elon Musk said in posts on X that Musk's team at the Department of Government Efficiency is going to help rapidly upgrade the nation\u2019s aviation safety system.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration has been working since the mid-2000s to upgrade the air traffic control system through its NextGen program.",
      "Federal officials have been raising concerns about an overtaxed and understaffed air traffic control system for years, especially after a series of close calls between planes at U.S. airports. Among the reasons they have cited for staffing shortages are uncompetitive pay, long shifts, intensive training and mandatory retirements.",
      "Trump said that if the nation had a newer system, alarms would have sounded when the Black Hawk helicopter, which was on a training exercise, reached the same altitude as the plane.",
      "But an FAA report after the crash said that the controller did get an alert that the plane and helicopter were converging when they were still more than a mile (1.6 kilometers) apart. The controller responded by asking the helicopter if it had the plane in sight and directed the helicopter to pass behind the plane. The helicopter responded that it did have the plane in sight.",
      "The FAA made it clear Thursday it is going to ensure that helicopters and planes will no longer share the same airspace over the Potomac River.",
      "An early focus of the investigation has been confirming the altitude of the plane and helicopter. The jet\u2019s flight recorder showed its altitude as 325 feet (99 meters), plus or minus 25 feet (7.6 meters).",
      "Data from the airport\u2019s air traffic control system suggests the helicopter was above its 200-foot (61-meter) flight ceiling. The screen the controller was looking at that night showed that based on radar and other data, the helicopter was at 300 feet (91 meters), the NTSB said, noting that the figure would have been rounded to the nearest 100 feet (30 meters).",
      "To get more precise information, investigators need to be able to examine the wreckage of the Black Hawk. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said Thursday afternoon that all major components of the helicopter and jet have been removed from the river. Salvage crews will work to remove smaller debris with baskets over the next 10 days before finishing work on Feb. 16.",
      "\u201cWe will continue pushing forward in the coming days until we are confident the river is safe for navigation and that elements of evidentiary value are recovered and provided to the appropriate authorities,\u201d the Corps Baltimore District Commander Col. Francis Pera said.",
      "This crash was the deadliest in the U.S. since Nov. 12, 2001, when a jet slammed into a New York City neighborhood just after takeoff, killing all 260 people on board and five on the ground.",
      "There was concern after the crash that Trump's efforts to slash the size of the federal workforce could worsen the shortage of air traffic controllers if some of them accepted the deferred resignation offers sent to all federal employees last week. But air traffic controllers were told by their union Thursday that certain positions within the Federal Aviation Administration, including theirs, were exempt.",
      "The National Air Traffic Controllers Association said in its email to members that additional positions might be exempt based on the employees\u2019 \u201cnational security or public safety responsibilities.\u201d The union had already recommended to its members that they reject the offers, which were extended the day before the midair collision.",

      "The former interpreter for baseball star Shohei Ohtani is expected to be sentenced for bank and tax fraud",
      "LOS ANGELES -- The former interpreter for Japanese baseball star Shohei Ohtani is expected to be sentenced Thursday for bank and tax fraud after he stole nearly $17 million from the Los Angeles Dodgers player\u2019s bank account.",
      "Federal prosecutors are seeking a prison sentence of four years and nine months for Ippei Mizuhara, who was supposed to bridge the gap between Ohtani and his English-speaking teammates and fans as the duo traveled from Southern California to ballparks across the U.S. Instead, Mizuhara exploited the Japanese-English language barrier to isolate Ohtani and profit from his proximity to the two-way player \u2019s power.",
      "Mizuhara is scheduled to appear in federal court in the Orange County city of Santa Ana. He pleaded guilty last year to bank and tax fraud after he was accused of stealing money to cover his growing gambling bets and debts with an illegal bookmaker, in addition to $325,000 worth of baseball cards and his own dental bills.",
      "The case affected arguably the world\u2019s most famous baseball player \u2014 who previously pitched for the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim \u2014 and stoked an international media frenzy. It stemmed from a broader probe into illegal sports bookmaking organizations in Southern California and the laundering of proceeds through casinos in Las Vegas that has netted a dozen defendants.",
      "\u201cHis years-long theft of funds from Mr. Ohtani and the myriad lies he told to Mr. Ohtani\u2019s agents and financial advisors to cover up his theft represent a calculated betrayal of the very person he was hired to help,\u201d prosecutors wrote in court papers.",
      "They want Mizuhara to pay $17 million in restitution to Ohtani and $1 million to the Internal Revenue Service.",
      "In a letter to the court, Mizuhara described his financial strain and addiction to gambling, which he had hoped would alleviate his money problems. He also professed his admiration of Ohtani, and his remorse.",
      "\u201cI am asking for a little mercy from the court concerning my sentence you will hand down,\u201d Mizuhara wrote. \u201cI truly admire Shohei as a baseball player and a human being and I was committed to devote my life so Shohei can be the best version of himself on the field. I want to say I am truly sorry for violating his trust in me.\u201d",
      "Mizuhara accessed Ohtani\u2019s account beginning in 2021 and changed its security protocols so he could impersonate him to authorize wire transfers. By 2024, Mizuhara had used the money to buy about $325,000 worth of baseball cards at online resellers and had bet tens of millions of dollars that weren\u2019t his to wager on international soccer, the NBA, the NFL and college football.",
      "Prosecutors said Mizuhara never bet on baseball, and Ohtani was an unknowing victim of the scheme.",
      "\u201cLet there be no doubt, Mr. Ohtani is truly a victim and has suffered, and will continue to suffer, harm from defendant\u2019s conduct,\u201d prosecutors wrote.",
      "Michael G. Freedman, Mizuhara's attorney, wrote in court filings that his client is a gambling addict who made a \u201cterrible mistake\u201d and has suffered from a loss of a job and reputation. Mizuhara takes responsibility for his actions and expects to be deported to his native Japan after serving time, Freedman wrote while asking for a sentence of one and a half years.",
      "Mizuhara was born in Japan and moved to California with his parents when he was 6. He struggled to learn English but eventually did, and he returned to Japan in 2013 to become an interpreter for a Japanese baseball team and later for Ohtani, according to court filings.",
      "The two formed a tight-knit bond, and Mizuhara moved with Ohtani in 2018 to the U.S., where he took on numerous errands for the player such as grocery shopping, Freedman wrote.",
      "Inside baseball, Mizuhara stood by Ohtani\u2019s side for many of the athlete's career highlights, from serving as his catcher during the Home Run Derby at the 2021 All-Star Game, to being there for his two American League MVP wins and his record-shattering $700 million, 10-year deal with the Los Angeles Dodgers.",
      "Off the field, Mizuhara was Ohtani\u2019s friend and confidant. He famously resigned from the Los Angeles Angels during the 2021 MLB lockout so he could keep speaking to Ohtani, and he was rehired after a deal was struck.",
      "Last year, Ohtani and the Dodgers won the World Series, and the baseball star won his third Most Valuable Player award."

    "story": [
      "U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor has renewed her attack on a ruling by the court's conservative majority that afforded broad immunity to President Donald Trump",
      "LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor said her conservative colleagues are risking the court's legitmacy with decisions affording President Donald Trump broad immunity and overturning longstanding precedents on other issues.",
      "In her first public comments since Trump began his second term in the White House, Sotomayor told a Kentucky audience that the court has gone too far, too fast on a range of issues. She cited the Trump case during a lengthy response to a question about sagging public confidence in the court.",
      "Sotomayor issued a stinging dissent in that case, and she didn't hold back Wednesday night in discussing public perceptions of the court following its historic 6-3 decision on the immunity question. The court\u2019s conservative majority, with three justices appointed by Trump in his first term, ruled for the first time that former presidents have broad immunity from prosecution.",
      "\u201cIf we as a court go so much further ahead of people, our legitimacy is going to be questioned,\" Sotomayor said during the event in Louisville. \u201cI think the immunity case is one of those situations. I don\u2019t think that Americans have accepted that anyone should be above the law in America. Our equality as people was the foundation of our society and of our constitution.\u201d",
      "In her dissent last year, which she read aloud in the courtroom, Sotomayor said the court's majority allowed a president to become a \u201cking above the law\u201d in its ruling that limited the scope of criminal charges against Trump for his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol and efforts to overturn the election.",
      "She renewed her objections while discussing the case to the Louisville audience.",
      "\u201cOur constitution itself has provisions not exempting the president from criminal activity after an impeachment,\u201d she said. \"So I had a hard time with the immunity case. And if we continue going in directions that the public is going to find hard to understand, we\u2019re placing the court at risk.\u201d",
      "Earlier in her answer to the question about lagging public confidence in the court, Sotomayor pointed to her conservative colleagues' willingness to upend decades-old precedents.",
      "\u201cI think my court would probably gather more public support if it went a little more slowly in undoing precedent,\u201d Sotomayor said.",
      "Other seismic shifts made by the high court in recent years have included overturning Roe v. Wade to end nationwide protections for abortion rights, and striking down affirmative action in college admissions.",
      "Sotomayor said precedent-busting rulings have become more frequent, and she focused on the public fallout from courts going too far too fast.",
      "\u201cI think that creates instability in the society, in people\u2019s perception of law and people\u2019s perception of whether we\u2019re doing things because of legal analysis or because of partisan views,\" she said. \u201cWhether those views are accurate or not, I don\u2019t accuse my colleagues of being partisan.\u201d",
      "She said they \u201cgenuinely have a belief in a certain way of looking at the Constitution.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd I understand, in good faith, that they think that that belief better promotes our democracy,\u201d she said. \"But whether that\u2019s true or not is irrelevant if people are feeling insecure in the changes that they\u2019re instituting at a pace that they can\u2019t absorb.\u201d",
      "Sotomayor spent more than an hour answering questions from the the dean of the University of Louisville law school. The justice received the law school\u2019s Brandeis Medal, presented to people in the legal profession for their work advancing public service and their devotion to economic, social or political justice. UofL\u2019s law school is named for Louis D. Brandeis, a former Supreme Court justice from Louisville.",

      "A federal scientific publication has returned from a forced two-week hiatus with two papers examining the health effects of wildfires in Hawaii and California",
      "NEW YORK -- A federal scientific publication on Thursday returned from a forced two-week hiatus with two papers examining the health effects of wildfires in Hawaii and California.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention resumed the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, which the Trump administration suspended as part of a \u201cpause\u201d on regulations, guidance, announcements, press releases, social media posts and website posts.",
      "The CDC has gradually restarted some communications and reports, but the silencing of MMWR, as it it known, prompted a chorus of concern from public health leaders and some legislators.",
      "\u201cOutbreaks are not contained because scientists are ordered to stop talking about them,\u201d Sen. Dick Durbin, a Democrat from Illinois, said in a Wednesday night statement calling for the publication to be restarted.",
      "MMWR issues typically run 20 to 25 pages and contain four or more reports about disease investigations, health trends or other public health developments. Thursday\u2019s publication was slimmer than usual: just over eight pages, with two short reports.",
      "One of the reports was about last year's Maui wildfire. Researchers measured the blood of responding firefighters, looking for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS. The manmade chemicals have been linked to cancer and other health problems.",
      "Previous studies have shown firefighters have higher concentrations of some PFAS in their blood. Thousands of firefighters have sued manufacturers and companies that make firefighting gear and foam, seeking damages for their exposure.",
      "The new study looked at about 180 firefighters and 80 other county employees. It found the firefighters' blood had higher concentrations of some PFAS, but most were still at levels below a medical threshold that triggers the need for further testing. The researchers had no baseline measurements of the people in the study from before the 2023 fire, so it's hard to know if blaze contributed, the authors acknowledged.",
      "The second article looked at hospital emergency department visits during last month's Los Angeles wildfires. It found visits decreased 9% over the first six days of the wildfires.",
      "That's consistent with other research that has shown declines in ER visits immediately after natural disasters. The drop may be due to evacuations that caused people to leave Los Angeles or to get medical care from places other than hospitals. Information from hospitals in surrounding counties was not included in the new report.",
      "Before the journal went on hiatus, the CDC was expected to soon publish articles about the bird flu outbreak. A CDC spokesperson didn't say why the articles weren't published this week but said they \"are still in the pipeline.\u201d",
      "Dr. Tom Frieden, the CDC director during the Obama administration, said he was pleased to see the journal return but also concerned that it \u201cdoesn\u2019t contain any reports on bird flu spreading in animals and people, the new strain of mpox spreading or other emerging health threats.\u201d",
      "Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, said he wants to see meatier issues that have the information that researchers, local health officials and others need \u201cto make data-driven decisions.\u201d",
      "The MMWR has been called \u201cthe voice of the CDC.\u201d Published weekly since 1961, it has for generations been the main way the agency recounted disease investigations, shared public health recommendations and conveyed other health information.",
      "It had never taken a two-week break.",
      "Typically released every Thursday, the journal has more than 147,000 electronic subscribers \u2014 a readership that\u2019s mainly doctors, nurses, educators, researchers and public health scientists.",
      "A paper published in June 1981, about previously healthy gay Los Angeles men who came down with lung infections, turned out to be the first published report documenting the disease that came to be known as AIDS. In April 2009, the journal reported the first two cases of what became known as the H1N1 \u201cswine flu\u201d pandemic.",
      "In 2020, during the first Trump administration, the MMWR became the focus of concerns about political interference with CDC\u2019s scientific work. White House officials believed CDC scientists were undermining Trump by trying to make the COVID-19 pandemic appear worse than it was.",
      "The journal\u2019s editor at the time, Dr. Charlotte Kent, later told Congress that administration officials pressed her to delay publication of at least one article and told her to delete an email that showed political meddling.",
      "\u201cIf political decisions determine which health threats to highlight, we\u2019ll all be less safe,\" said Frieden, president of Resolve to Save Lives, a not-for-profit organization that works on international public health issues. \u201cI hope the new administration will see the value in CDC publishing information on health threats every week, without political interference.\u201d",

      "COLUMBUS, Ohio -- Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose has decided to launch a bid for state auditor in 2026, continuing the recent game of musical chairs among high-ranking Ohio Republicans.",
      "LaRose, one of the state's highest profile politicians, was expected to declare his plans Thursday. With term limits preventing him from seeking another term as the state's elections chief, he had sought the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate last year but lost the three-way primary to the GOP's Bernie Moreno. Moreno went on to defeat incumbent Democrat Sherrod Brown in November.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve always answered the call of duty, and I\u2019ve had a lot of encouragement from across Ohio to consider serving in this important office,\u201d LaRose said in a statement first provided to The Associated Press. \u201cThey\u2019ve asked me to build on what we\u2019ve done in the secretary of state\u2019s office, where we\u2019ve made Ohio a national leader in election administration and economic development by focusing on the highest performance standards.\"",
      "LaRose, 45, a former state senator and U.S. Army Green Beret, is the last of Ohio's five term-limited statewide executive officeholders to make his future plans known.",
      "Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, 78, has signaled he plans to retire when his current term ends at the end of 2026. Attorney General Dave Yost has announced a bid to succeed DeWine and Ohio Auditor Keith Faber has announced a bid to succeed Yost. LaRose is seeking Faber's seat and Ohio Treasurer Robert Sprague will run for LaRose's post.",
      "Sprague dropped a bid for governor on Wednesday, saying he would back former GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy if he runs. Ramaswamy is expected to launch his campaign sometime this month."

      "WASHINGTON -- Newly unsealed documents give one of the most detailed views yet of the evidence gathered on the accused 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, including how prosecutors allege he and others interacted with the hijackers who carried out the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks.",
      "The summaries of evidence released Thursday include Mohammed\u2019s own statements over the years, phone records and other documents alleging coordination between Mohammed and the hijackers, videos included in al-Qaida\u2019s planning for the attacks and prosecutors\u2019 summaries of government simulations of the flights of the four airliners that day. But few other details were given.",
      "Also to be presented are the photos and death certificates of 2,976 people killed that day at the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and in a Pennsylvania field, where the fourth airliner commandeered by the al-Qaida hijackers smashed into the ground after a revolt by passengers.",
      "The newly revealed framework of military prosecutors' potential case against Mohammed, who prosecutors say conceived of and executed much of al-Qaida's attack, is contained in a plea agreement that the Defense Department is battling in court to roll back.",
      "Mohammed and two co-defendants agreed in the plea deal with military prosecutors to plead guilty in the attack in return for life sentences.",
      "The Associated Press, The New York Times, NPR, The Washington Post, Fox News, NBC and Univision are suing to get the plea bargains unsealed. The summaries of the prosecution evidence were released Thursday in a partially redacted version of Mohammed's agreement.",
      "The evidence summaries point to the possibility of additional revelations about the attacks yet to come.",
      "As part of the plea agreement, prosecutors, defense and the senior Pentagon official overseeing the cases at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, agreed to an unusual step \u2014 a hearing that would allow them to make public the evidence compiled against the three.",
      "It appears designed to address complaints from families and others that a plea bargain typically would otherwise keep the evidence from fully being revealed.",
      "Another unusual part of the deal mandated Mohammed to agree to answer questions from the families of victims.",
      "Military prosecutors, defense attorneys and Guantanamo officials negotiated the deal over two years under government auspices. The negotiations were an attempt to bring a resolution to the 9/11 case, which has remained in pretrial hearings for more than two decades since the attacks.",
      "Then-Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin interceded to try to void the plea agreement after it was announced, saying that waiving the possibility of the death penalty in so grave an attack was a decision that defense secretaries should handle.",
      "Federal court hearings in the Defense Department's attempts to roll back the plea agreements are ongoing.",
      "Legal arguments over whether the sustained torture that Mohammed and other 9/11 defendants underwent in CIA custody has rendered their statements in the case inadmissible and has slowed the case. So have repeated staffing changes at the Guantanamo court and the logistical difficulties of holding a trial in a courtroom a plane flight away from the U.S.",

    "story": [
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom will order state officials to advance implementation of a state rule aiming to make homes more fire resistant during wind-driven wildfire after years of delay",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- As Los Angeles reels from deadly January wildfires that destroyed thousands of homes, California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed an order Thursday directing the state to advance long-delayed regulations requiring homeowners in high-risk areas to clear combustible materials around their homes.",
      "Newsom ordered the state to publish draft regulation next month, with a deadline to adopt those rules by the end of the year. The requirements were passed by lawmakers in 2020 and originally set to take effect by Jan. 1, 2023. Newsom signed the order after he returned from Washington to advocate for disaster aid.",
      "The rule requires homeowners to clear materials like dead plants and wooden furniture within 5 feet (1.5 meters) of their homes in fire-prone areas. As multiple fires roared through LA neighborhoods in January, the regulations still weren\u2019t written, and the state Board of Forestry and Fire Protection told The Associated Press last month it had no firm timeline for completing them.",
      "State officials said in a November meeting that the draft language likely won\u2019t be considered by the board until late this year, though the state has already encouraged homeowners to take up the practice of clearing items around their houses on its website.",
      "In response to questions from the AP last month, lawmakers who sponsored the original legislation said they were frustrated by the delay. Experts said it is likely the stringent requirements could have saved some homes from the Palisades Fire, which became the most destructive fire in Los Angeles city history.",
      "Most of the neighborhoods ravaged by the Palisades Fire are in areas that must follow state requirements to keep the immediate surroundings of their homes free of combustible materials and would be subject to the new rules because they are deemed at highest fire risk by the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.",
      "The fire, driven by hurricane-force winds that spread embers by air, destroyed at least 5,000 structures across areas including Pacific Palisades, Malibu and Topanga Canyon.",
      "Under the latest proposal, existing homes would have three years to comply with the regulations, so it is not clear how many homes would have been saved. But clearing the immediate area around homes likely would have made some difference, several experts said.",
      "\u201cThese steps will spur proactive actions to defend the most vulnerable homes and eliminate combustible material within five feet of homes to reduce the risk of a home igniting in an ember-driven fire,\u201d California Natural Resources Secretary Wade Crowfoot said. His agency oversees the board that is responsible for writing the regulations.",
      "The executive order will also direct CalFire to add about 1.4 million acres, or nearly 2,200 square miles (5,700 square kilometers), of land onto the map of fire-prone areas, which will subject homeowners in those areas to the fire mitigation rules. Some cities and homeowners are already taking on the practice voluntarily.",
      "\u201cTo meet the needs of increasingly extreme weather, where decades-old buildings weren\u2019t planned and designed for today\u2019s realities, these proposals are part of a bigger state strategy to build wildfire and forest resilience from forest management, to huge investments in firefighting personnel and equipment, community hardening, and adopting state-of-the-art response technologies,\u201d Newsom said in a statement.",
      "State officials told the AP last month that Newsom has proposed to spend $25 million to ensure homeowners follow the rules and other defensible-space requirements.",
      "The majority of neighborhoods that burned in the Eaton fire, including Altadena and parts of Pasadena, are not on the state\u2019s fire-prone map, so this requirement doesn\u2019t apply to them.",
      "Roy Wright, CEO of the Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety that supported the 2020 law, said he hasn't seen the details of the executive order but was optimistic about the Thursday announcement after years of delay.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing here is a very clear priority from the governor that this needs to move forward,\u201d Wright said. \u201cThe administration is leaning in and says, \u2018Let\u2019s get this done. The people in California need this.'\u201d",
      "California already enforces some of the most stringent defensible-space laws in the West, which require homeowners in fire-prone places to keep the area immediately around their homes free of landscaping and other materials that could catch fire.",
      "The state began requiring homeowners in high-risk areas to clear flammable materials within 30 feet (9 meters) of their houses in the 1960s and then expanded the rules to include areas within 100 feet (30.5 meters) of structures in 2006.",
      "The latest measure creates a new \u201cember-resistant\u201d zone, dubbed \u201czone zero,\u201d that bars things like brush, wooden fencing, furniture, sheds and mulch within 5 feet (1.5 meters) of homes. The idea is to clear all materials that could catch fire from flying embers carried by winds and spread to the structure. State officials and researchers said embers are responsible for 90% of structures destroyed by wildfire.",
      "The zone-zero law passed with bipartisan support after California experienced record-breaking fires in 2017 and 2018, including a fire that wiped out the town of Paradise, destroying more than 17,000 structures and killing 85 people."

      "Volkswagen-backed Scout Motors is making a massive bet in the electric SUV market",
      "BLYTHEWOOD, S.C. -- Volkswagen-backed Scout Motors is making a massive bet in the electric SUV market with a carefully cultivated experience that will allow some customers to buy the company's vehicle in minutes on an app and then use it to handle everything after from repairs to updates and upgrades.",
      "But without some help from lawmakers, that will be impossible in South Carolina, where the company is pouring billions into its new auto plant and a Scout Motors experience like BMW's test track in Greer.",
      "In a world where almost everything can be bought online, automobiles remain an exception. Supporters of the dealership model say the experience allows buyers to compare prices across several businesses.",
      "Unlike a pair of pants, where color, style and size are about the only concerns, buying a car involves financing, state registration, taxes, regulations \u2014 and often a test drive.",
      "South Carolina is one of about two dozen states that ban manufacturers from selling vehicles directly to consumers and instead require all new autos be purchased through a dealer. Scout would like to see that practice changed nationwide for all EV makers and figured it could start in its new backyard.",
      "South Carolina also bans manufacturers from owning their own service centers, which means anyone who wants to own a Scout SUV must travel to another state to have it repaired or serviced.",
      "People who back the dealership structure said online sales could lead to carmakers raising their own prices with less competition.",
      "The dealership structure requires local business owners to back what they sell and assure buyers get quality service on their vehicles. Auto dealers often have close ties to their communities and cities could lose one of their biggest businesses and heftiest taxpayers.",
      "\u201cIf for some reason the car is a lemon or the job isn't getting done, they are the folks who live there, who pay their taxes and send their kids to school,\u201d said Republican Sen. Larry Grooms, who runs the Senate Transportation Committee where any bill changing the rules would likely end up.",
      "Scout is determined to get the law changed to help them as well as other EV makers like Tesla and Rivian. They have gone on a media blitz that includes stories in local outlets. They are also trying to secure support in a Republican-dominated state with an argument that consumers should be free to buy whatever they wish directly, without a middleman.",
      "Scout also is armed with a 2000 Attorney General's Office opinion on the bill which would weeks later would become law and serve as the most recent major overhaul to South Carolina's laws on new car buying.",
      "\u201cIf a manufacturer cannot sell his own product, but must constitutionally pass that product through a \u2018middle man,\u2019 then our understanding of the free market system is way off base. The Internet is a worldwide web for trade, not a local instrument for protectionism,\u201d wrote then-Republican state Attorney General Charlie Condon in the opinion, which is not binding and an educated guess on what a judge might do if someone sued over the law.",
      "Scout officials say using a dealership-only business model would make the vehicles aimed at the under-$60,000 market too expensive and complicate what the company wants to be a seamless experience, from start to finish.",
      "Gov. Henry McMaster touts the Scout plant in Blythewood as one of his biggest economic development scores The Republican has been to both the February 2024 groundbreaking of the massive facility and this month's ceremony to mark work starting on a new $150 million interstate interchange the state is paying for to help get workers, parts and new SUVs in and out.",
      "McMaster recently said he wants to protect dealers, but wants to let Scout sell directly, too.",
      "\u201cOver the last few years with the Internet and Amazon and all the others customers are looking for their freedom and that ability to order things direct without a middleman,\u201d McMaster said.",
      "Scout is trying to find a niche in a growing but uncertain U.S. electric vehicle market. President Donald Trump's election could threaten the industry, both through ending tax credits and tariffs that could raise prices.",
      "The original Scout Motors made gasoline-powered vehicles for about 20 years when it was owned by International Harvester. Production ended in 1980, but their shape and features continue to influence modern SUVs. Scouts have had a niche fanbase of collectors ever since.",
      "The new Scout Motors is trying to tap into a mix of nostalgia and technology. Key to Scout\u2019s success will be its app, Scout Vice President of Growth Cody Thacker said.",
      "He envisions a Scout buyer scrolling through types and colors, performance and comfort options and hundreds of other choices. Financing, titling and paperwork would all be handled in minutes instead of the hours it takes at dealerships. That custom SUV could then be delivered to the buyer's door.",
      "\u201cYou see the point of contention and the huge opportunity,\u201d Thacker said.",
      "Scout's plant in Blythewood, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) north of Columbia, is expected to open in 2027 and employ up to 4,000 people if the company can hit its goal of making and selling 200,000 vehicles per year.",
      "Scout also wants to build by its plant a center where people could test drive vehicles on a company-owned track and take tours. For it to work, the company wants to be able to sell someone a vehicle after they zoom around the site, Thacker said.",
      "South Carolina agreed in 2023 to give Scout more than $1 billion in incentives to land the plant. At the time, the dealership law wasn't on their radar. It came up as executives started looking at their business model, Thacker said.",
      "The company doesn't regret choosing South Carolina and still believes it gave them the best workforce, economic climate and infrastructure. And it will move forward if the law isn't changed selling its vehicles through other states where it can get national licenses sending the money and tax benefits out of the state, Thacker said."

      "Minnesota House Democrats have returned to the state Capitol after reaching a power-sharing agreement with Republicans, ending a stalemate that prevented the chamber from conducting business for more than three weeks",
      "ST. PAUL, Minn. -- Minnesota House Democrats returned to the state Capitol on Thursday after reaching a power-sharing agreement with Republicans, ending a stalemate that prevented the chamber from conducting official business for more than three weeks.",
      "Under the deal, House Republican leader Lisa Demuth, of Cold Spring, will be formally elected as speaker for two years. Demuth, who is Black, will be the chamber's first speaker of color.",
      "All 66 Democrats had boycotted the House since Jan. 14 to prevent a quorum of 68 members needed for the chamber to operate.",
      "After the election, party leaders negotiated a power-sharing deal working on the assumption that the House would be tied 67-67. But in December, a judge ruled that one Democratic candidate didn\u2019t actually live in the district that he won, giving Republicans a temporary one-seat majority. At that point, the agreement fell apart.",
      "A special election to fill the empty seat is scheduled for March 11, and the Democratic candidate is expected to win, restoring the 67-67- tie. Republicans and Democrats will then co-chair most committees, with equal memberships from each party, though the GOP will get to lead and have a majority on a committee dedicated to rooting out fraud in government programs.",
      "As part of the deal, there will be some checks on the speaker's traditionally broad powers. Both parties will have to agree on certain major decisions, such as which bills come to the floor for debate, and Demuth won\u2019t be able to block legislation all by herself.",
      "Demuth said she intends to bring a collaborative leadership style, in contrast to the two previous years when Democrats controlled the state government.",
      "\u201cIt really felt like conservative voices were pushed out,\u201d Demuth said at a news conference. \u201cWhat I would like to do as speaker is recognize how it feels to be in the minority and rule as fairly as possible, recognizing the frustration that can be there, still doing what is needed to be done to uphold the integrity of the institution and not compromise that.\u201d",
      "While Republicans said they won significant concessions in the negotiations, Democrats said the final deal was essentially the same as the one they proposed just before the session.",
      "\"That it took nearly four weeks to reach this agreement is regrettable and was unnecessary. ... We could have avoided all of this, honored the will of the voters, and started in a bipartisan fashion from day one,\" the top House Democrat, former Speaker Melissa Hortman, of Brooklyn Park, told reporters.",
      "The last time the House was tied was in 1979, when party leaders reached a power-sharing agreement after weeks of negotiations. Republicans took the speakership, while Democrats chaired the three most powerful committees. The arrangement worked for most of the session but collapsed in the closing days, and lawmakers needed a one-day special session to finish off the year\u2019s must-pass bills.",
      "According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, tied chambers aren't that unusual and often work out better than expected.",
      "Under the Minnesota deal, House Democrats received GOP assurances that they will not try to unseat a Democrat who won reelection by only 14 votes in a swing district where 20 ballots went missing. An ethics committee will hold a hearing on that race but won't take further action.",
      "The Republican Party of Minnesota ramped up pressure this week by launching a drive to recall all 66 Democratic representatives. The party\u2019s executive director, Jennifer DeJournett, declined to say Monday whether they would drop the recall campaign if House Democrats returned. The state\u2019s recall process is difficult by design and DeJournett estimated the entire process could take 10 months. House GOP leaders said it would be up to the party organization to decide whether to continue."

      "IRVING, Texas -- A historic rebrand of the Boy Scouts of America has been followed by a small uptick in young people joining what will now be called Scouting America, a welcoming sign as the organization tries to move past scandal and bankruptcy.",
      "The group will continue leaning into a broad message of inclusivity as it celebrates its 115th birthday Saturday, president and CEO Roger Krone said. He acknowledged some backlash to the rebrand after it was announced last year but described the overall response as a positive one that generated wider interest.",
      "\u201cThe fact that we were going with a more kind of gender-neutral name, a lot of people kind of wanted to know more about it,\u201d Krone said.",
      "Although the overall gain in membership was small \u2014 about 16,000 new scouts, up less than 2% from the prior year \u2014 it is still encouraging for the organization after participation plummeted during the pandemic. The organization has just over 1 million members.",
      "Krone said Cub Scouts, the youngest scouting level, saw an increase of almost 3%.",
      "Although the majority of scouts are still boys, over 196,000, girls participated in Scouting America\u2019s programs last year. More than 8,000 girls have earned the rank of Eagle Scout.",
      "The name change will officially take effect during the weekend birthday celebration, when sites across the U.S. will be illuminated in red, white and blue, including Niagara Falls and the Empire State Building. A redesigned flag with the Scouting America brand will be raised next week at headquarters in the Dallas suburb of Irving.",
      "The rebrand is among momentous events the tradition-steeped organization has seen over the last decade, including its 2020 bankruptcy filing amid a flood of claims from tens of thousands of people \u2014 mainly men \u2014 who said they were abused as young scouts.",
      "Also, the organization began allowing gay youth in 2013 and ended a blanket ban on gay adult leaders in 2015. And in 2017 it announced that girls would be accepted as Cub Scouts as of 2018 and into the flagship Boy Scout program \u2014 renamed Scouts BSA \u2014 in 2019.",
      "The organization's $2.4 billion bankruptcy reorganization plan took effect in 2023, allowing it to keep operating while compensating sexual abuse survivors. Over 82,000 people filed abuse claims during the bankruptcy case.",
      "To fund the survivors\u2019 settlement trust, which has started making payouts, campgrounds and other properties have been sold, along with works of art including Norman Rockwell paintings depicting idyllic scenes featuring Boy Scouts.",
      "Krone said the organization is working to digitize all its materials, creating a platform that will also allow for programs to be made multilingual. That, for instance, could help a parent who doesn't speak English follow along with their scout, he said.",
      "Wally Tirado, who works closely with scouts in the Dallas area through a Scouting America leadership group, said the diversity among youth members was evident at a recent dinner honoring new Eagle Scouts. He called it a \u201croom full of cultures\" from around the world.",

      "Prosecutors said that on Nov. 27, 1991, Frazier, then 19, broke into Brown\u2019s apartment in Birmingham while she was asleep. Prosecutors said he demanded money and raped Brown at gunpoint after she gave him $80 from her purse. He then shot her in the head, they said, adding he returned later to have a snack and look for money.",
      "Frazier was sentenced to life in prison in Michigan for the 1992 murder of Crystal Kendrick, 14. Then in 1996, an Alabama jury convicted him of murdering Brown and recommended by a vote of 10-2 that he receive a death sentence. Frazier remained in Michigan custody until 2011 when the then-governors of the two states agreed to move him to Alabama\u2019s death row.",
      "Alabama became the first state to conduct nitrogen gas executions, putting three inmates to death last year with that method. It involves placing a respirator gas mask over the person\u2019s face to replace breathable air with pure nitrogen gas, causing death by lack of oxygen.",

      "Once the gas began flowing, Frazier moved his outstretched palms in a swirling circular movement for the first minute or two. At 6:12 p.m. he stopped circling his hands. He appeared to grimace, quiver on the gurney and take a gasping breath. At 6:13 p.m. he raised both legs several inches off the gurney and then lowered them.",

      "Hamm said that he believed that Frazier lost consciousness quickly, noting swirling hand motion hands had stopped. He said he believed other movements, including the raising of the legs and periodic breaths, were involuntary.",
      "A federal judge last week refused to block the execution. Defense attorneys had argued the new method does not work as quickly as the state promised. Media witnesses, including The Associated Press, previously described how those put to death with the method shook on the gurney at the start of their executions.",
      "The judge, however, ruled that the descriptions of the executions did not support a finding that any of the men \u201cexperienced severe psychological pain or distress over and above what is inherent in any execution.\u201d",
      "Some of Brown\u2019s family members witnessed the execution but declined to make a statement to the media.",

      "India's central bank has cut interest rates for the first time in nearly five years to counter slowing growth in Asia's third largest economy.",
      "The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) reduced its repo rate from 6.5% to 6.25%, in line with the expectations of many economists.",
      "The repo rate is the level at which the central bank lends to commercial banks.",
      "The latest cut happens when India's GDP growth is seen slowing to a four year low of 6.7%.",
      "RBI governor Sanjay Malhotra said the bank was keeping its policy stance \"neutral\", which would open more space to support growth, signalling further rate cuts.",
      "Investment growth and urban consumption in the world's fastest growing major economy have been flagging. Corporate profits have also shrunk in the first half of this financial year.",
      "But moderating inflation, an increase in rural demand and good agricultural output will help growth, said Mr Malhotra.",

      "Three former Harrods employees have accused Mohamed Al Fayed's only surviving brother of sexually assaulting them while they were working for the department store.",
      "Speaking publicly for the first time, the women say Ali Fayed, 82, assaulted them in the 1990s when he and his brothers, Mohamed and Salah, owned and ran Harrods.",
      "A spokesperson for Mr Fayed, who lives in the US, said the businessman \"will not be scapegoated\" and he \"unequivocally denies any and all the allegations of wrongdoing\" and that \"the incidents simply never took place\".",
      "Warning: This story contains descriptions of sexual violence",
      "The alleged sexual assaults happened in London, Scotland, Switzerland and the United States. One of the women, a former interior designer for Harrods, says one assault happened on a work trip while she was staying with Ali Fayed and his family at their former home in Connecticut.",
      "\"His hands were everywhere,\" she says, and he stopped because \"one of his little boys started calling for him\".",
      "All three women say prior to Ali Fayed's alleged assaults, they had also been sexually abused by his older brother. Police say 111 women have now made allegations against Mohamed Al Fayed, who added the Arabic \"Al\" prefix to his surname sometime in the 1970s.",
      "One of the women, Amy, has told the BBC she wants \"an explanation\" from Ali Fayed, and an \"understanding of what was going on that can help [her] step forward and begin healing\".",

      "\"This is my chance to finally stand up for myself. I'm not going to be that scared 24-year-old who doesn't know what to do,\" says Frances - who, like Amy, has waived her right to anonymity.",
      "Frances took a job working for Harrods in the store's interior design studio in 1989.",
      "It wasn't long before Mohamed Al Fayed began to bully and sexually abuse her, she says. Frances says she recalls him regularly trying to grab her breasts and grope her while at work, or subjecting her to \"foul\" verbal tirades.",
      "Despite not having much experience, Frances says she was tasked with renovating Mohamed Al Fayed's sprawling Scottish Balnagown Estate, including a farmhouse belonging to his younger brother, Ali.",
      "Frances describes Ali Fayed's demeanour as calmer than that of Mohamed.",
      "\"I think for a moment I thought maybe he would be kinder to me,\" she says. \"But he wasn't.\"",
      "Ali Fayed, like Mohamed, also had a private office and private apartment in 60 Park Lane in central London.",
      "It was in Ali's office where Frances says his sexual abuse started with him \"trying to kiss\" her, followed by him \"groping\" and \"molesting\" her.",
      "She says both the Fayed brothers would regularly give her gifts. \"With Mohamed, it would often be wads of cash, Ali would give jewellery or clothes. It would be a see-saw between abusive behaviour then praise for my work and these lavish items.\"",
      "The abuse escalated in 1992, she says, when she flew to Connecticut to discuss interior design plans with Ali Fayed's wife.",
      "\"It was this huge private house and it was decorated in an English country house style. I don't think I'd ever seen anything like it in my life,\" says Frances.",
      "\"I remember his wife taking me into this picture-perfect American rich town.\"",
      "Frances says she was staying in a guest room at the family's house when Ali Fayed told her to get changed for dinner one evening.",
      "\"I was in the bathroom and got undressed. When I came out in my underwear, he [Ali] was just standing there in the room. I hadn't heard him come in or knock.\"",
      "Frances says Ali Fayed got her on the bed and tried to get on top of her. His hands were \"inside my bra, inside my pants. I knew what his intention was\".",
      "According to Frances the alleged attack stopped when one of Ali's children called out for him. Afterwards, she says she sat on the bed, \"frozen\".",
      "A spokesperson for Ali Fayed said the businessman \"is not a perpetrator\" and will \"robustly defend himself against these unsubstantiated claims\".",
      "When Frances returned to work in London, she says Mohamed Al Fayed \"exploded\" and started \"aggressively spitting abusive words\" because he apparently believed she and Ali had had sex .",
      "She says he told her: \"I'm done with you\u2026 go be with my brother.\"",
      "\"From that point, I'd still see Mohamed, and he'd still call me every name under the sun, but he didn't actually physically abuse me,\" says Frances.",
      "\"Now I was in fear of two of the owners and I knew if I spoke out it would get worse. I could be threatened, I could be fired. I just felt I had to keep on going and, at some point, this horror would pass.\"",
      "'I remember him laughing'",
      "Frances says Ali Fayed sexually assaulted her again later that year on a trip to Balnagown, where she was adding the finishing interior touches to his farmhouse.",
      "Ali called her into his private office, she says, then dragged her onto his lap and started kissing her neck and touching her breasts as he spun around in his chair.",
      "She says she could feel he was aroused through his trousers.",
      "\"I remember him laughing,\" recalls Frances, who says she eventually managed to break free and run out of the room. \"Laughter is meant to be nice. It wasn't. I left him there just laughing at me.\"",
      "Ali Fayed would often try to sexually touch her when they met, she says, \"always laughing and joking and making out it was fun\".",
      "The following year, Frances says she was fired for being in a relationship with another employee, something she says Mohamed Al Fayed forbade among staff. Harrods later settled a case she brought for unfair dismissal.",
      "Frances describes her time after leaving Harrods as \"going underground and shutting myself down\". She struggled to work and trust people and eventually moved away. She says Mohamed and Ali Fayed \"took away\" her confidence and dignity.",
      "\"To this day I suffer with terrible anxiety and panic attacks and I don't like people in my space,\" she says.",
      "Mohamed Al Fayed and his younger brothers bought Harrods in 1985. While Mohamed was the chairman, running day-to-day operations of the luxury department store, Ali Fayed was a director and also helped oversee the House of Fraser group, which they owned in the early 1990s.",
      "The new claims point to the \"breadth of abuse\" by Mohamed Al Fayed and \"raise serious allegations\" against his brother Ali, Harrods told the BBC in a statement.",
      "\"We could not possibly speak on behalf of any individual who can, and should, respond to these allegations directly,\" it added.",
      "The store, which came under new ownership in 2010, said it hoped survivors were looking at \"every appropriate avenue to them in their pursuit of justice, whether that be Harrods, the police or the Fayed family and estate\".",
      "Ali Fayed, who was granted British citizenship in 1999, co-owns luxury British shirtmaker Turnbull and Asser with his sons - but resigned as director on 8 December 2024, 10 days after these allegations were put to him by the BBC.",
      "All three women alleging abuse by Ali Fayed initially spoke to filmmaker Keaton Stone, who has been investigating Mohamed Al Fayed since 2018 and whose work informed the BBC's recent documentary and podcast about Mohamed's predatory behaviour.",
      "Mohamed Al Fayed never faced charges while he was alive, but the women believe his brother Ali should now be investigated by police.",
      "\"Whether any charges would be brought, I don't know, but I believe he should be investigated for what he did,\" says Amy.",
      "She worked as a personal assistant to Mohamed Al Fayed for almost three years, and says he sexually abused her throughout her time at Harrods. The abuse escalated, Amy says, when Mohamed let himself into her room on a work trip to Paris and tried to rape her.",
      "She says she \"endured\" the abuse, thinking \"that was just what being a young woman meant, it was a hazard of the workplace\".",
      "Amy says she remembers Ali Fayed coming into Mohamed's Park Lane office - and also taking phone calls from him. \"He gave me the nickname 'Amy speaking' which he thought was hilarious,\" she recalls. \"He would giggle when he spoke to me.\"",
      "A year or two into the job, Amy says Mohamed told her to go to Switzerland with Ali to help with some personal assistant duties like filing and paperwork.",
      "The pair travelled together on a Harrods private jet, she says, and were driven to the upmarket resort of Gstaad, where the Fayed family owned a ski chalet.",
      "\"Once we got to the chalet, aside from the elderly housekeeper, it was myself and Ali alone for three days. It was strange,\" says Amy. \"No efforts were made to even create something for me to do.\"",
      "The trip was taken out of season and Amy says Ali Fayed seemed bored. He suggested they go to the local public swimming pool, she says, and when they got there it was deserted.",
      "\"That's when Ali's demeanour changed and he became giddy,\" says Amy.",
      "\"He pulled me in under the water, and groped and fondled me, making me feel very, very uncomfortable - very much trapped. I was terrified thinking how am I going to get out of this.\"",
      "Amy says Ali Fayed laughed as he \"groped\" her, before she managed to break free of his clutches.",
      "After the alleged assault, Amy says they both returned to the chalet and she was left alone for the rest of the evening, feeling isolated and afraid.",
      "Like the other two women, Amy didn't tell anyone about the alleged abuse by either of the brothers.",
      "Amy says she didn't want to upset her loved ones and didn't necessarily feel people would believe her.",
      "\"By not saying anything, I think it's a coping technique, to just put it away,\" she adds.",
      "Amy went back to work after the alleged assault took place in Gstaad, but eventually resigned.",
      "She says she \"escaped and ran away\" to work abroad.",
      "\"I wanted to just remove myself from it all\", she says, but \"the trauma\" lived with her.",
      "\"To this day, in certain social situations, I don't want to be noticed, I try to stay invisible,\" she says.",
      "Ali Fayed denies all the allegations of wrongdoing - said his spokesperson - and \"will not allow false accusations to go unchallenged\".",
      "A third woman, who we are calling Laura, told us she recalls Mohamed Al Fayed summoning her to his office and telling her \"with a smirk on his face\" that his brother Ali wanted to see her.",
      "\"I remember it vividly because I had no comprehension of who Ali was, I'd never even seen him,\" she says. \"I don't know how I was spotted or 'selected' for him.\"",
      "Al Fayed's brother Salah also abused us, women sayPolice investigate more people over Al Fayed abuse",
      "Al Fayed's brother Salah also abused us, women say",
      "Police investigate more people over Al Fayed abuse",
      "Laura had been working directly for Mohamed Al Fayed in Harrods' HR department and says his sexual harassment towards her had become commonplace, escalating to two serious sexual assaults.",
      "Laura says Mohamed sent her to their office building in Park Lane one evening, but when she arrived there was no work to be done. She says she was sent through to Ali Fayed's apartment where he was waiting. Laura says he told her they would be having dinner, and then presented her with a bottle of wine from the year she was born and a necklace.",
      "\"I wondered how he knew things about me,\" she says.",
      "Alone in his apartment, Laura says Ali Fayed ordered her through to the bedroom where she says she was subjected to a serious sexual assault. She says she felt \"numbed with fear\" and had to do whatever she was told in order to \"get out of there\".",
      "\"Afterwards he just told me I could go.\"",
      "Laura says she never saw Ali Fayed again but kept the necklace from that night and it has recently been valued at \u00a36,500.",
      "The abuse at Harrods \"took its toll\" says Laura - even after she left the store. She bottled it all up for 25 years, she says, and still hasn't told some of her loved ones what she went through.",
      "All three women are pursuing civil legal action against Harrods through Justice for Harrods Survivors.",
      "\"We applaud the bravery of the women who have spoken out on their allegations against Ali Fayed and reiterate our commitment to securing justice and accountability for all survivors,\" says their barrister Maria Mulla.",
      "\"We repeat, no stone will be left unturned in pursuit of this aim.\"",
      "The BBC spoke to three other women who said they had been either raped, sexually assaulted or trafficked by the other Fayed brother, Salah, who died of pancreatic cancer in 2010.",
      "The women who accuse Ali Fayed question what the three brothers knew about each other's behaviour.",
      "\"Looking back now, maybe they found it amusing to see how far the boundaries were with us between the brothers,\" says Amy. \"Maybe there was competition. I really don't know, but I do feel it was all amusing for them.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 06 Feb 2025 20:17:49 GMT",
    "summary": "Bank boss Andrew Bailey told the BBC it expected to cut rates further but warned the road ahead would be bumpy.",
    "story": [
      "The Bank of England has halved its growth forecast for this year as it cut interest rates to the lowest level for more than 18 months.",
      "The economy is now expected to grow by 0.75% in 2025, the Bank said, down from its previous estimate of 1.5%.",
      "The government has made growing the economy one of its key aims. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer told the BBC he was \"not satisfied with growth\" and the downgraded forecast \"just spurs us on\".",
      "The new forecast came as the Bank cut interest rates to 4.5% from 4.75%. Its governor, Andrew Bailey, said that rates remain on a downward path.",
      "When will interest rates fall?",
      "Low growth and rising prices - it's looking gloomy for the UK",
      "Mr Bailey said the Bank expected to be able to cut rates further \"but we will have to judge meeting by meeting, how far and how fast\".",
      "\"We live in an uncertain world, and the road ahead will have bumps on it,\" he added.",
      "After the rates announcement, the pound slumped, before regaining ground.",
      "Speaking to the BBC, Mr Bailey stressed that the Bank needs to remain \"gradual and careful\" when continuing to cut rates because \"there is a lot more uncertainty\" and because of the predicted rise in inflation.",
      "While it cut its growth forecast for this year, the Bank upgraded its predictions for both 2026 and 2027. The economy is now expected to grow by 1.5% in both of those years, the Bank said, up from 1.25%.",
      "However, it also predicted that higher energy and water bills would push up inflation \"quite sharply\" later this year, and warned there were a number of factors that could affect inflation including possible trade tariffs in the US.",
      "Inflation - the rate at which prices rise - is now expected to rise to 3.7% and take until the end of 2027 to fall back to its 2% target.",
      "Last week, Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced a number of measures to try to boost the UK economy.",
      "However, her decision in last year's Budget to increase employers' National Insurance contributions from April has led to a wave of criticism from businesses, who argue it will push up prices and hit investment and jobs.",
      "Mr Bailey said the impact of the Budget, particularly the looming higher costs of employing people, was feeding through into lower confidence for businesses and households.",
      "\"There's no question that the increase in the cost of employment does have an effect,\" he told the BBC.",
      "\"We're very focused on how that increased cost of employment is going to pass through.\"",
      "Sir Keir told the BBC the government would turn the economy around with a focus on \"build baby build\" and by making \"tough decisions whether on planning, on infrastructure, on nuclear\".",
      "Shadow chancellor Mel Stride said while the rate cut would be good news for many families and businesses, the government's \"disastrous Budget\" was likely to mean fewer rate cuts this year than expected.",
      "Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank, said it was \"very worrying\" for the government that the Bank of England has \"really, quite significantly\" downgraded its forecasts for economic growth.",
      "He added that if the official government forecaster - the Office for Budget Responsibility - changes its forecast in line with the Bank's then \"the chancellor is in big trouble\" when it comes to meeting her self imposed debt rules.",
      "\"That means... the tax revenues the chancellor is relying on are unlikely to come in as expected, and even tougher choices on spending and tax going forward.\"",
      "Mortgage impact",
      "The interest rate cut means that for the 629,000 homeowners on mortgage tracker deals that move in line with the base rate, there will typically be a \u00a329 fall in monthly repayments.",
      "The near 700,000 people on standard variable rate mortgages will have to wait to see if their lender responds.",
      "Those on a fixed mortgage deal will see no immediate change, but there might be cheaper deals available for new and renewing customers.",
      "However, the rate cut is likely to lead to lower returns for savers.",
      "Nicola Price and her husband John have still got 18 months remaining on their current mortgage deal, and welcome lower interest rates as it means they will pay less interest on their next mortgage - if rates remain low.",
      "Nicola wishes for \"certainly no more increases\" and thinks the sweet spot for her would be a rate of around 3%.",
      "However, the couple also see that falling interest rates aren't good news for everyone as their parents \"rely heavily\" on a better interest rate on their savings.",
      "In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank said economic growth had been \"broadly flat since March last year\".",
      "The UK economy showed zero growth between July and September.",
      "For the following three months, the Bank of England now expects it to shrink by 0.1% against a previous forecast of 0.3% growth.",
      "A recession is defined as two consecutive three-month periods of economic contraction.",
      "The Bank now expects the economy to grow by just 0.1% between January and March, down from the 0.3% it had predicted in November.",

      "Inflation is expected to \"rise quite sharply\" into the autumn, getting close to 4%, driven by rises in gas prices stemming from the need to fill drained storage facilities after a cold winter.

A 0.25 percentage point cut would typically save them about \u00a329 on their monthly repayments, according to figures from lenders' trade body UK Finance.",

    "summary": "The UK will still be hit even if not directly targeted by Trump's tariff measures.",
    "story": [
      "Don't mess with Canada - that's the private message to the US from the very top of Ottawa's political system. Just like nearly a century ago with the infamous American Smoot-Hawley tariffs, Canada got its retaliation in to Donald Trump's import taxes very quickly.",
      "While the White House is claiming Canada's pledge to spend $1.3bn (\u00a31bn) on a border protection plan has given it diplomatic victory in its battle over fentanyl traffic, there was very little conceded that was not already planned by America's northern neighbour.",
      "Crucially, both Mexico and Canada were undeterred by a clear threat in Trump's executive orders that any retaliation would lead to higher tariffs on imports into the US.",
      "After consulting each other, Canada and Mexico instead both negotiated a month's pause with Trump.",
      "The returning US president likes making threats of tariffs on most days, and in many directions.",
      "Since his inauguration, these have also been directed at Denmark, Colombia, China, Taiwan, the European Union as well as all of the Brics countries which include Brazil, Russia and India.",
      "The rationale for his tariffs keeps changing and much about this situation defies logical explanation.",
      "So, Mexico, Canada and every other country facing tariffs or the threat of them have to decipher what Trump is really playing at.",
      "And when they've done that, the question for the whole world is whether what we are seeing is an attempt by the US president to rewrite the entire global monetary system - and at what risk to America?",
      "The contradictions",
      "Trump has claimed that fentanyl trafficking was the legal pretext for tariffs, allowing him to bypass Congress and use emergency powers to impose border taxes on Canada, Mexico and China, by declaring an \"unusual or extraordinary threat\".",
      "But while talking about the fentanyl trade, he also referred to Canada's goods trade surplus with the US (which means Canada sells more to the US than it imports), and introduced the idea that Canada should become the \"51st state\" of America.",
      "While any country might demand talks about both illicit and legal trade flows, it is difficult to see how to handle these conversations when there is a parallel threat of continental annexation of a free trade ally which is also part of Nato and one of the Group of Seven (G7) most advanced economies in the world.",
      "A disputed surplus",
      "Europe, meanwhile, seems unwilling to stir the pot as it attempts to work out the president's precise motivations and how this feeds itself into what he decides over Transatlantic tariffs.",
      "Trump's long-standing animus with the EU comes from the bloc's substantial goods trade surplus with the US, arising from areas such as high-end German car exports.",
      "Underlying all of this is a perceived unfairness that other markets are more restrictive against America such as when it comes to the prices paid for US drugs or fines placed on US tech companies.",
      "But if this really is about trade deficits, it is something of a mystery as to why Trump has not yet announced tariffs against the likes of Vietnam, Japan and South Korea - who have far bigger surpluses with the US.",
      "In any case, for Trump to focus solely on goods means that he is willingly ignoring the US's great export - services.",
      "Faisal Islam: The 'Iron Chancellor' will have to flex to get the growth she wants",
      "Best of 'frenemies': Trump's relationship with Europe this time may be very different",
      "Growth at all costs? Why Reeves is in a sudden rush on the economy",
      "I put this precise point to the EU Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic last month.",
      "He told me: \"Sure, we have a trade surplus in goods, but the US has a trade surplus in services.",
      "\"And on top of it, every year, \u20ac300bn (\u00a3249bn) is flowing across the Atlantic into the American companies from our pension funds, from the saving accounts of the European citizens because they're investing in the US. So I think that it's a pretty balanced relationship.\"",
      "As it happens, the UK trade position with the US is more balanced, a point made to me by the Trade Secretary Jonathan Reynolds. In fact, on some measures, the US has a surplus with Britain.",
      "Amid the fog of Trump's true intentions,  European negotiators have resorted to stressing co-operation, partnership and deals with the US and studiously avoided directly criticising even the extraordinary suggestion of using tariffs against Nato-ally Denmark over the fate of Greenland.",
      "A negotiating tool",
      "In November 2024, Stephen Miran, before becoming President Trump's White House chief economics advisor, authored a paper laying out further questions that could determine how much more the US should tariff specific countries.",
      "These ranged from an assessment of whether a country applies similar tariffs to the US, suppresses its currency, respects US intellectual property, pays its Nato obligations, votes against the US at the United Nations or its \"leaders grandstand against the US in the international theatre\".",
      "It also talked of forcing other nations \"to choose between facing a tariff on their exports to the American consumer or applying tariffs to their imports from China\", asking: \"Which will they choose?\"",
      "The president himself was pretty clear in his video address to a stunned World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland in January.",
      "\"Your choice,\" he said to the assembled international executives. Build your goods in American factories with tax incentives, or import into the US from foreign factories and pay tariffs that would raise \"hundreds of billions of dollars and even trillions of dollars\" for the US Treasury.",
      "\"Most of the world has come to understand that Trump does use tariffs as a negotiating tool,\" Stephen Moore, a former Trump economic advisor who recently visited the president, told me.",
      "Across the board",
      "It may be that a part of Trump's logic is very simple: remodel the US tax system so that everything coming into the country attracts a levy but, in return, the public sees income tax rates slashed.",
      "\"By the way, I do think at the end of the day, there will be an across-the-board tariff imposed by Trump,\" says Mr Moore.",
      "\"He's talked about this, that if you're bringing something into the United States whether it's from Britain, whether it's Mexico, Canada, China, Europe, you're going to pay a little bit more but if something is made in the United States, he's going to lower the tax. And to a lot of Americans, that's a very attractive proposition.\"",
      "Mr Moore has suggested a 15% universal tariff on all imports from everywhere in order to fund a cut in income tax rates down to 15%.",
      "A fundamental change",
      "Mr Miran's paper also contains a proposal that led to jaws dropping in global central banks and finance ministries: bring down the value of the dollar in order to boost US industry and exports.",
      "Arranging this would mean a fundamental change to the way the global monetary system operates. But Mr Miran suggests that punitive tariffs could be used as leverage to make reluctant trading partners like Europe and China \"become more receptive\" to the idea.",
      "He suggests that in time there could be a summit of the world's economic powers, where allies and rivals thrash out the revaluation of the dollar, perhaps at the president's Florida residence. It could be known as the Mar-a-Lago Accord.",
      "Early discussions of the idea in international forums have been highly sceptical, recalling the history of similar attempts to manage global currency values.",
      "But it is the recently published concept of the top White House economic advisor. Tariff now, tariff hard and tariff everywhere in order to, in the future, get the world to help bring down the value of the dollar.",
      "Show strength",
      "Such a radical idea comes with risk and already simply with the tariffs, there is a danger for the White House that the US overplays its hand.",
      "Mark Carney, who is frontrunner to replace Justin Trudeau as Canadian Liberal Party leader, and as Prime Minister, at least until an election, has a rather unique approach.",
      "The former governor of both the Bank of England and the Bank of Canada decided to come out punching, ridiculing the fentanyl rationale and telling the BBC that Canada would retaliate \"dollar for dollar\" and that Canadians would \"stand up to a bully\".",
      "He said that the tariff move would rebound on the US economy itself by fuelling inflation, forcing the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates and crippling the ability of the US to sign trade deals, given they would have effectively ripped up their biggest  - the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) - just a few years after the president had personally renegotiated it.",
      "Mr Carney then publicly suggested that Canada removes a subsidy from exports to the US of its oil, and stressed that Canada's green investments might need to be protected from US carbon emissions.",
      "For those countries like the UK trying to avoid tariffs, he had a simple message: \"Good luck\".",
      "The clear sense was that from his own experience of having dealt with Trump at the G20, the way to deal with him was to show strength.",
      "The risk of retaliation",
      "This is partly a calculation that the muted opposition to these policies within the US will not be sustained. Again, the harder, more strategic and more coordinated the retaliation, the more pause for thought it will give big US corporates and some in the competing courts around the President.",
      "Elon Musk, the normally prolific social media poster on his X platform and chief executive of electric vehicle-maker Tesla, was curiously largely quiet about the single biggest move from the president.",
      "He eventually reposted the news from the Mexican president that their tariffs had been delayed.",
      "A leading US tech chief executive told me that his company was already making plans, assuming they would be on the receiving end of retaliatory tariffs.",
      "His hope was that Trump's focus on the rising value of the US stock market would create a natural restraint against excessive tariffs. Some saw the modest fall on the Dow Jones index on Monday as contributing to this week's pauses.",
      "Retaliation is standard procedure in trade wars.",
      "Indeed in the most famous of them all, when US Republicans passed the calamitous 1930s Smoot-Hawley tariffs, Canada was the first to hit back, doing so before the US had even finished legislating. History points to Henry Ford being one of those begging Herbert Hoover to veto the Smoot-Hawley tariffs in 1930.",
      "An integrated industry",
      "And, in 2025, the car industry is one obvious potential tariff loser.",
      "\"It's true to say that there is no such thing as a Canadian auto industry, an American auto industry and a Mexican auto industry,\" says Peter Frise, a professor of mechanical and automotive engineering at the University of Windsor.",
      "\"There are Canadian, American, and Mexican components of a North American auto industry and the integration among the three countries is absolutely foundational to how the industry works.\"",
      "Not only are models like the Honda Civic, which is hugely popular in the US, manufactured in Canada - Prof Frise says \"very few\" cars assembled in the US will not contain some parts that come from across the border. And so, says he adds, tariffs \"would drive up costs for everyone\" - US consumers included.",
      "Others diversify",
      "Another risk for Trump is that as Mr Carney and Mr Sefcovic said, they are all now responding to the direction of US trade policy by diversifying with one another. The EU is busy doing trade deals with Latin America. \"There is huge demand in the outside world for free and fair trade relationships,\" says Mr Sefcovic.",
      "The UK has also restarted trade negotiations with India and the Gulf countries.",
      "Reynolds says that the \"challenging international position\" means the UK has to push its \"genuine competitive advantage\" as the \"most connected market in the world\" with the US, the EU and China.",
      "An extensive and surprising tariff war",
      "The other issue here is that if the direction of travel is a universal tariff, as Trump and his advisors keep suggesting, is there much incentive to try to avoid it?",
      "There is some startling thinking circulating in Trumponomics circles. It is talk of that revenue grab of trillions of dollars that is spooking even allies who think they might escape the tariffs.",
      "It sounds like a wild economic gamble. But such talk is relative, at a time when the US president is putting tariffs on his closest economic G7 and Nato partner over fentanyl, while simultaneously claiming it should become part of the US.",
      "It could be an extensive and surprising tariff war. This week's trade dramas are just early skirmishes.",

      "China has accused the US of making \"unfounded and false allegations\" about its role in the fentanyl trade to justify tariffs on Chinese products.",
      "The complaint was lodged with the World Trade Organization (WTO) one day after US President Donald Trump raised border taxes on Chinese goods by 10%, a measure he said was intended to address an influx of illegal drugs.",
      "In the filing, China said the measures were \"discriminatory and protectionist\" and violated trade rules.",
      "But experts have warned that China is unlikely to secure a ruling in its favour as the panel that settles trade disputes remains unable to function. One former WTO official told the BBC it has \"no possibility of succeeding\".",
      "The dispute comes as Trump's plans for tariffs - a tax he has said he wants to see imposed on all foreign shipments into the country - are causing uncertainty across the global trade landscape.",
      "Trump has said tariffs will encourage firms to make their products in the US, repeatedly expressing concern about the size of America's trade deficit.",

      "On Wednesday, Bloomberg also reported that the country's anti-monopoly regulator was preparing for a possible investigation into Apple's policies and App Store fees, hitting the company's shares.",
      "Trump's moves - which included ordering an end of duty-free treatment for parcels worth less than $800 - will be a major \"shock\" to some firms, such as Shein and Temu, as they erode the ability to offer ultra-low prices, said Mark Williams, chief China economist at Capital Economics.",
      "But he said he thought for China overall that the effects of Trump's tariffs would not be too damaging.",

      "The US also ignored a previous finding by the WTO that earlier tariffs on steel and aluminium that were imposed during Trump's first term were against the rules.",
      "But Tom Graham, who chaired the WTO's appellate body in 2016 and 2019, told the BBC it would \"probably be a year\" before there is a decision from the first stage of Beijing's complaint and it has little chance of progressing further.",
      "\"It may be a strong case, the way the WTO dispute settlement system used to work, but it has no possibility of succeeding here ultimately,\" he said.",
      "Jeff Moon, who worked on China trade policy for President Barack Obama, told the BBC that he expected any initial WTO decision to support China's position.",
      "These cases typically take years to be resolved, however, and because the appeals process has been paralysed, \"a final decision will never be issued\".",
      "The former Assistant US Trade Representative for China Affairs added that Beijing needed to file the case to support its frequently stated position that it is the US that undermines the rules-based trading system and the relationship between the two countries.",
      "China ranked as the county with the biggest deficit in goods in December, sending $25.3bn more into the US than it purchased.",

    "story": [
      "Efforts to keep potentially disease-ridden meat out of the UK are being undermined by post-Brexit border checks, a senior health official has said.",
      "The boss of the Dover Port Health Authority said illegal meat, which has not been through proper health checks, was now available on \"most high streets\" in the UK.",
      "European outbreaks of deadly animal diseases in recent months have left health authorities, Whitehall officials and many in the farming industry worried about the threat they pose to the UK.",
      "But the government has insisted the checks work and it will never \"waver in its duty to support the UK's biosecurity\".",
      "Under the post-Brexit system, checks on commercial vehicles do not take place at Dover itself.",
      "Instead, drivers are ordered to travel 22 miles (35km) away to a border control post at Sevington.",
      "But critics have warned that many lorries are simply failing to turn up for the checks, due to a lack of enforcement.",
      "Parliament's Environment Select Committee has now launched an inquiry into whether the system is working.",
      "Lucy Manzano, head of the Dover Port Health Authority, told MPs on the committee that the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) had been overstating the effectiveness of the system.",
      "She said: \"Defra have continually stated that there are robust controls in place. There are not. They don't exist.\"",
      "She added that the department had failed to provide \"any confirmation of how food would be controlled at the point it arrives, or more importantly, between the point it arrives and the inspection facility that is accessed 22 miles across\".",
      "Ms Manzano said she had presented evidence to the government \"to demonstrate that the system brought in place to safeguard this country from a biosecurity point of view\u2026 is not working\".",
      "Defra refused to answer a recent Freedom of Information request from the BBC's Countryfile programme, asking how many vehicles were failing to turn up for checks at Sevington.",
      "The department claimed that releasing data about Sevington could inadvertently aid criminals looking for weak points in the UK's border controls.",
      "Almost 100 tonnes of illegal meat seized at port",
      "Action demanded over surge in illegal meat imports",
      "Ms Manzano claimed illegal meat has now become much more commonplace in high street shops - and that it is becoming increasingly difficult for consumers to spot if the product they are buying has gone through proper health checks.",
      "It is understood that the view inside Defra is that the post-Brexit checks are working as they should.",
      "Earlier this week figures showed that almost 100 tonnes of illegal meat was seized at the Port of Dover last year.",
      "Defra said it is \"unequivocal that importing illegal meat products is unacceptable \u2013 which is why suspected products are routinely checked at the border to ensure they don't reach our shores\".",
      "A BBC News investigation last year found that unprecedented levels of seizures had sparked fears of more organised criminal activity.",
      "A similar health check facility to the one at Sevington does exist on site at Dover, but it is understood that the government chose not to use it because of worries about potential traffic queues forming at the border.",
      "Ms Manzano said that decision was \"not based on biosecurity\" and added that \"the very purpose of import controls is to keep the bad stuff out and contain it at first point of entry\".",
      "Last month the UK government introduced strict restrictions on the import of German meat, following an outbreak of foot and mouth disease.",
      "But Ms Manzano said failures in the IT system introduced since Brexit meant that products which should have been undergoing checks were allowed to freely enter the UK for \"at least six days\".",
      "When the current system was introduced last year, the government also gave funding to Dover Port Health Authority to carry out spot checks on smaller vehicles directly at the border.",
      "Figures show the vast majority of illegal meat seized in the UK is caught through those spot checks.",
      "But Ms Manzano said that funding was due to run out in seven weeks and that without further government cash the checks would have to stop.",
      "Government discussions are ongoing about how to best fund border checks.",
      "It is understood the decision to put the checks at Sevington has likely had a direct negative impact on how much money goes to the Dover Port Health Authority.",
      "A Defra spokesperson refused to comment on ongoing spending decisions."

      "The trade war between the world's two biggest economies has escalated after China hit back against the introduction of tariffs by the US with measures of its own.",
      "Beijing has set out to target specific American goods with retaliatory taxes, among other measures, following the blanket 10% tariff introduced by President Donald Trump on all Chinese imports to the US.",
      "In some ways, this latest tit-for-tat is nothing new and builds on the long-running trade dispute between the nations, with tariffs having already been imposed and threatened on various goods since 2018.",
      "Trump has said he plans to speak to Chinese President Xi Jinping, so a deal could yet be struck. But if China proceeds with its response on 10 February as planned, what could the impact be?",
      "Coal, oil and gas",
      "Part of China's countermeasures to Trump's tariffs is to announce import taxes of its own on US coal and liquefied natural gas (LNG) of 10%, and a 15% charge on crude oil.",
      "The response from Beijing means companies wanting to import fossil fuels from the US would have to pay the tax in order to do so.",
      "China is the world's largest importer of coal, but it gets most of it from Indonesia, although Russia, Australia and Mongolia are also among its suppliers.",
      "When it comes to the US, China has been increasing imports of LNG from the country, with volumes nearly double 2018 levels, according to Chinese customs data.",
      "But its overall fossil fuel trade is modest, with US imports accounting for just 1.7% of China's total crude oil bought from abroad in 2023. This suggests China is not dependent on the US and so the impact of the tariffs on its economy could be minimal.",
      "Rebecca Harding, a trade economist and chief executive of the Centre for Economic Security think tank, said China could easily source more supplies from Russia, where it has already been buying oil on the cheap as the Kremlin seeks to fund its war effort.",

      "As well as fuel, China has slapped a 10% tariff on agricultural machinery, pick-up trucks, and some large cars.",
      "But China is not a big importer of US pick-ups and it gets most of its cars from Europe and Japan, so a 10% tariff on an already small number of imports would not hit consumers too hard.",
      "In recent years, China has increased investments in farm machinery to enhance production and reduce reliance on imports, and to strengthen its food security.",
      "So the introduction of tariffs on agricultural machinery might be another move to try to boost domestic industry.",
      "Julian Evans-Pritchard, head of China economics at consultancy Capital Economics, said all the tariff measures were \"fairly modest, at least relative to US moves\".",
      "He suggests that China's targeted goods represent about $20bn (\u00a316bn) worth of annual imports - around 12% of China's total imports from the US.",
      "\"This is a far cry from the more than $450bn worth of Chinese goods being targeted by the US.\"",

      "The company still has some business presence in the country through providing apps and games to the Chinese markets by working with local developers.",

    "summary": "Are we seeing the opening moves in a wider trade war, and what are the potential economic consequences?",
    "story": [
      "Just a day ago, Donald Trump was threatening a multi-front trade war with Canada, Mexico and China that would take the global economy into uncharted territory.",
      "Twenty-four hours later, we're in a rather different place with the tariffs - or taxes - against America's closest neighbours and trading partners on hold for 30 days.",
      "But the 10% tariffs on all goods imports from China have gone ahead, and Beijing has responded in kind. So what are the potential economic consequences of these opening salvos and could this turn into a broader trade war?",
      "Trump's 10% tariff on China begins as Beijing plans retaliation on US energy and some cars",
      "Trump's trade war with neighbours is delayed - what did they all get out of it?",
      "How could Trump's tariffs affect the UK?",
      "China is subject to significant US tariffs already and has been since Trump's first term. But the blanket nature of today's new levies from the White House on every single goods import from China - from toys, to mobile phones, to clothes - is new and significant.",
      "Beijing's promised tariff retaliation - including new levies on imports from the US of oil, agricultural machinery and some cars - is far less sweeping. Yet the retaliation moves us into the arena of tit-for-tat action, where the country experiencing the tariffs feels it has no choice but to hit back to show its own citizens it can't be pushed around by a foreign power.",
      "This is the dictionary definition of a trade war - and economic historians warn they tend to generate their own momentum and can rapidly spiral out of control.",
      "Trump has used just about every justification under the sun for tariffs, from raising more tax revenue to boosting American manufacturing and rebalancing trade. But one thing recent days confirm is the new president regards them as a powerful way to compel other nations to do what he wants.",
      "He threatened massive and punitive tariffs on Colombia when it initially refused to accept US flights of its deported nationals, but he lifted the threat when Bogota acquiesced.",
      "The White House might also point to the response of Mexico and Canada yesterday as evidence tariff threats yield results. He had threatened to ride roughshod over his own North American free trade deal unless those nations tightened up on border control. Although how much extra those two countries actually promised yesterday on border security relative to what they were already doing is open to question.",
      "Yet the problem with the White House using tariff threats in this way is that if other countries don't back down - or agreements are not reached - Trump might well feel he has no choice but to follow through or risk losing all credibility. And the targeted country might feel it has to respond with its prepared countermeasures, even if they would prefer not to.",
      "That high-risk dynamic - where things could slip out of control in an atmosphere of distrust and political pressure - is why many analysts and economists are far from comforted by how things have played out with Mexico and Canada this week.",
      "The other reason many economists fear Trump's intimidatory tariff diplomacy is its potentially chilling impact on business investment and confidence. US car firms have a deeply integrated industrial base across America, Mexico and Canada. Automotive parts cross those borders multiple times in the vehicle assembly process.",
      "The levying of 25% tariffs on each of those movements would be disastrous for these businesses. Those North American tariffs have been paused for now, but it's very hard to see US or Canadian automotive executives committing to further investment in those cross-border supply chains any time soon - and perhaps for many years to come.",
      "That will have negative implications for their productivity - and also for the wages of their employees in all three countries. The view of many economists is having cross-border supply chains makes these firms more productive than they would otherwise be and this raises US workers' wages relative to where they would be if they only manufactured in America.",
      "These same effects apply on a global scale. In light of Trump's tariff threats against the European Union, how many US firms are likely to be going ahead with planned investments in Europe - and vice versa?",
      "Countries such as Vietnam and Malaysia benefitted indirectly from the US tariffs imposed on China in Donald Trump's first presidential term, as multinationals shifted manufacturing out of China and into their territories to avoid the taxes and to continue exporting to America. But what if Trump now threatens tariffs against them too?",
      "The huge uncertainty Trump's tariff threats have injected into the global economy - even if they don't always translate into actual new taxes - will likely already be doing damage.",

      "That might be what's on the official agenda of the Artificial Intelligence Action Summit, but there is something else that's breathing fire into this particular talking shop: DeepSeek.",
      "A horse racing fan once told me that the night before a big race, everyone's a winner.",
      "And with China dramatically blowing the AI competition in a new direction with DeepSeek, its super-efficient and super-viral AI assistant, suddenly there's a feeling ahead of the summit that the pole position occupied by the US AI sector, despite its vast wealth and AI infrastructure, might not be quite so out-of-reach after all.",
      "Prof Gina Neff, from the Minderoo Centre for Technology and Democracy at the University of Cambridge, says there is currently \"a vacuum for global leadership on AI\".",

For one thing, half of the global population has been to the polls since then.",

      "I asked ChatGPT to list some of AI's notable milestones since the South Korea summit of May 2024. DeepSeek did not make the cut.",
      "Of course there is much more to AI than generative AI like both DeepSeek and ChatGPT - tools that create content like text, images, video. It may well be the most widely accessible to us as consumers. But there are also AI tools that spot disease symptoms, model climate change solutions, develop new formulas for drugs - and that will all be in scope in Paris.",

      "We do know that it was built on their shoulders: using a number of Nvidia chips (probably older ones, because of US sanctions) and some opensource AI architecture developed by Meta. In addition, OpenAI has complained that rivals are using its work in order to advance their own (contacts in the creative industries were amused at the irony of this, given that OpenAI products will happily produce output \"in the style of\" individual human creators).",
      "But nonetheless DeepSeek succeeded in shaking up the AI sector in a way not even AI itself might have predicted. And it wiped a lot of money off the value of some of the biggest players in the process. It will almost certainly be a huge topic of conversation all around those Parisian conference rooms.",
      "There's one more theme running through the AI Summit that will be worth keeping an eye on.",

    "summary": "The African nation exports its cashews in raw form, but processing them would be more lucrative.",
    "story": [
      "The Accra street vendor looks at me, bemused.",
      "I'm trying to establish how the rather flimsy 30g bag of roasted cashew nuts she's selling, beside a sweltering highway in Ghana's capital, costs me the equivalent of about 75 cents (60p).",
      "That's obviously not a lot of money for me, a visitor from the UK, but I'm amazed at the mark up.",
      "The price is at least 4,000% higher than the cost of buying the same weight of raw, unshelled cashews from a Ghanian farmer.",
      "\"It's incredible,\" I protest. Yet she doesn't understand my English, or my reasoning.",
      "The price of the nuts was, after all, printed on the packet. And explaining why I thought it was beyond the pale was never going to be easy.",
      "Cashing in on Ghana's cashews",
      "Ghana is the world's third-biggest exporter of unprocessed cashew nuts, behind Ivory Coast in first place, and Cambodia in second.",
      "To produce the crop, around 300,000 Ghanaians make at least part of their living growing cashews.",
      "Nashiru Seydou, whose family have a farm in the country's north-east, some 500 miles (800km) from Accra, is one of them.",
      "He says the work is hard, and unreliable supply chains and volatile wholesale prices make survival difficult.",
      "\"We are struggling. We can use the sunlight, the fertile land, to create more jobs,\" he says. \"I'd be happy if the government comes to our aid and helps support our industry.\"",
      "He tells me that he currently gets around $50 for a large 100kg sack of unshelled cashews.",
      "\"It's amazing,\" says Bright Simons, an entrepreneur and economic commentator in Accra, who has studied the numbers. \"Roasters and retailers buy the nuts from farmers for $500 a tonne, and sell to customers [both at home and abroad] for amounts between $20,000 and $40,000 a tonne.\"",
      "As a whole, Ghana grows about 180,000 tonnes of cashews annually. More than 80% is exported, and in raw, unshelled form. This generates some $300m in export revenues, but means that Ghana misses out on the significantly higher returns you get from roasted, ready-to-eat cashews.",
      "Mildred Akotia is one person trying to increase the amount of cashews that are shelled and roasted in Ghana. She is the founder and CEO of Akwaaba Fine Foods, which currently processes just 25 tonnes a year.",
      "Ms Akotia denies any suggestion that she and others like her are price-gouging. The packaging and roasting machinery a western business would automatically use in this industry, she says, is out of reach for her because of the high cost of credit in Ghana.",
      "\"If you go to a local bank, it will cost you 30% interest to get a loan,\" she complains. \"As a manufacturer you tell me how large your margins are that you can afford that kind of interest? We've had to rely on what we can get: soft loans from relatives and grants from donor agencies.\"",
      "She says that this situation is why less than 20% of Ghana's cashews are processed locally. The bulk are scooped up and exported to big factories in countries like India, Thailand and Vietnam.",
      "Remarkably, some of those packaged nuts are then exported back to Ghana, where they are sold for the same price as domestically roasted cashews. This is despite the 20,000-mile sea freight round trip, and import costs.",
      "It is a similar picture for rice, which is exported to Ghana from Asia and sold at low prices, despite Ghana also growing the crop itself.",
      "Back in 2016 the Ghanaian government experimented with an export ban on raw cashews in order to encourage homegrown processing. However the policy had to be abandoned within a couple of weeks after uproar from farmers and traders.",
      "Without available cheap loans, it wasn't possible for sufficient new Ghanaian roasters to enter the market. So the price of raw nuts crashed, and many started rotting for want of a buyer.",
      "More recently there has been talk of increased tariffs on raw cashew exports and bans on exporters purchasing cashews directly from farms.",
      "But all these policy interventions miss a key point, according to Mr Simons. A big challenge for local producers, he says, is to work harder on the basics of doing business, and growing their companies.",
      "\"In order to be efficient at this, you need scale,\" he says, adding that firms need to promote eating cashews to make it more widespread in the country. \"You need a lot of a Ghanaians consuming the nuts, not just a small middle class\".",
      "Prof Daron Acemoglu, a Turkish-American economist, agrees that building a strong local market is important for Ghana's cashew industry. He was one of last year's winners of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, for his work on the struggles facing low-income economies, and in particular their home-grown businesses.",
      "Yet he says that the first priority should be improving access to international markets for processed Ghanaian cashews.",

      "\"I take such matters extremely seriously,\" he said, adding that the suggestion that he acted in an improper way was \"deeply upsetting\".",
      "D'Acampo, 48, has been a regular on UK television since the early 2000s. He has primarily worked for ITV, including on a number of cooking and travel shows, as well as making appearances on other entertainment programmes.",
      "The Italian-born chef and broadcaster has also made appearances on BBC programmes.",
      "In a statement, ITV said production companies \"have the primary responsibility for the duty of care of everyone they work with\".",
      "The broadcaster said it had \"strengthened\" policies about what standards they expect from production companies it works with in the last five years.",
      "A statement continued: \"All of the concerns and complaints raised by those who have spoken to ITN [the producer of ITV News] describe behaviour which is inappropriate and unacceptable.",
      "\"Most of them were not reported to ITV at the time. Where issues have been raised with ITV action has been taken.\"",
      "The allegations follow a recent BBC News investigation into the behaviour of another TV chef, MasterChef presenter Gregg Wallace, who was accused of making inappropriate sexual comments by 13 people.",
      "Wallace's lawyers have said it is entirely false that he engages in behaviour of a sexually harassing nature. MasterChef's production company Banijay UK is currently investigating the claims.",
      "In the wake of the claims about Wallace, the culture secretary Lisa Nandy warned there were \"too many cultures of silence\", and warned she was \"prepared to take further action\" if the media industry couldn't address claims of misconduct."

    "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2025 09:45:12 GMT",
    "summary": "Previous comments made by Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n have been condemned since they came to light last week.",
    "story": [
      "The star of Spanish-language musical Emilia P\u00e9rez has said she will stay quiet for the rest of the film's Oscars campaign, after offensive comments she wrote in the past came to light.",
      "Tweets posted by best actress nominee Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n, mostly between 2019 and 2024, have caused significant fallout and left the film's awards campaign in disarray.",
      "Gasc\u00f3n has released several statements and given interviews since the controversy began, but in a new Instagram post she said she now wanted to step back and \"let the work talk for itself\".",
      "She added she hoped her silence would \"allow the film to be appreciated for what it is, a beautiful ode to love and difference\".",
      "Gasc\u00f3n had already pulled out of appearing at several awards season events in the coming days. It is not yet clear whether she will still attend the Oscars on 2 March.",
      "Her latest statement follows an interview the film's director Jacques Audiard gave to Deadline, in which he condemned Gasc\u00f3n's tweets and said he was no longer in contact with her.",
      "In her new statement, Gasc\u00f3n said: \"Following Jacques' interview that I understand, I decided, for the film, for Jacques, for the cast, for the incredible crew who deserves it, for the beautiful adventure we all had together, to let the work talk for itself.\"",
      "She also reiterated her regret for her original tweets, saying that she wanted to \"sincerely apologise to everyone who has been hurt along the way\".",
      "The original tweets saw Gasc\u00f3n make comments about Islam, George Floyd, and the high level of diversity at the Oscars.",
      "After they were brought to light, Gasc\u00f3n said she was \"deeply sorry to those I have caused pain\", adding that she is not racist and that many of her comments had been taken out of context.",
      "In the days since, Hollywood has distanced itself from her posts, while Netflix appears to have refocused its campaign efforts on the film's other nominees.",
      "Netflix has not publicly commented (BBC News approached the streamer for this article), but the company has been distancing itself from her comments in recent days.",
      "Here is how the campaign around Gasc\u00f3n has changed, following the controversy.",
      "Changing the promotional posters",
      "At this time of year, film studios take out advertisements intended to make a particular film more visible to awards voters.",
      "The movie will have already have had a separate promotional push at the time of its release, targeted at the public in the hope of securing high box office or streaming numbers.",
      "But the For Your Consideration (FYC) adverts which run during awards season are specifically intended to draw awards voters' attention to the categories the film has been nominated in at events such as the Baftas and Oscars.",
      "Previously, Gasc\u00f3n featured prominently in Netflix's publicity material, which reminded voters that she was nominated for best leading actress.",
      "But an updated FYC poster released on Monday almost entirely erased Gasc\u00f3n, instead making her co-stars Zoe Salda\u00f1a and Selena Gomez much more prominent.",
      "\"The shift suggests Netflix is trying to minimize Gasc\u00f3n's contributions so that the controversy around her remarks won't overshadow the film or the work of her co-stars and collaborators,\" suggested Variety's Clayton Davis.",
      "The CNN interview",
      "Gasc\u00f3n released several statements following the controversy, mostly via her social media accounts.",
      "But she also gave an emotional, hour-long sit-down interview to CNN en Espa\u00f1ol.",
      "It has since come to light that Gasc\u00f3n took part in the interview without the involvement or agreement of the film's PR team.",
      "The Hollywood Reporter said it had learned that the actress \"set up the interview on her own without the involvement of anyone working on the film, which was distributed by Netflix\".",
      "The fact that this line has been briefed to US journalists suggests Netflix is not only distancing itself from Gasc\u00f3n, but that the streamer's own PR team would not have signed off on such an interview being granted.",
      "Often, publicity teams advise a celebrity in crisis not to give too many interviews and statements, as it can keep a negative story alive for longer or even make the situation worse.",
      "Pulling out of events",
      "Gasc\u00f3n had been due to appear at several events in the next week or so.",
      "These included the AFI Awards luncheon, the Critics Choice Awards, the Directors Guild of America Awards, the Producers Guild of America Awards, and the Santa Barbara International Film Festival.",
      "However, the actress is now not expected to appear at any of them, as the turmoil continues.",
      "And that's not all. According to Variety, Netflix and the film's PR team have stopped talking directly with Gasc\u00f3n and are only communicating through an agent.",
      "The publication also reported the streamer \"is no longer covering expenses for her travel to the various awards shows or her styling for any appearances at these events\".",
      "It remains to be seen whether Gasc\u00f3n will attend the Oscars, which are scheduled to take place on 2 March.",
      "What happens to the 'Fab Five' Oscars format?",
      "Many film fans (ourselves included) love the so-called \"Fab Five\" format, which has been employed at some recent Oscars ceremonies.",
      "This sees five previous winners of a particular category take to the stage to present the latest winner with the same prize.",
      "For example, last year, Emma Stone was presented with the best actress trophy by previous winners Michelle Yeoh, Jennifer Lawrence, Sally Field, Jessica Lange and Charlize Theron.",
      "Traditionally, this format sees each of the previous winners deliver a short speech, paying tribute to the current nominees, before revealing the winner.",
      "However, it's understood that the Academy has moved away from doing this in the acting categories this year, which means no actress will be asked to praise Gasc\u00f3n's performance from the stage.",
      "Despite speculation, the decision appears to have been unprompted by the recent controversy.",
      "Instead, Variety reports the Academy decided to ditch the fab five format for the acting categories several weeks ago, before the tweets came to light, and instead is deploying it in different categories this year, such as best director.",
      "How could this impact Gasc\u00f3n's co-stars",
      "Emilia P\u00e9rez, a bonkers Spanish-language musical about a Mexican drug lord who changes gender, received 13 Oscar nominations, although it was not necessarily expected to be the biggest winner on the night.",
      "It has stiff competition in several categories, including best picture, but it was thought to be a frontrunner in a few in particular, such as best original song, and best supporting actress for Zoe Salda\u00f1a.",
      "It was widely thought Salda\u00f1a would run away with the trophy, not just for her acclaimed performance, but also because there is a lot of goodwill from voters because of her roles in box office smashes such as the Avatar and Marvel movies.",
      "After Gasc\u00f3n's tweets came to light, Salda\u00f1a said: \"It makes me really sad because I don't support [it], and I don't have any tolerance for any negative rhetoric towards people of any group.",
      "\"I can only attest to the experience that I had with each and every individual that was a part, that is a part, of this film, and my experience and my interactions with them was about inclusivity and collaboration and racial, cultural and gender equity. And it just saddens me.\"",
      "Then, on Sunday, Salda\u00f1a used her speech at the London Critics Circle Awards to tell the audience to be \"abstract with your idea of redemption\".",
      "Oscar voters and awards pundits will be watching forthcoming events such as the Bafta Film Awards and SAG Awards to see whether Salda\u00f1a can still follow through with her expected win.",
      "Meanwhile, director Jacques Audiard told Deadline he has avoided getting in touch with Gasc\u00f3n because \"right now she needs space to reflect and take accountability for her actions\".",
      "\"Very unfortunately, it is taking up all the space, and that makes me very sad,\" he said.",
      "\"It's very hard for me to think back to the work I did with Karla Sof\u00eda. The trust we shared, the exceptional atmosphere that we had on the set that was indeed based on trust.",
      "\"And when you have that kind of relationship and suddenly you read something that that person has said, things that are absolutely hateful and worthy of being hated, of course that relationship is affected. It's as if you fall into a hole. Because what Karla Sof\u00eda said is inexcusable.\"",
      "As for Emilia P\u00e9rez as a whole, the controversy could make its chances of a best picture win far less likely, particularly in a year where there is no breakout frontrunner for best picture.",

    "story": [
      "When The Zutons were asked to take part in the 25th anniversary celebrations of BBC Radio 1's Live Lounge, they knew there was only one artist they could cover.",
      "The live sessions have been a much-loved part of the station's output for years, but it was Amy Winehouse's performance of the Liverpool band's song Valerie in 2007 that was voted the best ever by its fans.",
      "And so it was Winehouse's iconic track Back To Black, along with a live version of Valerie, that the band played in their own session at the end of 2024.",
      "A couple of months on, saxophonist Abi Harding, who took vocal duties on the cover, said it had been a nerve-wracking experience, but one she had ultimately enjoyed.",
      "\"We thought 'let's not try and be like Amy Winehouse because you can't, there's only one Amy Winehouse',\" she said.",
      "She said they considered a number of Winehouse's songs to cover, including her personal favourite, Love Is A Losing Game, but Back To Black was \"the most one suited to a band\".",
      "\"We thought we could do it and make it our own like the way she did with Valerie.\"",
      "\"It was more fitting for me to sing it than Dave [McCabe, the band's lead singer] and I'd been dying to sing a song... [but] I was so nervous to be compared to her.",
      "\"I'm never going to be her, she's an amazing artist.\"",
      "She said she was glad to have done the song justice and believed that was partially down to its subject matter.",
      "\"Everyone, myself included, has been through heartbreak or times when you feel the worst,\" she said.",
      "\"I'm older now, so that's happened quite a few times, so you can go to that place.",
      "\"But it's nice to hear that [people think] it's still full of emotion and they get that from it.\"",
      "Such has been the response to the track, that the band subsequently released it as a single in December, mirroring what Winehouse, who died in 2011, did with Valerie 17 years earlier.",
      "That song started off as an idea formed by McCabe's head while he was travelling in a taxi to his mum's house, and was released as a single by The Zutons in 2006.",
      "It peaked at number nine in the UK charts and piqued the interest of Winehouse, who recorded a slowed version with producer Mark Ronson for the deluxe edition of her album Back To Black in 2007.",
      "Harding said the story was that Ronson wanted the people he was working with for his own album to do a modern cover.",

      "\"He went: 'You've come in every day singing that Valerie song by The Zutons, why don't you do that?'",
      "\"So the fact she liked the song, I was super flattered, but doing it on the Live Lounge and it becoming a big hit is another thing again.",
      "\"I just loved her so much... it was such a joy to hear her sing it and make it her own.\"",
      "Ronson released the upbeat version featuring Winehouse's vocals in October 2007 and it went on to reach number two on the UK charts.",
      "Harding said that had led the song to having \"a life of its own\".",
      "\"It's neither ours or hers, or anyone's... it's just everyone's.\"",
      "The Zutons' own appearance on the Live Lounge coincided with a career resurgence.",
      "Having split in 2009, they came back together in 2016 and were on the rise again with a tour celebrating the 15th anniversary of their debut album, Who Killed... The Zutons?, in 2019 when Covid-19 curtailed their activities.",
      "Harding said in some ways, the subsequent lockdowns were actually beneficial.",

    "story": [
      "Amandaland, the new BBC series which is a spin-off from the popular sitcom Motherland, has received a rapturous response from critics.",
      "The show sees Lucy Punch reprise her role as Amanda, the overbearing and competitive mother who was a viewer favourite in the original series.",
      "The Independent said the new spin-off \"will make you howl with laughter\", adding that English actress Punch \"has never been better\".",
      "The Telegraph described it as being \"both hilarious and heartfelt\", adding that lead actress Punch and co-star Dame Joanna Lumley \"make a dream comic double act\".",
      "In the show, the recently divorced Amanda must navigate parenting teenagers in her new surroundings, after having downsized, swapping Waitrose in Chiswick for Tesco Metro in South Harlesden.",
      "\"Spin-offs are always a risk, but Lucy Punch's Amanda was a sure bet,\" wrote the Guardian's Chitra Ramaswamy in a four-star review.",
      "\"Sorry, team Liz, but she was the best character in Motherland: the ideal [writer] Sharon-Horgan-sharpened instrument for impaling the worst excesses, blind spots and hypocrisies of the posh, white, west London middle classes.\"",
      "She added: \"There's lots to love... When the writing is this good, it fizzes with the hysterical energy of perimenopause.\"",
      "Ramaswamy singled out one line of dialogue where Amanda reflects: \"I'm actually glad I took the kids out of private school. They've got way more chance of getting into Oxbridge from a bog-standard state.\"",
      "'Ab Fab levels of relish'",
      "The \"narcissism-powered dynamic\" between Amanda and her mother, Felicity, is, the critic noted, \"played with Ab Fab levels of relish by Joanna Lumley\".",
      "The long-suffering Anne (Philippa Dunne) also returns for the spin-off, and there are new characters, such as Amanda's downstairs neighbour Mal (Samuel Anderson), celebrity chef Della Fry (Derry Girls actress Siobhan McSweeney) and her uber liberal wife Fi (Rochenda Sandall).",
      "The new show was created and written by the same team that came up with Bafta-winning comedy series Motherland; Holly Walsh, Helen Serafinowicz and Barunka O'Shaughnessy, with Horgan credited as creator.",
      "Motherland was reportedly axed after its 2022 Christmas special. For its follow-up, the Independent's Charlotte O'Sullivan noted: \"Arguably, lessons have been learnt.",
      "\"Where the final festive episode [of Motherland] was bracingly bleak, Amandaland (written by roughly the same team, plus Horrible Histories's Laurence Rickard) has a cosier, more romcom-ish vibe.\"",
      "In her four-star review, O'Sullivan said the story of \"Punch's posh alpha mum, is clever, jolly and hard to resist\".",
      "\"Even in Motherland, Amanda had angst,\" she said. \"In the new show, as you'd expect, there's more time to explore her loneliness and self-doubt. What is Amanda good for? The answer is frequently absolutely nothing. But we root for this absurd and vulnerable woman all the same.",
      "\"Richard Curtis [the Notting Hill and Love Actually film-maker] minimised the realities of gentrification to an outrageous degree,\" she continued. \"Amandaland, by contrast, seems deliberately designed to get us talking about what happens to a deprived area when the middle classes move in.\"",
      "The Telegraph's Anita Singh awarded the series five stars, labelling it as \"a treat\" from both the writers and its stars.",
      "She added that Punch \"excels at physical comedy and is hilarious as she tries to style out her reduced circumstances\".",
      "\"The script is deft and the writers nail the various stages of parenting teenagers: helping them through first love, carting them home in disgrace when they've got drunk and thrown up on themselves, and realising that you can't help them with their maths homework any more because you don't understand it.\"",
      "'A modern Mrs Bucket'",
      "In another five-star review, the Times' Carol Midgley noted how spin-off series \"can easily disappoint, as Joey, a feeble offshoot of Friends, showed\".",
      "\"But I just knew that Amandaland, offspring of the mighty Motherland, would be glorious... and it is.\"",
      "She likened the \"deliciously desperate\" new show, and its leading woman, to being  \"a Hyacinth Bucket for 2025\".",
      "\"Keeping Up Appearances was so joyous because it mocked the absurdity of prideful status-seeking,\" she noted of the Patricia Routledge-starring 1990s BBC sitcom.",
      "\"Amanda is Hyacinth for the new age (imagine if Hyacinth had had social media!).",
      "\"Punch carries most of the heavy lifting with ease,\" she wrote, \"and the result is not only a spin-off that punches above its weight: it is lovely, life-affirming escapism.\"",
      "There was another five-star rating from Christopher Stevens in the Daily Mail.",
      "\"Amanda's an awful woman, of course,\" he said, \"a backstabbing snob who treats her children as accessories and turns every encounter with her 'mum chums' at the school gates into a blood sport.\"",

      "Tilly Pearce of the Radio Times awarded four stars, writing: \"Spin-off shows can often be a bit of a tricky tightrope. To be successful, they need to find balance with the old and new, which is kind of apt, given Amanda's situation.",

    "story": [
      "Steve Coogan has been banned for driving for two months instead of six, after telling the judge that a lengthier ban would impact the filming of his popular TV comedy series The Trip.",
      "The actor and comedian was caught going at 97mph, well over the 70mph speed limit, while travelling in a Range Rover on the M6 in Staffordshire in July last year.",
      "In a letter to Birmingham Magistrates' Court, the 59-year-old urged the court not to disqualify him as he already had six points on his licence and was required to drive as part of filming a forthcoming series of the The Trip alongside co-star Rob Brydon.",
      "His request for five penalty points to be imposed instead of six - which would have led to a six-month ban meaning \"the production would likely be unable to proceed\", he argued - was granted after he pleaded guilty to the offence on 30 January.",
      "Coogan noted that the past penalty points on his licence would be due to expire in August 2025 and that he had stuck to speed limits since the incident.",
      "The Evening Standard, which first reported the story, said Coogan also expressed frustration it had taken almost six months for the prosecution to be brought.",
      "The court ultimately decided to ban him from driving for two months instead of six, meaning the TV show can be made as planned.",
      "He was also ordered to pay a \u00a32,500 fine, plus \u00a390 costs and a \u00a31,000 victim surcharge.",
      "'Requires me to drive'",
      "Coogan's letter to the court read: \"I have a series of important film commitments scheduled for 2025, many of which involve driving as a central component of the work.",
      "\"I am due to appear in a well-established TV series called The Trip which as the title suggests requires me to drive.",
      "\"This starts filming towards the end of June 2025 and if I were unable to drive, the production would likely be unable to proceed.\"",
      "He highlighted how the punishment would not only affect him, but \"the many individuals dependent on these productions for work\", including camera sound, and lighting technicians, as well as riggers.",
      "The Trip is a largely improvised sitcom directed by Michael Winterbottom, which stars Coogan and Brydon as fictionalised versions of themselves, dealing with life and often doing impressions while taking foodie trips around the UK, Italy, Spain and Greece.",
      "Coogan won the Bafta TV Award for best male performance in a comedy role in 2011 for his part in series one, which - like all four - was also edited into a feature film.",
      "His latest comments appear to confirm plans for a fifth series of The Trip, which had not yet previously been announced.",
      "It was thought that 2020's Trip to Greece - series four - had been the finale, but Coogan said on Brydon's podcast in 2023 that they should make another series, floating the idea of Wales, Ireland and America as possible locations.",
      "\"I think certainly there will be more stuff to say, because middle age is different to just getting old,\" said Coogan. \"I think we should do another one, at a time and place to be determined.\"",

      "Non-cancerous brain tumours are more common in people over the age of 50, and symptoms can include headaches, vision problems and drowsiness, according to the NHS website.",
      "Some can be difficult to remove without damaging surrounding tissue. And Chemotherapy or radiotherapy can also be used if the surgery is not successful.",

      "As a writer and producer, his multi-platinum hits included the J-Lo and Ja Rule duets Ain't It Funny and I'm Real, the Ashanti tracks Foolish and Always on Time, and Fat Joe's What's Luv?.",
      "\"People get confused because it sells like pop music,\" he told the Guardian in 2002. \"But we make black music first and foremost, and all our records is 'hood first'.\"",
      "A cause of death has not been announced, but the music mogul had battled diabetes-related issues and suffered what was described as a \"minor stroke\" in early 2024.",
      "At the time, Gotti's representatives said he had changed his diet and had been \"successful in making a full recovery\".",
      "Born Irving Lorenzo in Hollis, Queens, in 1971, his career began as a producer for New York MC Mic Geronimo, under the moniker DJ Irv.",
      "His big break came when he contributed to Jay-Z's debut album, Reasonable Doubt, in 1996. The rapper christened him the \"don of hip-hop\", renaming him Irv Gotti in reference to the mafia boss John Gotti.",
      "His next move was to sign gravel-voiced rapper DMX to the legendary rap label Def Jam Records.",
      "The label was in the middle of a rough patch, losing ground to Sean Combs' flashy, aspirational Bad Boy Inc label. DMX was the antidote to Combs' style - stripped back, raw and connected to the street.",

      "They chose the name Murder Inc after watching a documentary about the 20th-century New York organised crime group of the same name - reckoning that they could put out hit records in the same way their crime syndicate had put out hits for murder.",
      "Their first signing was Ja Rule, who saw massive commercial success with hits like Holla Holla, Livin' It Up, Always On Time and the UK number one Wonderful.",
      "Gotti also discovered the singer Ashanti as a teenager, and partnered her with his rap artists for a sprinkle of melodic fairydust.",
      "As a solo act, she also had a run of top 10 hits in the early 2000s with songs like Foolish, Rock Wit U and Only U.",
      "Gotti earned a Grammy for co-producing Ashanti's eponymous debut in 2002, which won best contemporary R&B album.",
      "Murder Inc also lent credibility to Jennifer Lopez's music career, with popular remixes of I'm Real and Love Don't Cost A Thing giving her frothy pop hits an urban edge.",
      "Overall, Gotti was credited as a producer on 28 US chart hits, from artists including Mary J Blige, Fat Joe and Kanye West.",
      "His career faced a setback in the mid-2000s after the FBI raided Murder Inc's offices, as part of an investigation into alleged ties with drug kingpin Kenneth \"Supreme\" McGriff.",
      "Gotti and his brother were charged with money laundering but were later acquitted of all charges.",
      "Beef with 50 Cent",
      "The accusations also formed part of a long-standing feud between Gotti and the rap star 50 Cent.",

      "Prior to that, one of 50 Cent's associates had allegedly robbed Ja Rule in New York, triggering a run of diss tracks and altercations between the pair, culminating in a recording studio brawl where 50 Cent was stabbed.",
      "Murder Inc rapper Black Child took credit for the attack on record, claiming it was an act of self-defence.",
      "50 Cent later downplayed the severity of the incident, but he continued to take pot shots at Gotti and Murder Inc throughout his career.",
      "'Creative soldier'",
      "After the controversies, Gotti rebranded Murder Inc as The Inc. He signed singer-songwriter Vanessa Carlton and continued to release albums by Ashanti, but the label struggled to match its former glories.",
      "Last July, Gotti was sued by for sexual assault and rape by an anonymous accuser, who said she had been in a relationship with the music mogul between 2020 and 2022.",
      "Through his lawyer, Gotti categorically denied the allegations, saying they \"represent an affront to women who have truly suffered abuse\".",
      "Gotti is survived by his three children, Angie, Sonny and Jonathan Wilson; his mother, Nee Nee Lorenzo; sisters Tina and Angie; and his brother Chris Lorenzo, with whom he co-founded Murder Inc.",

    "story": [
      "The star of Spanish-language musical Emilia P\u00e9rez has said she will stay quiet for the rest of the film's Oscars campaign, after offensive comments she wrote in the past came to light.",
      "Tweets posted by best actress nominee Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n, mostly between 2019 and 2024, have caused significant fallout and left the film's awards campaign in disarray.",
      "Gasc\u00f3n has released several statements and given interviews since the controversy began, but in a new Instagram post she said she now wanted to step back and \"let the work talk for itself\".",
      "She added she hoped her silence would \"allow the film to be appreciated for what it is, a beautiful ode to love and difference\".",
      "Gasc\u00f3n had already pulled out of appearing at several awards season events in the coming days. It is not yet clear whether she will still attend the Oscars on 2 March.",
      "Her latest statement follows an interview the film's director Jacques Audiard gave to Deadline, in which he condemned Gasc\u00f3n's tweets and said he was no longer in contact with her.",
      "In her new statement, Gasc\u00f3n said: \"Following Jacques' interview that I understand, I decided, for the film, for Jacques, for the cast, for the incredible crew who deserves it, for the beautiful adventure we all had together, to let the work talk for itself.\"",
      "She also reiterated her regret for her original tweets, saying that she wanted to \"sincerely apologise to everyone who has been hurt along the way\".",

      "After they were brought to light, Gasc\u00f3n said she was \"deeply sorry to those I have caused pain\", adding that she is not racist and that many of her comments had been taken out of context.",
      "In the days since, Hollywood has distanced itself from her posts, while Netflix appears to have refocused its campaign efforts on the film's other nominees.",
      "Netflix has not publicly commented (BBC News approached the streamer for this article), but the company has been distancing itself from her comments in recent days.",
      "Here is how the campaign around Gasc\u00f3n has changed, following the controversy.",
      "Changing the promotional posters",
      "At this time of year, film studios take out advertisements intended to make a particular film more visible to awards voters.",
      "The movie will have already have had a separate promotional push at the time of its release, targeted at the public in the hope of securing high box office or streaming numbers.",
      "But the For Your Consideration (FYC) adverts which run during awards season are specifically intended to draw awards voters' attention to the categories the film has been nominated in at events such as the Baftas and Oscars.",
      "Previously, Gasc\u00f3n featured prominently in Netflix's publicity material, which reminded voters that she was nominated for best leading actress.",
      "But an updated FYC poster released on Monday almost entirely erased Gasc\u00f3n, instead making her co-stars Zoe Salda\u00f1a and Selena Gomez much more prominent.",
      "\"The shift suggests Netflix is trying to minimize Gasc\u00f3n's contributions so that the controversy around her remarks won't overshadow the film or the work of her co-stars and collaborators,\" suggested Variety's Clayton Davis.",
      "The CNN interview",
      "Gasc\u00f3n released several statements following the controversy, mostly via her social media accounts.",
      "But she also gave an emotional, hour-long sit-down interview to CNN en Espa\u00f1ol.",
      "It has since come to light that Gasc\u00f3n took part in the interview without the involvement or agreement of the film's PR team.",
      "The Hollywood Reporter said it had learned that the actress \"set up the interview on her own without the involvement of anyone working on the film, which was distributed by Netflix\".",
      "The fact that this line has been briefed to US journalists suggests Netflix is not only distancing itself from Gasc\u00f3n, but that the streamer's own PR team would not have signed off on such an interview being granted.",
      "Often, publicity teams advise a celebrity in crisis not to give too many interviews and statements, as it can keep a negative story alive for longer or even make the situation worse.",
      "Pulling out of events",
      "Gasc\u00f3n had been due to appear at several events in the next week or so.",
      "These included the AFI Awards luncheon, the Critics Choice Awards, the Directors Guild of America Awards, the Producers Guild of America Awards, and the Santa Barbara International Film Festival.",
      "However, the actress is now not expected to appear at any of them, as the turmoil continues.",
      "And that's not all. According to Variety, Netflix and the film's PR team have stopped talking directly with Gasc\u00f3n and are only communicating through an agent.",
      "The publication also reported the streamer \"is no longer covering expenses for her travel to the various awards shows or her styling for any appearances at these events\".",
      "It remains to be seen whether Gasc\u00f3n will attend the Oscars, which are scheduled to take place on 2 March.",
      "What happens to the 'Fab Five' Oscars format?",
      "Many film fans (ourselves included) love the so-called \"Fab Five\" format, which has been employed at some recent Oscars ceremonies.",
      "This sees five previous winners of a particular category take to the stage to present the latest winner with the same prize.",
      "For example, last year, Emma Stone was presented with the best actress trophy by previous winners Michelle Yeoh, Jennifer Lawrence, Sally Field, Jessica Lange and Charlize Theron.",
      "Traditionally, this format sees each of the previous winners deliver a short speech, paying tribute to the current nominees, before revealing the winner.",
      "However, it's understood that the Academy has moved away from doing this in the acting categories this year, which means no actress will be asked to praise Gasc\u00f3n's performance from the stage.",
      "Despite speculation, the decision appears to have been unprompted by the recent controversy.",
      "Instead, Variety reports the Academy decided to ditch the fab five format for the acting categories several weeks ago, before the tweets came to light, and instead is deploying it in different categories this year, such as best director.",
      "How could this impact Gasc\u00f3n's co-stars",
      "Emilia P\u00e9rez, a bonkers Spanish-language musical about a Mexican drug lord who changes gender, received 13 Oscar nominations, although it was not necessarily expected to be the biggest winner on the night.",
      "It has stiff competition in several categories, including best picture, but it was thought to be a frontrunner in a few in particular, such as best original song, and best supporting actress for Zoe Salda\u00f1a.",
      "It was widely thought Salda\u00f1a would run away with the trophy, not just for her acclaimed performance, but also because there is a lot of goodwill from voters because of her roles in box office smashes such as the Avatar and Marvel movies.",
      "After Gasc\u00f3n's tweets came to light, Salda\u00f1a said: \"It makes me really sad because I don't support [it], and I don't have any tolerance for any negative rhetoric towards people of any group.",
      "\"I can only attest to the experience that I had with each and every individual that was a part, that is a part, of this film, and my experience and my interactions with them was about inclusivity and collaboration and racial, cultural and gender equity. And it just saddens me.\"",
      "Then, on Sunday, Salda\u00f1a used her speech at the London Critics Circle Awards to tell the audience to be \"abstract with your idea of redemption\".",
      "Oscar voters and awards pundits will be watching forthcoming events such as the Bafta Film Awards and SAG Awards to see whether Salda\u00f1a can still follow through with her expected win.",
      "Meanwhile, director Jacques Audiard told Deadline he has avoided getting in touch with Gasc\u00f3n because \"right now she needs space to reflect and take accountability for her actions\".",
      "\"Very unfortunately, it is taking up all the space, and that makes me very sad,\" he said.",
      "\"It's very hard for me to think back to the work I did with Karla Sof\u00eda. The trust we shared, the exceptional atmosphere that we had on the set that was indeed based on trust.",
      "\"And when you have that kind of relationship and suddenly you read something that that person has said, things that are absolutely hateful and worthy of being hated, of course that relationship is affected. It's as if you fall into a hole. Because what Karla Sof\u00eda said is inexcusable.\"",
      "As for Emilia P\u00e9rez as a whole, the controversy could make its chances of a best picture win far less likely, particularly in a year where there is no breakout frontrunner for best picture.",

      "Combs was often \"prickly\", but Evans says power was transforming him. Just days before, the hip-hop mogul had received his biggest reward to date \u2013 $6m (\u00a34.8m) to mark the label's success, which boasted platinum-selling artists like The Notorious B.I.G.",
      "That year Combs's music career reached its peak, with his empire soon expanding into fashion, alcohol and even his own TV network.",
      "Nearly three decades on, his legacy is in ruins as he sits in jail awaiting trial on charges of sex trafficking and racketeering alongside battling dozens of lawsuits accusing him of drugging and assault at lavish parties, high-end hotels and in his label's recording studio. He denies all the allegations.",
      "Now the BBC has spoken to more than 20 people who worked with Combs at Bad Boy Records - including former executives, assistants and producers - who describe for the first time troubling incidents they say they witnessed during its 1990s rise.",
      "Some executives say they had concerns after seeing Combs having sex with women in the studio, including one incident where the employee says the young woman did not seem to react when he walked in. Another staff member complained Combs asked her to bring him condoms.",
      "The BBC also heard that corporate funds were used to fly in women from across the US for sex at the request of artists and other employees.",
      "\"There was a course of conduct that became more egregious over time and that conduct does go back to the 90s,\" says Tony Buzbee, a US lawyer representing dozens of alleged victims, including one who says Combs threatened to kill her in similar terms to the incident Evans says he witnessed.",
      "His client alleges Combs raped her on a bathroom floor at a promotional party held for The Notorious B.I.G., the label's biggest star, in 1995. She says in her lawsuit that afterwards, Combs told her not to tell anyone or \"you will disappear\".",
      "In a statement, Combs's legal team accused Buzbee of being \"more interested in media attention than the truth\" and said the hip-hop star \"never sexually assaulted or trafficked anyone\".",
      "The 55-year-old's lawyers said they had not been provided with sufficient details about the BBC's claims to present the facts that would \"counter these fabricated accusations\".",
      "\"As we've said before, Mr Combs cannot dignify every publicity stunt or facially absurd claim with a response. He has full confidence in the judicial process, where the truth will prevail: these accusations are pure fiction,\" they said.",
      "A brash go-getter, Sean Combs became an overnight millionaire when he launched Bad Boy Records in 1993 with a roster of top artists.",
      "It was Combs's first venture, having already built a name for himself as a talent director at another music label, Uptown Records, aged 19.",
      "\"He said that he wanted to be one of the biggest artists in the world and it didn't matter if I believed him or not,\" remembers Jimmy Maynes, a former Uptown colleague.",
      "Maynes remembers Combs having a short fuse in the office, sometimes banging \"his hands up against the desk\" like a \"bratty kid\" and yelling if he did not get his way.",
      "Combs was eventually fired from Uptown and at the age of 23 started Bad Boy Records.",
      "\"He's the hardest working man that I've ever met and always wanted people to match his energy,\" says Daniel Evans, a senior executive who managed Bad Boy's recording budgets and artists' contracts between 1994 and 1997.",
      "Combs described himself as the \"Great Gatsby\" and swiftly became known for hosting coveted celebrity bashes at New York nightclubs, on the beaches of Cancun, Mexico, and later infamous \"White Parties\" - named after the all-white dress code - in the Hamptons.",
      "Even President Donald Trump attended events in the 90s, says Evans, who once saw him sit on a golden throne at Combs's 30th birthday and exclaim: \"I'm the real King of New York!\"",
      "\"We were all really young. I was 24 years old,\" reflects Evans, who was one of the label's original employees. \"People wanted to party, have fun, hook up and build good memories.\"",
      "But looking back, Evans says he is troubled by some of the things he witnessed about his boss's behaviour and the company culture.",
      "In about 1995, he says he walked in on Combs having sex with a young woman at Daddy's House, Bad Boy's New York recording studio near Times Square.",
      "\"I was getting ready to go home for the night and looking for my jacket. Open the door and he's having sex with this girl,\" says Evans, who thought the studio was empty as it was silent. Combs swore and shouted at him to leave. \"I thought I was getting fired,\" he says.",
      "Evans remembers the young woman had been brought to the studio, presumably for a tour, by a party-promoter who was a friend of Combs. His boss seemed sober, while she was quiet and did not really talk, he says, wondering if she was high on drugs or just shy.",
      "He says it did not seem unusual at the time. But recalling how the woman did not react when he entered the room, he says: \"Knowing what I know now, there's a lot of speculation about what state she was in\u2026 usually both parties are very responsive during the act.\"",
      "Felicia Newsome, the manager of Daddy's House recording studio between 1994 and 2000, says inappropriate conduct in the music industry as a whole was rife at the time.",
      "\"It was abnormal if somebody reported it, but it wasn't abnormal for it to be happening,\" she says.",
      "Newsome says an employee once called her to the studio in the middle of the night because Combs was in his underwear, about to have sex with a model and another woman. He was demanding the staff member fetch him condoms, she recalls.",
      "\"I said to Puffy, don't ever ask anyone here to go and get condoms,\" says Newsome, who arrived while they were getting dressed again. \"He replied: 'I didn't need anything like that, ma,' and never did it again.\"",
      "Newsome, then in her 30s, says she found Combs reasonable and that he changed his behaviour when she challenged him. On one occasion, when the studio first opened in 1995, she says Combs was unhappy about the look of the countertops and called her a \"bitch\" in front of staff.",

      "She says she demanded a public apology and temporarily shut the studio, asking him: \"If I'm bringing women into this space, which is open 24 hours, how do you want to treat people?\"",
      "Combs responded that he wanted it to be an inclusive and safe environment, she says.",
      "But while Newsome ran the studio with an \"iron fist\", she says other staff were less comfortable calling Combs out.",
      "\"Bad Boy Records was a crazy house with a lot of young people who wanted to touch the King's robes,\" she says.",
      "Former staff say the label was run by twenty-something executives and a large number of interns, some of whom were of school age. There were often sexual relationships between employees and the interns, they say.",
      "Evans remembers an uncomfortable moment with a 14-year-old in his own team, who he says propositioned him.",
      "\"She says to me, you work really hard. If you ever want to like, get loose, you and I should kick it\u2026 but not tonight, I have a curfew.\"",
      "Evans says he sent her home and called the next day, telling her not to return to work. He did not report her, but two weeks later she was back working in the mailroom.",
      "Artists and other employees at Combs's record label would sometimes also request for women to be flown in to have sex at the studio, the former executive says.",
      "\"If they had a [sexual] specialty in something, they would be flown in,\" says Evans, who told the BBC he knew because he controlled the budgets. Money for the flights would be set aside and logged under travel, he adds.",
      "\"It was probably like thousands of dollars,\" says Evans. \"I don't think it happened all that often, but it was definitely a recording expense.\"",
      "Evans says Combs's own requests were managed by his personal assistants. One told the BBC that Combs would often ask them to fly in women he was \"messing around with\" and put them up in hotels, though the assistant said they were not sex workers.",
      "In the 2000s, the Daddy's House recording studio further changed, two former staff say, into a culture of \"sex, drugs and rock'n'roll\". Combs would regularly bring \"random women\" there to party, turning up with an entourage of dozens of people in \"three white jeeps, with white rims and white leather seats\", they say. Other artists would demand suitcases of Ciroc vodka and one even brought a monkey to a session, according to a former executive.",
      "The studio is one of the locations where women have since accused Combs of drugging and raping them. Model Crystal McKinney alleges the mogul plied her with alcohol and marijuana before sexually assaulting her there in 2003. That same year, a woman alleges that Combs and two associates gang raped her at the studio when she was 17.",
      "Combs's lawyers say he \"looks forward to proving his innocence\", adding that McKinney's claims are \"without merit\".",
      "Many ex-staff say they still find it hard to reconcile the allegations with the man they knew. \"These accusations are a surprise to me, as I am sure it is to many of our circle,\" says Jeffery Walker, a close friend of Combs who was part of Bad Boy's original production team. \"I've been to White Parties and of course studio sessions, and none of what he is accused of went down in my sight.\"",
      "Evans was also sceptical about some of the claims until he saw the footage of Casandra Ventura, Combs's ex-partner of 10 years and a former Bad Boy artist, being brutally beaten by the rapper in a hotel in Los Angeles in 2016.",
      "Ventura was the first person to sue Combs back in November 2023, alleging that he had trapped her in a cycle of abuse, violence, and sex trafficking during their relationship. Combs settled the lawsuit the next day for an undisclosed amount.",
      "\"It's not the first time I've seen that temper,\" recalls Evans, thinking back to the death threat he says he witnessed back in 1997. \"It's hard to see. The guy in the video with Cassie is almost identical to the guy who threatened the employee. So, you wonder, has anything changed?\"",
      "Over the years, Sean Combs has repeatedly reinvented himself - from Puff Daddy, to P Diddy and in recent years, \"Love\".",
      "\"If I'm acting crazy, like 'ahhh!' that's Diddy. If I'm dancing real smooth with a girl, that's Puff Daddy. And if I'm looking like I'm nervous or scared or shy, that's Sean,\" he said in an interview in 2015.",
      "With more details likely to emerge when he goes on trial in May, many of those who were close to the rapper are questioning whether they knew the real Sean Combs at all.",
      "\"One could think that he's just a disgusting human being, but that's not my memory of Puff,\" says Jimmy Maynes, who grew up with Combs in Mount Vernon, New York.",
      "But after a pause, he adds: \"Or maybe money just gives people the freedom to be exactly who they really are, and he was that guy all along.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 04 Feb 2025 00:13:23 GMT",
    "summary": "The breakout star of the film has been winning awards as a stripper who marries the son of an oligarch.",
    "story": [
      "In many ways Anora feels like a fairy tale. Except that the film's title character - Ani to her friends - is a stripper and occasional sex worker. And her Prince Charming is the spoiled son of a Russian oligarch.",
      "When he spontaneously proposes, and they get married in Las Vegas, it seems all her dreams are coming true. But she quickly finds that a host of people strongly disapprove of the match.",
      "For Mikey Madison though, it is a dream of a part, where she gets to display everything from steely strength to delicate fragility.",
      "\"I recognised from the beginning that she's a very complicated character, very nuanced,\" agrees Mikey Madison.",
      "\"I always felt that she was someone who was very vulnerable on the inside. But is constantly covering it up with this hardness or an  aggression. But I do think that she's quite soft inside.",
      "\"I think that she's hopeful that this is her happily ever after, and I think that it's an opportunity and I like that she doesn't want to let go of them. And so she's going to fight to the end to try to save it.\"",
      "Both the film, and Madison's performance in particular, have been gaining huge amounts of awards momentum. It started when the movie premiered at Cannes.",
      "\"I have been working for almost a decade now, well trying to work. And that was my ultimate dream, to go to Cannes. And we had a film in the main competition, and then we won [the top prize, the Palme D'Or] and that was crazy in itself.\"",
      "She calls \"everything that has followed\" an \"absolutely wonderful, pleasant surprise\".",
      "\"Especially because I think I went into it feeling really proud of the film, and like we made something special to us. And the fact that the film is also special to other people is wonderful.",
      "\"It's a dream.\"",
      "Madison was relatively unknown before Anora. She had had small parts in the fifth instalment of the Scream horror franchise and in Quentin Tarantino's Once Upon A Time in Hollywood.",
      "The writer and director of Anora Sean Baker had seen her on screen before, and wrote the part of Ani especially for her.",
      "\"She's so unique. Not only in her physicality, but there's something about her aura,\" says Baker. \"There's something.. she's actually quite subdued, even in real life. Her demeanour is, she's quite reserved.",
      "\"But then suddenly she can explode like no other other person I've ever seen, no other actor I've ever seen.",
      "\"And I was always looking forward to those moments shooting the film, knowing that a scene would call for that. You know, to see that you don't detect anything, and then suddenly just total eruption. It was incredible to watch.\"",
      "The contradictions in Ani, and the shifting genres of the movie were elements that Madison says she embraced strongly during the filming.",
      "\"As an actor sometimes I felt like I was shooting a very romantic film, and sometimes it was almost like a horror film, or a drama, or a slapstick comedy. To navigate through my character with all of these different genres was fun. It was a challenge, and I liked it!\"",
      "'Oscar talk'",
      "The 25-year-old has been nominated as best actress at every major awards ceremony, including the Golden Globes, the Batfas and the Oscars. And she is probably Demi Moore's main rival for best actress at the Academy Awards.",
      "Speaking before her Oscar nomination, she said it felt astonishing to be part of the awards conversation.",
      "\"I know that I'm incredibly overjoyed, honoured, and humbled that our film is being recognised in this way. But I'm just processing it.",
      "\"It's overwhelming and amazing, and all of the things,\" she says, giving every appearance of being overcome by the acclaim her performance has been gathering.",
      "Should Mikey Madison finish off a fairy tale few months by winning best actress at next month's ceremony, she'll be one of the youngest ever performers to win that academy award, beaten only by a handful of stars, including Jennifer Lawrence, Marlee Matlin, and Audrey Hepburn.",

      "His character Martin could escape Harry Potter in order to not remind himself of the pain of not getting the role, but Butterfield says it is harder to do that in real life due to social media.",
      "\"You have to treat social media really carefully as too much exposure to it can really mess with your head,\" he says.",

      "\"Cancelling, pushing, moving does not accomplish what us standing together\" does, Mr Mason argued in a webcast before the show. The show will be \"unifying and coming together, honouring music, but also using the power of music to heal, rebuild and provide services to people who need it\".",
      "\"I think this might be one of the most important Grammy weeks we've ever had.\"",

      "\"Visibility is very important for artists,\" Mr Horowitz told the BBC.",

      "\"I'm interested in the narratives behind that and I want to provoke people. I'm not doing things to be nice.\"",
      "Towards the end of the ceremony, the star's live performance of Von Dutch and Guess saw her transform the biggest and glitziest night in music into a packed and sweaty nightclub.",
      "Emerging from a black SUV, she strutted towards the camera, throwing a glass of champagne against the wall of a parking garage, before launching into what appeared to be an underground rave.",
      "As the performance progressed, she appeared on stage with model Julia Fox and hundreds of dancers, who were then showered in underwear (a reference to the song's lyrics).",
      "The Grammys said all of the unworn garments were donated to domestic violence survivors after the show.",
      "Highlight: This photo (1)",
      "I can't be the only person desperate to know what Taylor is whispering, right?",
      "HIGHLIGHT: This photo (2)",
      "Beyonc\u00e9's stunned reaction to winning best country album is a gif that will never stop gif-ing.",
      "LOWLIGHT (if you\u2019re Drake): Kendrick Lamar\u2019s clean sweep",
      "The Grammys have a wobbly history with hip-hop. They didn't introduce a rap category until 1989, a full decade after the Sugarhill Gang introduced the genre to a wide audience with Rapper's Delight. And no rap act has won album of the year since OutKast in 2001.",
      "So it was a rare victory when Compton-born rapper Kendrick Lamar won all five of the awards in which he was nominated for Not Like Us, a furious takedown of his musical rival, Drake.",
      "Among those awards were the prestigious record and song of the year - categories that have only ever recognised a rap song once before (Childish Gambino's This Is America in 2019).",
      "Lamar didn't perform at the ceremony - he plays the Super Bowl halftime show next week instead - but, dressed head to toe in denim, he delivered a powerful message to Grammy voters.",
      "\"At the end of the day, nothing is more powerful than rap music. I don't care what it is. We are the culture\u2026 respect the art form\".",
      "HIGHLIGHT: Janelle Mona\u00e9's moonwalk moment",
      "Music lost one of its biggest legends in 2024, when Quincy Jones died at the age of 91.",
      "As the producer for everyone from Frank Sinatra to Michael Jackson, the Grammys gave him a star-studded send-off that lasted almost 20 minutes.",
      "Cynthia Erivo and Herbie Hancock played a beautiful version of Fly Me To The Moon; while Stevie Wonder's sang We Are The World with choirs from two schools affected by the devastating LA fires.",
      "But it was Janelle Mona\u00e9's performance of Michael Jackson's Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough that blew the roof off.",
      "Dressed in MJ's Billie Jean outfit, she pirouetted and moonwalked and jumped on the tables as if she'd been possessed by the man himself.",
      "Towards the end of the performance, she threw off her jacket to reveal a t-shirt bearing the legend \"I Love QJ\".",
      "And guess who caught it and wore it for the rest of the night?",
      "Taylor Swift.",
      "LOWLIGHT: Snubs for Billie Eilish and Taylor Swift",
      "Even with 94 awards to consider, some people will get overlooked - but nobody expected two of the Grammys' biggest darlings to go home empty-handed.",
      "Taylor Swift was blanked despite scoring six nominations. Voters clearly decided that The Tortured Poets Department wasn't worthy of comparison with her four previous album of the year winners (Fearless, 1989, Folklore and Midnights).",
      "Billie Eilish's wipeout was even more unexpected. She had been the bookmakers' favourite for album of the year, for her third release Hit Me Hard And Soft - but she lost all seven of the categories she was nominated for.",
      "Still, there was a lot of competition this year, especially in the pop categories. And Swift has spoken in the past about how losing album of the year for Red inspired her pop opus, and biggest-seller to date, 1989.",
      "Don't count either of these artists out just yet.",
      "HIGHLIGHT: Trevor Noah's easy-going hosting",
      "There's a reason they keep inviting Trevor Noah back to host the Grammys: He's got the tone right.",
      "He's relaxed, he's engaged with the music, and his humour never punches down.",
      "Here are some of his best quips from the night:",
      "\"Yesterday, Beyonce announced her new tour. Everyone saw that. I will say, though, Beyonce, there's tariffs. We can't afford a new tour, right?

And you don't wanna mess with them.\"\"The Beatles are nominated tonight for Record of the Year. Yes, the legendary band from Liverpool used AI to put out a new song after 53 years.

    "published": "Wed, 05 Feb 2025 06:05:49 GMT",
    "summary": "Concerns have been raised over a \"significant growth\" in imported illegal nicotine pouches.",
    "story": [
      "High strength nicotine pouches that are being sold illegally in the UK could cause inadvertent overdosing and harm to teenagers and young adults, experts have warned.",
      "Nicotine pouches - small sachets that fit under the top lip - are largely unregulated and there is currently no law stopping children from buying them.",
      "Trading Standards teams in Oxfordshire, Berkshire and Dorset have made more than 1,500 seizures in the past year.",
      "The Oxfordshire team said it was seeing \"significant growth\" in illegal versions containing potentially dangerous levels of nicotine.",
      "The government said new legislation would stop nicotine products being marketed to children and it was investing \u00a330m in enforcement.",
      "During the last 12 months, Oxfordshire Trading Standards has seized more than 900 packets of non-compliant nicotine pouches from retailers and launched several criminal investigations.",
      "In Dorset, 844 seizures were made by officers and in Windsor and Maidenhead 21.",
      "Because the products are fairly new there are no specific regulations covering advertising, strength or age restrictions.",
      "Instead, they come under General Product Safety Regulations which means they need to be clearly labelled in English with safety guidelines.",
      "Jody Kerman, head of Trading Standards at Oxfordshire County Council said: \"Nicotine is a poison, you need to know who to contact if something goes wrong, what to do if you swallow it, how many is safe to have over a period of time.",
      "\"If it's not in English how are you supposed to know how to use it safely?\"",
      "He added that he suspects much of the growth in interest in these products is from footballers, influencers and social media.",
      "A recent study found one in five professional footballers surveyed was using nicotine pouches and nearly half wanted to quit.",
      "The general use of nicotine pouches remains low in Great Britain, with research suggesting about five percent of adults and three percent of under-18s having ever tried them.",
      "What are the potential harms?",
      "Nicotine pouches are often presented in bright packaging with appealing flavours to make them more attractive to young users.",
      "They are sometimes informally referred to as 'snus' - although that is a tobacco product that has been banned in the UK and EU since 1992.",
      "While they are less harmful than smoking, they are highly addictive and not recommended for teenagers or non-smokers.",
      "Most pouches contain six to 20 milligrams (mg) of nicotine while some products contain 50mg - that is about five times stronger than an average cigarette.",
      "Some illegal pouches claim to contain as much as 150mg of nicotine, although tests conducted on behalf of Trading Standards found actual levels varied greatly.",
      "The World Health Organisation said there was a lack of data on the long-term health impact of using nicotine pouches and recommended policy makers should minimise the product's appeal and uptake among young people.",
      "Rachel Ward, a GP in Oxfordshire, warned against buying products not labelled in English saying that teenagers and young people could be exposed to dangerous levels of nicotine: \"Nicotine is a highly addictive substance, people compare it to other significant drugs like heroin and cocaine.",
      "\"Nicotine effects every organ system in our body, it has an effect on the brain, on our heart.",
      "\"It is a stimulant that will generally heighten your awareness, agitation, potential anxiety, physical symptoms like being a bit jittery, palpitations, dry mouth, so generally not pleasant symptoms.\"",
      "Brett Crundwell, owner of Triumph Vapes in Didcot, said he was put off nicotine pouches after he experienced a nasty reaction to one at a trade show: \"After 20 seconds it was stinging so I moved it to another part of my lip.",
      "\"I turned to speak to one of my friends and my gums were bleeding.",
      "\"I had a sore on my gums where I first put it on and one of my friend's daughters, who was on a stand with us, tried one and she said 'I've just been to the toilet and I was physically sick after trying this pouch'.\"",

      "Inside one of Nottingham's busiest hospitals stands an abandoned clinic where plaster is peeling off the walls, ceilings have caved in and standing water floods the corridor.",
      "\"This is what can happen when infrastructure issues are left untreated,\" said head of estates Michael Soroka during a visit by the BBC.",
      "Other hospital employees said they were concerned other wards could \"follow the same fate\" as plans to rebuild and improve Nottingham's Queen's Medical Centre (QMC) and City Hospital were delayed until 2037 at the earliest by the government.",
      "The Department of Health and Social Care said the government inherited a \"crumbling NHS\" and the new timeline was \"realistic and deliverable\".",
      "The former pain clinic in the QMC's south block previously saw hundreds of patients per year.",
      "It had fewer than a dozen rooms and treated people with both neurological and physical pain as part of an outpatient service.",
      "Over time, poor infrastructure, including old pipes leaking in the mechanical room above, escalated to a point where the clinic had multiple safety hazards and became unusable.",
      "It has been abandoned for the last seven years.",
      "Mr Soroka, 48, who is based at the QMC, described the state of the former unit as \"shameful\".",
      "He said: \"It is embarrassing to see the state the clinic is in now. Catastrophic leaks caused this and it became impossible to maintain.",
      "\"We need new pipes badly. Pipe and ventilation issues impact every floor.\"",
      "The pipework in the hospital was built in 1976 and most of the site's \"plant rooms\" share the same pipework as the former pain clinic.",
      "Plant rooms store equipment, like pipes, that keep the building running safely.",
      "Mr Sokora added: \"The equipment in our plant rooms is coming towards the end its life.",
      "\"This could cause further leaks if it isn't replaced soon enough.",
      "\"We are full here at the QMC. Space is a premium, so it's a real shame that this clinic is now unusable.\"",
      "The lack of space at the hospital has become more apparent in recent years.",
      "In winter 2023, patients \"lined corridors\" as the hospital ran out of bed space in its A&E department.",
      "The QMC is also experiencing problems on wards that currently treat patients.",
      "Mr Soroka said: \"We do have leaks on some wards - one on the F floor floods regularly.",
      "\"Any issues are patched up quickly to ensure they are safe for patients and staff, but the root problems aren't addressed.",
      "\"The team here keeps the hospital running on the face of it, but behind the scenes, behind closed doors, we are struggling.\"",
      "Improving the pipe works and general maintenance is part of the hospital's rebuilding plan, but Mr Soroka fears waiting over a decade for improvements is \"too long\".",
      "At the trust's City Hospital, two wings of the St Francis building, dating back to the 1900s, are also abandoned.",
      "The space was formerly patient wards and more recently became finance offices, but they are now empty.",
      "Leaks in the roof and a failure of the steam system meant it became \"uneconomical\" to keep repairing the space.",
      "A spokesperson for Nottingham University Hospitals (NUH) NHS Trust, which runs the QMC and City Hospital, said: \"The building itself can withstand the test of time, and with proper investment could become an excellent space for us to use.\"",

      "The QMC and City Hospital were included in the Conservative government pledge to build 40 new hospitals by 2030.",

      "Labour Health Secretary Wes Streeting declared last month work will not commence until 2037.",
      "The plans for 40 new hospitals by 2030 were a Conservative election promise, he said, adding they were not affordable.",

      "Its plans included a new centre for women, children and families, and a bespoke cancer care building.",
      "Phil Britt, director of major programmes at NUH, which includes Tomorrow's NUH, said: \"We spent years developing these plans because we want to make great changes to the hospital.",

      "They were offered a test, known as chorionic villus sampling (CVS), to check if their baby had any genetic or chromosomal conditions.",
      "Two days later, the foetal care team at City Hospital in Nottingham told them the initial results indicated their daughter had a rare genetic condition called Patau's Syndrome, which often results in miscarriage, stillbirth, or the baby dying shortly after birth.",
      "Ms Wesson, 43, says she had a conversation shortly afterwards with a foetal care consultant.",
      "She says she was told her baby would be left with severe care needs, and that it may not survive the pregnancy.",
      "\"It's the most impossible choice we've ever had to make. We thought the best option was to end the pregnancy because the baby was suffering.\"",
      "Results from a more detailed analysis of the sample were due back two weeks later.  The couple asked if it might show a different outcome, but they say their consultant advised them it would not.",

      "\"It's just an awful, impossible situation,\" says Ms Wesson. \"There was no good outcome, we had no hope.\"",
      "Six weeks after the abortion, they were asked to attend a meeting at City Hospital, which they assumed was a routine follow-up.",
      "\"[The consultant] just walked in and the first thing she said was 'I have got something to tell you, your results have changed',\" says Ms Wesson.",
      "The second test, called a long term CVS culture, showed their daughter, who the couple had nicknamed Ladybird, had no chromosomal abnormality.",
      "When they asked if their daughter would have survived, Ms Wesson says the doctor told the couple: \"Well, you could have miscarried anyway.\"",
      "\"That's always stuck with me - it was almost malicious,\" she says.",
      "An investigation into the death carried out by the trust said the second test showed \"all 50 cells studied had a normal chromosome compliment\".",
      "The first test result - which the couple say was the basis on which they decided to terminate the pregnancy - had been a false positive.",
      "This is \"a well-recognised hazard of early CVS results\", the investigation found.",
      "The trust, it concluded, \"must take responsibility for an outcome which would not have occurred were it not for a series of deficiencies in care, knowledge and process, all lining up together\".",
      "\"Although not absolutely certain, it seems highly probable that the pregnancy was, in fact, chromosomally normal,\" it said.",

While words will never change the outcome, I can assure them and other families that we have investigated and learnt from this tragic case.",

      "Wrong diagnosis",
      "Another family, who wish to remain anonymous, have told the BBC they ended their pregnancy in 2017 after they too were incorrectly told their baby had a genetic condition.",
      "Following a routine scan at 20 weeks, they say they were told there may be some abnormal development and\u202fwere referred to a foetal care consultant at City Hospital.",
      "A few days later, they were informed their baby likely had a life-limiting illness. As the condition was inherited, the parents were genetically tested to see if they were carriers, which the trust completed and promised expedited results.",
      "The BBC is not identifying the condition to protect the family's privacy, at their request.",
      "Several weeks later, with the results still not in, the family say the hospital called to tell them they had less than 24 hours to decide whether to terminate the pregnancy as it would be more complicated to carry out later.",
      "By this point, the pregnancy was just one day under 24 weeks, the legal limit for an abortion in most circumstances.",
      "Given the clear advice from doctors - that the baby might not survive or die shortly after birth, or have a life-limiting condition - the couple decided to end the pregnancy.",
      "When a post-mortem was carried out, the baby was found not to have the condition. The trust, they say, has never provided them with an explanation for the wrong diagnosis.",
      "\"I kept calling the hospital every day asking for those test results, I had my very much-wanted baby kicking inside me,\" the mother told the BBC.",
      "\"I needed to know whether to disconnect from the pregnancy, as I didn't know if my baby would survive. They never explained we had this time pressure. Then I got a frantic call in the late afternoon one day telling me we had to decide by the following day to terminate or it would be too late.\u202fIt was horrific.\"",

      "Triple killer Valdo Calocane was not forced to take his anti-psychotic medication in part because he did not like needles, a major review of his NHS care has revealed.",
      "The detail was published among a catalogue of failings identified by an independent report, which revealed \"the system got it wrong\" with Calocane, who stabbed to death Barnaby Webber, Grace O'Malley-Kumar and Ian Coates in Nottingham in June 2023.",
      "It laid out how Calocane, who has paranoid schizophrenia, had no contact with mental health services or his GP for about nine months prior to the killings - after he was discharged when he repeatedly failed to engage with them.",
      "Mr Webber's mother Emma described the report as a \"horror show\".",
      "In response, the government repeated its commitment to a public inquiry into the attacks, with work ongoing to establish its scope.",
      "The NHS said it had taken the decision to publish the report in full, in line with the wishes of the families, and \"given the level of detail already in the public domain\".",
      "The independent review, by Theemis Consulting, looked into the treatment given to Calocane by Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust prior to the killings, as well as the interactions the NHS had with other agencies involved in his care.",
      "The key findings of the report include:",
      "Calocane's risk \"was not fully understood, managed, documented or communicated\"There were missed opportunities to take more assertive action towards Calocane's careThe voice of Calocane's family \"was not effectively considered to support the dynamic evaluation of risk\" during his treatmentOther patients under the care of the same trust, some of whom had been discharged, had also perpetrated acts of \"serious violence\" across 15 incidents between 2019 and 2023Calocane had no contact with mental health services or his GP for about nine months prior to the killings",
      "Calocane's risk \"was not fully understood, managed, documented or communicated\"",
      "There were missed opportunities to take more assertive action towards Calocane's care",
      "The voice of Calocane's family \"was not effectively considered to support the dynamic evaluation of risk\" during his treatment",
      "Other patients under the care of the same trust, some of whom had been discharged, had also perpetrated acts of \"serious violence\" across 15 incidents between 2019 and 2023",
      "Calocane had no contact with mental health services or his GP for about nine months prior to the killings",
      "The case, which resulted in Calocane being sentenced to a hospital order in January 2024, sparked a number of reviews including the mental health homicide review, commissioned by NHS England.",
      "Another, by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), is looking into both Leicestershire and Nottinghamshire Police.",
      "A review into the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) found while prosecutors had been right to accept Calocane's pleas of manslaughter on the basis of diminished responsibility, they could have handled the case better.",
      "And in May, a judge ruled Calocane's sentence was not unduly lenient.",
      "Speaking after the release of the new report on Wednesday, Mrs Webber said: \"It's been additional trauma, horror, disbelief and fury - but all of that was anticipated and expected by all three families.\"",
      "She added: \"It leaves us feeling horrified, heartbroken, but even more determined now to make sure that it's addressed - that the government and the agencies react and listen properly.\"",
      "Mrs Webber also revealed she had been contacted by the family of one of the Southport stabbing victims.",
      "\"It's very rare that you can say to someone 'I know how dreadful that is' and know that that person really does know,\" she said.",
      "In an interview on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Ian Coates's son James said the main focus was to keep working to make sure mistakes were not repeated.",
      "\"I know my father would be proud of me to keep fighting,\" he said.",
      "Health Secretary Wes Streeting said the government had worked with NHS England to ensure the report was published in full.",
      "\"Sunlight is the best disinfectant,\" he said. \"The findings will help to support an inquiry into this attack and we'll set out the next steps as this develops.\"",
      "He added he had called for all the recommendations made in a previous Care Quality Commission (CQC) report into the case to be implemented across the country.",
      "The new report also sets out the contact Calocane had with mental health services before he killed Mr Webber, Ms O'Malley-Kumar and Mr Coates, and then stole Mr Coates's van before driving it into three pedestrians - Wayne Birkett, Marcin Gawronski and Sharon Miller - all of whom were seriously injured.",
      "The report states the former University of Nottingham student first came into contact with mental health services on 24 May 2020, when he was 28, when he was arrested for criminal damage to a neighbour's flat.",
      "It was documented that Calocane's behaviour was an episode of psychosis brought on by the stress of course work and a forthcoming exam, coupled with a lack of sleep.",
      "Shortly after returning to his home, Calocane again tried to gain access to a neighbour's flat. His neighbour was so frightened that she jumped from a first-floor window, sustaining back injuries which required surgery.",
      "Calocane was then detained for the first time under section 2 of the Mental Health Act, which meant he could be kept in hospital against his will for up to 28 days - known as a \"section\".",
      "Subsequent contacts with services saw him labelled as having paranoid schizophrenia.",
      "After about a month in hospital, Calocane was sent home with reviews expected from the community crisis team and the early intervention in psychosis (EIP) service.",
      "He was initially called by the crisis team. The contact was a phone call rather than a face-to-face appointment \"because of Covid-19 restrictions at the time\".",
      "His family expressed concerns because they felt he could \"play down his symptoms\" over the phone.",
      "In July 2020, Calocane was admitted to hospital for a second time after forcibly entering a neighbour's flat.",
      "He was sectioned again, this time under section 3 of the Mental Health Act, which allows for a longer hospital stay of up to six months.",
      "According to medical records shared by Calocane's family with BBC Panorama, while Calocane was ill in hospital, a psychiatrist observed that \"there seems to be no insight or remorse and the danger is that this will happen again and perhaps Valdo will end up killing someone\".",
      "Two weeks after this entry was made, Calocane was discharged from Highbury Hospital.",
      "According to the report, his family \"felt this was a real missed opportunity to fully understand [Calocane's] diagnosis, risk and to get to grips with a treatment plan that [Calocane] was concordant with\".",
      "Three months before his third hospital admission in August 2021, Calocane's family again reported concerns over his mental health.",
      "At the end of August, his care co-ordinator visited him at home with a colleague, noting that he was no longer taking his medication and had no intention of continuing treatment.",
      "A month later, the report said he had \"significantly assaulted\" police officers who attended in support of a Mental Health Act assessment.",
      "On a number of occasions, his care co-ordinator had suggested the use of depot medication - which releases slowly over time meaning patients need to administer medications less frequently.",
      "But, the report said, the inpatient teams were trying to treat him \"in the least restrictive way\", and took on board his reasons for not wanting to take injectable depot medication, \"which included him not liking needles\".",
      "After multiple missed appointments, in January 2022, officials contemplated discharging Calocane from the EIP service due to a lack of engagement.",
      "But the following day, the EIP learned Calocane had trapped two housemates in their flat, which resulted in the police being called.",
      "He was assessed under the Mental Health Act, but not detained.",
      "Calocane was admitted to hospital at the end of January 2022 for almost a month - his fourth hospital admission.",
      "After being discharged, it was noted that none of Calocane's care providers should visit him at home alone because of his \"history of violence and aggression\".",
      "Calocane then missed a few appointments to collect his medication over the coming months, and a new care co-ordinator tried to contact him multiple times.",
      "After these failed attempts, a decision was taken in September 2022 to discharge Calocane from the EIP service to his GP.",
      "The report said \"opportunities to assertively try to reach out to [Calocane] when he disengaged from services were limited\" because of pressures in the team.",
      "\"Due to multiple factors, including workload, the discharge system did not function as intended,\" the report said.",
      "'Watershed moment'",
      "It added there was no contact between Calocane and mental health services, or his GP, for roughly nine months from this time until the killings.",
      "Dr Jessica Sokolov, regional medical director at NHS England (Midlands), said it was \"clear the system got it wrong\" and apologised to the victims \"on behalf of the NHS and the organisations involved\" in Calocane's care.",
      "Claire Murdoch, NHS England's national mental health director, said the organisation had asked every mental health trust to review the report findings.",
      "Marjorie Wallace, chief executive of mental health charity Sane, said the publication of the review \"should act as a watershed moment revealing the truth and honouring the needs of the families of victims of homicides by people with mental illness or disorder\".",
      "In a statement, Calocane's family said they were \"deeply sorry\" for \"this horrific tragedy\".",
      "They said: \"The report confirms what we and many others have known for a while: the mental healthcare system is in crisis and in need of immediate intervention, which we believe must come from the government. It is not enough to say that the NHS failed; we must be honest in recognising that the NHS has been set up for failure, and cannot be left to fix itself on its own.\"",
      "The chief executive of the Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, Ifti Majid, added: \"We apologise unreservedly for the opportunities we missed in the care of Valdo Calocane and accept the Theemis report in its entirety including its findings and recommendations.",

    "summary": "Ricky Sawyer gave out medication illegally and some of his clients needed emergency hospital treatment.",
    "story": [
      "A self-styled \"beauty consultant\", whose celebrity client list includes Katie Price, is offering potentially dangerous cosmetic procedures to clients and handing over medication illegally - a BBC investigation has discovered.",
      "Ricky Sawyer specialises in liquid Brazilian butt-lifts (BBLs) - which involves injecting dermal filler into buttocks to lift them and make them look bigger.",
      "BBC News has spoken to five of his clients who needed emergency hospital treatment after their procedures. We have also been shown the testimonies of more than 30 women who say they have been left with serious complications such as sepsis and necrosis (tissue death).",
      "One woman told us she felt at the time she would rather \"have died\" than continue with the pain she was in following the treatment.",
      "Several local authorities have banned Mr Sawyer from practising in their areas.",
      "Our undercover filming captured Mr Sawyer handing out antibiotics without a valid prescription - a criminal offence. He is not qualified to prescribe and the pills were not labelled for a specific patient.",
      "He also offered to inject increasing doses of local anaesthetic without a prescriber present - again illegal - and did not ask for our reporter's weight, thus putting her at risk of an overdose.",
      "Posing as a potential client and her friend, we had booked a 45-minute appointment with Mr Sawyer through his Instagram page. We told him we wanted a 200ml (7fl oz) liquid BBL injection costing \u00a31,200. We paid a \u00a3200 deposit.",
      "Despite having advertised that all liquid BBLs would be carried out under the guidance of an \"ultrasound specialist doctor\", none was present at his pop-up clinic. He was working out of a small room in an east London office block - a non-clinical environment which would have increased the risk of infection.",
      "Within five minutes of being in his office, Mr Sawyer had begun to encourage our reporter to think about increasing the amount of filler. \"You might be surprised about how much product you can have and still look natural,\" he suggested.",
      "By the end of the appointment, Mr Sawyer had offered to inject a litre of filler - 500ml (almost a pint) per buttock - at a cost of \u00a32,000.",
      "We did not go through with it and later returned to put our allegations to him - but he refused to answer our questions and slammed the door on our reporter.",
      "Reviewing our footage, plastic surgeon Dalvi Humzah, who sits on the Joint Council of Cosmetic Practitioners, said Mr Sawyer's actions were \"shocking\", \"very dangerous\", and putting patients at a huge risk of infection and potentially fatal complications.",
      "\"Putting that volume in, in one sitting, is really dangerous,\" said Mr Humzah. \"The buttocks are such a large area that if they become infected it can overwhelm the body and could end in sepsis - or even death.\"",
      "The filler used for liquid BBLs is often made up of hyaluronic acid, which is commonly used in facial filling treatments. Because large amounts of the acid are involved in BBLs, and there is a risk of serious side effects such as blood clots and sepsis, it is regarded as one of the most dangerous cosmetic procedures.",
      "Mr Sawyer boasted on camera that he did up to seven procedures a day, six days a week. He can charge thousands of pounds per appointment.",
      "One of the women who said she had experienced serious complications after receiving a liquid BBL from Mr Sawyer was Joanne. A mum of two from south Wales, who only wants us to use her first name, she travelled seven hours to Essex for the treatment.",
      "Having had other cosmetic treatments before and having been persuaded by Ricky Sawyer's many adverts and celebrity endorsements, a liquid BBL didn't seem like such a big step to her.",
      "All she wanted, she says, was a \"peachy bum\".",
      "But when Joanne arrived, she began to have second thoughts.",
      "She had only been sent a postcode and says she seemed to be walking into an industrial estate.",
      "In the end, she found a small door into a block of flats and says she was told to wait in a \"dingy little hallway\" for about half an hour.",
      "\"I should have turned and ran,\" she says, \"but I had paid \u00a3600 deposit and travelled all this way.\"",
      "She was taken into a small room where there \"was only a bed, a tiny stool and a worktop\", and that is where she says she first met Ricky Sawyer.",
      "After counting out the rest of her cash - \u00a32,000 in total - she says he told her to stand in front of him while he sat on the stool.",
      "As he started to inject her with a litre (1.8 pints) of filler, the pain quickly became unbearable.",
      "\"I felt dizzy, sick and like shaky. My legs didn't even move properly. And that was all within a minute of him starting,\" she says. \"I remember looking round and he had white gloves on that were full of blood.\"",
      "By the end of the procedure, Joanne was in agony: \"I was in so much pain, my bottom was completely disfigured.\"",
      "She says she could barely sit down. By the time she got home the swelling had started and she could hardly walk.",
      "\"I messaged Ricky loads of times to say how bad I was feeling and how worried I was. He just told me to take my antibiotics.\"",
      "By this point, sepsis had begun to set in.",
      "\"My temperature kept on going up and I felt terrible,\" says Joanne. \"I had to phone 999. I was dripping with sweat and screaming.\"",
      "In hospital, she was attached to intravenous antibiotics. At one point, a surgeon drew on her buttock to indicate where they might need to cut, because the infection was spreading so quickly.",
      "After messaging Ricky Sawyer saying she was in hospital with sepsis, she says he blocked her from his Instagram account.",
      "Fortunately, Joanne did not need an operation.",
      "Another of Mr Sawyer's clients, Louise Moller, did need life-saving emergency surgery.",
      "Four days after receiving a liquid BBL at his Essex clinic in October 2023, the 28-year-old from Bolton was in hospital.",
      "She rang her mother, Janet, from Salford Royal's A&E department saying: \"Mum, I think I'm going to die.\"",
      "Louise had contracted sepsis and was warned by surgeons that she could die at any minute. To stop the infection from moving through her body, they cut dead tissue out of an area almost covering her entire left buttock.",
      "Janet promised her daughter she would prevent this from happening to anyone else and reported Ricky Sawyer to their local police station in Bolton.",
      "\"How can he carry on knowing he could kill someone?\" she told the BBC.",
      "However, Louise's case highlights the difficulty in holding practitioners like him accountable.",
      "Janet says she was told by police in Bolton that the file would need to be passed to Essex Police, where the incident happened.",
      "A prosecution could be difficult however, she was warned, because Louise had signed a consent form.",
      "BBC News has approached both Greater Manchester Police and Essex Police to get an update on the case - both have said it is down to the other to investigate.",
      "From a legal point of view, there is little to stop Mr Sawyer from practising.",
      "Injecting dermal fillers is seen as non-surgical and is unregulated, which means anyone can do it - and they can't be struck off and stopped.",
      "In September 2024, Alice Webb is believed to have become the first person to die after receiving a liquid BBL in the UK. Her procedure was not carried out by Ricky Sawyer.",
      "Following her death, Save Face - a group that campaigns for greater regulation to cover non-surgical procedures - called for a new law banning liquid BBLs from being carried out by anyone other than surgeons registered with the General Medical Council (GMC).",
      "Save Face's founder, Ashton Collins, says her organisation has received complaints from 39 women about Ricky Sawyer.",
      "All the women, she says, have told her they have been left needing urgent hospital treatment. Each of them, she says, had a BBL and suffered complications such as sepsis, necrosis and disfigurement.",
      "\"We've encouraged these women to report their experiences to the police,\" she says. \"Some have, and nothing has been done.\"",
      "So far, the most effective action has been taken by local authorities, three of which - Glasgow City Council, Epping Forest District Council and Brentwood Council -  confirmed they had issued prohibition notices under Health and Safety law to protect the public from serious injury.",
      "But \"he just moves on to different areas of the country and carries on\", says Ms Collins.",
      "We put our evidence to the Department of Health and Social Care which said it was \"urgently looking at options for tougher regulation\".",
      "It said our findings were \"shocking\" and that those caught \"dispensing medication without a licence should feel the full force of the law\".",
      "We attempted to put our allegations to Ricky Sawyer in person, by confronting him at his east London clinic.",
      "As soon as he saw the camera he tried to slam the door on us, before hiding behind it.",
      "We asked him if he was breaking the law by handing out prescription-only medicine, and if he had anything to say to the women who say they were left with such serious injuries that they needed emergency care.",
      "\"No,\" he said - and told us to leave.",
      "The dangers of unregulated cosmetic surgery should be taken far more seriously, says Ashton Collins.",
      "\"The general vibe that you pick up is that these are silly women that have made silly choices, driven through vanity, and it's their own fault.\"",
      "It is an attitude that needs to change, she adds: \"People are out there taking risks with people's lives, and they can do so with impunity.\"",

    "story": [
      "Child killer Lucy Letby did not murder any babies, a panel of international medical experts reviewing evidence in her case has claimed.",
      "Chairman Dr Shoo Lee told a press conference \"in all cases death or injury were due to natural causes or just bad medical care\".",
      "Letby, who is serving 15 whole life sentences for murdering seven babies and attempting to murder seven others between 2015 and 2016, has already lost two bids to appeal against her convictions.",
      "The panel's findings are likely to form part of an application which has been made by her lawyers to the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) for her case to be investigated as a potential miscarriage of justice.",
      "The lengthy and medically technical press conference was organised by Letby's legal team who had said the panel would present \"significant new medical evidence\".",
      "Dr Lee, a Canadian neonatal care expert, said there were alternative explanations for each of Letby's convictions for murder or attempted murder.",
      "He said he became involved in the case after learning that an academic paper he co-authored on air embolism, one of the methods Letby was said to have used to attack babies, had formed part of the prosecution case in her trial.",
      "Dr Lee said the 14 experts, including medical professionals from Canada, the US, Japan, Germany, Sweden and the UK, had looked at 17 cases at the heart of Letby's prosecution and had compiled an \"impartial evidence-based report\".",
      "The report presented at the conference was a summary of the panel's findings, and the full report would be submitted to Letby's legal team, Dr Lee said.",
      "Dr Lee provided what he said were highly detailed grounds baby-by-baby for concluding that none of the murders occurred.",
      "He added: \"We did not find any murders. In all cases, death or injury were due to natural causes or just bad medical care.\"",
      "\"Lucy was charged with seven murders and seven attempted murders\", he said.",
      "\"In our opinion, the medical opinion, the medical evidence doesn't support murder in any of these babies.",
      "\"Our full report will go to Lucy's barrister later this month, and then it'll be up to him and the courts to decide what next to do.\"",
      "During Letby's trial, the prosecution referred to the 1989 paper by Dr Lee that looked at cases of air embolus, referring to injuries caused when air is injected into a baby's arteries or veins after staff at the Countess of Chester reported skin discoloration on some of the babies.",
      "In the cases Dr Lee analysed in his paper, those injuries had happened accidentally.",
      "The prosecution argued that one of the methods Letby used to injure or kill babies was to inject air into their veins and used Dr Lee's paper to back that claim.",
      "In the paper, Dr Lee described a distinct discoloration on the babies' skin in 10% of cases.",
      "'Scrutinised'",
      "However, at the press conference Dr Lee said in all of the cases in his paper air was injected into the babies' arteries, not their veins.",
      "He said that the skin discolouration described in the paper was not possible when air was injected into the veins.",
      "Dr Lee said he had recently updated his academic paper and found no cases of skin discolouration linked to air embolism by the venous system.",
      "He prefaced his remarks by saying that the thoughts of each panel member were with the families of the babies who had died.",
      "Former neonatal nurse Letby, now 35, lost two bids to challenge her convictions at the Court of Appeal last year.",
      "The prosecution's medical case was scrutinised by the Court of Appeal in May last year and found to be safe - and the judges noted Letby herself did not present any experts at her trial offering an alternative view.",
      "Dr Lee had offered to give evidence to the Court of Appeal as part of Letby's application for permission to appeal, but three senior judges said his conclusions did not undermine her convictions.",
      "The judges concluded there had been no prosecution expert evidence diagnosing air embolus solely on the basis of skin discolouration.",
      "Earlier, the CCRC said Letby's lawyers had applied to the commission to investigate her case as a potential miscarriage of justice.",
      "The body said it would now assess the application and determine whether there was new evidence which presented a reasonable chance of a conviction being overturned.",
      "A CCRC spokesperson said: \"We are aware that there has been a great deal of speculation and commentary surrounding Lucy Letby's case, much of it from parties with only a partial view of the evidence.",
      "\"We ask that everyone remembers the families affected by events at the Countess of Chester Hospital between June 2015 and June 2016.\"",
      "Mark McDonald, Letby's barrister, said that because her previous legal team had not called a medical expert at her trial, the information presented was \"new, fresh evidence\".",
      "He said the nurse was convicted because of the medical evidence, and if that was wrong any circumstantial evidence would \"fall away\".",
      "\"The most important thing, the reason why Lucy Letby was convicted, was because of the medical evidence that was presented to the jury that today has been demolished,\" he said.",
      "Veteran MP Sir David Davis, who has been assisting Letby's legal team, described her convictions as \"one of the major injustices of modern times\".",

    "published": "Sat, 01 Feb 2025 00:51:57 GMT",
    "summary": "Trading Standards says adverts for heated tobacco products are banned, but some supermarkets disagree.",
    "story": [
      "Sainsbury's and Morrisons are displaying adverts for tobacco products in their stores which Trading Standards says are against the law.",
      "Video screens and posters promote devices that deliver nicotine by heating tobacco rather than burning it.",
      "The two supermarkets say they believe the laws banning tobacco advertising do not apply to the devices.",
      "Heated tobacco is less harmful than cigarettes, but experts say it is probably more harmful than vapes, and less effective at helping smokers quit.",
      "Tobacco adverts were banned in 2002. But if you walk into a Sainsbury's or a Morrisons you may well see adverts for iQos, a device that uses an electric current to heat tobacco.",
      "Some are on flashing video screens in places where they can easily be seen by children. The BBC has also seen adverts in Morrisons for a similar device called Ploom.",
      "Heated tobacco is different from vapes, which contain nicotine but no tobacco, and they are much less popular. But tobacco companies are keen to promote it as a new revenue stream to replace dwindling cigarette sales.",
      "The Chartered Trading Standards Institute (CTSI), which represents local authority trading standards teams, says the ads are \"prohibited\" by the 2002 law.",
      "CTSI says the issue has never been tested in court, so it cannot say conclusively that running them is illegal.",
      "\"The only people who can definitively test it are the courts. Now the courts are chocka. Trading Standards is very stretched, and I think that's probably the reason why you're seeing more and more of these ads,\" Kate Pike, lead officer for tobacco and vaping at CTSI, told the BBC.",
      "\"It's taking the mick, is my view.\"",
      "There is limited evidence regarding the health effects of heated tobacco, according to Prof Lion Shahab, co-director of the tobacco and alcohol research group at University College, London.",
      "\"As it involves no combustion, heated tobacco is likely less harmful than cigarettes,\" he said.",
      "\"Current findings suggest that heated tobacco may be more harmful than e-cigarettes, and less effective at helping smokers give up cigarettes long-term.\"",
      "How are the vaping rules changing?",
      "How many people still smoke in the UK?",
      "In June 2018, then-health minister Steve Brine wrote to the company that makes iQos, Philip Morris International (PMI), to say advertising for it was \"prohibited\" and to ask them to \"desist from such promotion in the future\".",
      "Two months later, he wrote to thank them for \"agreeing to comply with our request to stop advertising and promoting the iQos device\".",
      "PMI says it only agreed to suspend advertising, not stop.",
      "A spokesperson said: \"We maintain our view that communications regarding the iQos device at appropriate points of sale is lawful.\"",
      "Japan Tobacco International (JTI), which makes Ploom, said the 2002 law defines a tobacco product as something that is \"smoked, sniffed, sucked or chewed\", and because heated tobacco products do not produce smoke, they aren't covered by that definition.",
      "Morrisons cited the same argument. \"On that basis, we are comfortable that it is legal for heated tobacco products to be advertised in store,\" it said.",
      "Sainsbury's said the ads were \"in line with current tobacco legislation\".",
      "Both supermarkets say they do not sell the devices to children.",
      "PMI and JTI say their heated tobacco devices are only intended for existing nicotine and tobacco users.",
      "Hazel Cheeseman, chief executive of Action on Smoking and Health, said supermarkets advertising these products was \"disgraceful behaviour\".",
      "\"[It] puts pressure on overstretched enforcement services and risks introducing children and young people to new tobacco products.\"",
      "The government would not say whether it still thinks advertising heated tobacco is prohibited.",
      "A spokesperson said: \"This government's landmark Tobacco and Vapes Bill will enhance existing legislation, including on advertising, and put us on track for a smoke-free UK.\"",
      "The forthcoming bill is expected to ban all advertising of nicotine and tobacco products including nicotine pouches and vapes.",
      "The UK's biggest supermarket Tesco said it does not run tobacco ads, while a spokesperson for Asda said it doesn't advertise tobacco products \"in order to comply with current legislation as we understand it\"."

      "NHS experts have warned that services are overstretched trying to deal with unprecedented demand from patients wanting to try weight-loss drugs.",
      "How do Wegovy and Mounjaro work?",
      "There are two drugs on the market - semaglutide, marketed under the brand name Wegovy, and tirzepatide, sold as Mounjaro.  Semaglutide is also used in the type 2 diabetes treatment Ozempic.",
      "Both Wegovy and Mounjaro are given as weekly injections via pre-filled pens that can be self-administered into the upper arm, thigh or stomach.",

      "Other trials suggest Mounjaro users might lose even more - up to 20%. But it is difficult to compare the two treatments and, crucially, users of either drug can put weight back on once they stop treatment",

      "People with cardiovascular disease who are classed as overweight, but not quite obese, can also be given the drug.",
      "Patients should follow a diet and physical activity programme, and the drug should be only prescribed for a maximum of two years, according to NHS guidelines.",
      "The body which assesses how all drugs are used, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), has recommended that Mounjaro should also be offered to NHS patients in England from March 2025. This would be alongside advice on diet and exercise.",
      "As with Wegovy, it will initially only be available to obese patients who have a weight-related health condition and are under the care of a specialist.",
      "However, from June, the drug will be offered more widely. It is not yet clear how this will be managed, or who will provide ongoing monitoring and support.",
      "Detailed NHS England guidance is expected in early 2025.",
      "Around 3.4 million people could eventually qualify for Mounjaro.",

      "Foxglove CEO Martha Dark said: \"The government must urgently explain how its plans for new data centres will not threaten our long-term supplies of drinking water.\"",
      "A government spokesperson said: \"We recognise that data centres face sustainability challenges such as energy demands and water use - that's why AI Growth Zones are designed to attract investment in areas where existing energy and water infrastructure is already in place.\"",
      "In addition, recent changes made by the water regulator Ofwat would \"unlock \u00a3104bn of spending by water companies\" in the next five years.",
      "The data centre industry argues that modern sites are already more efficient. Alternative cooling methods which do not require much water, such as free air cooling and dry cooling, are evolving.",
      "Closed-loop cooling, which involves reusing water, will be deployed in Microsoft's new data centres in Phoenix and Wisconsin.",
      "Aaron Binckley, vice president of sustainability at Digital Realty, acknowledged criticism around data centres' water usage but claimed that the sector was making  \"significant strides\".",
      "His company, which has 300 data centres worldwide, is trialling a new AI tool which analyses operational data and identifies water-saving measures. He says it is predicted to conserve nearly 4m litres of water per year.",
      "Clearly, that is currently an expectation rather than a reality, but Mr Binckley  says it proves that \"AI can drive sustainability as well as technological progress\".",
      "In 2024 the Environment Agency wrote in a blog that by 2050, England alone would need an extra five billion litres of water every day \u2013 it says this is the equivalent of two million wheelie bins-full \u2013 just to serve the population.",
      "But the regulator now needs more data in order to factor in new data centres' future needs.",
      "For the time being, it is urging data centres to forecast and plan their water consumption - and to explore their own sources of water, such as water reuse.",
      "\"Meeting the increased water demand is not just for the water industry to solve,\" says a source."

    "summary": "The Public Accounts Committee warns the government of gambling public money on carbon capture.",
    "story": [
      "The government is committing billions of pounds to an \"unproven\" green technology for reducing planet-warming gases without considering the impact on consumers' bills, MPs have warned.",
      "Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage (CCUS) facilities prevent carbon dioxide, produced by industry, being released into the atmosphere by capturing and storing it underground.",
      "In October, the government pledged nearly \u00a322bn for CCUS facilities and three quarters of the money will be raised from consumer bills.",
      "But on Friday, the House of Commons' Public Accounts Committee raised serious concerns that the government had not properly assessed the financial impact on households and businesses.",
      "What is carbon capture and can it fight climate change?",
      "Nearly \u00a322bn pledged for carbon capture projects",
      "What does net zero mean?",
      "\"It is an unproven technology, certainly in this country. And we are concerned this policy is going to have a very significant effect on consumers' and industry's electricity bills,\" said Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, chair of the Public Accounts Committee, a cross-party group of MPs which scrutinises public spending.",
      "Speaking to the BBC Today programme on Friday, Ed Miliband, Secretary of State for Energy, acknowledged the technology was novel but said it was vital for tackling climate change.",
      "\u201dCCS is an innovative technology in terms of being used at scale, but all the expert advice - UK Climate Change Committee and others - say if we don't do this we are never going to cut global emissions,\u201d he said.",
      "He added he was \u201c100% committed\u201d to the government's climate goals.",
      "The UK has a target to reach \"net zero\" - meaning no longer adding to the total amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, by 2050. As the country switches to renewable energy and away from fossil fuels for heating homes and running cars, greenhouse gas emissions like carbon dioxide, also known as CO2, will fall.",
      "But a small amount of gas will still need to be used to maintain electricity supply and there are some industries such as cement where there are few green alternatives. Carbon capture could prevent the CO2 produced by these processes from entering the atmosphere - and the government has bet achieving its climate goals on it.",
      "Both the UK's independent climate watchdog and the UN's climate science body, the IPCC, agree that CCUS will be needed if countries want to reach net zero and avoid the worst impacts of climate change.",
      "By 2050, the government wants carbon capture and storage to prevent the emitting of 50 million tonnes of CO2 - more than 10% of what the country currently releases - and has committed \u00a321.7bn to achieving this goal.",
      "The funding, announced in October, will go towards clusters of carbon capture projects in Merseyside and Teesside, which it said would create thousands of jobs and attract private investment.",
      "Dr Stuart Jenkins, research fellow at the University of Oxford, pushed back on the committee's assessment of the technology.",
      "\"I really don't like the phrase \"unproven\" technology, it is not representative of the status of the technology as an engineering problem,\" he said.",
      "Although there are no commercial CCUS sites in the UK, there are 45 commercial facilities already operating globally capturing around 50 million tonnes of CO2, and there are more than 700 being proposed or developed, according to the International Energy Agency.",
      "But Dr Jenkins did agree with the Public Accounts Committee that there were questions about whether the government's current funding model was sustainable.",
      "The committee have recommended that the full financial impact of the programme on consumers be properly assessed, taking account of cost-of-living pressures.",
      "The committee did recognise the importance of early government support for novel technologies like CCUS to give confidence to the industry.",
      "But it added it \"was surprised\" to discover that the government had signed two contracts with CCUS developers last year and not guaranteed that if the projects were successful that the government - and the public - would receive profits or benefits such as lower energy bills.",
      "\"If you were a venture capitalist investing this sort of sum of money, which is effectively what the taxpayers are doing here, you would expect to have a big equity stake in this whole thing,\" said Sir Clifton-Brown.",
      "His committee recommended that any future contracts be changed to include profit-sharing mechanisms.",
      "The government said that it expected the \u00a321.7bn funding for CCUS to unlock \u00a38bn in private sector investment over the next 25 years.",
      "Mirte Boot, co-founder of Carbon Balance Initiative and research associate at University of Oxford, said her team's research suggests a better long-term model for financing could be introducing a carbon storage mandate - placing a legal obligation on fossil fuel producers to store a share of the CO2 they produce, or face a financial penalty.",

    "summary": "Bank boss Andrew Bailey told the BBC it expected to cut rates further but warned the road ahead would be bumpy.",
    "story": [
      "The Bank of England has halved its growth forecast for this year as it cut interest rates to the lowest level for more than 18 months.",
      "The economy is now expected to grow by 0.75% in 2025, the Bank said, down from its previous estimate of 1.5%.",
      "The government has made growing the economy one of its key aims. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer told the BBC he was \"not satisfied with growth\" and the downgraded forecast \"just spurs us on\".",
      "The new forecast came as the Bank cut interest rates to 4.5% from 4.75%. Its governor, Andrew Bailey, said that rates remain on a downward path.",
      "When will interest rates fall?",
      "Low growth and rising prices - it's looking gloomy for the UK",
      "Mr Bailey said the Bank expected to be able to cut rates further \"but we will have to judge meeting by meeting, how far and how fast\".",
      "\"We live in an uncertain world, and the road ahead will have bumps on it,\" he added.",
      "After the rates announcement, the pound slumped, before regaining ground.",
      "Speaking to the BBC, Mr Bailey stressed that the Bank needs to remain \"gradual and careful\" when continuing to cut rates because \"there is a lot more uncertainty\" and because of the predicted rise in inflation.",
      "While it cut its growth forecast for this year, the Bank upgraded its predictions for both 2026 and 2027. The economy is now expected to grow by 1.5% in both of those years, the Bank said, up from 1.25%.",
      "However, it also predicted that higher energy and water bills would push up inflation \"quite sharply\" later this year, and warned there were a number of factors that could affect inflation including possible trade tariffs in the US.",
      "Inflation - the rate at which prices rise - is now expected to rise to 3.7% and take until the end of 2027 to fall back to its 2% target.",
      "Last week, Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced a number of measures to try to boost the UK economy.",
      "However, her decision in last year's Budget to increase employers' National Insurance contributions from April has led to a wave of criticism from businesses, who argue it will push up prices and hit investment and jobs.",
      "Mr Bailey said the impact of the Budget, particularly the looming higher costs of employing people, was feeding through into lower confidence for businesses and households.",
      "\"There's no question that the increase in the cost of employment does have an effect,\" he told the BBC.",
      "\"We're very focused on how that increased cost of employment is going to pass through.\"",
      "Sir Keir told the BBC the government would turn the economy around with a focus on \"build baby build\" and by making \"tough decisions whether on planning, on infrastructure, on nuclear\".",
      "Shadow chancellor Mel Stride said while the rate cut would be good news for many families and businesses, the government's \"disastrous Budget\" was likely to mean fewer rate cuts this year than expected.",
      "Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank, said it was \"very worrying\" for the government that the Bank of England has \"really, quite significantly\" downgraded its forecasts for economic growth.",
      "He added that if the official government forecaster - the Office for Budget Responsibility - changes its forecast in line with the Bank's then \"the chancellor is in big trouble\" when it comes to meeting her self imposed debt rules.",
      "\"That means... the tax revenues the chancellor is relying on are unlikely to come in as expected, and even tougher choices on spending and tax going forward.\"",
      "Mortgage impact",
      "The interest rate cut means that for the 629,000 homeowners on mortgage tracker deals that move in line with the base rate, there will typically be a \u00a329 fall in monthly repayments.",
      "The near 700,000 people on standard variable rate mortgages will have to wait to see if their lender responds.",
      "Those on a fixed mortgage deal will see no immediate change, but there might be cheaper deals available for new and renewing customers.",
      "However, the rate cut is likely to lead to lower returns for savers.",
      "Nicola Price and her husband John have still got 18 months remaining on their current mortgage deal, and welcome lower interest rates as it means they will pay less interest on their next mortgage - if rates remain low.",
      "Nicola wishes for \"certainly no more increases\" and thinks the sweet spot for her would be a rate of around 3%.",
      "However, the couple also see that falling interest rates aren't good news for everyone as their parents \"rely heavily\" on a better interest rate on their savings.",
      "In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank said economic growth had been \"broadly flat since March last year\".",
      "The UK economy showed zero growth between July and September.",
      "For the following three months, the Bank of England now expects it to shrink by 0.1% against a previous forecast of 0.3% growth.",
      "A recession is defined as two consecutive three-month periods of economic contraction.",

      "Inflation is expected to \"rise quite sharply\" into the autumn, getting close to 4%, driven by rises in gas prices stemming from the need to fill drained storage facilities after a cold winter.

The uncertainty is not just about what he does, but the market reaction to it, and the response of other countries, including the UK. Today's weaker forecast did not factor in the US tariff policies.",
      "It is a far from happy set of figures for the chancellor. The economy has been flat since March. A technical recession is narrowly avoided, but there is a risk of little or no growth well into this year.",
      "Over this year the economy is forecast to grow by just 0.75%, half the rate forecast in November. Unemployment is expected to rise over the next two years to just below 5%.",

      "Under those proposals, if there is a significant risk to health or safety repair works must begin within 7 days.",
      "Landlords who fail to comply face being taken to court and ordered to pay compensation.",

      "The prime minister told the BBC the government was going to \"take on the blockers\" and change planning rules so new reactors could be built in more parts of the country.",
      "Sir Keir said he wanted the country to return to being \"one of the world leaders on nuclear\", helping to create thousands of highly skilled jobs and boosting economic growth.",
      "Unions and business groups welcomed the move, but some environmentalists criticised the government, saying it had \"swallowed nuclear industry spin whole\".",
      "Currently, progress building nuclear power stations in the UK can be slow - to get from planning to \"power on\" can take nearly 20 years.",
      "Speaking on a visit to the UK National Nuclear Laboratory in Lancashire, Sir Keir said the process was too long and that changes announced by the government would speed it up.",
      "Asked by the BBC's Chris Mason if \"build baby build\" was his mantra like US President Donald Trump's \"drill baby drill\", Sir Keir said: \"I say build baby build. I say we're going to take on the blockers so that we can build.\"",
      "He said the government had already changed the rules to allow onshore wind farms and was now acting to ensure \"we can fast forward on nuclear\".",
      "Pressed over whether people who live near nuclear infrastructure could get money off their electricity bills, the prime minister said while this was not part of the announcement the government had already backed the idea of benefits for local communities hosting energy infrastructure.",
      "In the 1990s, nuclear power generated about 25% of the UK's electricity but that figure has fallen to around 15%, with no new power stations built since then and many of the country's ageing reactors due to be decommissioned over the next decade.",
      "Mini nuclear power stations - or small modular reactors (SMRs) - are smaller and cheaper than traditional nuclear power plants, and produce much less power.",

      "Local elections in East Sussex, West Sussex, Essex, Thurrock, Hampshire, the Isle of Wight, Norfolk, Suffolk and Surrey will be delayed for one year to allow major reorganisations to take place, Local Government Secretary Angela Rayner has said.",
      "Speaking to Parliament, Rayner said the postponement would pave the way for a \"generational power shift from Whitehall to the town hall\".",
      "She said that holding elections for authorities that were due to be scrapped would be \"an expensive and irresponsible waste of taxpayers' money\".",
      "However, Conservative shadow minister Kevin Hollinrake said the \"mass postponement\" was a \"worrying day for democracy\".",
      "The shake-up of local councils, announced by the government last year, will see smaller district councils merged with local county councils to create single bodies known as unitary authorities.",
      "The new bodies would represent populations of around 500,000.",
      "Hollinrake accused Rayner of \"creating a new tier of Orwellian-sounding, strategic authorities which are closer to her and closer to Whitehall\".",
      "He added: \"These are for her to use as a pawn to implement this government's deeply unpopular socialist agenda.\"",

      "Liberal Democrat Leader Sir Ed Davey MP said the delays were a \"disgraceful stitch up between Labour and the Conservatives\".",

      "\"These places will get a fast-track ticket to drive real change in their area,\" she told MPs.",
      "\"While devolution can sound techie, the outcome is simple - it's a plan for putting more money in people's pockets, it's a plan for quicker, better, cheaper transport designed with local people in mind, a plan for putting politics back in the service.\"",
      "Bodies representing smaller councils have argued that the proposals will not save money but will weaken the link between communities and their councillors.",
      "Announcing its devolution plans last year, the government invited councils to submit reorganisation proposals and said it would consider requests for election delays to allow changes to take place.",
      "In January, the government said that of the 21 county councils due to hold elections, 16 had requested postponements. Two of the 10 unitary councils had also made the same request.",
      "On Wednesday, Rayner told MPs she had only agreed to half of the requests for postponements made by local authorities, and that delaying elections to allow for restructuring was a \"well established precedent\".",
      "\"After careful consideration, I've only agreed to postpone elections in places where this is central to our manifesto promise to deliver devolution,\" she said.",

    "story": [
      "Doctors would have to raise other treatment options when discussing assisted dying with a patient, under proposals put forward by the MP behind the legislation.",
      "Kim Leadbeater said it was necessary to \"enhance\" the bill, currently being examined in Parliament, and strengthen safeguards.",
      "It comes after MPs scrutinising the legislation spent three days listening to evidence from around 50 experts, with some raising concerns people could be pushed towards a path they did not want.",
      "If approved, the bill would allow terminally ill adults in England and Wales expected to die within six months to seek help to end their own life.",
      "Leadbeater has tabled several amendments, including that in their first conversation with a patient doctors cannot raise assisted dying in isolation but must also set out other treatment, palliative or hospice care available.",
      "Under her proposals, doctors would also need to produce a detailed report on the patient, including an assessment of their mental capacity and any risk of coercion.",
      "Training on these issues would have to be provided, with experts in both capacity and coercion as well as the Equality and Human Rights Commission consulted before training is put in place.",
      "What is assisted dying and how could the law change?",
      "What happens next to the bill on assisted dying?",
      "How assisted dying has spread across the world and how laws differ",
      "Leadbeater said she was conscious of advice from chief medical officer Sir Chris Whitty that the system should not end up as a \"bureaucratic thicket\", which is too difficult for patients to navigate.",
      "\"We need to give terminally ill people choice, autonomy and dignity whilst ensuring the most rigorous safeguards are embedded in the legislation,\" the MP for Spen Valley said.",
      "\"With that in mind, I believe this bill provides an opportunity to develop the very best end of life care, conversations and choice with 'gold standard' training.\"",
      "In a letter to MPs, Leadbeater wrote: \"It is extremely important to get the details of the legislation right, and enhance it where necessary, particularly with regard to safeguards, but we must also not lose sight of the fact that the current legal situation is unacceptable and deeply problematic, inflicting terrible injustices on terminally ill people and their families at their most vulnerable time.\"",
      "In evidence to MPs last week, Dan Scorer, head of policy and public affairs at disability charity Mencap, said how an initial conversation about assisted dying was conducted was \"potentially an extremely risky and dangerous moment for people with a learning disability who are terminally ill\".",
      "He raised concerns that it could be \"highly suggestive and push people in a course that they don't, they may not want to go down\".",
      "He added that Mencap believes initial conversations would have to be \"incredibly well supported and structured\" with an advocate present.",
      "MPs backed proposals to legalise assisted dying in England and Wales in November, by a majority of 55.",
      "However, it will be debated further by the House of Commons and Lords later in the year, and will require the approval of both before it becomes law.",
      "A committee of MPs is expected to begin line-by-line scrutiny of the bill on 11 February and further changes could be proposed."

      "\"It's created a lot of animosity,\" they said.",
      "\"Many councillors only got elected in 2023 and are beginning to deliver their agenda around housing delivery, infrastructure and growth and they've had rug pulled out from beneath them.",
      "\"They were out on the doorstep saying the government had to deliver homes, but everyone is so fixated on local government reorganisation they haven't been able to think about their local plan.",
      "\"All that spare capacity and bandwidth has been taken up talking about something that may or may not happen.\"",
      "There's another point of contention - the speed at which it's happening.",
      "Supporters say the government's been clear about the direction of travel so pressing on makes sense, while critics claim the process has been \"rushed\".",
      "Cllr Bridget Smith, the Lib Dem leader of South Cambridgeshire District Council, said the issue of reorganising local government had taken attention \"almost to the exclusion of anything else\" since before Christmas, saying it's a \"massive distraction and massive cost\" that would mean \"the local will be lost in local government\".",
      "\"Surely the big problem is social care and children's services,\" she said.",
      "\"Surely it's better to focus on solving those before moving the deckchairs of local government around.\"",
      "Setting out plans in the House of Commons, Rayner said there would be extensive engagement with local communities - and plenty of local leaders have already been knocking on ministers' doors to share their views.",
      "Some believe the pushback is being driven by politics from those who stand to lose out on council seats.",
      "\"I think it's people in the bubble talking to themselves,\" one council leader said. \"This is about politics, nothing more.\"",

Moving to something that is stronger, more resilient, more ambitious for its population can only be good for people.\"",
      "Tim Oliver, the Conservative leader of Surrey County Council, said: \"There is party political noise about this, but at the end of the day we're here to serve residents and is simplification and less cost better for residents? It is. We'll get through a little bit of turbulence.\"",
      "There's certainly plenty of discussion - and disagreement - among councillors across England, but one thing most agree on - and ministers acknowledge - is that changing the way councils work will not solve the challenges they face without further reform of some of the key services they provide."

    "summary": "How might the UK be affected by Trump's tariffs, even if they are not imposed on the UK?",
    "story": [
      "Donald Trump has been unclear about whether he will impose tariffs on the UK but  economists warn there are still ways Britain could be negatively affected by the president's wider trade policies even if it avoids being hit directly.",
      "The impact could be felt through slower growth in some of the UK's important trading partners. Industrial exports could be diverted from the US and flood the UK market and there could be impacts on our financial markets, including a possible increase to borrowing costs.",
      "Asked about future tariffs, Trump told the BBC on Sunday night: \"The UK is way out of line but I'm sure that one\u2026 I think that one can be worked out.\"",
      "The president did not specify in which way he regarded the UK as being \"out of line\".",
      "One of the justifications Trump has given for imposing tariffs on countries is they have a trade surplus with the US - in other words they sell more to the US than they import from America.",
      "He has claimed these trade surpluses amount to \"massive subsidies that we're giving to Canada and to Mexico\".",
      "The tariffs on Mexico were paused for a month by Trump on Monday but the president has complained about unbalanced trade with the EU, saying on Sunday: \"They don't take our cars, they don't take our farm products, they take almost nothing and we take everything from them. Millions of cars, tremendous amounts of food and farm products.\"",
      "So one way the UK might be seen to be out of line in the mind of Trump - and at risk of tariffs - is if Britain was also running a trade surplus with America.",
      "Does the UK have a trade surplus with the US?",
      "The UK's Office for National Statistics estimates the UK had a surplus of around \u00a371bn in trade with the US in 2023, the most recent full year for which we have data.",
      "But the American statistics office, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, estimates the US had a surplus on its trade with the UK in that year of $14.5bn, around \u00a312bn.",
      "How can both be true?",
      "The two stats agencies have looked at this discrepancy and agree it is due to different ways of measuring trade.",
      "One factor is the UK agencies, unlike their US counterparts, do not count trade flows through British crown dependencies such as the Isle of Man, some of which are significant financial services hubs and markedly affect the overall figures.",
      "Another key, related, element seems to be differences in the measurement of services trade - things such as banking and finance - as opposed to physical goods.",
      "But the bottom line is there is still a degree of uncertainty about what precisely is driving the overall difference in the statistics and both agencies are trying to work it out.",
      "In the meantime, the UK government will doubtless be hoping President Trump prefers to use the US data, which shows America is selling more to the UK than it is buying - and will focus on the goods rather than services trade.",
      "If the president were to impose a blanket tariff on UK exports to the US it would affect around \u00a360bn of goods sent in 2023, according to the UK's figures.",
      "Pharmaceutical products accounted for \u00a38.8bn of the UK's goods exports to the US in that year, cars \u00a36.4bn and power generation machinery \u00a35.2bn.",
      "While the immediate impact of the tariffs would be to make the price of these imported goods for US firms and consumers higher, over time they could reduce American demand for them, which could have a negative impact on the UK firms exporting them.",
      "How else could the UK be affected?",
      "There are other ways in which Britain could be negatively affected by US tariffs on other countries.",
      "Slower growth in the global economy and, in particular, the EU - with which the UK still does around half of its trade - would impede the UK's growth prospects.",
      "If our trading partners were to fall into recession due to tariffs, analysts say they would cut interest rates and their currencies would drop in value making British exports to them more expensive.",
      "\"The US imposing tariffs on our other trading partners will still have a negative effect on the UK economy through its effect on supply chains and the exchange rate,\" said Ahmet Kaya, of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR).",
      "Niesr has estimated that the 25% tariffs the US has threatened to impose on Mexico and Canada could reduce UK GDP growth by 0.1 percentage points in 2025.",
      "Some economists warn exports - such as Chinese-made steel - that might get diverted from the US markets due to the new tariffs, could be sold at below the cost of production, or \"dumped\" in UK markets, which might have a negative impact on the sales of UK steel producers.",
      "Some analysts say higher US interest rates as a result of the tariffs could also spill over to UK borrowing markets.",
      "One of the reasons UK government borrowing costs, or Gilt yields, temporarily spiked upwards in January, was because American government bond yields had also risen.",
      "\"The main threat to the UK economy from Trump's tariffs may well be the spillover from higher US interest rates, rather than tariffs themselves,\" says the economist Julian Jessop.",
      "\"US and UK government bond yields are now moving in lockstep again. If the Fed [US central bank] is more reluctant to cut US rates, as seems likely, borrowing costs will be higher for longer in the UK as well.\"",
      "Higher borrowing costs could slow the UK economy and also put pressure on the UK government to cut public spending or raise taxes in order to keep within its chosen borrowing rules.",
      "Correction: This article has been changed \u2013 the worth of power generation machinery to the US in 2023 was \u00a35.2bn.",

      "The question is being frantically addressed between the Treasury and the Department of Work of Pensions (DWP) right now.",

      "That dual motive explains why this is being treated as such an urgent issue at the top of government.",
      "Ministers are concerned by a situation in which the amount of people who are in receipt of certain benefits has surged. Meanwhile, the Treasury needs to ensure that it is not on course to break its own self-imposed fiscal rules.",
      "\"It's high up the agenda for us because of the cost implications but also the broader economic problem of having so many people economically inactive,\" a Treasury source said.",
      "And in 10 Downing Street, aides say that tackling this issue would be the clearest sign yet that Sir Keir is truly serious about reforming public services.",
      "Last year, the government spent \u00a365bn on sickness benefits - a 25% increase from the year before the pandemic. That figure is forecast to increase to around \u00a3100bn before the next general election.",
      "Some of this is the legacy of Covid. But the chancellor has made clear her view that another reason for this surge is the \"perverse incentives\" wired into the system.",
      "Again and again, ministers and officials complain of a system where those on universal credit are required to display evidence they have applied for jobs, or face sanctions - but people out of work who also qualify for sickness benefits both get more money and are not necessarily required to seek work.",
      "Ministers believe that this encourages some people to \"game the system\". Some Labour advisers fear this issue is being exacerbated, especially among young people, by videos on TikTok and other platforms which explain to claimants the best ways to fill out questionnaires in order to get sickness benefits.",

      "That's not just true of party members but MPs too. Among the vast 2024 intake of Labour MPs, one of their most common reasons for getting involved in the Labour Party was opposition to Conservative austerity and welfare cuts.",

    "story": [
      "The government is committing billions of pounds to an \"unproven\" green technology for reducing planet-warming gases without considering the impact on consumers' bills, MPs have warned.",
      "Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage (CCUS) facilities prevent carbon dioxide, produced by industry, being released into the atmosphere by capturing and storing it underground.",
      "In October, the government pledged nearly \u00a322bn for CCUS facilities and three quarters of the money will be raised from consumer bills.",
      "But on Friday, the House of Commons' Public Accounts Committee raised serious concerns that the government had not properly assessed the financial impact on households and businesses.",
      "What is carbon capture and can it fight climate change?",
      "Nearly \u00a322bn pledged for carbon capture projects",
      "What does net zero mean?",
      "\"It is an unproven technology, certainly in this country. And we are concerned this policy is going to have a very significant effect on consumers' and industry's electricity bills,\" said Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, chair of the Public Accounts Committee, a cross-party group of MPs which scrutinises public spending.",
      "Speaking to the BBC Today programme on Friday, Ed Miliband, Secretary of State for Energy, acknowledged the technology was novel but said it was vital for tackling climate change.",
      "\u201dCCS is an innovative technology in terms of being used at scale, but all the expert advice - UK Climate Change Committee and others - say if we don't do this we are never going to cut global emissions,\u201d he said.",
      "He added he was \u201c100% committed\u201d to the government's climate goals.",
      "The UK has a target to reach \"net zero\" - meaning no longer adding to the total amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, by 2050. As the country switches to renewable energy and away from fossil fuels for heating homes and running cars, greenhouse gas emissions like carbon dioxide, also known as CO2, will fall.",
      "But a small amount of gas will still need to be used to maintain electricity supply and there are some industries such as cement where there are few green alternatives. Carbon capture could prevent the CO2 produced by these processes from entering the atmosphere - and the government has bet achieving its climate goals on it.",
      "Both the UK's independent climate watchdog and the UN's climate science body, the IPCC, agree that CCUS will be needed if countries want to reach net zero and avoid the worst impacts of climate change.",
      "By 2050, the government wants carbon capture and storage to prevent the emitting of 50 million tonnes of CO2 - more than 10% of what the country currently releases - and has committed \u00a321.7bn to achieving this goal.",
      "The funding, announced in October, will go towards clusters of carbon capture projects in Merseyside and Teesside, which it said would create thousands of jobs and attract private investment.",
      "Dr Stuart Jenkins, research fellow at the University of Oxford, pushed back on the committee's assessment of the technology.",
      "\"I really don't like the phrase \"unproven\" technology, it is not representative of the status of the technology as an engineering problem,\" he said.",
      "Although there are no commercial CCUS sites in the UK, there are 45 commercial facilities already operating globally capturing around 50 million tonnes of CO2, and there are more than 700 being proposed or developed, according to the International Energy Agency.",
      "But Dr Jenkins did agree with the Public Accounts Committee that there were questions about whether the government's current funding model was sustainable.",
      "The committee have recommended that the full financial impact of the programme on consumers be properly assessed, taking account of cost-of-living pressures.",
      "The committee did recognise the importance of early government support for novel technologies like CCUS to give confidence to the industry.",
      "But it added it \"was surprised\" to discover that the government had signed two contracts with CCUS developers last year and not guaranteed that if the projects were successful that the government - and the public - would receive profits or benefits such as lower energy bills.",
      "\"If you were a venture capitalist investing this sort of sum of money, which is effectively what the taxpayers are doing here, you would expect to have a big equity stake in this whole thing,\" said Sir Clifton-Brown.",
      "His committee recommended that any future contracts be changed to include profit-sharing mechanisms.",
      "The government said that it expected the \u00a321.7bn funding for CCUS to unlock \u00a38bn in private sector investment over the next 25 years.",
      "Mirte Boot, co-founder of Carbon Balance Initiative and research associate at University of Oxford, said her team's research suggests a better long-term model for financing could be introducing a carbon storage mandate - placing a legal obligation on fossil fuel producers to store a share of the CO2 they produce, or face a financial penalty.",

    "title": "Record January warmth puzzles climate scientists",
    "published": "Thu, 06 Feb 2025 03:10:59 GMT",
    "summary": "January was expected to be cooler than the same month last year, but was 0.1C warmer, which experts are struggling to explain.",
    "story": [
      "Last month was the world's warmest January on record raising further questions about the pace of climate change, scientists say.",
      "January 2025 had been expected to be slightly cooler than January 2024 because of a shift away from a natural weather pattern in the Pacific known as El Ni\u00f1o.",
      "But instead, last month broke the January 2024 record by nearly 0.1C, according to the European Copernicus climate service.",
      "The world's warming is due to emissions of planet-heating gases from human activities - mainly the burning of fossil fuels - but scientists say they cannot fully explain why last month was particularly hot.",
      "It continues a series of surprisingly large temperature records since mid-2023, with temperatures around 0.2C above what had been expected.",
      "\"The basic reason we're having records being broken, and we've had this decades-long warming trend, is because we're increasing the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere,\" Gavin Schmidt, director of Nasa's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, told BBC News.",
      "\"The specifics of exactly why 2023, and 2024, and [the start of] 2025, were so warm, there are other elements involved there. We're trying to pin those down.\"",
      "January 2025 ended up 1.75C warmer than January temperatures of the late 19th Century, before humans started significantly warming the climate.",
      "Early last year, global temperatures were being boosted by the natural El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern, where unusually warm surface waters spread across the eastern tropical Pacific. This releases extra heat into the atmosphere, raising global temperatures.",
      "This year, La Ni\u00f1a conditions are developing instead, according to US science group Noaa, which should have the opposite effect.",
      "While La Ni\u00f1a is currently weak - and sometimes takes a couple of months to have its full effect on temperatures \u2013 it was expected to lead to a cooler January.",
      "\"If you'd asked me a few months ago what January 2025 would look like relative to January 2024, my best shot would have been it would be cooler,\" Adam Scaife, head of monthly to decadal predictions at the UK Met Office, said.",
      "\"We now know it isn't, and we don't really know why that is.\"",
      "A simple guide to climate change",
      "What is El Ni\u00f1o and how does it change the weather?",
      "A number of theories have been put forward for why the last couple of years have been warmer than anticipated.",
      "One idea involves a prolonged response of the oceans to the 2023-24 El Ni\u00f1o.",
      "While it was not especially strong, it followed an unusually lengthy La Ni\u00f1a phase from 2020-23.",
      "The El Ni\u00f1o event might therefore have \"lifted the lid\" on warming, allowing ocean heat that had been accumulating to escape into the atmosphere.",
      "But it's unclear how this would still be directly affecting global temperatures nearly a year after El Ni\u00f1o ended.",
      "\"Based on historical data, that effect is likely to have waned by now, so I think if the current record continues, that explanation becomes less and less likely,\" says Prof Scaife.",
      "The fact that sea temperatures in other regions of the world remain particularly warm could suggest \"that the behaviour of the ocean is changing\", according to Samantha Burgess, deputy director of Copernicus.",
      "\"We're really looking to see how the ocean temperatures evolve because they have a direct influence on air temperatures.\"",
      "Another prominent theory is a reduction in the number of small particles in the atmosphere, known as aerosols.",
      "These tiny particles have historically masked some of the long-term warming from greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane by helping to form bright clouds and reflecting some of the Sun's energy back into space.",
      "Aerosol numbers have been falling recently, thanks to reductions in tiny particles from shipping and Chinese industry, for example, aimed at cleaning the air that people breathe.",
      "But it means they haven't had as large a cooling effect to offset the continued warming caused by greenhouse gases.",
      "And this cooling effect of aerosols has been underestimated by the UN, argues James Hansen, the scientist who made one of the first high-profile warnings on climate change to the US Senate in 1988.",
      "Most scientists aren't yet convinced that this is the case. But, if true, it could mean there is greater climate change in store than previously assumed.",
      "The \"nightmare scenario\", says Prof Scaife, would be an extra cloud feedback, where a warming ocean could cause low-level reflective clouds to dissipate, in turn warming the planet further.",
      "This theory is also very uncertain. But the months ahead should help to shed some light on whether the \"extra\" warmth over the past couple of years is a blip, or marks an acceleration in warming beyond what scientists had anticipated.",
      "Currently, most researchers still expect 2025 will end up slightly cooler than 2023 and 2024 \u2013 but the recent warmth means they can't be sure.",
      "What they do know, however, is that further records will follow sooner or later as humanity continues to heat up the planet.",
      "\"In time, 2025 is likely to be one of the cooler years that we experience,\" Dr Burgess said.",
      "\"Unless we turn off that tap to [greenhouse gas] emissions, then global temperatures will continue to rise.\"",

      "Unions and business groups welcomed the move, but some environmentalists criticised the government, saying it had \"swallowed nuclear industry spin whole\".",
      "Currently, progress building nuclear power stations in the UK can be slow - to get from planning to \"power on\" can take nearly 20 years.",
      "Speaking on a visit to the UK National Nuclear Laboratory in Lancashire, Sir Keir said the process was too long and that changes announced by the government would speed it up.",
      "Asked by the BBC's Chris Mason if \"build baby build\" was his mantra like US President Donald Trump's \"drill baby drill\", Sir Keir said: \"I say build baby build. I say we're going to take on the blockers so that we can build.\"",
      "He said the government had already changed the rules to allow onshore wind farms and was now acting to ensure \"we can fast forward on nuclear\".",
      "Pressed over whether people who live near nuclear infrastructure could get money off their electricity bills, the prime minister said while this was not part of the announcement the government had already backed the idea of benefits for local communities hosting energy infrastructure.",
      "In the 1990s, nuclear power generated about 25% of the UK's electricity but that figure has fallen to around 15%, with no new power stations built since then and many of the country's ageing reactors due to be decommissioned over the next decade.",
      "Mini nuclear power stations - or small modular reactors (SMRs) - are smaller and cheaper than traditional nuclear power plants, and produce much less power.",

      "Experts say they're seeing many earthquakes within a relatively small area, which don't fit the pattern of a mainshock-aftershock sequence, says Dr Ganas.",

      "It was placed in a specially made case and taken to Diamond Light Source in Oxfordshire.",
      "Inside this huge machine, which is called a synchrotron, electrons are accelerated to almost the speed of light to produce a powerful X-ray beam that can probe the scroll without damaging it.",

      "The scan is used to create a 3D reconstruction, then the layers inside the scroll - it contains about 10m of papyrus - have to be identified.",
      "\"We have to work out which layer is different from the next layer so we can unroll that digitally,\" said Dr Mancuso.",
      "After that artificial intelligence is used to detect the ink. It's easier said than done - both the papyrus and ink are made from carbon and they're almost indistinguishable from each other.",

    "summary": "The Built Environment Committee says the concept has been \"eclipsed\" by other planning rule changes.",
    "story": [
      "The government's idea of re-designating areas as \"grey belt\" land in its bid to build more homes is \"largely redundant\", a House of Lords committee has said.",
      "Ministers had said that, if a council's housing targets could not be met, some protected land known as green belt would be re-labelled grey belt and thereby freed up for development.",
      "However, after conducting an inquiry the committee said it suspected the grey belt concept had been \"eclipsed by more significant changes\" made by the government.",
      "A government spokesperson said its changes to the green belt were \"just one of the ambitious housing reforms we have set out to solve the housing crisis and boost economic growth\".",
      "They added that the measures were \"informed through widespread consultation and will unlock more land for the homes and infrastructure communities desperately need, delivering sustainable, affordable and well-designed developments on low quality grey belt\".",
      "Since coming to power in July, the Labour government has said it wants to build 1.5 million homes over the next five years and has identified \"poor quality\" green belt land as possible areas of construction.",
      "It pointed to a disused garage in Tottenham, north London, as an example of land that could not be developed because it was deemed to be on a green belt site.",
      "Green belts were established more than 70 years ago with five purposes, including restricting the sprawl of urban areas and protecting the countryside.",
      "In a letter to Housing Secretary Angela Rayner, chair of the Built Environment Committee Lord Moylan said the green belt had been treated as \"sacrosanct\"  making it difficult for local authorities to build on the area, despite a high demand for more homes.",

      "What is the 'grey belt' and how many homes could Labour build on it?",
      "However, he said that changes announced in the National Planning and Policy Framework (NPPF) would mean that the impact of the grey belt would be \"at best, marginal\".",
      "The changes include a requirement for councils to review green belt boundaries and suggest changes to the boundaries if they cannot meet their housing targets.",
      "Under the new rules, building on green belt land will be be allowed if other options have been exhausted, the government has said.",
      "\"It is difficult to see what the grey belt regime will add in terms of the ability to build on the green belt in light of this requirement,\" Lord Moylan said.",
      "In the course of taking evidence the committee heard dramatically differing estimates of how many dwellings could be built on grey belt land.",
      "Homebuilders Barratt Redrow suggested the number could be as low as 50,000, while LandTech, a software company, put the figure at four million.",
      "Responding to the inquiry's conclusions, Fergus Charlton, a planning partner at firm Michelmores, said: \"Whether or not the grey belt policies will play an effective role in achieving the government's difficult to reach 1.5 million new homes target will become clearer as the policies begin to play a defining role in plan making.",

    "title": "UN monitors asteroid with a tiny chance of hitting Earth",
    "published": "Mon, 03 Feb 2025 17:02:12 GMT",
    "summary": "The asteroid named YR4 has a 1% chance of hitting Earth in 2032",
    "story": [
      "UN planetary defence organisations are closely monitoring an asteroid that has a tiny risk of hitting the Earth.",
      "The European Space Agency (ESA) has said that it has an almost 99% chance of safely passing Earth on 22 December 2032, but a possible impact \"cannot yet be entirely ruled out\".",
      "The probability that the asteroid, called 2024 YR4, may impact Earth on 22 December 2032 is currently estimated to be 1.3%.",
      "Dr Robert Massey of the Royal Astronomical Society, says that he is \"not panicking or losing sleep over it\".",
      "\"There is no need for alarm,\" he said. \"The thing about this kind of event is that historically they tend to go away when the calculations are refined.\"",
      "We need to be aware alert and we need to give astronomers the resources they need to track these kinds of threats so that we can take action as soon as possible.\"",
      "YR4 was detected on 27 December 2024. Astronomers calculated that it was between 40m and 90m across. This would have the power of a nuclear bomb were it to hit the Earth and cause severe damage if the impact was in a populated area.",
      "But it is much more likely that YR4 would fall into the ocean or a remote part of the planet. It is too far away from Earth and there are too many uncertainties at this stage to determine where a potential impact could occur in the unlikely event of a collision.",
      "Since early January, astronomers have been using telescopes to calculate the asteroid's size and trajectory more precisely. YR4 is now rated at level 3 out of 10 on the Torino Impact Hazard Scale: \"a close encounter that warrants attention from astronomers and the public\". A collision is only certain when it reaches 8, 9 or 10, with the numbers rising in line with the damage likely caused.",
      "When asteroids are initially calculated to have a small probability of hitting the Earth, that impact probability usually drops to zero after additional observations.",
      "This happened in 2004 when an asteroid called Apophis was calculated to have a 2.7% chance of striking Earth in 2029; further observations ruled out an impact.",
      "Any object that may be more than 50m wide and has a greater than 1% chance of hitting the Earth, triggers a set of precautionary measures. These are to ensure that the threat, however tiny, is closely monitored and, if necessary, steps are taken to nullify it.",
      "The first stage is to activate two UN-endorsed asteroid reaction groups: the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN), chaired by Nasa, and the Space Mission Planning Advisory Group (SMPAG), chaired by the European Space Agency.",
      "The SMPAG is having a series of meetings this week to determine its next steps.  It has already concluded that it is too early to take immediate action but said that it would \"monitor the evolution of impact threat and possible knowledge about the size closely\".",
      "Another meeting to take decisions on future activities will be held towards the end of April or early May, or earlier, \"if the evolution of the threat merits\".",
      "If the asteroid's impact probability remains above the 1% threshold, SMPAG will provide recommendations to the UN and may begin to evaluate options.",
      "In the unlikely event YR4 were headed our way, one option would be to divert it by hitting it with a robotic spacecraft, as was successfully tested out with Nasa's Dart mission in 2022. That changed the course of an asteroid that was not on a collision course with the Earth.",
      "\"Nasa's Dart mission showed that we have the means to divert an asteroid, but only if we spot it early enough,\" says Dr Massey.",
      "YR4 is currently moving away from Earth in almost a straight line, making it difficult to accurately determine its precise orbit before it returns towards Earth.",
      "Over the next few months, the asteroid will begin to fade from view, after which  it will be monitored by ground and space telescopes.",
      "According to ESA \"It is possible that asteroid 2024 YR4 will fade from view before we are able to entirely rule out any chance of impact in 2032. In this case, the asteroid will likely remain on ESA's risk list until it becomes observable again in 2028.\""

      "Billionaire businessman Jared Isaacman has a big vision for the future of humanity.",
      "He set off on his first mission to space in 2021 \u2013 a private journey he paid an estimated $200m (\u00a3160m) for \u2013 and announced that he wanted space travel to be for the masses, not only for the 600 who have experienced it to date \u2013 most of them professional astronauts employed by Nasa and the wealthy.",
      "\"We want it to be 600,000,\" he told reporters.",
      "Later, he added: \"I drank the Kool-Aid in terms of the grand ambitions for humankind being a multi-planet species\u2026 I think that we all want to live in a Star Wars, Star Trek world where people are jumping in their spacecraft.\"",
      "Mr Isaacman, who made much of his $1.9bn (\u00a31.46bn) fortune from a payment processing company that he founded in 1999 aged 16, is said to have bankrolled the rest of the crew of four aboard the SpaceX craft in the 2021 mission, fuelled by a longstanding love of flying and fascination with space.",
      "Since then, there have been more adventures: last year he demonstrated Captain Kirk-like daring by travelling in an upgraded SpaceX capsule and performing the first commercial spacewalk.",
      "During the mission, he tested an experimental spacesuit and a new cost-saving protocol to exit and re-enter the spacecraft without using an airlock.",
      "The photograph of Mr Isaacman, silhouetted with the world at his feet, is now iconic \u2013 it demonstrated that this was not a playboy billionaire paying to act out Star Trek, but someone pushing the envelope of what was possible with current technology.",
      "And yet it is a more recent achievement that has drawn greater attention still \u2013 being nominated by Donald Trump in December to be the new head of Nasa.",
      "The question is why Trump chose him and what has he asked him to do \u2013 especially in the context that the President has appointed SpaceX owner Elon Musk to a government role to cut $2 trillion (\u00a31.6 trillion) off the Federal budget.",
      "The Nasa post is a presidential appointment, though it requires the confirmation of the US Senate. And if confirmed, Mr Isaacman's appointment will also raise broader questions about the future of humanity in space, given his vision for space travel for the masses. It also has significant implications for the future of the space agency, if Mr Isaacman's role leads to Nasa using the private sector even more than it does now.",
      "Brink of a second space age?",
      "In the past, the heads of Nasa have come from a variety of backgrounds: some, such as the previous incumbent Bill Nelson, have been former astronauts; others, such as Michael Griffin (in charge from 2005 to 2009) came from a government background, and before him Dan Goldin was an entrepreneur, striving to lower costs.",
      "Despite their disparate backgrounds, those who have led Nasa have all been company people, charged with defending the space agency and its values.",
      "And yet Mr Isaacman, along with Mr Musk and Amazon's Jeff Bezos, is among a new wave of billionaires who have been challenging the old order in space.",
      "They have accelerated the pace of innovation and are aiming to dramatically reduce the cost of human space travel.",
      "On the day of his nomination in December, Mr Isaacman posted a statement on X that gave an early glimpse into his vision. \"This second space age has only just begun,\" he wrote.",
      "\"There will inevitably be a thriving space economy \u2013 one that will create opportunities for countless people to live and work in space\u2026 At Nasa, we will\u2026 usher in an era where humanity becomes a true spacefaring civilisation.\"",
      "Many presidents have talked about sending astronauts to the Moon since the end of the Apollo lunar landings of the 1960s and 70s, but Trump was the first to turn talk into action, authorising Nasa's Artemis programme to send humans back to the Moon during his first term. His record suggests that he is a big Nasa fan.",
      "But since then, two factors are likely to have changed his thinking: Nasa's rocket, the Space Launch System (SLS), has been delayed and costs have spiralled; at the same time Mr Musk's SpaceX and Bezos's Blue Origin are developing reusable low-cost Moon rockets.",
      "That is a worrying backdrop for Nasa, according to Courtney Stadd of New York-based Beyond Earth Institute think tank.",
      "\"You have a government looking to slash,\" he said at a webinar hosted by Space News. \"If you are the new administrator, you are going in in that context, so you are going to have to look at everything that is a drain on your budget\u2026",
      "\"This next two years is going to be the equivalent of a tsunami and everything is on the table.\"",
      "Future of Nasa's moon rocket",
      "One of the biggest questions is what to do with the space agency's SLS Moon rocket. In 2021, Nasa's Office of Inspector General (OIG), which provides oversight of the space agency for Congress, reported that the cost was $4.1bn (\u00a33.3bn) for each and every launch.",
      "By contrast, SpaceX's equivalent rocket system, Starship, is estimated to cost around $100m (\u00a380m) per launch \u2013 and Musk has said he aims to bring the costs down further to $10m (\u00a38m) as he develops his system.",
      "Bezos's new Moon rocket, New Glenn, had its maiden test launch at the beginning of January. Blue Origin has not announced its cost per launch, but it is estimated currently to be around $68m (\u00a354.5m).",
      "Competition between the two billionaires is likely to speed up innovation and reduce costs further.",
      "Starship and New Glenn are projected to be cheaper because, unlike SLS, they are designed to be reusable. But \"that's only a part of the reason for the disparity in costs\", according to Dr Adam Baker, an expert on the space industry at Cranfield University.",
      "\"SpaceX is given a sum of money and contracted to deliver on time and on budget,\" he continues. \"They are driven by profit, and they want to minimise costs.",
      "\"A Nasa programme is not driven by profit; it is driven by the programme objectives and so those in charge don't think they need to track costs in the same way.",
      "\"There is a general acceptance that SLS has no future.\"",
      "Questions around spiralling costs",
      "The OIG could only come up with a best guess for the full cost of the Artemis programme in its review for Congress because, as it put it: \"Nasa lacks a comprehensive and accurate cost estimate that accounts for all programme costs.",
      "\"Instead, the Agency's plan presents a rough estimate that excludes $25bn (\u00a320bn) for key activities\".",
      "Nasa's project management of SLS is not an aberration \u2013 some would say it is typical. For example, the James Webb Space Telescope was given a $1bn (\u00a3800m) budget and a launch date of 2010 \u2013 but it cost ten times that amount and launched in 2021, earning it the nickname of \"the telescope that ate astronomy\".",
      "(Other important scientific programmes had to be scaled back, delayed or scrapped entirely to make way for the overruns.)",
      "It was a similar story of delays and budget overruns during the development of the Space Shuttle in the 1970s and the construction of the International Space Station in the 2000s.",
      "Nasa got away with it because it was responsible for arguably America's greatest moment when it sent the first astronauts to the Moon. The Apollo programme laid the foundations for America's technology businesses and ushered in a vibrant new era for the US.",
      "But the world has changed significantly since then, and Nasa has simply not kept up, according to Emeritus Prof John Logsdon, former director of the Space policy Institute at George Washington University. \"Changing the way the United States goes about its civilian space programme is long overdue.\"",
      "New light on the 'old way of doing things'",
      "The current model is to give so-called \"cost-plus\" contracts to big heritage aerospace companies, such as Lockheed Martin and Boeing, which guarantee to pay the development costs and an agreed profit.",
      "The model gave the firms the financial reassurance they needed for ambitious projects such as the space shuttle, the SLS, and developing parts of the Saturn V rocket that took Apollo astronauts to the Moon, but these contracts provided no incentives to cut costs or increase efficiency. For example, there were no penalties for delays or cost overruns.",
      "Dr Simeon Barber at the Open University, who has worked with Nasa on robotic space missions, was originally sceptical that the new commercial companies would deliver. But he is now a convert to the new way of doing things.",
      "\"We were used to big projects falling behind schedule and going over budget. But the new companies have shone a light on the old way of doing things.\"",
      "Moves to change what some saw as an overly cosy relationship with the heritage space companies gained pace in 2009 when President Obama introduced fixed-price contracts to some private sector firms. The companies were given latitude to innovate to cut costs and increase their profits provided they delivered on schedule and on budget.",
      "Among those firms was the dynamic new start-up, SpaceX, which was awarded a contract to develop its reusable Falcon rockets and Dragon Space capsule to resupply the International Space Station with crew and cargo.",
      "The heritage space company Boeing was also given a similar contract in 2014 to develop its Starliner capsule to do the same job.",
      "SpaceX, with its riskier but faster development processes, began delivering to the ISS within four years of receiving its contract. By contrast, Boeing's Starliner, which had a series of delays due to technical problems and cost overruns, took 10 years \u2013 only to have more issues with some of its engines, which left astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams stranded on the space station.",
      "The ultimate humiliation is that they will be brought back to Earth by rival SpaceX's Dragon capsule.",
      "\"Starliner is an embarrassment for the traditional way of doing business,\" says Prof Logsdon. \"So, shaking up the system is very positive.\"",
      "On the brink of a big shakeup?",
      "Prof Logsdon expects big changes under Trump, Mr Musk and Mr Isaacman: scrapping programmes, closing Nasa centres and more contracting out to SpaceX, Blue Origin and other private sector firms. Mr Isaacman has called the SLS \"outrageously expensive\" and said that the major aerospace contractors are \"incentivised to be economically inefficient\".",
      "But changes like that are not going to be easy. Nasa's budget is controlled by Congress. Although President Trump's party controls both legislative houses, individual senators and congressmen on the committees that oversee Nasa are from states with jobs and industries dependent on Nasa's $25bn (\u00a320bn) annual budget.",
      "\"Party discipline takes second place where there is constituency money involved,\" says Prof Logsdon, a seasoned watcher of the horse trading that goes on with space politics in Congress.",
      "Although Nasa's projects have been expensive, they have shown us the wonders of the universe and shifted humanity's perception of ourselves and our place in the cosmos.",
      "The creation of the first reusable space shuttle, the construction of an orbiting space station, the images of distant worlds captured by its robotic spacecraft and the awe-inspiring photos from Hubble have all inspired generations and supercharged interest in science. As a result, senators and congressmen know that America and the world owe Nasa an unpayable debt.",
      "\"The old way of doing things gave us a lot of success, so you don't want to throw the baby out with the bathwater. There will be significant change, but not the radical change that Mr Musk and Mr Isaacman want to see,\" argues Prof Logsdon.",
      "\"There is a delicate balance between the interests of Nasa, Congress and the White House.\"",
      "Where that balance will fall will emerge in the coming months: some are speculating that the return-to-the-Moon programme might be scrapped altogether in favour of going straight to Mars, as President Trump alluded to during his inauguration, with the greatest proponent of that policy \u2013 Musk \u2013 seated nearby.",
      "Others fear cuts in Nasa's Earth Observation programmes, which monitor and model environmental changes from space, and include the impact of climate change; and some worry that the robotic scientific missions to other planets might be cut back to boost efforts for the human spaceflight programme.",
      "Where SpaceX fits in",
      "There is concern in some quarters about the close relationship between Mr Isaacman and Mr Musk. Mr Isaacman paid SpaceX for his two ventures into space. The company has already received $20bn (\u00a316bn) in contracts from government since 2008.",
      "But if SLS is scrapped, and SpaceX were to receive the lion's share of Nasa's Moon programme work, Mr Musk's firm stands to receive contracts that might be ten or even a hundred times greater, possibly at the expense of other private-sector players.",
      "And there are many innovative US start-up companies hoping to build parts for spacecraft and infrastructure in Nasa's return-to-the-Moon programme, including Texas-based Firefly, which has a spacecraft on its way to land on the Moon in March.",
      "But industry analysts say that the US government has a long tradition of breaking up monopolies so that they don't stifle innovation. And in any case, just because Mr Isaacman has worked with Mr Musk, it does not mean that any outcome is inevitable, argues Prof Logsdon.",
      "\"Isaacman is his own man,\" he adds. \"He is not a disciple of Elon Musk.\"",
      "Fatbergs turned into perfume - inside Britain's bizarre new industrial revolution",

      "Ultimately, however, it has become painfully clear, even to Nasa's most ardent supporters, that it needs saving from itself. And the need for Nasa reform is not a partisan issue \u2013 Democrat and Republican presidents alike have set the wheels in motion.",
      "But the coincidental timing of the success of SpaceX, Blue Origin and other private-sector space firms with a new administration impatient to cut costs and energise the private sector means that Mr Isaacman has a unique opportunity to make some of the biggest changes to Nasa since its inception.",
      "\"Nasa truly is a crown jewel, and we aren't doing what we should be doing on behalf of the American people,\" argued former deputy head of Nasa Lori Garver during the Space News webinar. \"That is frustrating for all of us.\"",
      "Asked if a private sector billionaire was the right person to be entrusted with one of America's greatest national treasures, Ms Garver responded: \"Jared is a patriot, and he is doing this for public service.",

      "A combination of prevailing winds and the rotation of the earth drive litter up the loch to create what is known as the Arrochar litter sink.",
      "About 62,000 items wash up on the beach each year, much of it from the waterways in and around Glasgow, Scotland\u2019s largest city.",
      "It is estimated that 11% of the rubbish which enters the River Clyde - which flows through the city - and its tributaries is eventually washed up at Arrochar.",
      "The local residents can't clean it up fast enough.",
      "Lots of the waste is tangled in the seaweed which was once an asset to the community.",
      "It used to be collected by the bucketload to fertilise farm land, but that's no longer possible because of the pollution.",
      "Campaigners say the only solution is to stop the waste entering the water in the first place - and that the introduction of a deposit return scheme for bottles and cans would play a major role in doing just that.",
      "A Scottish scheme was originally meant to be operational by 2023 but was delayed after objections from businesses to the inclusion of glass.",
      "It then emerged that the UK government was considering blocking Scotland's plans because it wanted a single scheme for all four nations.",
      "UK ministers eventually decided they would grant an exemption - but only if glass was taken out of the Scottish plans to align it with the scheme it was planning to introduce in England.",
      "That position led to angry recriminations and eventually an announcement from Circular Economy Minister Lorna Slater of a further delay until at least October 2025.",
      "That was later extended to 2027, in line with the UK scheme.",
      "But in December, the Welsh government confirmed it was opting out of the UK-wide proposition and creating its own scheme - which would include glass recycling.",
      "In the meantime, a deposit return scheme has been successfully launched in the Republic of Ireland which has captured almost a billion items in its first year.",
      "All of these political rows have been frustrating to people who just want to see the marine environment free of litter.",
      "Kirsty Crawford from the Marine Conservation Society (MCS) says it's vital for places like Arrochar that the current target date of 2027 is not pushed back again.",
      "She said: \"With each fresh high tide you're going to get more litter washing in.",
      "\"It is a big task at hand but this is where we hope the deposit return scheme would help see a reduction in that problem.\"",
      "The scheme in Ireland went live a year ago and more than 900 million items have so far been returned to shops.",
      "Consumers have to pay a deposit of 15 cents for every standard-sized plastic bottle or can which is purchased. The deposit is refunded when the item is returned.",
      "Glass is not included in the scheme.",
      "Some retailers were initially resistant, but others say it has led to an increase in footfall in shops.",
      "Reverse vending machines can cost shop owners about \u20ac15,000 (\u00a312,500), but stores do have the option of collecting returned items over the counter.",
      "Environmental group Coastwatch Europe, which monitors more than 500 stretches of shore in Ireland, says the scheme is already having a significant impact.",
      "Seven years ago volunteers were recording around 60 bottles per kilometre of beach - but a survey in September and October found an average of eight per kilometre.",
      "Co-founder Karin Dubsky believes that's not just down to the deposit return scheme but also a broader appreciation of the impact of plastic pollution.",
      "\u201dThere is so much positivity and I think it has opened the gates to a different kind of thinking,\u201d she said.",
      "Politicians hope a deposit return scheme scheme will boost Scotland\u2019s stubborn household recycling figures, which have barely budged for a decade.",
      "In 2023, 43.5% of household waste was recycled, compared with 42.9% in 2014.",
      "The Scottish government says it expects the scheme to reduce littering by a third and increase recycling of single-use drinks containers to 90%.",
      "Lorna Slater, the Scottish Greens minister who introduced the scheme during her time in government, says she hopes glass can still ultimately be included in the scheme.",
      "But she says it\u2019s most important that there are no further delays to its rollout.",
      "That view is echoed by environmental charities like the MCS and Keep Scotland Beautiful.",

    "published": "Sat, 01 Feb 2025 00:45:04 GMT",
    "summary": "Some scientists fear the risk of a collapse to warm Atlantic currents has not been taken seriously.",
    "story": [
      "Of all the possible climate futures, there's a scenario where the United Kingdom and north-west Europe buck the trend of global warming and instead face plunging temperatures and freezing winters.",
      "It's not the most likely outcome, but a number of scientists fear that the chance of it happening is growing, and that the consequences would be so great that it deserves proper consideration.",
      "They are concerned that the ocean currents that bring warm water from the tropics to the North Atlantic could weaken - or even collapse - in response to climate change.",
      "Huge uncertainties remain about when - or even whether - a collapse could happen. So, how likely is it, and what would it mean?",
      "The system of Atlantic currents, called the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (Amoc), is a key reason why the UK is warmer than Moscow, despite being a similar distance from the Equator.",
      "Forming a vital part of our climate system, this conveyor belt distributes energy around the planet, bringing warm, salty water from the tropical Atlantic to cooler regions south of Greenland and Iceland, and also the Nordic Seas.",
      "The warmth from the ocean is transferred to the air above it, helping keep temperatures milder than they otherwise would be.",
      "As this salty water cools, it becomes denser, and sinks, before flowing back towards the southern hemisphere as a deep ocean current. This water eventually gets pulled back up to the surface, and the circulation continues.",
      "But Amoc appears to be getting weaker.",
      "We don't know for sure, because direct and continuous measurements of Amoc strength have only been taken since 2004. That's not long enough to be able to identify a definite change.",
      "But indirect evidence suggests it could have already slowed by around 15% over the last couple of centuries, although not all scientists agree.",
      "One indication is the sediments on the ocean floor. Larger grains indicate a stronger current. By measuring the size of the grains and calculating their age, scientists can estimate how much Amoc has slowed over time.",
      "Another piece of evidence is the so-called 'cold blob' or 'warming hole' in the north Atlantic. This describes a region which appears to have cooled in recent decades, unlike the vast majority of the world.",
      "A slowdown in Amoc - meaning less warmer water would be transported to this region - is seen as a possible culprit.",
      "This is \"a very clear signature and footprint of a classic Amoc slowdown\" says Matthew England, professor of oceanography at the University of New South Wales.",
      "The UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) expects Amoc to weaken this century. But the major concern is that Amoc could suddenly \"switch off\", as appears to have happened repeatedly in the Earth's past.",
      "Today, global warming appears to be making the water in the north Atlantic less salty, due to extra freshwater from a melting Greenland ice sheet and more rainfall.",
      "As fresher water doesn't sink as easily, this is expected to slow the circulation and so bring less saltwater northwards from the tropics.",
      "Beyond a \"tipping point\", this loop could lead Amoc to runaway collapse.",
      "\"We really want to avoid a tipping point because then there's nothing we can do about it,\" warns David Thornalley, professor of ocean and climate science at University College London.",
      "Where might the tipping point be?",
      "No one really knows how close it may be.",
      "In 2021, the IPCC said it had \"medium confidence\" that Amoc would not collapse abruptly this century, although it expected it to weaken.",
      "But some more recent studies have pointed to a growing possibility of Amoc passing a tipping point in the coming decades, beyond which full collapse would be inevitable.",
      "Each study comes with various caveats and uncertainties, and different climate models can give different results for a system as complex as Amoc.",
      "\"We don't believe the idea of an Amoc collapse this century has substantially changed because of these new results,\" cautions Dr Laura Jackson, oceanographer at the Met Office.",
      "But many scientists are growing increasingly concerned. Prof Thornalley argues that, whatever the imperfections of individual studies, taken together they \"lead to a conclusion that we maybe need to be worried\".",
      "Following the new evidence, more than 40 leading ocean and climate scientists signed an open letter last October calling for wider recognition of the \"greatly underestimated\" risks.",
      "That is not to say the signatories believe Amoc will pass a tipping point this century. But they warn it is now enough of a possibility to warrant proper consideration.",
      "\"I'd say you're looking at a risk of reaching a tipping point in the coming decades that could be at the 10 or 20% level even if we hold the line at 2C warming [above temperatures of the late 19th Century, before humans started significantly warming the climate],\" warns Tim Lenton, professor of Earth system science at the University of Exeter.",
      "Given the magnitude of the consequences from Amoc collapse, these probabilities \"are not trivial,\" he adds.",
      "What would happen if Amoc collapsed?",
      "Even the most likely scenario - where Amoc continues to weaken this century - could have serious effects.",
      "\"If the Amoc gradually weakens over the next century, you're going to get global warming but less warming over Europe,\" says Dr Jackson.",
      "That would still mean the UK getting hotter summers with climate change, but a weaker Amoc could also fuel more winter storms as regional temperature patterns change.",
      "A full-scale collapse, meanwhile, would be \"like a war situation [\u2026] something almost unimaginable,\" says Prof Lenton.",
      "While it could take a century or more for impacts to play out, temperatures in northern Europe could fall by a couple of degrees a decade.",
      "In the UK, it could \"become horribly, horribly cold \u2026 like living in northern Norway,\" Prof Thornalley warns.",
      "\"Our infrastructure is not set up for that.\"",
      "There could be global consequences too, such as shifts to the tropical rain belts.",
      "\"That's a big story,\" warns Prof Lenton.",
      "\"If you lost the monsoon or seriously disrupted it, you'd have humanitarian catastrophes, in simple terms, in west Africa [and] probably in India.\"",
      "How we prepare for this alternative future poses challenges for governments.",
      "Prof Lenton draws parallels with preparations for the Covid-19 pandemic - another major event which scientists had warned about, but had no way of knowing when it might occur.",
      "But a recent report warned the UK has a \"glaring national security blind spot for climate threats\" such as those posed by Amoc collapse. The government admitted last year that it \"has not assessed the effect of any [Amoc] slowing or collapse\" on economic planning.",
      "Scientists are clear that the fundamental way to reduce these risks is to cut the greenhouse gas emissions causing climate change.",
      "\"We're playing a bit of a Russian roulette game,\" warns Prof England.",
      "\"The more we stack up the atmosphere with greenhouse gases, the more we warm the system, the more chance we have of an Amoc slowdown and collapse.",

      "We do know that it was built on their shoulders: using a number of Nvidia chips (probably older ones, because of US sanctions) and some opensource AI architecture developed by Meta. In addition, OpenAI has complained that rivals are using its work in order to advance their own (contacts in the creative industries were amused at the irony of this, given that OpenAI products will happily produce output \"in the style of\" individual human creators).",

    "published": "Sun, 02 Feb 2025 00:07:35 GMT",
    "summary": "Tomohiko Sho says the unreleased game was something fans were 'starting to get a bit bored of'.",
    "story": [
      "It is rare that a video game series becomes so popular it inspires copycats - but it is rarer still that it's so unique it kicks off its own genre.",
      "But that's what happened with Dynasty Warriors, a series which pioneered the so-called \"1 vs 1,000\" gameplay, in which the player defeats thousands of enemies in each level.",
      "Throughout years of development - the series has been going since 1997 on the original PlayStation - hardware limitations meant at its best only a few hundred enemies could appear on-screen at any one time.",
      "But all that is now changing, with the power of modern consoles enabling as many as 10,000 opponents on-screen at once.",
      "In other words, the \"1 vs 1,000\" moniker is finally coming true.",
      "And with that new power comes a new game - after seven years in the wilderness, publisher Koei Tecmo is back with Dynasty Warriors: Origins.",
      "Throughout this period the series has faced a problem - despite selling 21 million copies throughout its history - Dynasty Warriors has always sold significantly better in Japan than in the West.",
      "\"It's something that we've been trying to get a lot of people overseas to play,\" the head of developer Omega Force, Tomohiko Sho, told the BBC.",
      "But times may be changing, as the release of Dynasty Warriors: Origins in January 2025 has seen encouraging sales.",
      "In the UK, it broke the top 10 of the retail sales charts, while online it was the top-selling game on PC retailer Steam - with just under 70,000 people playing the game at the same time on launch.",
      "There have been nine numbered entries in the series since it began in 1997, culminating in 2018's Dynasty Warriors 9 on the PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC.",
      "But advances in hardware mean Mr Sho believes now is the time for a sequel.",
      "Though he did not call it a reboot, the team has ditched the numbered titles and simply called the game Dynasty Warriors: Origins - perhaps signalling that the studio believes this is a turning point for the franchise.",
      "It released on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S and PC in January 2025, becoming the first mainline entry in the series in seven years.",
      "Mr Sho told the BBC the team had been working on a sequel - which would have been called Dynasty Warriors 10 - but he felt it was simply too similar to previous games, which fans were \"starting to get a bit bored of\".",
      "Instead, the long-awaited game was scrapped in order to take advantage of the new hardware.",
      "DW10 cancelled",
      "The reason Dynasty Warriors: Origins seeks to break away from what came before is simple, Mr Sho said - it was a result of fan reaction to the last mainline game released in the series, 2018's Dynasty Warriors 9.",
      "\"Either you really liked it, or you didn't,\" he said.",
      "The unreleased sequel was too similar to what came before, he said, but by the time development was in full swing, a change in the games industry ultimately halted production.",
      "Within two days of each other in November 2020, Sony released the PlayStation 5 and Microsoft launched the Xbox Series X - consoles so powerful Mr Sho ceased development to focus on the new hardware.",
      "\"The current technology allows us to have many troops and army officers on the screen,\" he said.",
      "\"This is something I've been wanting to do since Dynasty Warriors 2 and 3.\"",
      "Those two games, which released on PlayStation 2 back in 2000 and 2001, could at most manage twenty or thirty enemies on-screen at once.",
      "The new hardware can manage a lot more - with PlayStation 5 Pro owners seeing an even bigger leap in performance.",
      "\"We're able to have many troops on-screen - not just thousands, but tens of thousands,\" Mr Sho said.",
      "\"With the current generation of consoles, we're able to do that.\"",
      "But all that power comes with a cost - no multiplayer, which has been a staple of the series since its PlayStation 2 days.",
      "\"I am very aware that it is seen as an iconic part of the series,\" he said.",
      "He felt multiplayer would result in a \"performance loss\", meaning fewer enemies on screen, so he decided against including it.",
      "But he said that may change if the game were given a sequel.",
      "\"If everyone really enjoys the game, then for the next game in the series, we will definitely have multiplayer,\" he said.",
      "Spin-offs and future",
      "In the interim years between the release of Dynasty Warriors 9 and Dynasty Warriors: Origins, the team has focussed on other things - namely spin-offs.",
      "These are versions of the game, within the 1 vs 1,000 genre, outside of the main series that typically feature different characters - much like how the film franchise Puss in Boots was a spin-off of Shrek.",
      "The company has found success in this area with games featuring characters from series such as Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda and Sega's Persona 5.",
      "Mr Sho said Dynasty Warriors: Origins was a shift in direction as it focused on performance - while spin-offs were about being true to the franchises involved.",
      "\"When the teams were approaching development, they weren't thinking about the hardware,\" he said.",
      "\"But more, with Hyrule Warriors and Fire Emblem Warriors being on the Switch, how would we be able to do that best as a Warriors game?\"",
      "He said Dynasty Warriors' future was about \"getting the most\" out of current consoles - perhaps with even more enemies on screen.",
      "Though he laughed off the suggestion that perhaps the studio should consider collaborating on the ultimate \"spin-off\" - a Sonic the Hedgehog game.",
      "\"I also actually like Sonic, just to let you know,\" he said.",
      "And Mr Sho said if he could make any Dynasty Warriors spin-off, there are two series he's huge fans of - Star Wars and Lord of the Rings.",
      "\"If there is a chance, I'd definitely love to take on the challenge,\" he said."

      "The Sims was never supposed to be a hit.",
      "Back in the 1990s, when creator Will Wright pitched the game to his bosses, they weren't convinced by his idea of a \"virtual dollhouse\".",
      "A so-called life simulator where players design their own characters, give them personalities and tend to their needs.",
      "Who wants that?",
      "Quite a lot of people, it turns out.",
      "Now, 25 years from its debut, The Sims is one of the best-selling video game series of all time, with an active community of superfans known as Simmers.",
      "The latest instalment, The Sims 4, has been translated into 18 languages and played by 85 million people worldwide, according to publisher Electronic Arts.",
      "The original game's open-ended nature helped it to become a hit and reach so-called \"casual gamers\" outside the medium's more dedicated audience.",
      "Players had the freedom to carefully craft a detailed domestic setting for their digital people, managing their love lives, daily routines, basic needs and hobbies in exacting detail.",
      "But it also allowed them to imagine various torments for their virtual pals. One of the most famous - stranding your Sim in a swimming pool without a ladder - remains a popular meme to this day.",
      "UK-based streamer Jesse, best known as Plumbella, says she became obsessed with the legendary trick when she first played the game at five years old.",
      "The Sims has been part of Jesse\u2019s life ever since, thanks, she says, to the community around it.",
      "Players can create modifications or \"mods\" that alter different elements from the way the game plays to a character's appearance.",
      "Extra height options, having multiple jobs and neurodivergent personality traits are among some of the popular fan-made add-ons.",
      "For dedicated fans, Jesse says, the longevity comes from building on each other's creations.",
      "As she puts it: \"Take something and customise it and share it with other Simmers.",
      "\"It's really interesting to see the ways that people can come up with to use their game in an interesting way.\"",
      "The ability to express yourself in The Sims also made it a popular title among its many players from diverse communities.",
      "Even at its launch in 2000, The Sims included same-sex relationships at a time when choices around sexuality or identity in gaming were rare.",
      "Creator Mollie, who streams as TheEnglishSimmer, makes a lot of LGBT-themed content for her channel.",
      "She says developer Maxis has \"always been kind of a spearhead in the gaming industry when it comes to telling diverse stories and wanting to show that representation\".",
      "Mollie says The Sims has given her a platform to find others like her.",
      "\"That's been so wonderful that I have been able to tell my stories and connect with people and they can see themselves represented,\" she says.",
      "The Sims has come in for more criticism over the years for its racial representation.",
      "American content creator Amira, known as Xmiramira online, created a custom skin tone pack for The Sims 4 that's still used by many players today.",

      "\"But the difference between The Sims and other games is I can do something about it.\"",
      "Amira's Melanin Pack was a hit when it was released, and she's since worked with Maxis and Electronic Arts on officially adopting more skin tones into the game.",
      "\"For me that's a big part of why I've played the game for so long,\" she says.",
      "\"I can do what I want, I can make a Sim with any body type, complexion, hair, whatever I want to do, it's one of the most customisable games I have.\"",
      "Amira says she's noticed more and more games offering the ability to choose different skin tones, body types and hairstyles without the need for third-party add-ons.",

      "Zoe Delahunty-Light, a video producer at website Eurogamer, commends The Sims for making \"great strides\" with diversity and working with creators to build authentic representation into the game.",
      "But she does point out that much of the work was done first, for free, by modders.",
      "The official Lovestruck add-on, Zoe says, introduces polyamorous relationships to the game and costs \u00a330 ($37).",
      "\"So it can feel like it is squeezing as much money as it can out of people who desire representation the most, which is pretty audacious,\" she says.",
      "The game has also been criticised over a lack of inclusion for players with disabilities, both in their ability to modify its controls and see themselves on screen.",
      "\"The game still lacks the option to change key binds, which is a basic accessibility issue,\" says Zoe.",
      "Developer Maxis has previously said it's discussing the introduction of more accessibility features to the game.",

      "Critics argue these schemes are discriminatory and used to push political agendas, while supporters argue that they work to combat inequalities.",
      "The tech industry has followed suit, with companies such as Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, scrapping its DEI efforts and also cutting moderation teams.",
      "There's a question over whether this could impact gaming, where companies are often criticised for failing to adequately tackle racial and gender-based harassment on their platforms.",

      "\"Everybody should be able to, for the most part, make themselves with little to no issue,\" she says.",

      "\"I've given over 100 billion,\" he says, \"but I still have more to give.\"",
      "That's dollars, just to clarify, worth about \u00a380bn.",
      "It's roughly equivalent to the size of the Bulgarian economy or the cost of building the whole HS2 line.",
      "But to put it in context, it's also around the same as just one year of Tesla sales. (Tesla owner Elon Musk is now the richest man on the planet, a position Gates held for many years.)",
      "The co-founder of Microsoft and his fellow philanthropist Warren Buffett are combining their billions through the Gates Foundation he originally set up with his now ex-wife Melinda.",
      "Gates says philanthropy was instilled in him early on. His mother regularly told him \"with wealth came the responsibility to give it away\".",
      "His Foundation's 25th anniversary is in May, and Gates exclusively revealed the $100bn figure to the BBC.",
      "He tells me, for his part, he enjoys giving his money away (and around $60 billion of his fortune has gone into the Foundation so far).",
      "When it comes to his day-to-day lifestyle, he doesn't actually notice the difference: \"I made no personal sacrifice. I didn't order less hamburgers or less movies.\" He can also, of course, still afford his private jet and his various huge houses.",
      "He plans to give away \"the vast majority\" of his fortune, but tells me he has talked \"a lot\" with his three children about what might be the right amount to leave them.",
      "Will they be poor after he's gone? I ask him. \"They will not,\" he replies with a quick smile, adding \"in absolute, they'll do well, in percentage terms it's not a gigantic number\".",
      "Gates is a maths guy and it shows. At Lakeside School in Seattle, in eighth grade, he competed in a four-state regional maths exam and did so well that, at 13, he was one of the best high school maths students of any age in the region.",
      "Maths terminology comes second nature to him. But to translate, if you're worth $160bn, which Bloomberg's Billionaires Index claims he is, even leaving your children a tiny percentage of your fortune still makes them very rich.",
      "I'm with one of only 15 people on the planet who are centibillionaires (worth more than $100bn), according to Bloomberg. We're in his childhood home in Seattle, a mid-century modern four-bedroom house set into a hill, and we're meeting because he's written a memoir, Source Code: My Beginnings, focusing on his early life.",
      "I want to find out what shaped a challenging, obsessive child who didn't fit the norm into one of the tech pioneers of our age.",
      "He's brought along his sisters, Kristi and Libby, and all three excitedly tour the home where they grew up. They haven't been back in some years and the current owners have refurbished (fortunately, the Gates siblings seem to approve of the changes).",
      "But it's bringing back memories including, as they walk into the kitchen, of the now-long-gone intercom system between rooms beloved by their mother. She used it to \"sing to us in the morning\", Gates tells me, to get them out of their bedrooms for breakfast.",
      "Mary Gates also set their watches and clocks eight minutes fast so the family would work to her time. Her son often rebelled at her efforts to improve him, but now tells me \"the crucible of my ambition was warmed through that relationship\".",
      "He puts his competitive spirit down to his grandmother \"Gami\", who was often with the family in this house and who taught him to outsmart the competition early on with games of cards.",
      "I follow him down the wooden stairs as he heads off to find his old childhood bedroom in the basement. It's a neat guest room now, but young Bill spent hours, even days, in here \"thinking\", as his sisters put it.",
      "At one point, his mum was so fed up with the mess that she confiscated any item of clothing she found on the floor and charged her stubborn son 25 cents to buy it back. \"I started wearing fewer clothes,\" he says.",
      "By this time, he was hooked on coding and, with some tech-savvy school friends, had been given access to a local firm's one computer in return for reporting any problems. Obsessed with learning to program in those nascent days of the tech revolution, he would sneak out at night through his bedroom window without his parents knowing to get more computer time.",
      "\"Do you think you could do it now?\" I ask.",
      "He starts unwinding the catch and opens the window. \"It's not that hard,\" he says with a smile as he climbs up and out. \"It's not hard at all.\"",
      "There is a famous early clip of Gates in which a TV presenter asks him if it's true he can jump over a chair from a standing position. He does it right there in the studio. I'm in the Gates childhood bedroom for something that feels like \"a moment\". The guy's nearly 70. But he's still game.",
      "He seems at ease - and it isn't just because we're in a familiar environment. In the memoir, he's revealed publicly for the first time that he thinks if he were growing up today, he'd probably be diagnosed on the autism spectrum.",
      "The only time I met him before was in 2012. He barely looked me in the eye as we did a quick interview about his goal to protect children from life-threatening diseases. There was certainly no pre-interview small talk. I wondered after our interaction whether he was on the spectrum.",
      "The book lays it out: his ability to hyperfocus on subjects he was interested in; his obsessive nature; his lack of social awareness.",
      "He says at elementary school he turned in a 177-page report on Delaware, having written off for brochures about the state, even sending stamped addressed envelopes to local companies asking for their annual reports. He was 11.",
      "His sisters tell me they knew he was different. Kristi, who's older, says she felt protective of him. \"He was not a normal kid\u2026 he would sit in his room and chew pencils down to the lead,\" she said.",
      "They're obviously close. Libby, a therapist, tells me she wasn't surprised to hear he believes he is on the spectrum. \"The surprise was more his willingness to say 'this might be the case',\" she says.",
      "Gates says he hasn't had a formal diagnosis and doesn't plan to. \"The positive characteristics for my career have been more beneficial than the deficits have been a problem for me,\" he says.",
      "He thinks neurodiversity is \"certainly\" over-represented in Silicon Valley because \"learning something in great depth at a young age - that helps you in certain complex subjects\".",
      "Elon Musk has also said he is on the spectrum, referencing Asperger's syndrome. The Tesla, X and SpaceX billionaire is famously courting Donald Trump, as are the other modern-day tech bros, Meta's Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon's Jeff Bezos among other Silicon Valley attendees at Trump's inauguration.",
      "Gates tells me although \"you can be cynical\" about their motives, he too reached out to the president. They had a three-hour dinner on 27 December \"because he's making decisions about global health and how we help poor countries, which is a big focus of mine now\".",
      "I ask Gates, himself a target of some pretty wild conspiracy theories, what he thinks of the decision taken by Zuckerberg after Trump's election to dump fact-checking in the US on his sites. Gates tells me he's not \"that impressed\" by how governments or private companies are navigating the boundaries between free speech and truth.",
      "\"I don't personally know how you draw that line, but I'm worried that we're not handling that as well as we should,\" he says.",
      "He also thinks children should be protected from social media, telling me there's a \"good chance\" that banning under-16s, as Australia is doing, is \"a smart thing\".",
      "Gates tells me \"social networking, even more than video gaming, can absorb your time and make you worry about other people approving you\" so we have to be \"very careful how it gets used\".",
      "As for Trump's first pick for US health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, who claims he isn't anti-vaccination but has promoted debunked claims about vaccines, Gates makes short shrift. He tells me RFK Jr is \"misleading people\".",
      "The Bill Gates origin story isn't rags to riches. His dad was a lawyer, money wasn't tight, although the decision to send their son to private school to try to motivate him was \"a stretch, even on my father's salary\".",
      "If they hadn't, we might never have heard of Bill Gates.",
      "He first got access to an early mainframe computer via a teletype machine at the school, after the mothers held a jumble sale to raise the money. The teachers couldn't figure it out, but four students were on it day and night. \"We got to use computers when almost nobody else did,\" he says.",
      "Much later, he would set up Microsoft with one of those school friends, Paul Allen. Another, Kent Evans, Gates' best friend, would die tragically age 17 in a climbing accident. As we walk around Lakeside School, we pass the chapel where they held his funeral and where Gates remembers crying on the steps.",
      "Together, they'd had big plans. When they weren't on computers, they were reading biographies to work out what factors made people successful.",

On Thursday night, police had still not confirmed the identity of the gunman - widely reported by Swedish media to be 35-year-old local Rickard Andersson - nor any details about his motive or the victims.",
      "In a statement issued early on Wednesday, less than 24 hours after the attack, police said the shooter did not appear to be motivated by any ideology. On Thursday, Anna Bergkvist, who is leading the police investigation, appeared to walk the statement back.",
      "\"Why they said that, I cannot comment,\" she told the BBC. \"We are looking at different motives and we will declare it when we have it.\"",
      "Swedish police are usually cautious about naming suspects during an investigation, but the absence of official information has contributed to a feeling of fear and uncertainty among Orebro's immigrant communities over the past few days.",
      "\"We are getting all our information from the media and I don't know why,\" said Nour Afram, 36, who was inside the Risbergska school when the attack began.",
      "\"We need more information,\" she said. \"We don't know why he did it, why did he target this school? Was he sick or was it something else?\"",
      "Afram was waiting to go into class when she heard people screaming that there was a shooter - something so unbelievable to her she thought at first it was a prank.",
      "\"We started to run and then I heard the gunshots,\" she said. \"One at first, then tak tak tak -  maybe ten shots. I was so scared I felt like my heart stopped in my chest.\"",
      "Afram, who immigrated from Syria to Orebro as a child, said she was afraid for the first time to send her three children to school in Sweden.",
      "Zaki Aydin, a 50-year-old Syriac language teacher in Orebro, said he was afraid for the first time for his young students, who are mostly from the Middle East. \"We are foreigners, we have to be careful now,\" he said.",
      "Aydin used to have the doors of his classroom and the church building open when he taught. \"Now we are closing them,\" he said. \"And yesterday I asked someone to stand outside to prevent anyone we didn't know already from coming in.\"",
      "One of the pupils at the school, 18-year-old Gabriel, said a \"nightmare had come true\" for Orebro.",
      "\"The problem is we have no motive, only speculation,\" he said. \"A lot of people my age are frightened to go to school, we feel like Sweden has become like America. The things you see on television have happened here.\"",
      "In the absence of any official news about the motive, all that the residents here in Orebro know is that the killer appears to have been a reclusive white Swedish man and that he targeted a school with a large immigrant student base.",
      "Tomas Poletti Lundstrom, an academic researcher in racism at Uppsala University, who happens to live just a few minutes from the site of the attack and heard police helicopters fly over his home on Tuesday, said Orebro was facing a \"deeply horrible time\".",
      "\"You can really sense it everywhere here, it is affecting everyone,\" Lundstrom said. \"We don't know the motives of the shooter yet, but we are living in a very racist time and this is a school for a lot of immigrants.\"",
      "Attacks like the one at Risbergska were \"the outcome of how our society looks at the moment, how our politicians talk, and how we talk about one another\", he said.",
      "\"The government and the main opposition support anti-immigrant policies and use anti-immigrant rhetoric,\" he added. \"This is what happens when politicians speak the way they are speaking.\"",
      "At the cordoned off entrance to Risbergska school early on Thursday morning, people were stopping by to leave flowers, light candles, or simply to stand and take in the scene. From the street, you can clearly see the front door through which the killer was filmed appearing to go from classroom to classroom with a rifle.",
      "Among those who came alone and stood for a while by the collection of candles and flowers was the city's mayor, John Johansson, who had made an official visit to the site the day before alongside the prime minister and the king and queen but stopped there again on his way to work on Thursday to pay his respects.",
      "\"I hope that the police will find conclusions soon,\" Johansson said. \"The city needs answers, our society needs answers, and the families of the victims need to know why this happened.\"",
      "But it was not time to \"speculate or rush ahead\", he said. \"We do not want to contribute to any false rumours, and so we hope the police will find answers as early as possible.\"",
      "Tony Estroem, a salesman from Eskilstuna, about 80km from Orebro, also stopped by the school on Thursday morning. \"This kind of shooting, at a school, you read about it elsewhere but not in Sweden,\" he said.",
      "\"It looks to be a Swedish guy, and perhaps that is better than if it had been an immigrant responsible,\" he added. \"Of course it is a terrible event either way, but we do not want to add more fuel to the fire.\"",
      "Police have given out some limited information about their investigation. They said that about 130 officers responded to the shooting in total, and that they were met by an \"inferno\" in the school. They said that they believe the gunman acted alone.",
      "Family members, former school friends and neighbours have told Swedish media he had become a recluse in recent years and may have suffered with psychological issues.",
      "There have been complaints about the handling of the case. The Bosnian ambassador Bojan Sosic, who also visited the site of the shooting, learned from residents that a Bosnian was among the dead.",
      "\"I find it odd, to say the least, that the police chooses to withhold information that pertains to foreign citizens from respective embassies,\" he said.",
      "Others, including members of the Syrian community, said they trusted the police were doing the right thing and only hoped to learn more soon. Kasselia, the Syrian Orthodox priest, said that the wider community \"does not know what the police are thinking, but we trust that they have their own plan\".",
      "Hundreds of people came to Kasselia's church on Thursday night from the Syrian, Turkish, Iraqi and other migrant communities. A picture of Salim Iskef, one of the shooting's victims, sat on an easel. Children from the congregation sung hymns. Iskef's family, sitting in a pew near the front, were consumed by grief.",
      "It is difficult to understand why these sorts of attacks happen even when the motive is known. Without it, it is even more confounding. A few hours before the memorial service began, Kasselia had been sitting in a pew in his empty church, trying to make sense of it.",
      "\"People die, of course. They become sick, they have some accident,\" he said. \"But this, how can we understand this? To be shot dead in a school. We could not dream of this. We cannot even describe it. Why?\"",
      "There was some comfort in hearing from the police that the gunman acted alone, Kasselia said. It left less anxiety of another attack.",
      "\"But this man had something in his heart, some kind of hate, that he gathered from somewhere,\" the priest said. \"We cannot say there are not others.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 06 Feb 2025 23:34:31 GMT",
    "summary": "A haven for the super rich, or a city built on scams? The BBC was invited to find out.",
    "story": [
      "The tall, shiny buildings which rise out of the cornfields on the Myanmar side of the Moei river are a sight so jarring you find yourself blinking to be sure you haven't imagined it.",
      "Eight years ago there was nothing over there in Karen State. Just trees, a few roughly built cement buildings, and a long-running civil war which has left this area of Myanmar one of the poorest places on earth. But today, on this spot along the border with Thailand, a small city has emerged like a mirage. It is called Shwe Kokko, or Golden Raintree.",
      "It is accused of being a city built on scams, home to a lucrative yet deadly nexus of fraud, money-laundering and human trafficking. The man behind it, She Zhijiang, is languishing in a Bangkok jail, awaiting extradition to China.",
      "But Yatai, She Zhijiang's company which built the city, paints a very different vision of Shwe Kokko in its promotional videos \u2013 as a resort city, a safe holiday destination for Chinese tourists and haven for the super-rich.",
      "The story of Shwe Kokko is also one of the unbridled ambition which has rippled out of China in the last two decades.",
      "She Zhijiang dreamed of building this glittering city as his ticket out of the shadowy world of scams and gambling which he inhabited.",
      "But by aiming so high he has drawn the attention of Beijing, which is now keen to stamp out the fraud operations along the Thai-Myanmar border which are increasingly targeting Chinese people.",
      "Publicity about the scams is also hurting Thai tourism \u2013 Thailand is shutting down power to compounds over the border, toughening its banking rules and promising to block visas for those suspected of using Thailand as a transit route.",
      "Shwe Kokko has been left marooned in post-coup, war-wracked Myanmar, unable to bring in the flow of investment and visitors it needs to keep going.",
      "Yatai is trying to fix the city's sinister image by allowing journalists to see it, holding out hope that more favourable reporting might even get She Zhijiang out of jail.",
      "So they invited the BBC to Shwe Kokko.",
      "Inside Shwe Kokko",
      "Getting there is tricky.",
      "Ever since construction began in 2017, Shwe Kokko has been a forbidden place, off-limits to casual visitors.",
      "As the civil war in Myanmar escalated after the 2021 military coup, access became even more difficult. It takes three days from the country's commercial hub Yangon \u2013 through multiple checkpoints, blocked roads and a real risk of getting caught in armed skirmishes. Crossing from Thailand takes just a few minutes, but requires careful planning to avoid Thai police and army patrols.",
      "She Zhijiang's colleagues took us on a tour, highlighting the newly paved streets, the luxury villas, the trees \u2013 \"Mr She believes in making a green city,\" they told us. Our guide was Wang Fugui, who said he was a former police officer from Guangxi in southern China. He ended up in prison in Thailand, on what he insists were trumped-up fraud charges. There he got to know She Zhijiang and became one of his most trusted lieutenants.",
      "At first glance, Shwe Kokko has the appearance of a provincial Chinese city. The signs on the buildings are written in Chinese characters, and there is a constant procession of Chinese-made construction vehicles going to and from building sites.",
      "Yatai is vague about the tenants of all its buildings, as it is about many things. \"Rich people, from many countries, they rent the villas,\" they told us. And what about the businesses? \"Many businesses. Hotels, casinos.\"",
      "However, most of the people we saw were local Karen, one of Myanmar's ethnic minorities, who come into Shwe Kokko every day to work. We saw very few of the overseas visitors who are supposed to be the customers of the hotels and casinos.",
      "Yatai says there are no more scams in Shwe Kokko. It has put up huge billboards all over town proclaiming, in Chinese, Burmese and English, that forced labour was not allowed, and that \"online businesses\" should leave. But we were quietly told by local people that the scam business was still running.",
      "Starting a decade ago in the unchecked frenzy of Chinese investment on the Cambodian coast, then moving to the lawless badlands of Myanmar's border with China, the scam operators have now settled along the Thai-Myanmar border. Around them, the Myanmar military and a hotch-potch of rebel armies and warlords are fighting for control of Karen State.",
      "The scams have grown into a multi-billion dollar business. They involve thousands of workers from China, South East Asia, Africa and the Indian subcontinent kept in walled-off compounds where they defraud people all over the world of their savings.",
      "Some work there willingly, but others are abducted and forced to work. Those who have escaped have told harrowing stories of torture and beatings. Some have come from Shwe Kokko.",
      "We were able to speak to a young woman who had been working in one of the scam centres a couple of weeks before our visit. She had not enjoyed it and been allowed to leave.",
      "Her job, she said, was as part of the modelling team, made up mostly of attractive young women, who contact potential victims and try to build an intimate online relationship with them.",
      "\"The target is the elderly,\" she said. \"You start a conversation like 'oh you look just like one of my friends'. Once you make friends you encourage them by sending pictures of yourself, sometimes wearing your night clothes.\"",
      "Then, she explains, the conversation moves to get-rich-quick schemes, such as crypto investments, with the women claiming that's how they made a lot of money.",
      "\"When they feel close to you, you pass them on to the chatting section,\" she says. \"The chatting people will continue messaging with the client, persuading them to buy shares in the crypto company.\"",
      "During our brief time in Shwe Kokko we were only allowed to see what Yatai wanted us to see. Even so, it was evident that the scams have not stopped, and are probably still the main business in the city.",
      "Our request to see inside any of the newly built office buildings was turned down. Those are private, they kept telling us. We were escorted at all times by security guards seconded from the militia group which controls this part of the border.",
      "We were allowed to film the construction work, and the outsides of the buildings, but not to enter them. Many of the windows had bars on the insides.",
      "\"Everybody in Shwe Kokko knows what goes on there,\" said the young woman who used to work in a scam centre.",
      "She dismissed Yatai's claim that it no longer permitted scam centres in Shwe Kokko.",
      "\"That is a lie. There is no way they don't know about this. The whole city is doing it in those high-rise buildings. No-one goes there for fun. There is no way Yatai doesn't know.\"",
      "Who is She Zhijiang?",
      "\"I can promise that Yatai would never accept telecom fraud and scams,\" said She Zhijiang on a call from Bangkok's Remand Prison, where he is being held.",
      "Yatai wanted us to hear from the man himself, and hooked up a ropey video link. Only Mr Wang could be seen talking to him; we had to stay out of view of the prison guards, and had to rely on Mr Wang to put our questions to him.",
      "Not much is known about She Zhijiang, a small-town Chinese entrepreneur who Beijing alleges is a criminal mastermind.",
      "Born in a poor village in Hunan province in China in 1982, he left school at 14 and learned computer coding. He appears to have moved to the Philippines in his early 20s and into online gambling, which is illegal in China.",
      "This is where he started to make his money. In 2014 he was convicted by a Chinese court of running an illegal lottery, but he stayed overseas.",
      "He invested in gambling businesses in Cambodia, and managed to get Cambodian citizenship. He has used at least four different names.",
      "In 2016, he struck a deal with a Karen warlord, Saw Chit Thu, to build a new city together. She Zhijiang would provide the funds, the Chinese construction machinery and materials, while Saw Chit Thu and his 8,000 armed fighters would keep it safe.",
      "Glitzy videos by Yatai promised a $15bn (\u00a312.1bn) investment and depicted a high-rise wonderland of hotels, casinos and cyberparks. Shwe Kokko was described as part of Xi Jinping's Belt-and-Road Initiative or BRI, bringing Chinese funds and infrastructure to the world.",
      "China publicly dissociated itself from She Zhijiang in 2020, and the Myanmar government launched an investigation into Yatai, which was building far beyond the 59 villas authorised by its investment permit and was operating casinos before these had been legalised in Myanmar.",
      "In August 2022, acting on a Chinese request to Interpol, She Zhijiang was arrested and imprisoned in Bangkok. He and his business partner Saw Chit Thu have also been sanctioned by the British government for their links to human trafficking.",
      "She Zhijiang claims to be a victim of double dealing by the Chinese state. He says he founded his company Yatai on the instruction of the Chinese Ministry of State Security, and insists that Shwe Kokko was then a part of the BRI.",
      "He accuses China's communist leadership of turning on him because he refused to give them control of his project. They wanted a colony on the Thai-Myanmar border, he says. China has denied any business relationship with She Zhijiang.",
      "While he denied any wrongdoing on Yatai's part, She Zhijiang, however, admitted to \"a high probability\" that scammers were coming to Shwe Kokko to spend their money.",
      "\"Because our Yatai City is completely open to anyone who can go in and out freely. Refusing customers, for a businessman like me, is really difficult. This is my weakness.\"",
      "It is, however, stretching credulity to believe that Yatai, which runs everything in Shwe Kokko, was unable to stop scammers coming in and out of the city.",
      "It is also hard to think of any business other than scams which would choose to operate here.",
      "With Thailand cutting off power and telecommunications, electricity comes from diesel generators, which are expensive to run. And communications go through Elon Musk's Starlink satellite system, which is also very costly.",
      "Yatai's strategy is \"to whitewash the project to create a narrative that Shwe Kokko is a safe city\", says Jason Tower, from the United States Institute for Peace, which has spent years researching the scam operation in Shwe Kokko.",
      "He says they may even \"begin moving some of the more notorious components of the scam industry, like torture, into other zones\".",
      "But he doesn't think the plan will work: \"What kinds of legitimate businesses will go into Shwe Kokko? It's simply not attractive. The economy will continue to be a scam economy.\"",
      "A business in a war zone",
      "When we were eventually allowed to see inside one casino in Shwe Kokko, run by a genial Australian, he told us they were going to close it down.",
      "Inside the only customers were local Karen, gambling on a popular arcade-like game where they had to shoot digital fish. We were forbidden from doing any interviews. The back rooms, with the card and roulette tables, were empty.",
      "The Australian manager said the casino - built six years ago - had been popular and profitable when there were just one or two of them, before the civil war. But these days, with at least nine in operation, there were not enough customers to go around.",
      "The real money was in online gambling, which he said was the main business in Shwe Kokko.",
      "It is impossible to know how much money is made through online gambling, and how much through outright criminal activities like money laundering and scams. They are usually run from the same compounds and by the same teams. When we asked Yatai how much money they made they would not tell us \u2013 not even a ballpark figure. That is private, they said.",
      "The company is registered in Hong Kong, Myanmar and Thailand, but these are little more than shell companies, with very little income or revenue passing through them.",
      "We turned down Yatai's offer to see the go-kart track, water park and model farm that they have built. We did glimpse one other casino, while being taken to eat breakfast in Yatai's own luxury hotel, though we could not go inside it. It seemed empty.",
      "The only other facility we were allowed to see was a karaoke club, with spectacular private rooms, cavernous domes entirely covered in digital screens on which huge tropical fish and sharks swam.",
      "They also ran video loops extolling the vision and virtues of She Zhijiang. This club too seemed deserted, except for some young Chinese women who worked there.",
      "They wore opera masks to avoid being identified, and danced unenthusiastically to music for a few minutes before giving up and sitting down.",
      "Interviews were not permitted. We were allowed to talk to a local Karen member of staff, but she was so intimidated by this we got little more than her name.",
      "In his absence, She Zhijiang has left the running of Shwe Kokko to a young prot\u00e9g\u00e9, 31-year-old He Yingxiong. He lives with Wang Fugui in a sprawling villa they have built on the banks of the Moei River, overlooking Thailand, and guarded by massive Chinese bodyguards. There they play mahjong, eat the finest food and drink, and keep an eye on business.",
      "Mr He has a slightly different explanation from his boss for the scams still operating under their noses. \"We are just property developers,\" he said. \"I can guarantee that this kind of thing does not happen here.",
      "\"But even if it does, the local people have their own legal system, so it is their job to deal with it. Our job is just to provide good infrastructure, good buildings and supporting industries.\"",
      "But there is no legal system in this part of Myanmar, nor any government. It is ruled by the various armed groups which control different bits of territory along the Thai border.",
      "Their commanders decide who can build or run a business, taking their cut to help fund their wars against the Myanmar military, or against each other. Many of them are known to be hosting scam compounds.",
      "Mr He admitted that it was the war which had allowed Yatai to obtain the land so cheaply. Karen human rights groups have accused Saw Chit Thu of driving the original inhabitants off their land, with minimal compensation, though it is clear Yatai is also providing badly needed jobs for the locals.",
      "It is the lawlessness of Karen State which makes it so appealing to illegal businesses \u2013 and that doesn't help the image of Shwe Kokko.",
      "Neither do recent headlines.",
      "Last month a 22-year-old Chinese actor, Wang Xing, was rescued from a scam centre on the border after being lured to Thailand with an offer of work on a movie shoot. His disappearance spurred a barrage of questions on Chinese social media, forcing the Thai and Chinese authorities to mount a joint operation to free him.",
      "Chinese tourists have been cancelling their holidays in Thailand, fearing for their safety. Other rescues have followed.",
      "The BBC has been sent emails by some scam victims pleading for help; rescue organisations believe there are still thousands trapped. Nearly all are in smaller compounds along the border south of Shwe Kokko.",
      "Yatai stressed to us that they are not the same as these rougher operations, some little more than a collection of sheds built in forest clearings. That is where all the bad things happen now, they said.",
      "They talked about KK Park, a notorious compound south of the border town of Myawaddy, and Dongmei, a cluster of low-rise buildings run by a prominent Chinese crime lord called Wan Kuok Koi, better known as Broken Tooth.",
      "That distinction hasn't helped She Zhijiang, who once had the ear of politicians, police bosses and even minor royalty in Thailand. Today he appears to have lost even the influence he once had in prison, to buy himself special privileges. He has complained of being roughed up by the guards.",
      "His lawyers are appealing against the Interpol red notice used to justify his arrest, but China's voice will probably be loudest in determining his fate.",
      "From our interview with him, Shi Zhijiang seemed genuinely outraged over his sudden reversal of fortune.",
      "\"Before, I had no understanding of human rights, but now I really understand how horrible it is to have human rights infringed upon,\" he said.",
      "\"It is hard to imagine how the human rights of ordinary people in China are trampled upon when a respected businessman like me, who used to be able to go to the same state banquets as Xi Jinping, does not have his human rights and dignity protected in any way.\"",
      "It seems he really did believe he could build something which would one day transcend Shwe Kokko's sordid origins as a scam city.",
      "What happens to it now is hard to guess, but if the Thai and Chinese governments keep acting to shut down the scams, the money will start to dry up.",

      "Prosecutor Alexandra Pethieu said the rural area was not a war zone: \"And yet that day ended up with a bewildering scene worthy of Mad Max.\"",
      "One officer was knocked down and another was thrown against the car windscreen for several metres.",
      "Hendy-Freegard, who told the court his real name was David Hendy, was released several years early on appeal in the UK after his kidnapping charges were quashed.",
      "Witnesses at his 2005 trial in the UK had described how they had been subjected to years of poverty because of the power he had over them. Coercive or controlling behaviour eventually became a criminal offence in 2015 in England and Wales.",

    "published": "Thu, 06 Feb 2025 03:10:59 GMT",
    "summary": "January was expected to be cooler than the same month last year, but was 0.1C warmer, which experts are struggling to explain.",
    "story": [
      "Last month was the world's warmest January on record raising further questions about the pace of climate change, scientists say.",
      "January 2025 had been expected to be slightly cooler than January 2024 because of a shift away from a natural weather pattern in the Pacific known as El Ni\u00f1o.",
      "But instead, last month broke the January 2024 record by nearly 0.1C, according to the European Copernicus climate service.",
      "The world's warming is due to emissions of planet-heating gases from human activities - mainly the burning of fossil fuels - but scientists say they cannot fully explain why last month was particularly hot.",
      "It continues a series of surprisingly large temperature records since mid-2023, with temperatures around 0.2C above what had been expected.",
      "\"The basic reason we're having records being broken, and we've had this decades-long warming trend, is because we're increasing the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere,\" Gavin Schmidt, director of Nasa's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, told BBC News.",
      "\"The specifics of exactly why 2023, and 2024, and [the start of] 2025, were so warm, there are other elements involved there. We're trying to pin those down.\"",
      "January 2025 ended up 1.75C warmer than January temperatures of the late 19th Century, before humans started significantly warming the climate.",
      "Early last year, global temperatures were being boosted by the natural El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern, where unusually warm surface waters spread across the eastern tropical Pacific. This releases extra heat into the atmosphere, raising global temperatures.",
      "This year, La Ni\u00f1a conditions are developing instead, according to US science group Noaa, which should have the opposite effect.",
      "While La Ni\u00f1a is currently weak - and sometimes takes a couple of months to have its full effect on temperatures \u2013 it was expected to lead to a cooler January.",
      "\"If you'd asked me a few months ago what January 2025 would look like relative to January 2024, my best shot would have been it would be cooler,\" Adam Scaife, head of monthly to decadal predictions at the UK Met Office, said.",
      "\"We now know it isn't, and we don't really know why that is.\"",
      "A simple guide to climate change",
      "What is El Ni\u00f1o and how does it change the weather?",
      "A number of theories have been put forward for why the last couple of years have been warmer than anticipated.",
      "One idea involves a prolonged response of the oceans to the 2023-24 El Ni\u00f1o.",
      "While it was not especially strong, it followed an unusually lengthy La Ni\u00f1a phase from 2020-23.",
      "The El Ni\u00f1o event might therefore have \"lifted the lid\" on warming, allowing ocean heat that had been accumulating to escape into the atmosphere.",
      "But it's unclear how this would still be directly affecting global temperatures nearly a year after El Ni\u00f1o ended.",
      "\"Based on historical data, that effect is likely to have waned by now, so I think if the current record continues, that explanation becomes less and less likely,\" says Prof Scaife.",
      "The fact that sea temperatures in other regions of the world remain particularly warm could suggest \"that the behaviour of the ocean is changing\", according to Samantha Burgess, deputy director of Copernicus.",
      "\"We're really looking to see how the ocean temperatures evolve because they have a direct influence on air temperatures.\"",
      "Another prominent theory is a reduction in the number of small particles in the atmosphere, known as aerosols.",
      "These tiny particles have historically masked some of the long-term warming from greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane by helping to form bright clouds and reflecting some of the Sun's energy back into space.",
      "Aerosol numbers have been falling recently, thanks to reductions in tiny particles from shipping and Chinese industry, for example, aimed at cleaning the air that people breathe.",
      "But it means they haven't had as large a cooling effect to offset the continued warming caused by greenhouse gases.",
      "And this cooling effect of aerosols has been underestimated by the UN, argues James Hansen, the scientist who made one of the first high-profile warnings on climate change to the US Senate in 1988.",
      "Most scientists aren't yet convinced that this is the case. But, if true, it could mean there is greater climate change in store than previously assumed.",
      "The \"nightmare scenario\", says Prof Scaife, would be an extra cloud feedback, where a warming ocean could cause low-level reflective clouds to dissipate, in turn warming the planet further.",
      "This theory is also very uncertain. But the months ahead should help to shed some light on whether the \"extra\" warmth over the past couple of years is a blip, or marks an acceleration in warming beyond what scientists had anticipated.",
      "Currently, most researchers still expect 2025 will end up slightly cooler than 2023 and 2024 \u2013 but the recent warmth means they can't be sure.",
      "What they do know, however, is that further records will follow sooner or later as humanity continues to heat up the planet.",
      "\"In time, 2025 is likely to be one of the cooler years that we experience,\" Dr Burgess said.",
      "\"Unless we turn off that tap to [greenhouse gas] emissions, then global temperatures will continue to rise.\"",

      "The technology giant is also reviewing some of its other DEI programmes.",
      "US President Donald Trump and his allies have regularly attacked DEI policies. Since his return to the White House just over two weeks ago, Trump has ordered government agencies to eliminate such initiatives.",
      "\"We're committed to creating a workplace where all our employees can succeed and have equal opportunities,\" a Google spokesperson said.",
      "\"We've updated our [annual investor report] language to reflect this, and as a federal contractor our teams are also evaluating changes required following recent court decisions and executive orders on this topic.\"",
      "The story was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.",
      "Between 2021 and 2024, Google's investor reports stated its commitment to make \"diversity, equity, and inclusion part of everything we do\". That line is not in its latest report, which was published on Wednesday.",
      "In recent years, Google had been an outspoken supporter of DEI targets, particularly after the murder of George Floyd in 2020 and the protests that followed his death.",
      "At the time, Google's chief executive, Sundar Pichai, set a five-year goal to increase the number of its leaders who came from underrepresented groups by 30%.",

      "Target has also recently announced that it was ending its DEI targets.",
      "In the latest example of the Trump administration's disapproval of such policies, the US President last week speculated, without giving evidence, that DEI had led to an air crash in Washington DC.",

    "story": [
      "US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order that prevents transgender women from competing in female categories of sports.",
      "The order provides guidance, regulations and legal interpretations, and it will enlist the Department of Education to investigate high schools thought to be non-compliant.",
      "Republicans say it restores fairness to sports but LGBT advocacy and human rights organisations have described the move as discriminatory.",
      "The order, which goes into effect immediately, largely covers high school, universities and grassroots sports.",
      "A number of sporting governing bodies, including swimming, athletics and golf, have banned transgender women from competing in the female category at elite level if they have gone through male puberty.",
      "Transgender women banned from top golf toursWorld Athletics bans transgender women",
      "Transgender women banned from top golf tours",
      "World Athletics bans transgender women",
      "According to White House officials who briefed reporters on Wednesday morning, this latest order empowers the Department of Education to investigate how schools implement Title IX, a US law that bans sex discrimination in federally funded education programmes.",
      "An administration official said that the executive order will reverse the position of the Biden administration which in April last year said that LGBT students would be protected by federal law, although it did not give specific guidance on transgender athletes.",
      "\"If you let men take over women's sports teams or invade your locker rooms, you will be investigated for violations of Title IX and risk your federal funding,\" Trump explained.",
      "Additionally, the White House plans to bring in sporting bodies - such as the National Collegiate Athletics Association, or NCAA - to come to the White House to meet female athletes and their parents to discuss concerns.",
      "The official who discussed the order, said the US would do all it could to prevent transgender athletes from competing against females in International Olympic Committee (IOC) competitions that take place on US soil.",
      "President Trump specified that the order would include the 2028 Olympic Games in Los Angeles.",
      "He has said he will deny visas for transgender Olympic athletes trying to visit the US to compete at the LA Games.",
      "Ahead of signing the executive order, Trump declared that \"the war on women's sports is over\", saying that during the LA Games, \"my administration will not stand by and watch men beat and batter female athletes.\"",
      "He said he would direct the secretary of homeland security \"to deny any and all visa applications made by men attempting to fraudulently enter the United States while identifying themselves as women athletes...\"",
      "In a statement sent to the BBC, an IOC spokesperson said that \"working with the respective International Sports Federations, the IOC will continue to explain and discuss the various topics with the relevant authorities\".",
      "White House officials described the policies as being broadly popular with Americans, and critical to ensuring \"fairness\" for women in sports, as well as safety.",
      "In a statement, Human Rights Campaign president Kelley Robinson said that the order \"exposes young people to harassment and discrimination, emboldening people to question the gender of kids who don't fit a narrow view of how they're supposed to dress or look\".",
      "\"For so many students, sports are about finding somewhere to belong,\" Ms Robinson added. \"Not partisan policies that make life harder for them.\"",
      "Less than 1% of the population over the age of 13 in the US are transgender, according to a study by the UCLA Williams Institute, and the number playing sports is smaller.",
      "On Trump's first day in office on 20 January, he signed a separate order calling for the federal government to officially define sex as either being male or female."

    "story": [
      "Italian Justice Minister Carlo Nordio has said Rome had no choice but to release a Libyan war crimes suspect due \"errors and inaccuracies\" in an arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC).",
      "Osama Almasri Najim, head of Libya's judicial police, was apprehended in Turin on 19 January.",
      "Two days later, he was released and flown back to Tripoli on an Italian air force plane.",
      "Mr Najim faces various charges including murder, rape, and torture linked to his role at Tripoli's Mitiga detention centre, and his release drew condemnation from opposition parties and NGOs.",
      "Addressing the Italian parliament on Wednesday, Carlo Nordio said the warrant that led to Mr Najim's detention was riddled with \"inaccuracies, omissions, discrepancies and contradictory conclusions\" which meant the Libyan citizen could not be held in jail.",
      "Interior Minister Matteo Piantedosi said Mr Najim was expelled as he was a \"national security risk\".",
      "Images shared by Libyan media showing a jubilant crowd welcoming Mr Najim back circulated widely on Italian media. The ICC has demanded an explanation from the Italian authorities.",
      "Elly Schlein, leader of the opposition Democratic Party (PD), accused Nordio of speaking not as a government minister but as a \"defence lawyer for a torturer\".",
      "Last week, Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni disclosed that she, Nordio and Piantedosi were under investigation in connection with Mr Najim's release.",
      "A special court that handles cases involving ministers has begun an investigation.",
      "David Yambio, a 27-year-old from South Sudan who says he was abused in Tripoli's Mitiga prison, told the BBC that Italy was \"complicit in the atrocities taking place in Libya\".",
      "He says he first encountered Mr Najim after he was caught at sea while trying to cross the Mediterranean on a boat and was returned to Libya.",
      "After he was forced to join a militia \u2013 which he says was \"a pure nightmare\" \u2013  Mr Yambio ended up in Mitiga, where he says he suffered months of torture. He also said he saw Mr Najim abuse other migrants.",

      "\"Our torturer was in Italy, he was arrested, and then he was smuggled back to Libya,\" Mr Yambio added.",
      "As a signatory to the ICC, Italy is legally bound to execute the court's warrants.",
      "But critics suggest Italy's decision to free Mr Najim may have been influenced by its political and business ties with Libya.",
      "In 2017, the centre-left government of Paolo Gentiloni forged a deal with Tripoli that saw Italy pay the Libyan coastguard to intercept migrant boats before they reach Italian shores.",
      "NGOs have consistently criticised this policy, which they say exposes migrants to dire conditions in Libyan detention centres.",
      "The case has now dominated Italian headlines for weeks.",
      "Yet it is unlikely the investigation into Meloni, Nordio and Piantedosi will yield any meaningful consequences, given the government's solid parliamentary majority.",
      "Last week, Meloni suggested that the investigation was part of a politically motivated attack from the left and said she would not be \"blackmailed or intimidated\".",
      "But some commentators believe that Libya's ability to leverage its relationship with Rome highlights Italy's vulnerability on migration \u2013 one of Meloni's flagship issues.",
      "\"While Meloni insists she is not susceptible to blackmail from the judiciary, she is highly vulnerable to Libya, given her fixation on migration,\" said Nathalie Tocci, director of Rome's Institute for International Affairs.",
      "She added that the issue had been \"weaponised and exploited\" by Libya.",
      "\"The implicit message is: either you release Mr Najim or we will let the migrant boats through.\"",
      "Libya plays a key role in the success of Meloni's Mattei Plan - an ambitious set of policies that aims to boost European co-operation with Africa in exchange for curbing irregular migration.",
      "\"The question of Libya is and remains a matter of... national security, meaning the safety of all citizens,\" former interior minister Marco Minniti told Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera.",
      "\"A large part of national security is played out beyond national borders.\"",
      "For Mr Yambio and other survivors of the atrocities that Mr Najim is accused of, the release of the man they say tortured them is \"a deep betrayal\".",
      "In a letter to Giorgia Meloni, they called for an end to the Italy-Libya migration agreement, as well as the release of those still detained in Libyan camps.",

      "After US President Donald Trump threatened Canada with steep tariffs, Monika Morelli from Montreal cancelled her subscriptions to Netflix and Amazon, two giant American companies.",
      "She also called off a trip that she had planned for later in the year to New Orleans.",
      "\"There is something that has been irrevocably broken now, after centuries of the US and Canada being allies,\" Ms Morelli, 39, told the BBC.",
      "The threaten of import taxes, she said, plus Trump's remarks that Canada could become the 51st US state, \"have made something snap in us all\".",
      "Trump had vowed to slap a 25% tariff on both Canada and Mexico this week, citing issues with border security.",
      "He then struck a surprise deal with Mexico on Monday that resulted in the duties being delayed for 30 days in exchange for more Mexican troops at the border. A similar deal was agreed with Canada later in the day.",
      "For Canadians, who had been deeply anxious about the economic consequences of the tariffs, the delay elicited a sigh of relief. But some feel the threat has caused a rift in the US-Canada relationship.",
      "Data released on Wednesday by national pollster Angus Reid found that 91% of Canadians want their country to rely less on the US in the future, preferring that option over repairing the US-Canada relationship, though more than half still wanted to try.",
      "The opinion survey also noted a big jump in national pride, and found that 90% of Canadians were following this issue closely, mimicking engagement levels not seen since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic.",
      "Shachi Kurl, president of Angus Reid, told the BBC the numbers capture \"a moment of unity\" in the country. They also showed that Canadians have responded to the US tariffs with a shared sense of anger, she said.",
      "With the US being the largest customer for Canadian goods, the tariffs threaten to push the Canadian economy into a recession and put thousands of jobs at risk.",
      "In addition to the tariffs, Trump has stated repeatedly (possibly as a joke) that Canada should instead become a US state to avoid paying the levy - a remark that has been met with fury from Canadians, and has been seen by some as a threat to their sovereignty.",
      "The issue has made way for a surge of patriotism in Canada - notably uniting people from all political stripes at a time when the country had been deeply divided over the leadership of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his policies.",
      "A \"Buy Canadian\" sentiment has been pushed by politicians and the general public, with shoppers wanting to support local businesses and avoid purchasing US-made products in protest over the potential tariffs.",
      "Carole Chandler, a 67-year-old retired public school teacher from Halifax, said that she, like Ms Morelli, had cancelled an upcoming holiday to Florida.",
      "\"I love America and Americans,\" she tells the BBC. \"But I don't want to be one.\"",
      "Even with the temporary pause on tariffs, some Canadian provinces are still pushing ahead with \"Buy Local\" campaigns to encourage people to spend their dollars closer to home.",
      "On Wednesday, Manitoba's premier Wab Kinew said his province will be spending C$140,000 ($97,800; \u00a378,200) on advertising - including on billboards and radio - to push Manitobans to contribute to their local economy.",
      "Provinces are also removing barriers to trade internally within Canada, and many are calling for the country to diversify its trade relationship and build ties elsewhere.",
      "Kinew described the back and forth on the potential tariff war between the US and Canada as akin to \"whiplash\".",
      "\"But through it all, to see people come together and to rally around the flag, to put the Manitoba pride first and foremost, has been very encouraging,\" Kinew said.",
      "Ms Kurl noted that the Canada-US relationship has endured for centuries, and the two countries have long been close allies and partners on the world stage.",
      "\"It's quite an enmeshed relationship,\" she said.",
      "Canadians share not only deep economic ties with the US, but also familial bonds and the world's longest land border. The US has also long been the top travel destination for Canadians.",
      "She said it would not be easy to untangle those ties, and it remains to be seen whether the recent sentiments over Trump's tariffs signal a fundamental shift between the two countries.",
      "A lot of it, she added, could depend on how the relationship with the current US president progresses, and whether the tariff threat materialises.",

Today, there are about 5.9m Palestinians registered by the UN, with most living in Gaza, the occupied West Bank, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.",

      "Israel occupied Gaza and the West Bank in the 1967 Middle East war and began constructing settlements in both that are widely seen as illegal under international law. In 2005, Israel withdrew its troops and settlers from Gaza, although the UN still regards it as Israeli-occupied territory.",

      "If Donald Trump is right about one thing, it is that decades of US diplomacy on Israel and the Palestinians have failed to resolve the conflict.",
      "Peace proposals and presidents have come and gone but the problems have festered. Hamas's attack on Israel on 7 October 2023 and the war in Gaza it triggered were the hideous results.",
      "Trump made his millions as a property developer and, with that hat on, made a perfectly valid observation: if Gaza is to be rebuilt, from scratch in some places, it makes little sense for hundreds of thousands of civilians to be sheltering in the rubble.",
      "The task of rebuilding Gaza will be monumental. Unexploded munitions and mountains of debris have to be removed. Water and power lines have to be repaired. Schools, hospitals and shops need to be rebuilt.",

      "Even for a president who spent much of his first term upending US Middle East policy \u2013 including moving the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and recognising Israeli sovereignty over the occupied Golan Heights \u2013 this was an astonishing proposal.",
      "In their wildest imaginations, no US president ever thought that solving the Israel-Palestinian conflict would involve taking over a chunk of Palestinian territory and evicting its population.",
      "To be clear, to do this by force would be a grave violation of international law.",
      "Some Palestinians would likely choose to leave Gaza and rebuild their lives elsewhere. Since October 2023, as many as 150,000 already have.",
      "But others cannot or will not, either because they lack the financial means to do so or because their attachment to Gaza \u2013 part of the land they call Palestine \u2013 is simply too strong.",
      "Many Gazans are descendants of people who fled or were driven from their homes in 1948 during the creation of the state of Israel - a period Palestinians call the Nakba, the Arabic word for catastrophe.",
      "The thought of another will be too painful for many and they will cling to their reduced lives in what remains of Gaza with a fierce determination.",
      "For Palestinians who dream of a state of their own, alongside Israel, the loss of part of it will feel like an amputation.",
      "Gaza has been physically separated from the West Bank since 1948. Previous rounds of negotiations, as well as Trump's 2020 \"Vision for Peace\", included plans for tunnels or railways that might link the two.",
      "Now Trump is basically telling the Palestinians to give up on Gaza once and for all.",
      "While he does not appear to be advocating the forced deportation of civilians - which is against international law - Trump is clearly encouraging Palestinians to leave.",
      "Palestinian officials have already accused Israel of blocking the supply of tens of thousands of caravans which could help Gazans to stay put in less damaged parts of the territory while reconstruction takes place elsewhere.",

      "Various plans have been discussed for the post-war governance of Gaza.",
      "In December, the two main Palestinian factions, Hamas and Fatah, agreed to form a joint committee to oversee its administration - an agreement which has so far come to nothing.",
      "At other times, discussions have focused on the creation of an international peacekeeping force, possibly made up of troops from Arab countries.",

      "These could be the first, tentative signs of an expanded international - and possibly US-led - presence in Gaza.",

      "If Hamas feels the end product of this whole process is a depopulated Gaza - devoid not just of Hamas, but of all Palestinians - it may conclude there is nothing to talk about and hold on to the remaining hostages it took on 7 October 2023.",
      "Netanyahu's critics have accused him of looking for excuses to blow up the negotiations and resume the war. They are bound to conclude that, with these comments, Trump is a willing accomplice.",
      "On the other hand, the Israeli prime minister's right-wing backers have expressed satisfaction with the US takeover plan, potentially reducing the risk of cabinet resignations and making Netanyahu's immediate political future appear more assured.",
      "In that sense, Trump has given Netanyahu a powerful incentive to keep the ceasefire going.",
      "What did Donald Trump say about the West Bank?",
      "Asked whether he agreed the US should recognise Israeli sovereignty over the occupied West Bank, Trump said he had yet to take a position but that he would have an announcement to make in four weeks' time.",
      "That remark has caused alarm among Palestinians, for whom such an announcement would inevitably be seen as another nail in the coffin for a two-state solution.",
      "Recognising the legitimacy of Israel's settlements in the West Bank would be a hugely consequential move. Most of the rest of the world regards them as illegal under international law, although Israel disputes this.",
      "During previous rounds of peace talks, negotiators recognised that Israel would get to hold onto large settlement blocs as part of a final agreement, probably in exchange for small chunks of Israeli territory.",
      "In 2020, Trump brokered the Abraham Accords, which secured the historic normalisation of relations between Israel and two Arab nations, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Bahrain.",
      "The UAE signed that agreement on the understanding Israel would not annex parts of the West Bank - an understanding which may now be in jeopardy.",

    "published": "Thu, 06 Feb 2025 20:16:56 GMT",
    "summary": "Scientists say it is unclear how many more earthquakes will come to the idyllic Greek island.",
    "story": [
      "\"We've put all our mattresses in the living room,\" says Georgia Nomikou.",
      "The Santorini resident fears the impact of ongoing earthquakes on the Greek island, popular with tourists for its picture-postcard views.",
      "But the idyll has been disrupted this past week by thousands of earthquakes.",
      "Santorini, and other Greek islands in the region, are in the middle of an \"unprecedented\" seismic swarm or crisis - the name for an abrupt increase in earthquakes in a particular area.",
      "About three-quarters of the island's 15,000 population have evacuated while authorities declared a state of emergency after a 5.2 magnitude quake, the largest yet, rocked the island on Wednesday.",
      "Further, albeit smaller quakes, were felt again on Thursday.",
      "The \"clusters\" of quakes have puzzled scientists who say such a pattern is unusual because they have not been linked to a major shock. So what's going on?",
      "What is happening in Santorini?",
      "Experts agree the island is experiencing what Greece's prime minister has called an \"extremely and intricate geological phenomenon\".",
      "\"It is really unprecedented, we have never seen something like this before in [modern times] in Greece,\" says Dr Athanassios Ganas, research director of the National Observatory of Athens.",
      "Santorini lies on the Hellenic Volcanic Arc - a chain of islands created by volcanoes.",
      "But it has not seen a major eruption in recent times, in fact not since the 1950s, so the reason for the current crisis is unclear.",
      "Experts say they're seeing many earthquakes within a relatively small area, which don't fit the pattern of a mainshock-aftershock sequence, says Dr Ganas.",
      "He said this began with the awakening of a volcano on Santorini last summer. Then in January there was a \"surge\" of seismic activity with smaller earthquakes being recorded.",
      "That activity has escalated in the past week.",
      "Thousands of earthquakes have been recorded since Sunday, with Wednesday's the most significant yet.",
      "\"We are in the middle of a seismic crisis,\" Dr Gasnas said.",
      "Dr Margarita Segou from the British Geological Survey described the quakes as happening every day \"in pulses\".",
      "She says this \"swarm-like behaviour\" means that when a more significant  earthquake strikes, for example a magnitude four, the \"seismicity is increased for one to two hours, and then the system relaxes again\".",
      "How much longer will it last?",
      "In short, it is impossible to tell. There are hopes that Wednesday's quake, which struck at night, will be the biggest one to hit the island.",
      "But seismologists have told the BBC it is difficult to be sure. Authorities have warned the activity could go on for weeks.",
      "Experts also do not know whether this chain of quakes are foreshocks leading up to a large earthquake or their own event.",
      "Professor Joanna Faure Walker, an earthquake geology expert at UCL's Institute of Disaster Risk Reduction, said some large earthquakes do experience foreshocks - elevated levels of small to moderate seismic events - before the main shock.",
      "But what is happening now are not volcanic earthquakes, say Dr Ganas. Volcanic earthquakes have a characteristic signature of low frequency wave forms and these have not been exhibited here.",
      "Dr Segou told the BBC she and colleagues had analysed previous earthquakes in the region with machine learning - a data analysis method able to make predictions - to learn how earthquakes in the region in 2002 and 2004 came to an end.",
      "The magnitude of those earthquakes were not as intense as the ones felt now she said. But the \"signatures\" of how they started and ended could help build a picture of what patterns to look out for.",
      "Meanwhile, additional police units and military forces have been deployed to the island to help it cope with any major earthquake.",
      "Ms Nomikou, who is president of Santorini's town council, said her family were staying put but had each packed a small bag, \"ready to go if anything happens\".",
      "But some islanders say they are not fazed by the tremors.",

      "Chantal Metakides insists that she would not be joining her compatriots. \"For 500 years, this house has lived through earthquakes and volcanic eruptions and it's still standing,\" she told AFP news agency, adding, \"there's no reason why this should change\".",

    "story": [
      "Finding and fighting the militants who have become the beating heart of the Islamic State (IS) group in Africa can be tough work as they hide deep in the mountains of north-eastern Somalia.",
      "But in typical Donald Trump style, after the new US president ordered an airstrike on the area last weekend, he posted on social media: \"WE WILL FIND YOU, AND WE WILL KILL YOU!\"",
      "Trump said the hit, less than two weeks into his term, had targeted a senior IS attack planner and other militants in Somalia's semi-autonomous region of Puntland and had \"destroyed the caves they live in, and killed many terrorists without, in any way, harming civilians\".",
      "He boasted that he had succeeded where former US President Joe Biden had failed.",
      "\"Biden and his cronies wouldn't act quickly enough to get the job done. I did!\"",
      "The fact that Somalia was the target of America's first major military operation under the new administration surprised many in the country who feared the US was planning to abandon them.",
      "In his first term, Trump withdrew about 700 American troops, a decision reversed by his successor.",
      "The $600,000 (\u00a3492,000) a year deal the Somalia government recently signed with top Washington lobbying firm, the BGR Group, is an indication of how worried it is.",
      "Under Biden, US troops in Somalia were carrying out special operations, training an elite Somali force and conducting regular airstrikes.",
      "A day before the airstrike, the Washington Post published an interview with Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud in which he pleaded for the US \"not to pull out the American advisers and consultants who are supporting the training of our special forces\".",
      "A post on X from his office after the strike also had a touch of desperation about it, acknowledging \"the unwavering support of the United States in the fight against international terrorism\" and welcoming \"the continued commitment under the decisive leadership of President Donald Trump\".",
      "But airstrikes are different from troops on the ground and Trump did not stop aerial bombardments in his first term. In fact, he increased them to nearly 400.",
      "\"The strike does not mean that the US government is going to step up its military engagement in Somalia,\" says Matt Bryden, the strategic adviser of Nairobi-based Sahan Research.",
      "\"Several American officials expected to assume leadership positions on African affairs no longer perceive Somalia's federal government to be a credible partner and are deeply critical of the high levels of security assistance provided in recent years to very little appreciable effect.\"",
      "Puntland's counter-terrorism approach is different from that of the national Somali government, with which it cut ties in March last year.",
      "It is more self-reliant and not as heavily dependent on support from African Union troops - of which around 12,000 are on the ground - and global powers including the US and Turkey.",
      "As Mohamed Mubarak, head of Puntland's security co-ordination office, points out it is troops from the north-east that have been battling IS for years with little help or thanks from others.",
      "\"It is not fair to put the airstrike front and centre while we have been fighting and dying on the ground,\" Mr Mubarak says.",
      "\"Regardless of what the rest of the world is doing, we are fighting IS, which is an international problem,\" he says.",
      "\"We have not seen much support except from Kenya, Ethiopia and the UAE. We don't know if the Americans will conduct more than one airstrike.\"",
      "Puntland says its forces have captured 48 caves and IS outposts - and destroyed dozens of drones and explosive devices - since launching its full-scale \"hilaac\" or \"lightning\" offensive last year.",
      "Although IS has been active in Somalia for about a decade, it has posed less of a threat than the Islamist group al-Shabab, which controls large parts of the country and has been described as al-Qaeda's most successful affiliate.",
      "However, in recent times, IS has become more significant - locally, regionally and internationally.",
      "The authorities in Puntland and unnamed US officials say IS-Somalia's leader, the orange-bearded, bespectacled Abdulqadir Mumin, is now the global head of IS.",
      "Initial reports suggested he had been killed in a US airstrike last May but have never been confirmed.",
      "Whether or not Mumin is the head of IS or is alive or dead, IS-Somalia has become increasingly worrying for foreign states.",
      "As Trump said: \"These killers, who we found hiding in caves, threatened the United States and our allies.\"",
      "According to Tricia Bacon, director of the policy anti-terrorism hub at American University in Washington DC, \"IS-Somalia has taken on more responsibilities within the Islamic State network, particularly in Africa but beyond the continent as well\".",
      "With branches of IS operating across the continent, from Mozambique to Mali, from the Democratic Republic of Congo to Nigeria, IS-Somalia serves as a crucial nerve centre.",
      "Ms Bacon warns that IS-Somalia is looking beyond Africa too.",
      "\"It is positioned to facilitate and contribute to IS attacks in the West, including the United States. It also seeks to inspire attacks in the West,\" she says.",
      "\"International partners should provide more support to Puntland's ongoing efforts against the group.\"",
      "Mr Bryden says collusion with Iranian-backed Houthi rebels across the Red Sea in Yemen is also an issue.",
      "\"Like al-Shabab, IS-Somalia has received arms and training from the Houthis in Yemen, which is a source of concern for the US government and its allies,\" he says.",
      "A growing number of foreign fighters are joining the group, enhancing its strength in terms of numbers and expertise.",
      "A major source of IS-Somalia recruits are thought to be Ethiopian migrants, who gather in Puntland's port city of Bosaso in the hope of a sea crossing to a better life abroad.",
      "IS offers them better pay than they would earn in the Gulf states and experts say that some of the group's senior commanders are Ethiopian.",
      "\"We assess that IS-Somalia is 80% or more foreign fighters, mostly from North Africa, Ethiopia, Tanzania and the Middle East, in that order,\" says Mr Mubarak.",
      "He estimates the group is about 1,000-strong; UN monitors put it at around 600 to 700.",
      "Last October, the head of the US Africa Command, Michael Langley, said he thought IS had grown in northern Somalia by about \"two-fold\" in a year.",
      "The group staged one of its most sophisticated ever attacks in December, hitting a military base in Puntland's Bari region.",
      "The group released a statement saying not a single Somali was involved. The 12 attackers came from seven countries - Tanzania, Algeria, Morocco, Libya, Tunisia, Yemen and Ethiopia.",
      "The movement has also become more effective at raising money.",
      "The US, UN and Somalia experts say a key part of IS's financial infrastructure - the al-Karrar office - is based in Puntland, disbursing funds and expertise to other branches of the group in Africa and beyond.",
      "The US Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) said IS-Somalia had raised nearly $2m in the first half of 2022 by taxing local businesses, imports, nomads and farmers.",
      "If Puntland's forces are to succeed in driving out the militants, air support will prove invaluable.",
      "Shortly after the US strike, Puntland police said the head of IS-Somalia's assassination squad, Abdirahman Shirwa Aw-Said, had surrendered.",
      "But experts say such strikes will need to be consistent to hunt down existing IS cells in Somalia and stop others mushrooming.",
      "It is unclear whether the US and its unpredictable leader have the appetite to keep bombing Somalia's north-eastern mountains.",

      "They wonder aloud whether Basel will ever be able to freely visit Yuval's home in Israel, whether Basel's village will get building permits, and whether they will one day have stability.",
      "For years, the friends have been filming the destruction of houses, a well and a school by the Israeli army after a court order declared Basel's community illegal. They tell each other they hope they will change that reality.",
      "Now, that scene has reached some of the world's biggest stages.",
      "The film it is in, No Other Land, has been nominated for an Oscar and a Bafta for best documentary feature.",
      "It follows the fight over Masafer Yatta, a community of around 20 villages, and the friendship between Basel Adra and Israeli journalist Yuval Abraham.",
      "In the film Basel is nearly detained after a protest, his father is arrested, and a soldier shoots a community member in the neck while confiscating a generator, leading to the man's paralysis and death.",
      "\"It's scary because yes, the film is succeeding and people are aware of it, but I don't think there is sufficient action, especially amongst those who have power to change this,\" Yuval told the BBC.",
      "\"I don't have an illusion that films are going to change the world, but I know they can change individuals, and I know that they can be part of a bigger change, and we really need this now.\"",
      "Basel and Yuval created the film along with Hamdan Ballal and Rachel Szor over five years.",
      "Asked about the man who was paralysed, the IDF said its investigation had found no crime. A spokesperson said that during an operation against \"illegal construction\", two Palestinians had grabbed a soldier by his weapon and vest, leading to the shot.",
      "Palestinian eyewitnesses told Israeli media they were not contacted as part of the initial investigation and believed the shot was fired intentionally.",
      "Israel has occupied the West Bank since 1967. Israeli settlements in the territory are considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this. They have expanded over the past 55 years, becoming a focal point of violence and conflicting claims over land.",
      "On 7 October 2023, Hamas attacked Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages. That triggered an Israeli military campaign that has killed at least 47,500 people in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.",
      "Since then, settler-related violence in the West Bank has increased, with 13 Palestinians killed by settlers, according to the UN.",
      "More than 850 Palestinians, many of them militants, have been killed by Israeli troops in the West Bank in the same period, the Palestinian health ministry says. The UN says 30 Israelis were killed by Palestinians in the West Bank during that timeframe.",
      "In 2024, the UN recorded about 1,420 incidents of Israeli settler violence \u2013 the highest number that reportedly led to casualties, property damage or both, since records began in 2006.",
      "Additional attacks on Palestinians had occurred since US President Donald Trump's return to power, Basel said, and the filmmakers feared it could worsen.",
      "Trump has lifted sanctions the Biden administration had placed on some settlers. The president's ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, has said Israel has a \"title deed\" to the West Bank and \"there's no such thing\" as occupation or settlements.",
      "When asked on Tuesday whether he agreed the US should recognise Israeli sovereignty over the occupied West Bank, Trump said he had yet to take a position but that he would make an announcement in four weeks' time.",
      "The debate over Masafer Yatta began in the 1980s when Israel declared the area a closed military firing zone, meaning no one was allowed to live there.",
      "According to notes from a 1981 meeting, then-Israeli Agricultural Minister Ariel Sharon offered the military additional training areas to restrict the \"expansion of the Arab villagers from the hills towards the desert\".",
      "Israel argued residents previously did not live there permanently. The Palestinian population took their case to Israel's Supreme Court, arguing communities had lived there for generations and pointing to a 1945 map showing some villages.",
      "In 2022, the Supreme Court ruled in favour of Israel and allowed the demolition of homes and expulsion of more than 1,000 villagers.",
      "Scenes from the film show a bulldozer destroying a primary school, a truck pouring mud into a well, and machinery crushing a home as villagers confront the army.",
      "A girl cries, and when her mother is asked if she has any other place to go she says: \"We have no other land.\"",
      "The documentary also records intimate human moments, like when the mother, who moves into a cave, kisses her daughter and tells her: \"You're my love... Tomorrow will be a new day.\"",
      "The film explores Basel and Yuval's friendship as well. Though they are around the same age and share similar values, their inequality is ever-present.",
      "While Yuval can travel freely in Israel and the West Bank, Basel cannot travel into Israel without a permit, as part of what it says are security measures.",
      "In the film, Basel laments that although he studied law, he could only find work in construction in Israel, and when he thinks about it too hard, \"I feel this huge depression.\"",
      "The film does not shy away from the tension created by Yuval's identity, with one Palestinian asking him: \"How can we remain friends, when you come here, and it could be your brother or friend who destroyed my home?\"",
      "Yuval told the BBC he felt \"responsibility for what is happening to Basel's community\" because \"at the end of the day, the fuel in the bulldozers is my tax money\".",
      "Last year, Yuval faced a backlash for his acceptance speech for the best documentary award at the Berlin Film Festival, alongside Basel, in which he criticised a \"situation of apartheid\" and called for a ceasefire in Gaza.",
      "US filmmaker Ben Russell, who was there and wore a Palestinian keffiyeh scarf, said he stood against \"genocide\" in Gaza. Israel strongly denies the accusation of genocide.",
      "German Culture Minister Claudia Roth said the statements were \"shockingly one-sided and characterised by a deep hatred of Israel\", while Berlin Mayor Kai Wegner posted on social media that it was an \"intolerable relativisation\" and that \"antisemitism has no place in Berlin\".",
      "Israel's public broadcaster called Yuval's comments antisemitic.",
      "Yuval, who said he received death threats, told the BBC he was \"very angry\" at the label, which was \"emptying this term of meaning at a time when antisemitism is rising on the right wing and on the left wing\".",
      "He said it was \"absurd\" to hear the criticism when most of his family was killed in the Holocaust, adding that learning from this history \"should tell us to fight against dehumanisation\u2026 no matter who is the victim\".",
      "Despite winning several international awards, No Other Land is self-distributing in the US because it has not found an official distributor there \u2013 rare for a documentary which has been nominated for an Oscar.",
      "One of the film's last scenes is from 13 October 2023, when Basel recorded a settler shooting his cousin, whose hands appear empty, in the stomach. In other footage, settlers throw rocks at homes while soldiers watch.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the shooting case was transferred to the state attorney's office, which the BBC approached for comment.",
      "Currently in Masafer Yatta, Basel said settlers have \"unlimited power\" and there is a \"daily level of harassment\".",
      "He said there were three major settler attacks in January, including on a 72-year-old taken to hospital after he was hit in the head with sticks, and around 15 people arrested in the two days before 30 January while grazing their sheep or chasing away settlers' sheep. Israel Police did not reply to a BBC request for comment.",
      "The UK has sanctioned three settler outposts and four organisations it says are supporting violence against West Bank communities. Yuval called on the UK to sanction all settlers, believing that would \"truly be a deterrent\".",
      "A foreign office spokesperson told the BBC the foreign secretary \"has been clear with Israeli ministers that they must clamp down on settler violence and end settlement expansion\".",
      "\"We have regularly taken action against settler violence, including through targeted sanctions, and will continue to do all we can to ensure the rights of Palestinians are protected and that those responsible for violence are held to account,\" the statement read.",
      "Yuval said: \"I really believe there is no other way forward, other than reaching a just, fair political solution where Palestinians can be free, truly free, and our people, both of them, will have security and self-determination.",

      "Former music executive Daniel Evans says he can still remember the threat from his old boss, Sean \"Diddy\" Combs - then known as Puff Daddy - to a colleague. It was 1997, he says, in the New York office of Combs's Grammy Award-winning music label Bad Boy Records.",
      "\"It was like, this is what money does to you,\" he says.",
      "Combs was often \"prickly\", but Evans says power was transforming him. Just days before, the hip-hop mogul had received his biggest reward to date \u2013 $6m (\u00a34.8m) to mark the label's success, which boasted platinum-selling artists like The Notorious B.I.G.",
      "That year Combs's music career reached its peak, with his empire soon expanding into fashion, alcohol and even his own TV network.",
      "Nearly three decades on, his legacy is in ruins as he sits in jail awaiting trial on charges of sex trafficking and racketeering alongside battling dozens of lawsuits accusing him of drugging and assault at lavish parties, high-end hotels and in his label's recording studio. He denies all the allegations.",
      "Now the BBC has spoken to more than 20 people who worked with Combs at Bad Boy Records - including former executives, assistants and producers - who describe for the first time troubling incidents they say they witnessed during its 1990s rise.",
      "Some executives say they had concerns after seeing Combs having sex with women in the studio, including one incident where the employee says the young woman did not seem to react when he walked in. Another staff member complained Combs asked her to bring him condoms.",
      "The BBC also heard that corporate funds were used to fly in women from across the US for sex at the request of artists and other employees.",
      "\"There was a course of conduct that became more egregious over time and that conduct does go back to the 90s,\" says Tony Buzbee, a US lawyer representing dozens of alleged victims, including one who says Combs threatened to kill her in similar terms to the incident Evans says he witnessed.",
      "His client alleges Combs raped her on a bathroom floor at a promotional party held for The Notorious B.I.G., the label's biggest star, in 1995. She says in her lawsuit that afterwards, Combs told her not to tell anyone or \"you will disappear\".",
      "In a statement, Combs's legal team accused Buzbee of being \"more interested in media attention than the truth\" and said the hip-hop star \"never sexually assaulted or trafficked anyone\".",
      "The 55-year-old's lawyers said they had not been provided with sufficient details about the BBC's claims to present the facts that would \"counter these fabricated accusations\".",
      "\"As we've said before, Mr Combs cannot dignify every publicity stunt or facially absurd claim with a response. He has full confidence in the judicial process, where the truth will prevail: these accusations are pure fiction,\" they said.",
      "A brash go-getter, Sean Combs became an overnight millionaire when he launched Bad Boy Records in 1993 with a roster of top artists.",
      "It was Combs's first venture, having already built a name for himself as a talent director at another music label, Uptown Records, aged 19.",
      "\"He said that he wanted to be one of the biggest artists in the world and it didn't matter if I believed him or not,\" remembers Jimmy Maynes, a former Uptown colleague.",
      "Maynes remembers Combs having a short fuse in the office, sometimes banging \"his hands up against the desk\" like a \"bratty kid\" and yelling if he did not get his way.",
      "Combs was eventually fired from Uptown and at the age of 23 started Bad Boy Records.",
      "\"He's the hardest working man that I've ever met and always wanted people to match his energy,\" says Daniel Evans, a senior executive who managed Bad Boy's recording budgets and artists' contracts between 1994 and 1997.",
      "Combs described himself as the \"Great Gatsby\" and swiftly became known for hosting coveted celebrity bashes at New York nightclubs, on the beaches of Cancun, Mexico, and later infamous \"White Parties\" - named after the all-white dress code - in the Hamptons.",
      "Even President Donald Trump attended events in the 90s, says Evans, who once saw him sit on a golden throne at Combs's 30th birthday and exclaim: \"I'm the real King of New York!\"",
      "\"We were all really young. I was 24 years old,\" reflects Evans, who was one of the label's original employees. \"People wanted to party, have fun, hook up and build good memories.\"",
      "But looking back, Evans says he is troubled by some of the things he witnessed about his boss's behaviour and the company culture.",
      "In about 1995, he says he walked in on Combs having sex with a young woman at Daddy's House, Bad Boy's New York recording studio near Times Square.",
      "\"I was getting ready to go home for the night and looking for my jacket. Open the door and he's having sex with this girl,\" says Evans, who thought the studio was empty as it was silent. Combs swore and shouted at him to leave. \"I thought I was getting fired,\" he says.",
      "Evans remembers the young woman had been brought to the studio, presumably for a tour, by a party-promoter who was a friend of Combs. His boss seemed sober, while she was quiet and did not really talk, he says, wondering if she was high on drugs or just shy.",
      "He says it did not seem unusual at the time. But recalling how the woman did not react when he entered the room, he says: \"Knowing what I know now, there's a lot of speculation about what state she was in\u2026 usually both parties are very responsive during the act.\"",
      "Felicia Newsome, the manager of Daddy's House recording studio between 1994 and 2000, says inappropriate conduct in the music industry as a whole was rife at the time.",
      "\"It was abnormal if somebody reported it, but it wasn't abnormal for it to be happening,\" she says.",
      "Newsome says an employee once called her to the studio in the middle of the night because Combs was in his underwear, about to have sex with a model and another woman. He was demanding the staff member fetch him condoms, she recalls.",
      "\"I said to Puffy, don't ever ask anyone here to go and get condoms,\" says Newsome, who arrived while they were getting dressed again. \"He replied: 'I didn't need anything like that, ma,' and never did it again.\"",
      "Newsome, then in her 30s, says she found Combs reasonable and that he changed his behaviour when she challenged him. On one occasion, when the studio first opened in 1995, she says Combs was unhappy about the look of the countertops and called her a \"bitch\" in front of staff.",

      "She says she demanded a public apology and temporarily shut the studio, asking him: \"If I'm bringing women into this space, which is open 24 hours, how do you want to treat people?\"",
      "Combs responded that he wanted it to be an inclusive and safe environment, she says.",
      "But while Newsome ran the studio with an \"iron fist\", she says other staff were less comfortable calling Combs out.",
      "\"Bad Boy Records was a crazy house with a lot of young people who wanted to touch the King's robes,\" she says.",
      "Former staff say the label was run by twenty-something executives and a large number of interns, some of whom were of school age. There were often sexual relationships between employees and the interns, they say.",
      "Evans remembers an uncomfortable moment with a 14-year-old in his own team, who he says propositioned him.",
      "\"She says to me, you work really hard. If you ever want to like, get loose, you and I should kick it\u2026 but not tonight, I have a curfew.\"",
      "Evans says he sent her home and called the next day, telling her not to return to work. He did not report her, but two weeks later she was back working in the mailroom.",
      "Artists and other employees at Combs's record label would sometimes also request for women to be flown in to have sex at the studio, the former executive says.",
      "\"If they had a [sexual] specialty in something, they would be flown in,\" says Evans, who told the BBC he knew because he controlled the budgets. Money for the flights would be set aside and logged under travel, he adds.",
      "\"It was probably like thousands of dollars,\" says Evans. \"I don't think it happened all that often, but it was definitely a recording expense.\"",
      "Evans says Combs's own requests were managed by his personal assistants. One told the BBC that Combs would often ask them to fly in women he was \"messing around with\" and put them up in hotels, though the assistant said they were not sex workers.",
      "In the 2000s, the Daddy's House recording studio further changed, two former staff say, into a culture of \"sex, drugs and rock'n'roll\". Combs would regularly bring \"random women\" there to party, turning up with an entourage of dozens of people in \"three white jeeps, with white rims and white leather seats\", they say. Other artists would demand suitcases of Ciroc vodka and one even brought a monkey to a session, according to a former executive.",
      "The studio is one of the locations where women have since accused Combs of drugging and raping them. Model Crystal McKinney alleges the mogul plied her with alcohol and marijuana before sexually assaulting her there in 2003. That same year, a woman alleges that Combs and two associates gang raped her at the studio when she was 17.",
      "Combs's lawyers say he \"looks forward to proving his innocence\", adding that McKinney's claims are \"without merit\".",
      "Many ex-staff say they still find it hard to reconcile the allegations with the man they knew. \"These accusations are a surprise to me, as I am sure it is to many of our circle,\" says Jeffery Walker, a close friend of Combs who was part of Bad Boy's original production team. \"I've been to White Parties and of course studio sessions, and none of what he is accused of went down in my sight.\"",
      "Evans was also sceptical about some of the claims until he saw the footage of Casandra Ventura, Combs's ex-partner of 10 years and a former Bad Boy artist, being brutally beaten by the rapper in a hotel in Los Angeles in 2016.",
      "Ventura was the first person to sue Combs back in November 2023, alleging that he had trapped her in a cycle of abuse, violence, and sex trafficking during their relationship. Combs settled the lawsuit the next day for an undisclosed amount.",
      "\"It's not the first time I've seen that temper,\" recalls Evans, thinking back to the death threat he says he witnessed back in 1997. \"It's hard to see. The guy in the video with Cassie is almost identical to the guy who threatened the employee. So, you wonder, has anything changed?\"",
      "Over the years, Sean Combs has repeatedly reinvented himself - from Puff Daddy, to P Diddy and in recent years, \"Love\".",
      "\"If I'm acting crazy, like 'ahhh!' that's Diddy. If I'm dancing real smooth with a girl, that's Puff Daddy. And if I'm looking like I'm nervous or scared or shy, that's Sean,\" he said in an interview in 2015.",
      "With more details likely to emerge when he goes on trial in May, many of those who were close to the rapper are questioning whether they knew the real Sean Combs at all.",
      "\"One could think that he's just a disgusting human being, but that's not my memory of Puff,\" says Jimmy Maynes, who grew up with Combs in Mount Vernon, New York.",
      "But after a pause, he adds: \"Or maybe money just gives people the freedom to be exactly who they really are, and he was that guy all along.\"",

      "\"I'm alive thanks to USAID,\" says Dmytro Sherembey.",
      "He's been living with HIV for 24 years in Ukraine, and says the agency, which distributes billions of dollars of aid around the world, has helped prevent the virus from spreading there.",
      "\"Every second HIV-positive person in Ukraine was identified thanks to this programme,\" Mr Sherembey adds.",
      "But the future of USAID (the United States Agency for International Development) is now very uncertain.",
      "One of US President Donald Trump's first actions after returning to office was signing an executive order pausing almost all foreign assistance for 90 days while a review could be carried out. He has said USAID is run by \"radical left lunatics\" and is getting away with \"tremendous fraud\" - without giving evidence.",
      "Mr Sherembey, who heads 100% Life, the largest patient-led organisation in Ukraine, recalls that when Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, warehouses storing HIV medication were bombed.",
      "It was USAID assistance that made it possible to quickly procure replacement medication and distribute it across the country, he explains.",
      "\"USAID's slogan is that this is assistance from the American people. But it turns out that this aid could be stopped by the decision of one person,\" he says.",
      "USAID was established in 1961 by President John F Kennedy. It has around 10,000 employees and a budget of nearly $40bn (\u00a332.25bn), out of a total of $68bn in US government foreign aid spending.",
      "It has bases in more than 60 countries, and works in dozens of others. However, most of the work on the ground is carried out by other organisations that it contracts and funds.",
      "The range of activities it undertakes is vast. Its work includes providing food in countries where people are starving, to operating the world's gold-standard famine detection system, which uses data analysis to try to predict where food shortages are emerging.",

      "Elon Musk - the world's richest man, who has been tasked by Trump with shrinking the US federal government - has called the agency \"a criminal organisation\", without providing evidence, and has said it is \"time for it to die\".",
      "But in countries such as Afghanistan, the end of USAID could cause huge problems. The agency is one of the biggest donors to the country's health sector, funding projects that provide life-saving services to mothers and children.",
      "A doctor responsible for USAID-funded projects there says more than 60 of his team, including midwives, nurses and doctors, were told to stay at home after funding was paused.",
      "\"The future appears bleak and the impact on patients is massive,\" he says.",
      "\"If the funding halt continues, mothers will be forced to give birth at home as the facilities are closed and it will increase mortality rates,\" one midwife says.",
      "USAID's work also branches out into areas like cybersecurity. One Iranian activist, focusing on anti-censorship, says their organisation operates with USAID funding.",
      "\"If an opposition figure, a university student, or a women's rights activist is arrested in Iran, it is NGOs like the one I work for that immediately act so the person's email and social media accounts are locked and removed,\" says the activist, who requested anonymity due to fear of reprisals.",
      "This has meant that if Iranian intelligence agents force detainees to reveal their passwords, they cannot access that person's communications, the activist says.",
      "\"If an internet company works with the regime to restrict Iranians' access to the internet, we expose them publicly and get them\u2026 sanctioned by the EU and the US,\" the activist adds.",
      "\"All of this work is now about to be stopped because of the funding freeze.\"",
      "Among its other activities, USAID also grants scholarships - with 1,077 undergraduate students in Egypt alone receiving money. Trump's pause on international spending and his comments on USAID have thrown the futures of these students into doubt.",
      "\"I feel like I don't know my fate. I was once a top student with a bright future, but now my future looks dark, and I fear heading in the wrong direction,\" said Mohamed Ashraf, one of the affected students.",
      "Trump is a long-term critic of overseas spending, and has said it does not represent value for money for American taxpayers - singling out USAID, which he has described as wasteful. But whether he can actually shut down the agency is not yet clear.",
      "Closing USAID altogether, as Musk wants, would likely require an act of Congress - in which Trump's Republican Party holds slim majorities in both chambers.",

Secretary of State Marco Rubio says he is now the acting head of the agency - which says thousands of its staff around the world will be put on leave at the end of the week.",

    "story": [
      "After days of speculation over the precise role the world's richest man would play in Donald Trump's White House - how much power he would hold, whether he is a government employee at all - he took to the social media platform he owns to clarify.",
      "\"My preferred title is just 'Tech Support,'\" Elon Musk wrote on X on Tuesday. It was a knowing understatement.",
      "As the head of the nascent Department of Government Efficiency (Doge), Musk has emerged as a dominant force in the dizzying start to Trump's second administration.",
      "In just two weeks he has led efforts to seize access to the federal payment system, dismantled an entire agency and offered millions of civil servants an ultimatum - quit or face being fired.",
      "But Musk's increasingly bold attempt to remake the federal government with the same blunt force he used to take control of companies like Twitter have put him on a collision course with the Washington establishment.",
      "And while he has secured a place in Trump's inner circle, observers wonder if a showdown between these two powerful personalities could be looming.",
      "Musk's journey from billionaire entrepreneur to White House power player was not straightforward. By his own accounting, Musk had - for decades - been a reliable vote for the Democrats.",
      "But unhappy with Biden's position on issues from labour laws to transgender rights, Musk began to look to the other side of the aisle in the run-up to the 2024 presidential election.",
      "Initially, Musk called for Trump to \"hang up his hat & sail into the sunset\" and had backed his rival, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, for the Republican nomination. But he soon became the president's biggest booster, contributing $288m to Trump and other Republican candidates and becoming a key adviser on the campaign.",
      "By the time of Trump's inauguration, Musk was his right-hand man, seated just behind the president's left shoulder on the dais - an unmistakable symbol of his influence.",
      "\"You know I always say we have to be protective of our geniuses because we don't have too many. But that one is a good one,\" Trump said of Musk, after welcoming him on stage at a rally the day before.",
      "Musk has been a near constant presence in the nation's capital ever since.",
      "Almost immediately after his election Trump tapped Musk to run Doge, and this new role has seemingly empowered him in a far-reaching mission to slash and transform the federal government, pushing for massive reforms with stunning speed.",
      "Although Trump had said Musk would not be given an office in the West Wing, the tech leader and his team have moved beds into the federal personnel office next door to the White House, according to the New York Times.",
      "He has top secret security clearance, a Trump administration official confirmed, potentially giving him access to a broad swathe of highly classified information.",
      "His tactics - relentless, sometimes ruthless - are reminiscent of how he ran his previous companies, former employees say.",
      "A former programme manager at Tesla, who spoke to the BBC on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters, said Musk \"did not care\" about the human cost of his decisions.",
      "\"He's only concerned with the objective at hand. I think he views interpersonal issues and conflicts as ancillary things that are not worth his time,\" he said.",
      "Occasionally, Musk tended toward the impulsive. The manager recalled seeing Musk fire a fellow Tesla employee on the spot over an overflowing rubbish can.",
      "\"He interpreted that as a sign that this person didn't take as much pride in his work as he should,\" he said. \"That was the nuance to it\u2026 but at the end of the day someone got fired because they admitted that their trash can was overflowing.\"",
      "The approach yielded a committed workforce, the employee said. If you were on board with Musk's mission, that single-minded focus was motivating, he said, and helped fuel regular 13 plus-hour days on the job.",
      "\"He can get more out of people than anyone else I have ever seen,\" he recalled, although he added that the intensity at Tesla was par for the course in Silicon Valley.",
      "But for those in the federal government, the employee added, \"it's gotta be a culture shock.\"",
      "Nowhere has Musk's purported work on behalf of Trump been felt as intensely as USAID.",
      "The government agency responsible for international development went from dispensing billions in aid to programmes around the world to an effective dead stop in just over two weeks.",
      "Trump already curtailed USAID's work significantly when he ordered a 90-day pause in US foreign spending, while the administration reviewed the funds in order to make sure they were in line with the president's policy goals.",
      "But in recent days, employees have watched with increasing alarm as Musk set his sights directly on USAID, labelling their agency a \"criminal organisation\" on X.",
      "Musk's increasingly harsh rhetoric has coincided with equally drastic changes at USAID.",
      "On 1 February, the USAID website stopped working; its X account appeared to vanish not long after. That same weekend,  two top security officials were placed on administrative leave after a confrontation with Doge representatives over access to a secure facility used for reviewing classified information, the Washington Post and other US outlets reported.",
      "On Monday, USAID employees were told to stay at home while hundreds of employees were locked out of their email. CBS, the BBC's US news partner, reports USAID employees are being pulled out of their respective countries worldwide by Friday.",
      "\"It's beyond repair,\" Musk said of the agency during his 50-minute conversation on X Spaces early Monday morning.",
      "\"I went over it with him in detail, and he agreed that we should shut it down,\" Musk said of his conversation with Trump. \"And I actually checked with him a few times [and] said 'are you sure?'\"",
      "\"The comments from Elon Musk have been particularly cutting, calling us a 'criminal organisation' that needs to 'die,''\" said a USAID staffer, who asked not to be named because they feared retaliation from Musk and the administration.",
      "\"Coming from the wealthiest man on the planet, that feels pretty grotesque,\" said the staffer, who has since been put on administrative leave along with many other colleagues.",
      "\"I see foreign service officers that have spent their entire lives serving - a large part of it overseas - and the sacrifices they made,\" they said. \"To be dragged through the mud like this is disrespectful.\"",
      "The upheaval at USAID has raised concerns from Democrats and experts about whether Trump and Musk's actions are legal.",
      "On its face, efforts by Trump and Musk to shut down USAID are \"not legal because it runs afoul of what Congress has explicitly done previously,\" said Jon Rogowski, a political science professor at the University of Chicago who studies the separation of powers in the US government.",
      "Congress has established USAID as an independent agency, and the legislative branch appropriates funding.",
      "As head of the federal agencies, however, Trump does have broad authority to bring certain USAID functions under the state department's control, according to George Ingram, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former USAID deputy assistant administrator.",
      "One such move included appointing Secretary of State Marco Rubio as the acting head of USAID, when in the past the agency had functioned independently of the state department, while following its guidance on foreign policy.",
      "And influential Republicans in Congress appear ready to work with the administration to allow some degree of change.",
      "\"I'm supportive of the Trump administration's efforts to reform and restructure the agency in a way that better serves US national security interests,\" said Senator James Risch, chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.",
      "Though Musk does not have the authority to shut down or restructure USAID, the agency likely could not have been dismantled as swiftly and thoroughly without his influence.",
      "\"I cannot think of any precedent where a presidential administration has essentially handed over the reins to a private citizen, to remake and take control of the executive branch as they see fit,\" Mr Rogowski said.",
      "In a statement to the BBC, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Musk \"is selflessly serving President Trump's Administration as a special government employee, and he has abided by all applicable federal laws\".",
      "Prior to Trump's inauguration, some of Musk's peers expressed optimism at the prospect of an injection of start-up culture in Washington.",
      "\"I think we've just had a very exciting moment,\" Marc Benioff, the billionaire founder and CEO of Salesforce who has been vocal in his support of Trump, told the BBC in December. \"It's a new chapter for America.\"",

      "But two weeks into the Trump administration, some observers say not everyone in Silicon Valley is enthusiastic.",
      "Niki Christoff, a former Salesforce executive who now runs a communication firm in DC, told the BBC that many \"people in the [tech] industry seem dumbstruck by the events of the past two weeks\".",
      "\"Most CEOs of publicly traded multinational tech companies want predictability. They want stability. They want a strong dollar,\" she added. \"They want predictable supply chains, and a lot of the policies and the headlines coming out of Washington are creating anxiety and uncertainty.\"",
      "Dr Philip Low, a neuroscientist and CEO of neurotechnology company Neurovigil, said Musk's playbook could wreak havoc on governmental institutions. The two were close for nearly 15 years before their relationship soured, he said.",
      "\"His pattern is to take companies, invest in them, destabilise them, and then take them over,\" said Dr Low, citing Twitter as an example.",

      "The view is spectacular from the top of Ponte Tower, one of the most famous buildings in the South African city of Johannesburg.",
      "Built in 1975, standing almost 200m (656 ft) tall, it's a long-established feature of the city skyline, once the tallest residential building in Africa.",
      "But like the city, it's had its ups and downs. In the 1980s it was taken over by criminal gangs, and its hollow core filled with rubbish up to 50m deep.",
      "\"The building got hijacked. There were no utilities, so most of the people were actually throwing their trash right inside the building, until it reached the 14th floor,\" said Delight Sithole, who runs tours of the building.",
      "He added: \"There were some dead bodies here, illegal firearms, drugs. The smell, I'm sure it was just horrible, just really like, hell on earth.",
      "\"If you asked anybody what happens in that round building, somebody would have something interesting or scary to say about it,\" said Sifiso Zikhali, who works with Mr Sithole in an organisation called Dlala Nje, which means \"just play\" in Zulu.",
      "\"People were scared of the neighbourhood,\" he said.",
      "Johannesburg was seen as being one of the most dangerous cities in the world.",
      "But the building turned itself around 15 years ago in the wake of the Fifa World Cup hosted in South Africa, and people started moving back in.",
      "After Covid, people returned and the building is now around three-quarters full.",
      "There is no escaping the issues that Johannesburg, and South Africa, face.",
      "Despite signs of improvement in the most recent statistics, crime is still a major issue.",
      "Crippling power cuts that plagued the city for years, known as load-shedding, came to an end almost a year ago, but now a water crisis is looming, leaving many without.",
      "A building fire in the Central Business District (CBD) killed almost 80 people in the winter of 2023, and exposed the issue of hijacked buildings, disused housing and apartments blocks that have been taken over by criminal gangs who charge people to live there.",

      "Living in a 'hijacked' building",
      "This is an area that's been regenerated by a property company called Ithemba, which is Zulu for \"hope\". And it's a company that is seeing business booming in Johannesburg.",
      "A few days later, on a tour of one of Ithemba's flagship residential developments called Jewel City, senior manager Alan Tait explains the turnaround.",
      "\"The demand is just phenomenal, and that demand is specifically to live in the CBD,\" he said.",
      "He said that the company currently leases 7,200 properties and is expected to double that over the next two years.",
      "Named after its origins as a diamond dealing district, like the Ponte building the area fell into disrepair, only to see a resurgence.",
      "\"We launched Jewel City about five years ago, just as Covid was hitting. So the timing was a little bit out. But as soon as Covid lifted, the buildings filled up quite quickly,\" he said.",
      "As we near the edge of the development, he points out a long strip of lights under a flyover. They were put up to provide light in an area that had been dark for some time, largely due to the loadshedding affected the city.",
      "It was part of an initiative by a group called JoziMyJozi which started in 2023. One of its first projects was to light up the Nelson Mandela bridge, a centrepiece of the city, that meant people once again found it safe to use.",
      "\"So the whole aim of JoziMyJozi is to bring hope back to the residents of the city,\" said Bea Swanepoel, CEO of the organisation, in the courtyard behind her office in Rosebank, north of the city centre.",
      "\"And by bringing hope back, we need to show some visible improvements and impactful projects so that they can see there's a way out of where we are currently, and to live in the city of the future, where people can be safe and where they can thrive and where there are jobs.\"",
      "The group also launched the gateway project, an effort to clean up the ten main entrances to the city, and they've begun to tackle everything from potholes, to homelessness to education.",
      "Could Johannesburg one day be spoken about like London, Paris or New York?",
      "\"Well, that is the intention,\" said Ms Swanepoel. \"Much of what's happening in Joburg is due to perceptions. We have a long way to go. I mean, there's no doubt about that, but it's not impossible. We need to get up there and be the gold standard for cities in Africa.\"",
      "The city is due to host the G20 later this year, which will bring new investment and attention to the city.",
      "Back on 51st floor of the Ponte tower, Sifiso Zikhali gazes out of the window.",
      "Does he think Dlala Nje is succeeding in its mission?",
      "\"Yes we are, because one of our biggest challenges was to get people coming here. We are now one of the city's top attractions.  This is our city, and whatever we face, we need at the end to find a solution for it,\" he said.",

    "published": "Wed, 05 Feb 2025 05:41:10 GMT",
    "summary": "The document charred by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius is being 'unwrapped' using X-ray scans and AI.",
    "story": [
      "A badly burnt scroll from the Roman town of Herculaneum has been digitally \"unwrapped\", providing the first look inside for 2,000 years.",
      "The document, which looks like a lump of charcoal, was charred by the volcanic eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79AD and is too fragile to ever be physically opened.",
      "But now scientists have used a combination of X-ray imaging and artificial intelligence to virtually unfurl it, revealing rows and columns of text.",
      "More work is needed to make the scroll fully legible to decipher its contents, but the team behind the project say the results are very promising.",
      "\"We're confident we will be able to read pretty much the whole scroll in its entirety, and it's the first time we've really been able to say that with high confidence,\" said Stephen Parsons, project lead for the Vesuvius Challenge, an international competition attempting to unlock the Herculaneum scrolls.",
      "Some letters are already clearly visible in the ancient text and the team believes it's a work of philosophy.",
      "Hundreds of carbonised scrolls were discovered in Herculaneum, which like its neighbour Pompeii was buried beneath metres of volcanic ash.",
      "In the past, some of the documents, which are made from a thick paper-like material called papyrus, were prised open but they crumbled into pieces.",
      "The University of Oxford's Bodleian Library holds several of the scrolls. Thought to be unreadable, they had been left untouched for decades.",
      "\"We've never been convinced before that any of the techniques would be safe enough or effective enough to get any information from the scrolls,\" explained Nicole Gilroy, head of book conservation.",
      "But the promise of a hi-tech solution prompted the team to get one of the precious scrolls out of storage.",
      "It was placed in a specially made case and taken to Diamond Light Source in Oxfordshire.",
      "Inside this huge machine, which is called a synchrotron, electrons are accelerated to almost the speed of light to produce a powerful X-ray beam that can probe the scroll without damaging it.",
      "\"It can see things on the scale of a few thousandths of a millimetre,\" explained Adrian Mancuso, director of physical sciences at Diamond.",
      "The scan is used to create a 3D reconstruction, then the layers inside the scroll - it contains about 10m of papyrus - have to be identified.",
      "\"We have to work out which layer is different from the next layer so we can unroll that digitally,\" said Dr Mancuso.",
      "After that artificial intelligence is used to detect the ink. It's easier said than done - both the papyrus and ink are made from carbon and they're almost indistinguishable from each other.",
      "So the AI hunts for the tiniest signals that ink might be there, then this ink is painted on digitally, bringing the letters to light.",
      "\"We can tell the entire scroll is full of text,\" said Stephen Parsons.",
      "\"Now we can work on making it show up more clearly. We're going to go from a handful of words to really substantial passages.\"",
      "Last year, a Vesuvius Challenge team managed to read about 5% of another Herculaneum scroll.",
      "Its subject was Greek Epicurean philosophy, which teaches that fulfilment can be found through the pleasure of everyday things.",
      "The Bodleian's scroll is likely to be on the same subject - but the Vesuvius team is calling for more human and computing ingenuity to see if this is the case.",
      "For Nicole Gilroy, the work is providing a link to the past.",
      "\"I just love that connection with whoever collected them, whoever wrote them, whoever rolled those scrolls up and put them on the shelves. There's a real human aspect to it that I just think is really precious,\" she said.",

      "The group imposed its extreme ideology on the city, targeting minorities and killing opponents.",
      "Three years later, a US-backed coalition in alliance with the Iraqi army and state-linked militias mounted an intense ground and air offensive to wrest the city back from IS control. The bloodiest battles focused on the Old City, where the group's fighters made a last stand.",

      "The huge task of rebuilding began under the auspices of Unesco with a budget of $115m (\u00a393m) that the agency had managed to drum up, much of it from the United Arab Emirates and the European Union.",
      "Father Olivier Poquillon - a Dominican priest - returned to Mosul to help oversee the restoration of one of the key buildings, the convent of Notre-Dame de l'Heure, known locally as al-Saa'a, which was founded nearly 200 years ago.",
      "\"We started by trying first to gather the team - a team composed of people from Old Mosul from different denominations - Christians, Muslims working all together,\" he says.",
      "Father Poquillon says that bringing the communities together was the biggest challenge and the biggest achievement.",
      "\"If you want to rebuild the buildings you've got first to rebuild trust - if you don't rebuild trust, it's useless to reconstruct the walls of those buildings because they will become a target for other communities.\"",
      "In charge of the entire project - which included the restoration of 124 old houses and two especially fine mansions - has been the chief architect Maria Rita Acetoso, who came to Mosul straight from restoration work for Unesco in Afghanistan.",
      "\"This project demonstrates that culture too can create jobs, can encourage skills development and in addition can make those involved feel part of something meaningful,\" she says.",

    "published": "Wed, 05 Feb 2025 00:00:20 GMT",
    "summary": "The African nation exports its cashews in raw form, but processing them would be more lucrative.",
    "story": [
      "The Accra street vendor looks at me, bemused.",
      "I'm trying to establish how the rather flimsy 30g bag of roasted cashew nuts she's selling, beside a sweltering highway in Ghana's capital, costs me the equivalent of about 75 cents (60p).",
      "That's obviously not a lot of money for me, a visitor from the UK, but I'm amazed at the mark up.",
      "The price is at least 4,000% higher than the cost of buying the same weight of raw, unshelled cashews from a Ghanian farmer.",
      "\"It's incredible,\" I protest. Yet she doesn't understand my English, or my reasoning.",
      "The price of the nuts was, after all, printed on the packet. And explaining why I thought it was beyond the pale was never going to be easy.",
      "Cashing in on Ghana's cashews",
      "Ghana is the world's third-biggest exporter of unprocessed cashew nuts, behind Ivory Coast in first place, and Cambodia in second.",
      "To produce the crop, around 300,000 Ghanaians make at least part of their living growing cashews.",
      "Nashiru Seydou, whose family have a farm in the country's north-east, some 500 miles (800km) from Accra, is one of them.",
      "He says the work is hard, and unreliable supply chains and volatile wholesale prices make survival difficult.",
      "\"We are struggling. We can use the sunlight, the fertile land, to create more jobs,\" he says. \"I'd be happy if the government comes to our aid and helps support our industry.\"",
      "He tells me that he currently gets around $50 for a large 100kg sack of unshelled cashews.",
      "\"It's amazing,\" says Bright Simons, an entrepreneur and economic commentator in Accra, who has studied the numbers. \"Roasters and retailers buy the nuts from farmers for $500 a tonne, and sell to customers [both at home and abroad] for amounts between $20,000 and $40,000 a tonne.\"",
      "As a whole, Ghana grows about 180,000 tonnes of cashews annually. More than 80% is exported, and in raw, unshelled form. This generates some $300m in export revenues, but means that Ghana misses out on the significantly higher returns you get from roasted, ready-to-eat cashews.",
      "Mildred Akotia is one person trying to increase the amount of cashews that are shelled and roasted in Ghana. She is the founder and CEO of Akwaaba Fine Foods, which currently processes just 25 tonnes a year.",
      "Ms Akotia denies any suggestion that she and others like her are price-gouging. The packaging and roasting machinery a western business would automatically use in this industry, she says, is out of reach for her because of the high cost of credit in Ghana.",
      "\"If you go to a local bank, it will cost you 30% interest to get a loan,\" she complains. \"As a manufacturer you tell me how large your margins are that you can afford that kind of interest? We've had to rely on what we can get: soft loans from relatives and grants from donor agencies.\"",
      "She says that this situation is why less than 20% of Ghana's cashews are processed locally. The bulk are scooped up and exported to big factories in countries like India, Thailand and Vietnam.",
      "Remarkably, some of those packaged nuts are then exported back to Ghana, where they are sold for the same price as domestically roasted cashews. This is despite the 20,000-mile sea freight round trip, and import costs.",
      "It is a similar picture for rice, which is exported to Ghana from Asia and sold at low prices, despite Ghana also growing the crop itself.",
      "Back in 2016 the Ghanaian government experimented with an export ban on raw cashews in order to encourage homegrown processing. However the policy had to be abandoned within a couple of weeks after uproar from farmers and traders.",
      "Without available cheap loans, it wasn't possible for sufficient new Ghanaian roasters to enter the market. So the price of raw nuts crashed, and many started rotting for want of a buyer.",
      "More recently there has been talk of increased tariffs on raw cashew exports and bans on exporters purchasing cashews directly from farms.",
      "But all these policy interventions miss a key point, according to Mr Simons. A big challenge for local producers, he says, is to work harder on the basics of doing business, and growing their companies.",
      "\"In order to be efficient at this, you need scale,\" he says, adding that firms need to promote eating cashews to make it more widespread in the country. \"You need a lot of a Ghanaians consuming the nuts, not just a small middle class\".",
      "Prof Daron Acemoglu, a Turkish-American economist, agrees that building a strong local market is important for Ghana's cashew industry. He was one of last year's winners of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, for his work on the struggles facing low-income economies, and in particular their home-grown businesses.",
      "Yet he says that the first priority should be improving access to international markets for processed Ghanaian cashews.",
      "\"These firms are dealing with workforces that aren't properly skilled, they have infrastructures that aren't working, they are constantly in fear of corrupt officials, or rule changes, and also it's very difficult to reach foreign markets, he says. \"They need the foreign market because the domestic market is small, and their own government has very little capacity [to boost it].\"",
      "He also wants to see the Ghanaian government improve the network of roads and railways to ease the cost of transportation.",
      "But Mr Simons reckons the onus should now be on Ghanaian businesses themselves, to do the basics to enhance the branding and marketing of cashews. As it is, he says, many of the country's most enterprising business people are just leaving Ghana for better paid opportunities abroad because of the red tape and cronyism in Ghana are so prohibitive.",
      "\"There's a massive brain drain,\" he says. \"My theory of why Africa's economic development has been slow is because we focus too much on the supply side, but the real beauty is in demand, creating a consuming class of cashew-eating enthusiasts, and you don't have an entrepreneurial class that can create demand transformation.\"",
      "He says the same argument applies to Ghana's other bigger exports, like gold and chocolate, neither of which gets much value-addition within Ghana before getting exported to the West.",
      "Mildred Akotia hopes she might be one of those entrepreneurs to buck the trend. She now wants to build her own logistics arm, to be able to process the cashews direct from the farm gate.",
      "\"I have a lot of calls from the UAE, from Canada and America. Currently we can't meet demand. We can't get enough kernels to roast.",
      "\"There's a ready market both locally and internationally. My branding is good, my marketing is good. My dream is to give a facelift to Ghanaian processed foods.\"",

You changed my life and I will always love you RIP.\"",

So I think that his legacy is really and truly a man who had really pushed very hard from humble beginnings in Hollis, Queens to the highest, highest echelons in music,\" Creekmur said.",
      "Gotti remains an inspiration to generations of hip-hop artists, including Amadeus, a multi-platinum producer and musician.",
      "\"When you make and create timeless music and music that's from your heart and soul, that's not gimmicky, that's not something trendy. It lasts forever,\" Amadeus said.",
      "Gotti and his brother, Christopher, stood trial in the early 2000s over their ties to a known drug kingpin, but they were both cleared of the charges. The case was closely watched by some of the music industry's biggest stars, and Ja Rule called it a \"war against hip-hop.\"",

      "Yusef didn't win this time. It also was not Yusef's first time at the Grammys \u2014 far from it, with eight Grammy wins and 44 nominations.",
      "But it was still an absolute thrill for the South Side kid, whose first passion of poetry led him to the art of the spoken word.",
      "\"I'm living a dream way beyond my own dream,\" Yusef said.",
      "CBS News Chicago caught up with Yusef before the awards ceremony Sunday night. Inside Agriculture Custom Clothier at 67 W.

      "He explained the tradition of spoken word.",
      "\"Spoken word is ancient. It's Griotism. It's how people pass down information throughout generations \u2014 and they made it catchy,\" Yusef said. \"It's music without singing \u2014 a form of rhythmic poetry made for the ear, not so much the eye.\"",
      "Yusef got his big break after performing during a poetry open mic night at Chicago's iconic Green Mill Lounge, 4802 N. Broadway, over 30 years ago. He caught the attention of other artists and the media there.",
      "\"It literally catapulted everything,\" Yusef said.",
      "Now, Yusef counts the biggest names of the era as collaborators \u2014 Drake, Chance the Rapper, Jay-Z, John Legend, The Weeknd, Common, Fall Out Boy, Jennifer Hudson, and Adam Levine. He even cowrote \"Sandcastles\" for Beyonc\u00e9.",

      "She was the archetypal Sixties rock chick; a pop star at 17; Mick Jagger's muse at 19; and by 24, a junkie on the streets. But Marianne Faithfull (Dec. 29, 1946-Jan. 30, 2025), who burst out of the '60s British Invasion with the hit \"As Tears Go By,\" launched a second act in the late 1970s. Her lithe voice, later weathered from surviving sex, drugs, and rock 'n' roll, was brought forth in such albums as \"Broken English,\" \"Dangerous Acquaintances,\" and \"Easy Come, Easy Go.\"",
      "The daughter of an eccentric British professor and an Austrian baroness, Faithfull was just out of convent school, and was performing as a folk singer, when she was discovered at a party by the manager of the Rolling Stones. Jagger and Keith Richards wrote her breakthrough hit, \"As Tears Go By.\"",
      "Just as her career exploded, at 18, she married a London art dealer and had a baby. \"I was very overenthusiastically eager for life,\" she told \"Sunday Morning\" in 2009. \"I wanted to just bite into it and swallow it whole.\"",
      "She then left her marriage for Jagger. They became one of Swinging London's most photographed couples. Then, in February 1967, British police barged into a Rolling Stones party at Richards' home. The police found drugs, and Marianne naked in a fur rug. Though charges were later dropped, Faithfull's image was disgraced. She felt she'd let her parents down: \"I think that's the worst feeling in the world,\" she told Anthony Mason.",
      "She played up the \"bad girl\" image by acting in the film \"Girl on a Motorcycle.\" But she miscarried Jagger's child after eight months, and while on a trip to Australia with Jagger, she swallowed 150 sleeping pills. She spent six days in a coma. Faithfull recovered, but her relationship with Jagger did not.",
      "She fell into heroin addiction. She said, \"It's certainly not what I was dreaming of when I was eight or ten \u2013 I'm going to grow up and become a junkie and live on the street!\" she said. She would lose custody of her son, Nicholas, and the damage began to show in her singing voice. But in 1979, she pulled herself together to release a raw and daring comeback album, \"Broken English.\" \"I became myself,\" she said, \"and it was not a person people thought I was. It was more intelligent, stronger, ravaged in its own way, but very quite interesting.\"",
      "It would be several more years before she freed herself of addiction, and in 2008 recorded \"Easy Come, Easy Go,\" with Sean Lennon, Rufus Wainwright, Nick Cave, Cat Power, and Keith Richards. She also returned to acting, in \"Paris, Je T'aime,\" \"Marie Antoinette,\" and \"Faces in the Crowd.\"",
      "Faithfull said she appreciated the long, hard road she'd traveled: \"I think I've been very unconscious for a long time, and only now have I begun to get it. As long as I got it before I croaked, I think that's the main thing.\""

    "title": "Jesse Eisenberg on the bitter and sweet of \"A Real Pain\"",
    "published": "Sun, 02 Feb 2025 10:48:22 -0500",
    "summary": "The actor-writer-director's latest film, a poignant comic-drama costarring Kieran Culkin, earned him an Academy Award nomination for best original screenplay. But Jesse Eisenberg finds it difficult to not feel miserable.",
    "story": [
      "We'll tell you up front: Actor-director Jesse Eisenberg, who says he can appreciate a good Jewish deli, is a different kind of movie star. We joined him last week at the legendary Canter's Deli in Los Angeles, and shared some chocolate babka, with a dill pickle chaser. \"This is the real test,\" Eisenberg said.",
      "It was a little unusual, but for Eisenberg, it'd already been a pretty unusual day. Just a few hours earlier, he received his second Oscar nomination, this time for best original screenplay.",
      "And he was mortified.",
      "I asked, \"Are you able to enjoy moments like this?\"",
      "\"No, I'm not really wired to enjoy praise,\" he replied. \"I don't know why. I think it just, like, I don't know, triggers some guilt response in my brain and I try to find something to be miserable about. But I'll tell you what I do love: I love actually doing my job. Like, I feel so lucky that I found something I like to do.\"",
      "At the moment, his job is to promote the film he wrote, directed and starred in, \"A Real Pain,\" co-starring Kieran Culkin. The film is about two cousins who travel to Poland to see their ancestral home, and visit the actual home of their late grandmother, who barely survived the Holocaust.",
      "The film started out as a buddy movie about a trip to Mongolia. As he was writing the script, Eisenberg got stuck, until inspiration literally popped up on his computer. \"I was, like, 30 pages into the script and something was missing,\" he said. \"I knew the script was not going well. And so, I'm, like, kind of, like, banging my head against the keyboard. And an ad pops up online for 'Auschwitz tours.' And then in parentheses, 'with lunch.' And I was like, 'Auschwitz tours (with lunch)?' That's, like, the strangest pairing of four words I've ever seen. And once I saw that, and once I read that brochure, I was like, 'Oh, that's the movie. That is so interesting,' because I was trying to deal with these two characters who are both kind of, like, in pain in their own ways.\"",
      "\"Dude, we are Jews on a train in Poland, ******* think about it. \u2026 Does no one else see the irony here? Like, eating fancy food and sitting up here, when 80 years ago we would've been herded into the backs of these ******* things like cattle?\"",
      "Watch a scene with Jesse Eisenberg and Kieran Culkin in \"A Real Pain\" [Warning: Graphic language]",
      "Eisenberg has had those same thoughts. He is himself of Polish lineage, and he has relatives who were victims of the Holocaust. \"I come from a family who survived the war; a lot of, you know, cousins, aunts, and uncles who didn't,\" he said. \"And yet, I walk around New York City, like, kind of miserable. Like, I'm not, like, a happy person. I'm not asking for pity or anything; I'm just recognizing objectively, like, I'm not a happy person. And yet, I come from people who survived through miracles. Intellectually, I think I should be waking up every morning kissing the dirt that I'm here by virtue of a thousand miracles. And instead, I walk around, I'm like, Oh my God. What am I gonna do today? Oh my God. I shouldn't drink a coffee 'cause then I'll peak at noon.",
      "\"And so, I'm constantly trying to reconcile my fortunate life with how I feel about things, and my forebears' very unfortunate lives and how they appreciated things. And that's what this movie is kind of focusing on.\"",
      "It seems he's been feeling that same kind of anxiety all of his life. Raised in New Jersey, Jesse Eisenberg was, by his own admission, a \"sad kid\" who was uncomfortable at school, and took refuge in acting. By 2010 he'd made a name for himself in Hollywood, with roles like Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg in \"The Social Network.\" The part earned him an Oscar nod, and the juice to branch out into writing and directing.",
      "But when COVID shut down the film industry in 2020, Eisenberg and his wife, Anna Strout, moved back to her native Indiana, and spent their days volunteering at her mom's domestic violence shelter in Bloomington. \"I was just volunteering every day at the shelter,\" he said. \"It sounds weird to say this, and I don't mean this for any kind of \u2013 it was, like, the happiest time of my life. I was painting walls and fixing garbage disposals. And I just loved it so much. I loved being able to, like, accomplish something where there was no, like, critique of it, you know what I mean?\"",
      "\"It makes total sense,\" I said. \"You fix the garbage disposal, the garbage disposal's fixed. End of it.\"",
      "\"Exactly.\"",
      "But of all the roles he's played, on-screen and off-, he says the confident illusionist in the \"Now You See Me\" franchise is the most challenging, because it's absolutely nothing like him. \"We just did the third 'Now You See Me,' and it's such a blast,\" he said. \"And it's such a challenge, because I'm doing something that's, like, the exact opposite of my psychology. It's the only time I ever walk away thinking, 'I did a good job today.' But that's because my character thinks that they're doing well. And yes, they're Hollywood movies, and they're really fun. But, like, for me, it's been a kind of like a therapy.\"",
      "\"Does that confidence linger at all past the shoots?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yes, normally it will linger through dinner,\" he replied. \"Once I get on set and I'm in those clothes, and I'm speaking in the way they've written for me \u2026 I stand up straighter. I'm, like, an inch taller. It's amazing. I can make eye contact with my father!\"",
      "You'd think the success of \"A Real Pain\" would give Eisenberg some swagger. His movie also snagged Culkin an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor. But like the babka and pickles at Canter's, Eisenberg can't seem to enjoy the sweet without just a little bit of sour.",
      "I asked, \"Is there a part of you that finds this whole experience, with the way that 'A Real Pain' has been received, kind of unreal? That at some moment you're gonna wake up?\"",
      "\"Oh, yeah, I assume a piano is gonna fall on my head every day,\" Eisenberg said. \"Because I feel like, I am so lucky. And, like, the way my mind does equations is that this lucky thing must mean this horrible upcoming thing. And so, yes, I'm not walking under any air conditioners in New York City. I don't know how to think about it any other way. And that's really unfortunate, but true!\"",

    "story": [
      "Like many homes, Suzanne de Passe's is filled with stuff. Her version of stuff? Gold and platinum albums. Snapshots with Stevie Wonder and a young Michael Jackson. The Oscar-nominated screenplay she co-wrote for \"Lady Sings the Blues.\" Her 2024 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Induction Award.",
      "De Passe is a giant in the music and entertainment industry \u2026 a trailblazing executive who moved Motown from Hitsville to Hollywood. She did it with raw talent and relentless determination.",
      "\"I had so many wonderful things to do,\" she said, \"and they were all hard, and they were all new \u2013 learning; making mistakes; getting my butt kicked; crying (tears of frustration, not sadness) \u2013 and little by little, I got my legs up under me.\"",
      "Born in Harlem and nurtured in the historic Black community of Oak Bluffs on Martha's Vineyard, de Passe says a supportive family gave her the tools to succeed.",
      "I asked, \"What were the lessons you learned from them?\"",
      "\"I think more than lessons, it was values,\" she replied.",
      "By 19, she left college to book performers at the Cheetah Club in Manhattan. Her friend, Cindy Birdsong, had just joined The Supremes, and introduced de Passe to her boss, Motown founder Berry Gordy, who hired de Passe as his creative assistant.",
      "\"When he decided that I should come to the company, I asked for a contract,\" she recalled. \"He said, 'I don't do contracts.' And I was there for 21 years without one, on a handshake.\"",
      "Part of her job was to find new talent, and that's what she did, when de Passe first heard about a group of brothers from Gary, Indiana. They called themselves The Jackson 5.",
      "\"The hair on the back of my neck stood up. They were great,\" she said.",
      "\"The hair literally stood up?\"",
      "\"Yeah, the hair. This is my big barometer, back there, absolutely. When you feel something, it's not intellectual, at all. I said, 'Oh, my gosh, Mr. Gordy, I saw this great act.' He said, 'Great.' I said, 'Wait till you see these kids.' He said, 'Kids? I don't want any kid acts. Are you crazy?'\"",
      "She wasn't. And Motown introduced The Jackson 5 to the world.",
      "de Passe took them to the dentist, worked on their early dance moves, and even picked out their wardrobe. She found Michael Jackson's hat on 8th Street in Greenwich Village. \"It was iconic, but nobody knew it at the time,\" she said.",
      "In the 1970s, she was discovering and developing artists for Motown in L.A., signing The Commodores, De Barge, and Rick James. \"I feel like I'm lucky to be alive,\" she laughed. Why? \"Because Rick was bigger than life. He was a great consumer of drugs, and just a brilliant, brilliant artist.\"",
      "It is a notorious business, and difficult to navigate, especially back then, especially for her.",
      "I asked, \"You weren't just a woman, you were a Black woman. Are you saying you faced, like, things coming at you, sexism, racism?\"",
      "\"I have had every 'ism' to deal with,\" said de Passe. \"Sexism, racism, pessimism, optimism, you know? And what I've found is that the moment you let yourself be defined by your 'isms' is when you've lost.\"",
      "de Passe always persevered. She was also a good persuader, convincing Diana Ross that the song \"I'm Coming Out\" would be a smash hit. Ross' first reaction, said de Passe, was, \"in very blatant terms, 'I hate these songs.' But I felt it would be [a hit]. Nobody knows. That's the thing about it. Nobody knows.\"",
      "\"But clearly you have really good sixth sense?\" I asked.",
      "\"I believe in what I believe in,\" de Passe replied. \"And some of it works and some of it doesn't. But I'm happy to say I have a good percentage.\"",
      "In 1982, de Passe was made president of Motown Productions. One of her first big projects was the TV special \"Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever.\" Nearly 50 million people watched Michael Jackson do the moonwalk. \"Oh, my God. and it was only six seconds,\" said de Passe. \"But the whole 'Billy Jean' of it all was just magic, I think, because nobody had ever seen anything like that before.\"",
      "de Passe also produced the landmark miniseries \"Lonesome Dove.\"",
      "I said, \"A lot of people would ask, 'What does Motown know about westerns?'\"",
      "\"Probably nothing; but I did,\" de Passe replied. \"I think the death of art is that you have to be gay to play gay. I think the death of art is that you have to be Black to direct or write a Black movie. The death of art is to not have the best person do what it is they are well-suited and passionate to do, regardless of all that other exterior stuff. And I am sick of it.\"",
      "At 78, she is still listening to her ear (and gut), finding new opportunities and stories to tell. And, with her induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, Suzanne de Passe is recognized as a true pioneer.",
      "\"I am so grateful to have had that moment to really feel that energy coming back to me,\" she said. \"I will also say, I have worked really, really hard.\"",
      "\"For someone who worked behind the scenes and in the shadows, you felt seen?\" I asked.",
      "\"Oh, definitely. I felt very seen, and very blessed.\"",

      "As part of one of the lessons learned from the outbreak, the office was intended to formalize the so-called czar roles that had led efforts across the federal government to prepare and respond to pandemic threats.",
      "Parker was previously the associate dean for Global One Health at Texas A&M University. \"One Health\" refers to the study of how health threats in animals and the environment are closely linked to human health concerns, including how dangerous viruses and bacteria often emerge in animals before spreading to humans.",

      "\"I've not been a fan of every choice that Donald Trump has made. And I've been very critical of many of them. This one is a very good choice,\" said Dr. Ashish Jha, former White House COVID-19 response coordinator under President Biden.",
      "Jha said he had consulted with Parker many times, describing him as widely known within the public health community as \"deeply knowledgeable, serious, not particularly partisan, but really just very focused on important issues.\"",
      "One of the first challenges Parker will have to tackle is the unprecedented spread of bird flu around the country.",
      "In recent months, variants of the virus have decimated the poultry and dairy industries, driven up egg prices and led to concerns about spillovers into humans, including one death in Louisiana.",
      "Under the Biden administration, the office was charged with coordinating the mammoth response operations at HHS agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Food and Drug Administration, with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which has struggled to investigate and stomp out spread of the virus in farms.",
      "\"There are very few public health experts who have that breadth of knowledge around One Health and have dealt with animal health. And so, I think that is an advantage he has over many other people,\" said Jha.",
      "Other challenges loom on the immediate horizon, including the U.S. response to a new outbreak of an Ebola virus in Uganda that has faced delays due to the Trump administration's sweeping pauses on foreign aid and shutdown of U.S. Agency for International Development missions.",
      "Parker's selection for the role suggests that President Trump is not planning to do away entirely with the office, a possibility he had raised during his campaign.",
      "Some Trump advisers had suggested that the office might be reorganized into the National Security Council, instead of operating as a standalone team.",
      "One current health official voiced concern over whether Parker's team would be adequately staffed for the breadth of work awaiting him, as he starts at the White House this week.",

The recalled ranges have been involved in more than 28 fires, with at least five causing extensive property damage totaling more than $340,000. At least eight minor injuries have been reported, including burns, and at least three of the fires involved the deaths of pets, according to the federal agency.",
      "Found at appliance stores including Best Buy, Costco, The Home Depot, Lowe's, and online at LG.com, the recalled ranges were sold from 2015 through January 2025 for between $1,400 and $2,650, depending on the model.

    "published": "Wed, 05 Feb 2025 20:38:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The strain, called D1.1, was behind a human death from bird flu last year.",
    "story": [
      "At least four cattle herds in Nevada have tested positive for a strain of H5N1 bird flu never before seen in cows, state agriculture officials confirmed Wednesday, and respiratory symptoms like coughing and sneezing have been reported.",
      "That bird flu strain, called D1.1 by scientists, was also linked to a fatal human case in Louisiana last year after exposure to sick birds. The D1.1 strain has emerged in recent months to dominate infections in wild birds and poultry flocks across North America.",
      "Symptoms seen in humans infected by D1.1 have been more severe than the previous bird flu strain that has been spreading in cows. That strain, called B3.13, has led to only mild symptoms, like pink eye and fever, in humans infected after contact with sick cows.",
      "Research suggests that B3.13 is less likely to result in severe disease for humans, unlike other bird flu strains overseas. The risk is different for other animals, like pet cats, which have frequently died after exposure to food and milk contaminated with B3.13.",
      "The discovery of the D1.1 bird flu strain's spread in cows also upends previous theories floated by U.S. health and agriculture officials that the spillover of the virus into cows from wild birds was a rare, one-off event.",
      "All cases of bird flu in cows since a spillover in Texas in late 2023 had previously been linked only to B3.13, which officials have cited as evidence that new variants of the virus were not repeatedly spreading into cows from birds.",
      "\"The detection does not change USDA's HPAI eradication strategy,\" the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service said Wednesday, citing the federal government's plan to try to stop the unprecedented surge of highly pathogenic avian influenza, or HPAI, in recent years.",
      "In addition to the human health threat posed by the virus, an unprecedented toll claimed by spillovers of the D1.1 from wild birds into chickens has driven up egg prices across the country.",
      "Nearly a thousand cow herds have been confirmed infected by bird flu to date, the USDA says, with detections across 16 states. Most recent cases have been in California.",
      "The four new cattle herds infected by D1.1 were reported in Nevada's Churchill County, a spokesperson for the state's Agriculture Department said.",
      "Bird flu was also reported in December from a herd in the state's Nye County, though those cows ended up testing positive for the B3.13 strain of the virus.",
      "The Nevada spokesperson said two additional herds in Churchill County have also now been placed under quarantine, pending laboratory results from the USDA.",
      "\"Symptoms of H5N1 D1.1 have been similar to the detections of B3.13. These include fever, reduced feed consumption, reduced milk production and mild respiratory signs (coughing, sneezing, runny nose),\" Ciara Ressel, Nevada Agriculture Department spokesperson, said of the cows' symptoms.",
      "Those herds were confirmed to have been infected as the result of a state investigation, the USDA said, after a silo that had received milk from the cows tested positive for the virus.",
      "\"USDA APHIS continues to work with the Nevada Department of Agriculture by conducting additional on-farm investigation, testing, and gathering additional epidemiological information to better understand this detection and limit further disease spread,\" the USDA said.",
      "It is unclear how many workers in the state may have been exposed to the D1.1 strain after working with those sick cows.",
      "A spokesperson for Nevada's health department referred a request to the Central Nevada Health District, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that 40 out of the 67 confirmed human bird flu cases since 2024 have been linked to exposure to dairy cows sick with the virus. Most of the others have been the result of exposure to infected poultry.",
      "In a news release last month, Nevada's Agriculture Department said the CDC \"maintains that the risk to humans remains low,\" and that it was \"working with state and county health officials to protect human health and safety.\"",
      "A spokesperson for the CDC did not immediately respond to a request for comment when asked if D1.1's spillover changes that risk assessment.",

      "Foodborne illness kills hundreds of Americans a year, sickens tens of millions annually, and costs billions in medical care, lost productivity and premature deaths, federal researchers said in a report.",
      "Roughly 10 million cases of foodborne illness each year in the U.S. are caused by six pathogens \u2014 salmonella, listeria monocytogenes, campylobacter, clostridium perfringens, shiga toxin-producing E. coli and norovirus, according to a coming study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The illnesses result in about 53,300 hospitalizations and more than 900 deaths annually, according to CDC estimates cited this week by the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO).",
      "The economic impact of these diseases is severe, costing an estimated $75 billion (in 2023 dollars) annually, including costs associated with secondary chronic illnesses and conditions that develop after the initial illness, according to the findings published Monday by the GAO, which also cited research by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Economic Research Service.",
      "The actual count of people who get sick from eating food is unknown and likely far higher than official tallies, as only a small percentage of illnesses related to contaminated food is diagnosed and reported to public health officials. For every case of salmonella detected through a lab test, for example, 29 illnesses are caused by the bacteria, the CDC estimates.",
      "Last year, separate salmonella outbreaks linked to cucumbers and eggs sickened more than 200 people in dozens of states, while listeria outbreaks linked to ready-to-eat meat and poultry products sickened 19, hospitalized 17 and killed two. An outbreak of E. coli in the fall of 2024 linked to organic carrots sickened 48 people in 19 states, killing one. Another linked to onions served in McDonald's burgers sickened more than 100 people in 14 states, resulting in one death.",

    "story": [
      "BATON ROUGE, La.\u00a0\u2014 A New York doctor was indicted by a Louisiana grand jury on Friday for allegedly prescribing an abortion pill online in the Deep South state, which has one of the strictest near-total abortion bans in the U.S.",
      "Grand jurors at the District Court for the Parish of West Baton Rouge issued an indictment against Dr. Margaret Carpenter; her company, Nightingale Medical, PC; and a third person. All three were charged with criminal abortion by means of abortion-inducing drugs, a felony.",
      "Prosecutors in Louisiana say a mother ordered the pill online and gave it to her child.",
      "\"The young child was told by the mother that she had to take the pill or else, and the child took the pill,\" District Attorney Tony Clayton said.",
      "The case appears to be the first instance of criminal charges against a doctor accused of sending abortion pills to another state, at least since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022 and opened the door for states to have strict anti-abortion laws.",
      "\"To ship a pill from another state is equivalent to me of shipping fentanyl or any other type of drugs over here that end up in the mouths and stomachs of our minor kids,\" Clayton said.",
      "Carpenter was also sued by the Texas attorney general in December under similar allegations of sending pills to that state. That case did not involve criminal charges.",
      "CBS News New York reached out to Carpenter, but has not heard back yet.",
      "Testing New York's shield laws",
      "The indictment could be the first direct test of New York's shield laws, which are intended to protect prescribers who use telehealth to provide abortion pills to patients in states where abortion is banned.",
      "\"Earlier today, a New York doctor was indicted in Louisiana for using telemedicine to prescribe abortion medication to a patient. That's right: a doctor is being prosecuted for providing basic health care to her patient. We always knew that overturning Roe v. Wade wasn't the end of the road for anti-abortion politicians. That's why I worked with the Legislature to pass nation-leading laws to protect providers and patients. It's more critical than ever for states to step up and protect reproductive freedom \u2014 and I'll never back down from this fight,\" Gov. Kathy Hochul said in a prepared release.",
      "Hochul signed the bill protecting doctors from out-of-state lawsuits\u00a0in 2023.",
      "\"I will never under any circumstances turn this doctor over to the state of Louisiana under any extradition request,\" Hochul said in a video posted to social media. \"I will do everything I can to protect this doctor and allow her to continue the work that she's doing that is so essential.\"",
      "New York Attorney General Letitia James, who would enforce the shield law, said in a statement:",
      "\"Abortion care is health care. The criminalization of abortion care is a direct and brazen attack on Americans' bodily autonomy and their right to reproductive freedom. This cowardly attempt out of Louisiana to weaponize the law against out-of-state providers is unjust and un-American. We will not allow bad actors to undermine our providers' ability to deliver critical care. Medication abortion is safe, effective, and necessary, and New York will ensure that it remains available to all Americans who need it.\"",
      "Legal experts say Carpenter may still face some hurdles.",
      "\"What happens when she tries to renew her medical license and she has a pending felony indictment in Louisiana? What happens to the doctor when she tries to fly somewhere and TSA says, hey, you have an active warrant?\" attorney Franz Borghardt said.",
      "Louisiana classifies abortion pills as \"controlled dangerous substances\"",
      "Pills have become the most common means of abortion in the U.S., accounting for nearly two-thirds of them by 2023. They're also at the center of political and legal action over abortion. In January, one judge let three states continue to challenge federal government approvals for how one of the drugs usually involved can be prescribed.",
      "The indictment comes just months after Louisiana became the first state with a law to reclassify both mifepristone and misoprostol as \"controlled dangerous substances.\" The drugs are still allowed, but medical personnel have to go through extra steps to access them.",
      "Under the legislation, if someone knowingly possesses mifepristone or misoprostol without a valid prescription for any purpose, they could be fined up to $5,000 and sent to jail for one to five years. The law carves out protections for pregnant women who obtain the drug without a prescription to take on their own.",
      "Since the fall of Roe v. Wade, Louisiana has had a near-total abortion ban, without any exceptions for rape or incest. Under the law, physicians convicted of performing an illegal abortion, including one with pills, face up to 15 years in prison, $200,000 in fines and the loss of their medical license.",
      "\"Make no mistake, since Roe v Wade was overturned, we've witnessed a disturbing pattern of interference with women's rights,\" the Abortion Coalition of Telemedicine, where Carpenter is one of the founders, said in a statement. \"It's no secret the United States has a history of violence and harassment against abortion providers, and this state-sponsored effort to prosecute a doctor providing safe and effective care should alarm everyone.\"",
      "Dr. Dara Kass, an emergency medicine physician in New York, said abortion bans are making it more dangerous for young girls and women.",
      "\"It's making it less safe to be pregnant, and it's increasing things like infant mortality and maternal mortality in states where abortions are restricted,\" she said.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump on Saturday signed an executive order that imposes 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, while adding an additional 10% levy on goods from China. Canada responded hours later with retaliatory tariffs of its own, while Mexico said it was also planning to issue tariffs on the U.S. as well.",
      "China's commerce secretary said that China would challenge the tariffs through the World Trade Organization, according to Reuters, claiming that the move \"seriously violates\" WTO rules.",
      "However, Mr. Trump on Monday announced he would\u00a0pause the tariffs on Canada and Mexico for 30 days after both countries agreed to direct additional resources to their borders.",
      "The salvo, which Mr. Trump had threatened even before returning to power earlier this month, underlines his willingness to use trade policy even against some of the U.S.' largest economic allies. It also signals the president's first major turn away from his promise on the campaign trail to rapidly reduce everyday costs for Americans once in office.",
      "In a Truth Social post on Sunday morning, Mr. Trump acknowledged \"some pain\" could come with the new wave of tariffs but insisted his vision for the country \"will all be worth the price that must be paid.\"",
      "\"THIS WILL BE THE GOLDEN AGE OF AMERICA! WILL THERE BE SOME PAIN? YES, MAYBE (AND MAYBE NOT!),\" he wrote. \"BUT WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, AND IT WILL ALL BE WORTH THE PRICE THAT MUST BE PAID. WE ARE A COUNTRY THAT IS NOW BEING RUN WITH COMMON SENSE \u2014 AND THE RESULTS WILL BE SPECTACULAR!!!\"",
      "The tariffs\u00a0were slated to take effect at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday. While the order imposes 25% tariffs on goods from Canada, \"energy resources\" such as oil and gas would only be hit with a 10% tariff.",
      "The order notes that should any of the three nations \"retaliate against the United States\" with \"import duties\" or \"similar measures,\" the president \"may increase or expand in scope the duties imposed under this order to ensure the efficacy of this action.\"",
      "According to the White House, the salvo is aimed at curbing the flow of undocumented immigrants and illicit drugs into the U.S.; spurring a resurgence in domestic manufacturing; and raising federal revenue.",
      "In a\u00a0statement\u00a0posted to social media after the announcement, Mr. Trump said the order was issued through the\u00a0International Emergency Economic Powers Act\u00a0\"because of the major threat of illegal aliens and deadly drugs killing our Citizens, including fentanyl.\"",
      "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced in a news conference Saturday night that Canada would retaliate by placing 25% tariffs \"against $155 billion worth of American goods,\" with the first set of tariffs taking effect Tuesday.",
      "\"This will include immediate tariffs on $30 billion worth of goods as of Tuesday, followed by further tariffs on $125 billion worth of American products in 21 days' time to allow Canadian companies and supply chains to seek to find alternatives,\" Trudeau said.",
      "And in a statement posted to social media, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said she instructed her economic secretary to put together a response that included both retaliatory tariffs and other measures \"in defense of Mexico's interests.\"",
      "\"We categorically reject the defamatory claims made by the White House accusing the Government of Mexico of having alliances with criminal organizations, as well as any attempts to interfere in our territory,\" Sheinbaum wrote.",
      "John Murphy, senior vice president for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which bills itself as the world's largest business organization, slammed Mr. Trump's decision, writing in a statement that \"the imposition of tariffs under IEEPA is unprecedented, won't solve these problems, and will only raise prices for American families and upend supply chains.\"",
      "Murphy added that the Chamber \"will consult with our members, including main street businesses across the country impacted by this move, to determine next steps to prevent economic harm to Americans.\"",
      "Three trade associations for the distilled spirits industry \u2014 Distilled Spirits Council of the U.S., the Chamber of the Tequila Industry, and Spirits Canada \u2014 said in a joint statement that they were \"deeply concerned that U.S. tariffs on imported spirits from Canada and Mexico will significantly harm all three countries and lead to a cycle of retaliatory tariffs that negatively impacts our shared industry.\"",
      "Bob Hemesath, an Iowa farmer and board chairman of Farmers for Free Trade, an agriculture group that advocates for more open trade, said in a statement that Canada, Mexico and China are \"indispensable markets for the livelihood of the American ag economy,\" and \"placing tariffs on the three largest export markets for American farmers and ranchers, particularly for an extended period of time, would have severe consequences.\"",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson praised the order, writing on social media that Mr. Trump is \"holding Mexico, Canada, and China accountable for their role in the flow of illegal aliens and illicit drugs across our borders.

      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer criticized the move in a series of social media posts, one of which read: \"You're worried about grocery prices. Don's raising prices with his tariffs.\"",
      "Experts warn that the impact of the tariffs could affect the economies of Canada, Mexico and China \u2014 the nation's three biggest trading partners \u2014 as well as the U.S. itself. Canada's economy could shrink by 3.6%, while Mexico could take a 2% hit, according to Cornell University economics professor Wendong Zhang.",

      "\"We have stressed that steep tariff increases against U.S. trading partners could create a stagflationary shock \u2014 a negative economic hit combined with an inflationary impulse \u2014 while also triggering financial market volatility,\" said EY Chief Economist Gregory Daco in a Jan. 31 report.",
      "Daco added, \"These tariffs against Mexico, Canada and China would mark the first major wave of trade levies in Trump's new term, with effects rippling far beyond those economies, as other nations brace for potential targeting and U.S. businesses navigate supply chain disruptions and retaliation risks.\"",
      "American consumers have been bracing for the impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs, telling pollsters that they expected to see higher prices if the president followed through on his plans to enact them. Those expectations may have prompted some consumers to purchase goods before Mr. Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20, economists say.",
      "\"The mere prospect of tariffs appears to be influencing the behavior of consumers and businesses,\" analysts with Oxford Economics in a research note. \"Imports surged in December, likely an attempt to front-run any tariffs, while consumers may be bringing forward spending in anticipation of tariff-related price hikes.\"",

    "summary": "A federal court temporarily paused the Trump administration's \"deferred resignation\" offer, while unions claim it is against the law.",
    "story": [
      "Millions of federal workers have more time to ponder their next career move after a judge on Thursday temporarily suspended the Office of Personnel Management's deadline for them to accept or reject the agency's\u00a0\"deferred resignation\" offer.",
      "The cutoff to take the deal had been set to expire at on Thursday at midnight Eastern time before the ruling from U.S. District Judge George O'Toole barred the OPM from implementing the deadline. A Justice Department lawyer said the agency, which sent the original offer, would notify government employees that the deadline is paused pending further legal proceedings.",
      "\"In compliance with the court order, the deadline for federal employees to accept the deferred resignation program is being extended to Monday, Feb. 10, at 11:59 p.m. EST,\" the OPM said in a social media post. \"The program is NOT being blocked or canceled. The government will honor the deferred resignation offer.\"",
      "Under the OPM's offer, employees who accepted it would continue getting paid through September but would be excused from reporting for workers. But if they opted to keep their jobs, they could get fired.",
      "That decision, one affecting the careers and livelihoods of 2.3 million civilian federal employees, is a fraught one, employment attorneys and government watchdogs said. In part, that's because the offer includes a number of provisions that are unclear and not guaranteed, posing financial and professional risks while leaving workers in danger of not getting what they signed up for, experts told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The Trump administration also may lack authority to extend such a deal, and as such the deferred resignation allegedly breaks numerous laws, a Feb. 4 lawsuit filed by several federal employee unions alleges. The plaintiffs in that suit are asking a court to block the government's offer, which they describe as \"arbitrary, capricious\" and in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, a 1946 law governing how federal agencies implement regulations.",
      "The deferred resignation offer is the brainchild of the second Trump administration, which has ordered federal workers to return to the office five days a week\u00a0while directing government agencies to end remote work arrangements. The White House expects to persuade up to roughly 10% of the federal civilian workforce to resign, saving $100 billion a year in costs.",
      "The offer isn't available to members of the armed forces, U.S. Postal Service workers, and those who work in jobs related to immigration enforcement and national security,\u00a0according\u00a0to the OPM.",
      "Through Feb. 5, about 40,000 federal workers had accepted the deal, or some 2% of the federal workforce, according to a CBS News source familiar with the matter.",
      "\"We encourage federal workers in this city to accept the very generous offer,\" White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said Thursday around the time of Judge O'Toole's ruling. \"They don't want to come into the office. If they want to rip the American people off, then they're welcome to take this buyout and we'll find highly qualified people\" to replace them.",
      "Risks to workers",
      "OPM's offer includes many gray areas that could present pitfalls to employees who accept it, legal sources and union officials said.",
      "\"There is a risk for employees to take this without knowing what would happen down the line,\" said Ryan Nerney, managing partner at law firm Tully Rinckey and an expert on federal employment law. \"If you decide to take this, and let's say there's a reduction in force and your job is eliminated, there is no guidance on what would happen in a circumstance like that. Would you still get paid through Sept. 30?\"",
      "The agency's email lacks specifics and guarantees about the offer, adding to government workers' confusion, Doreen Greenwald, president of the National Treasury Employees Union, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"It's very confusing \u2014 it says you won't have to do your position duties anymore, but there is a caveat that says if they need you, you have to keep doing that,\" Greenwald said, referring to the resignation letter that says employees aren't expected to work except in \"rare circumstances.\"",
      "A dozen state attorneys general around the country have also cautioned federal workers about accepting the offer, describing it as \"misleading\" and urging employees to closely scrutinize the terms.",
      "Elon Musk's \"Fork in the Road\"",
      "Federal workers received the Trump administration's offer in an email last month entitled \"A Fork in the Road,\" mirroring the subject line of a 2022 message\u00a0sent by billionaire Elon Musk to employees at Twitter, the social media platform he bought in October 2022 and later renamed X.",
      "Like Twitter's earlier deal, OPM's offer includes a demand that federal workers make a decision by a specific date. In his 2022 email, Musk told Twitter employees they had one day to decide to either agree to work in a \"hardcore\" style or quit and get three months of severance.",
      "Musk is spearheading the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, a nongovernmental task force tasked by President Trump with slashing federal costs. The Tesla CEO has touted the government's deferred resignation offer on X, claiming that employees who accept it can do \"whatever you like, including obtaining a new job\" while receiving government pay and benefits through September.",
      "Although that could strike some workers like a good deal, the unions' lawsuit claims OPM may not have the financial authority to make that offer. For instance, the agency's email states it will pay workers who agree to resign by Feb. 6 through Sept. 30, but funding for most federal agencies expires on March 14.",
      "That indicates the Trump administration is planning to spend money \"before an appropriation is authorized,\" the suit claims. If so, that could violate The Antideficiency Act, a law that prohibits federal agencies from spending above their appropriated levels, the complaint alleges.",
      "The deferred resignation offer allegedly also violates the Administrative Procedure Act, the lawsuit claims. That law says courts can find government agency actions to be unlawful if they are \"arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\"",
      "It's also not clear what could happen to federal workers who accept the offer if it is then found to be illegal by the courts, said Robert Weissman, co-president of government watchdog group Public Citizen. \"I could imagine going back to work and being told you did not work, and we're not going to pay you for an illegal program,\" he said.",
      "Government employees should \"be skeptical about what is actually going to be delivered through this offer,\" Weissman added.",

      "The offer also fails to consider the impact of widespread resignations on the government's ability to provide services to Americans, the union suit alleges. Twitter (now X) suffered from a number of issues after Musk cut the majority of its workforce, including a decline in advertisers and sharp drop in its valuation, the complaint states.",
      "A sweeping job-cutting measure could cause chaos if government agencies lacked enough staff to handle some services such as tax refund processing, Social Security verification, or providing health care through Medicaid and Medicare, experts say.",
      "\"There is no 10% across-the-board slush fund of employees that [the public] would not feel any harm by this,\" Greenwald said. \"The federal government is not Twitter \u2014 it is funded by Congress and budgeted by that process, and it is set to uphold the laws that Congress has passed.\"",

      "Giving federal employees just over a week to make a weighty career decision is a departure from previous voluntary resignation offers, with buyouts in the Clinton administration providing one year for workers to accept a deal, the lawsuit points out.",

      "About 500,000 ranges sold nationwide are being recalled after dozens of fires burned property, people and pets, LG Electronics said Wednesday in a notice posted by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission.",
      "The recall involves ranges with front-mounted knobs that can be turned accidentally, with CPSC receiving at least 86 reports of unintentional activation. The recalled ranges have been involved in more than 28 fires, with at least five causing extensive property damage totaling more than $340,000. At least eight minor injuries have been reported, including burns, and at least three of the fires involved the deaths of pets, according to the federal agency.",
      "Found at appliance stores including Best Buy, Costco, The Home Depot, Lowe's, and online at LG.com, the recalled ranges were sold from 2015 through January 2025 for between $1,400 and $2,650, depending on the model.

    "summary": "White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said that Tesla CEO Musk is categorized as a special government employee.",
    "story": [
      "Billionaire Elon Musk is categorized as a \"special government employee\" through his work with the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, a cost-cutting initiative created by President Trump to find ways to trim federal spending.",
      "Musk's employee status was confirmed by White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt on Monday, although she added that she wasn't sure whether the Tesla CEO has gained security clearance.",
      "DOGE, which isn't a federal department, has drawn criticism from Democratic lawmakers and sparked several lawsuits since Mr. Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20, with some claiming Musk's DOGE is violating various laws. For instance, two unions and the Alliance for Retired Americans, an advocacy group for older people and retirees, sued on Feb. 3 over DOGE's access to the Treasury Department's payment systems \u2014 which handle everything from tax refunds to Social Security payments \u2014 alleging that the move breaches privacy regulations.",
      "That lawsuit pointed out that, at the time of its filing, Musk's status with the federal government was unclear.",
      "\"The Trump administration has not publicly revealed whether Mr. Musk has been made an officer or employee of the U.S. government or remains a private citizen,\" the lawsuit states. \"The Trump administration also has not publicly revealed the employment status of other individuals who are part of DOGE.\"",
      "In an emailed statement to CBS MoneyWatch, Leavitt said, \"Elon Musk is a special government employee and has abided by all applicable federal laws.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the \"special government employee\" designation.",
      "What is a special government employee?",
      "A special government employee, or SGE, is someone who\"who works, or is expected to work, for the government for 130 days or less in a 365-day period,\" according to the Department of Justice.",
      "The role was created in 1962 as a way to enable the government to tap outside expertise, according to the publication Government Executive. A special government employee can be paid or unpaid, the Justice Department notes.",
      "Which rules must SGEs adhere to?",
      "SGEs \"are subject to most rules, although sometimes in a less restrictive way,\" including ethics and conflict of interest rules, the Justice Department states.",
      "But SGEs also are prohibited from working on issues that impact their financial interests, as well as their spouses, children or organizations in which they work or serve as a director or trustee. Some of Musk's businesses rely on the federal government's contracts, including SpaceX, which was awarded 100 contracts in 2023 worth $3 billion, according to the New York Times.",
      "Musk's potential conflict of interests were highlighted by Senator Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, in a Jan. 31 letter to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent about the Tesla CEO's access to the department's payment system.",
      "\"I am concerned Musk's enormous business operations in China \u2014 a country whose intelligence agencies have stolen vast amounts of sensitive data about Americans, including U.S. government employee data by hacking U.S. government systems \u2014 endangers U.S. cybersecurity and creates conflicts of interest that make his access to these systems a national security risk,\" Wyden wrote.",
      "However, an SGE can get a waiver \"if your interest is not large,\" the Justice Department notes. \"If you do not qualify for a waiver, you will have to disqualify yourself from participating in any matter that affects your financial interests.\"",
      "Musk's $418 billion fortune is largely tied up in his stakes in SpaceX, worth $136 billion, and Tesla, valued at $158 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.",
      "Does Musk need to make disclosures as an SGE?",
      "Special government employees are only required to make a public financial disclosure report if they earn above the GS-15 government pay rate, or about $123,000. If they make below that, they can file on a confidential basis.",
      "It's not clear whether Musk is being paid for his work or if he's participating on a volunteer basis, although DOGE has recruited full-time salaried employees.",

      "Before a wildfire ravaged their street in northwest Altadena, Louise Hamlin and Chris Wilson lived next door to each other in nearly identical houses.",
      "\"I chose an old home in an old neighborhood because it has soul,\" said Hamlin, a 51-year-old single mom with a teenage boy, who bought her 1,500-square-foot home 10 years ago.",
      "Today, gone are their charming English-style cottages built in 1925 with the welcoming porches and Palladian windows. Amid the rubble and ash, little is left of their historic neighborhood.",
      "In the weeks since the Eaton wildfire took their homes, Hamlin and Wilson have been stumbling through the layers of business, bureaucracy and emotional trauma of surviving a natural disaster, with their sights firmly set on rebuilding.",
      "How they'll navigate rebuilding is a story of contrasting fortunes and unequal recovery that reveals the nation's growing home insurance crisis. Her insurance has already paid out nearly a million dollars and she is searching for contractors. He is contemplating loans, lawsuits and moving his family out of California.",
      "\"It changes the whole trajectory to your life,\" said Wilson, 44, who bought his house five years ago with his wife, who is six months pregnant with their first child.",
      "Hamlin's home was privately covered by Mercury Insurance, but Wilson was forced onto the California Fair Access to Insurance Requirements Plan \u2014 the state's bare-bones insurance program \u2014 when SafeCo declined to renew his policy last May. The FAIR Plan insures people who can't get private coverage but need insurance as a condition of their mortgage.",
      "As wildfires, hurricanes and other natural disasters become more frequent due to climate change, many property owners find themselves struggling to find or afford private insurance. The issue is particularly acute in California, where some major insurance companies have stopped writing new policies altogether or are refusing to renew existing ones.",
      "State officials recently started rolling out new regulations to entice insurers to stay in California, with the hope of getting as many homeowners as possible off the FAIR Plan.",
      "FAIR, with its high premiums and basic coverage, was designed as a temporary safety net until policyholders find a more permanent option. Yet the number of FAIR Plan residential policies more than doubled from 2020 to 2024, reaching nearly 452,000 policies last year.",
      "For Wilson and Hamlin, their parallel rebuilding journeys serve as a cautionary tale. Wilson paid nearly 60% more in premiums related to the fire than Hamlin, for less than half the coverage.",
      "\"That's why a lot of people call it 'The Unfair Plan.'\" said Amy Bach, executive director of the consumer advocacy group United Policyholders.",
      "SafeCo's parent company Liberty Mutual said in a statement that it couldn't comment on any individual policies but acknowledged \"difficult but purposeful business decisions\" in California.",
      "Mercury didn't respond to requests for comment.",
      "Janet Ruiz, spokesperson for the Insurance Information Institute, which represents many major insurance companies, said California is fortunate to have the FAIR Plan, which is required to accept everyone. Ruiz said outcomes would be even worse if homeowners had no coverage at all.",
      "Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara said California is working to make sure all claims are paid. He said in a statement that his office is working to get homeowners off the FAIR Plan and back to traditional more comprehensive insurance coverage.",
      "A FAIR Plan spokesperson declined to comment on Wilson's case, and noted that it's difficult to compare policies and coverage.",
      "Thousands of people lost their homes in the Eaton and nearby Palisades fires, which were among the most destructive in California history.",
      "The FAIR Plan said it expanded staffing to meet the surging demand and has a funding mechanism in place to pay all covered claims. State data shows more than 31,000 wildfire-related claims had been filed as of last week, including roughly 4,400 claims under the FAIR Plan.",
      "Hamlin had standard comprehensive home insurance, with an annual policy premium of $1,264 at the time of the fire. She can receive up to $1.5 million to replace her home, other structures and personal property, including up to $303,000 for living expenses while displaced. Her policy further entitles her to coverage that could add more than $200,000 to help her rebuild.",
      "Wilson, meanwhile, pays a $2,000 premium for the FAIR Plan that sets his maximum payout at $686,000, including $100,000 for living expenses while displaced.",
      "Wilson also had to buy \"wrap-around insurance\" for $1,500 a year for issues the FAIR Plan doesn't cover, such as burst pipes or falling objects. That supplemental plan doesn't cover fire damage.",
      "Hamlin said Mercury's support has been exceptional, immediately sending her money and helping with next steps such as finding housing and getting contractor quotes. Within days, the company wired her tens of thousands of dollars to get started while the process fell into place.",
      "\"Being able to rest at night and wake up and deal with everything else is really important,\" Hamlin said.",
      "Meanwhile, Wilson has struggled to even talk to a FAIR Plan representative. There was zero communication in the first two weeks, contact information was listed incorrectly, phone numbers had no voicemail and emails bounced back.",
      "\"Half the time, I feel like I'm doing something wrong,\" Wilson said.",
      "After The Associated Press reached out for comment, Insurance Department spokesperson Michael Soller said a representative would contact Wilson directly.",
      "Wilson said he feels haunted by his choices. He thought he had bought property in a low-risk area, and had avoided looking for homes in another neighborhood further north after hearing that people there had been dropped by their insurers.",
      "Hamlin, too, was aware of the fire risks when she moved in. She previously lived in Pasadena and was surprised that State Farm, her then-insurance company, would not offer her coverage in Altadena. She chose Mercury because it was the cheapest option, and was considering pursuing even more robust coverage.",
      "\"I could have been dropped when Chris was dropped. Any of us could be at any time. It's just luck, really. It's nothing I did or didn't do,\" Hamlin said, stunned by the comparison. \"I had the same risk factors as everyone else.\"",
      "Stephen Collier, a professor of urban planning at University of California, Berkeley, said the seemingly random nature of who gets dropped and when has much to do with insurance companies' complicated risk models.",
      "\"They're all trying to manage their exposure,\" Collier said. \"If you think about wildfires, you don't want concentrated exposure.\"",
      "Wilson said SafeCo requested an inspection of his property before deciding not to renew his policy. Panicked, he tried unsuccessfully to negotiate with them, offering to clear brushes, trim trees near the roof, and other wildfire mitigation efforts.",
      "Wilson shopped around aggressively with his insurance agent but to no avail, and resigned himself to the FAIR Plan, assuming he would eventually find private insurance again.",
      "There was another catch: Wilson said he couldn't get comprehensive replacement cost coverage on the FAIR Plan because his roof was too old. Instead, he ended up with what is known as \"actual cash value\" coverage, which greatly limits the payout based on the physical depreciation of what was lost.",
      "\"We're talking hundreds of thousands of dollars and that's very, very painful,\" said Bach of United Policyholders.",
      "Citing rising fire risks and other problems, seven of the top 12 insurance companies either paused or restricted new business in California in 2023. State regulations give insurers more latitude to raise premiums in exchange for issuing policies in high-risk areas, including consideration of climate change in premiums and passing the costs of reinsurance to consumers.",
      "But those are only short-term solutions, said Dave Jones, California's insurance commissioner from 2011 to 2018. He pointed to Florida, where officials have \"done everything the insurers asked California to do\" but yielded little success.",
      "\"We're marching steadily towards an uninsurable future in the United States because we're not doing enough fast enough to address the underlying cause, which is climate change,\" Jones said.",
      "Unless governments take on the financial burden of serious mitigation efforts, the price of California's fire risk will remain unequal and left to the homeowners, Collier of UC Berkeley said. That could be the underinsured \u2014 like Wilson \u2014 swallowing their personal losses, or all California homeowners collectively saddled with increased premiums, or both. State Farm, California's largest insurance company, this week urged the state to approve an emergency rate hike of 22% for homeowner policies starting in May after processing nearly 8,700 claims and paying out more than $1 billion to policyholders for the LA fires.",
      "\"There's a huge amount of risk in the system and there's a big question of who is going to pay for this,\" Collier said.",
      "Wilson expects he'll have to take out loans to rebuild. He's considering joining a lawsuit against Southern California Edison that alleges the utility's equipment sparked the blaze, in hopes of receiving settlement money.",
      "But with a baby on the way, Wilson said he can't fathom living in limbo on the FAIR Plan forever, and he's thinking about leaving California if private insurance remains out of reach.",
      "\"I don't want to have to be prepared to maybe lose everything again,\" Wilson said. \"Stuck paying for an insurance that doesn't cover anything. You don't want to live in a risky area. You don't have the safety net.\"",

      "President Trump's move to tack an additional 10% tariff on U.S. imports from China could lead Mattel to hike the price of its Barbie, Hot Wheels and other toys.",
      "Mattel Chief Financial Officer Anthony DiSilvestro said in an earnings call with Wall Street analysts on Tuesday that roughly 40% of the company's toys are made in China, while noting that is less than the industry average of 80%. Overall, the fresh U.S. levies on Chinese good affect about 20% of Mattel's global production.",
      "\"Against the tariff, we have a range of mitigating actions,\" including \"potential price increases,\" he said.",
      "\"We do work closely with our retail partners to achieve the right balance and always keep consumers in mind when we consider pricing actions,\" DiSilvestro added.",
      "Mr. Trump has also imposed 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico, where Mattel sources almost 10% of its products, and on Canada. On Monday, the president paused those tariffs for at least 30 days after Mexico and Canada agreed to heighten security at their respective borders with the U.S.",

      "\"We're going to suffer as a small business, but so is everyone in this country,\" Dan Marshall, co-owner of family-run Mischief Toy Store in St. Paul, Minnesota, told CBS News Minnesota this week. Marshall said there are few toy manufacturers left in the U.S., and the tariffs could have an adverse impact.",

    "story": [
      "With Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) gaining control of the Treasury Department's payment system, consumer advocates and Democratic lawmakers are raising alarms about the group's access to the federal government's financial spigot, as well as sensitive data such as the Social Security numbers of most taxpayers.",
      "DOGE, a Trump administration task force assigned to find ways to reduce federal spending, now has access to a Treasury unit called the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, which disburses trillions in payments each year, including Social Security checks and federal salaries, according to the Associated Press.",
      "Musk's access to the payment system is raising concerns as it comes just days after the White House ordered a broad freeze\u00a0on federal grants and loans, causing confusion within federal assistance programs, at nonprofits and among Americans receiving government aid. That same day, state Medicaid programs said they were locked out\u00a0of the Department of Health and Human Services system used to track and disburse money.",
      "What are the concerns?",
      "While the White House later rescinded the memo and a judge halted the freeze, DOGE's control of the Treasury's payment system raises questions about the Trump administration's ability to halt the flow of federal funds for programs including Medicare and Social Security. It's also causing concerns about DOGE's access to the personal and financial information of most taxpayers.",
      "\"There's no community of Americans that this system does not touch, and so I think the concern is that access to this system including personally identifiable information has been ceded to the president's billionaire friend for reasons that are passing understanding,\" Donald K. Sherman, executive director and chief counsel of the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "There are \"quite real risks\" that DOGE \"could potentially undermine that system and threaten millions of Americans from getting payments that they are due,\" he added.",
      "Musk's access to the Treasury payment system has sparked concern from Democratic lawmakers including Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Ron Wyden, while a lawsuit was filed on Monday alleging \"unlawful ongoing, systematic, and continuous disclosure of personal and financial information\" to Musk and DOGE. The lawsuit, filed by two unions and the Alliance for Retired Americans, names U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and the Treasury as defendants.",
      "\"Controlling the system could allow the Trump Administration to 'unilaterally' \u2014 and illegally \u2014 cut off payments for millions of Americans, putting at risk the financial security of families and businesses based on political favoritism or the whims of Mr. Musk and those on his team who have worked their way inside,\" said Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, in a Feb. 2 letter to Bessent.",
      "She added, \"It could also give them access to millions of Americans' personal and financial information that is protected by law.\"",
      "The Treasury Department didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",

      "The letter stated that Tom Krause, a member of Musk's DOGE team who has been brought in as a Treasury Department employee, will \"have read-only access to the coded data of the Fiscal Service's payment systems\" as part of an \"operational efficiency assessment.\"",
      "\"This is similar to the kind of access that Treasury provides to individuals reviewing Treasury systems, such as auditors, and that follows practices associated with protecting the integrity of the systems and business processes,\" the letter read, describing Krause as a \"longtime technology executive.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the Bureau of the Fiscal Service.",
      "What is the Bureau of the Fiscal Service?",
      "The Treasury has long been the federal government's checkbook, tasked with handling payments for individual agencies based on funds appropriated by Congress. Its systems control the flow of over $6 trillion in payments to American families, businesses and other recipients each year.",
      "The Treasury Department's Bureau of the Fiscal Service handles most of those payments. About 90 cents of every $1 in federal payments are sent through the little-known division.",
      "In fiscal 2023, the unit disbursed nearly 1.3 billion payments totaling $5.4 trillion, according\u00a0to\u00a0the agency. Almost 97% of the payments were made electronically and all were made on time, it noted.",
      "How did DOGE get control of the payment system?",
      "The executive\u00a0order\u00a0signed by President Trump that created DOGE directed all agencies to make sure it was given \"full and prompt access to all unclassified agency records, software systems and IT systems.\" DOGE itself is not a federal department.",
      "Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla, gained control of the system after Treasury's acting Deputy Secretary, David Lebryk, resigned from his position after more than 30 years of service. Lebryk stepped down after Musk and his DOGE organization requested access to sensitive Treasury data, the Washington Post had reported.",
      "On Sunday, Musk\u00a0stated\u00a0that DOGE had stopped payments from the U.S. Department of Health and Human services to Lutheran Family Services, a faith-based charity that had been offering social services to refugees.",
      "Could this impact Social Security?",
      "Lawmakers and consumer advocates are raising concerns about the potential impact on government programs including Social Security, although neither Musk nor Mr. Trump have flagged Social Security as a target for cuts.",
      "Indeed, Mr. Trump has said he will preserve Social Security, and while on the campaign trail he vowed to eliminate taxes on Social Security Income. But because the Bureau of the Fiscal Services sends monthly checks to more than 70 million Social Security beneficiaries, some advocates say they're worried.",
      "Musk and DOGE \"now have access to the personal information of every Social Security beneficiary \u2014 and the ability to stop payments for any federal programs they dislike,\" said Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, an advocacy group for the programs, in an email. \"Seniors, their families, and people with disabilities most certainly cannot trust Trump and Musk with their crucial federal benefits \u2014 or their personal data.\"",
      "Sen. Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, said in a Jan. 31 letter to Bessent that he's concerned that Social Security checks could be impacted, \"whether intentional or unintentional.\"",
      "\"It appears that Musk's behavior is forcing out highly qualified and experienced career public servants in order to get his way and fulfill Trump's goal of eviscerating the federal budget, including potentially by cutting Social Security and Medicare benefits for millions of Americans who are already struggling to pay their bills or buy groceries,\" he wrote.",
      "In a response to Wyden's letter, however, Jonathan Blum, a legislative affairs official at Treasury, told Wyden that DOGE personnel are only only able to read \"coded data\" in the federal payment system and cannot change scheduled systems. DOGE \"has not caused payments for obligations such as Social Security and Medicare to be delayed or re-routed,\" Blum wrote.",
      "Bloomberg was the first to report on the letter.",
      "Warren said Blum's letter raised more questions than answers. \"It asserts that a set of Treasury staff members have 'read-only' access but fails to answer questions about non-Treasury employees, like those working for Elon Musk and DOGE,\" she said in a statement.",
      "Does Musk have access to taxpayers' personal data?",
      "Lawmakers and consumer advocates are also raising concerns about DOGE's access to personal data for millions of American taxpayers. Because the Bureau of the Fiscal Service distributes tax refunds and Social Security payments, it has access to the Social Security numbers and bank accounts of recipients.",
      "Kate Miller, who serves on an advisory board for DOGE, didn't respond to requests for comment but did\u00a0repost an Associated Press article on X\u00a0with the comment, \"No classified material was accessed without proper security clearances.\"",
      "Access to that personal information could pose risks to taxpayers, according to data safety experts.",
      "\"Traditionally, access to this information has been highly restricted and among the most secure information the U.S. government holds,\" said James E. Lee, the president of the Identity Theft Resource Center, said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "He added, \"This is the kind of information that, if it found its way into the hands of a bad actor, could lead to a wide range of identity crimes \u2014 impersonation to open new accounts or access existing ones, theft of the funds in an existing banking account, applying for new state or federal government benefits, and filing false tax returns among other forms of identity fraud.\"",
      "The data is also sensitive because it could be useful to intelligence agencies in other nations, including the personal data of government employees or ties that businesses have with the U.S. government, Lee noted.",
      "That concern was echoed by Sen. Wyden, who in the Jan. 31 letter to Bessent questioned granting access to sensitive information to Musk due to significant business interests in China, noting that Tesla operates its largest factory in China. Musk didn't respond to a request for comment.",

    "summary": "The world's two biggest economies are on the brink of an economically destructive trade war. Here's what experts think could happen next.",
    "story": [
      "The quick-fire volley of tariffs between the U.S. and China in recent days has heightened global fears of a new trade war between the world's two largest economies. Yet while experts think the battle is likely to escalate, they also say the early skirmishes offer hope for an agreement on trade and other key issues that could head off a larger conflict.",
      "After the Trump administration's additional 10% levy on Chinese imports took effect Tuesday, China announced a 15% tariff\u00a0on U.S. coal and liquified natural gas, along with a 10% tariff on crude oil, agricultural machinery and some cars, that is set to kick in Feb. 10. China also put limits on exports of vital minerals used in high-tech products; opened an antitrust probe into Google; and placed two American companies on an \"unreliable entities\" list \u2014 PVH Group, which owns Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, and Illumina, a biotechnology company with offices in China.",
      "Notably, however, the U.S. opted to hit China with a relatively modest tariff, rather than levies of up to 60%, as President Trump had previously threatened. For its part, Beijing also pulled its punches by targeting less vital U.S. sectors, leaving the door open for the sides to reach a deal.",
      "\"I think [Mr. Trump] backed off bigger Chinese tariffs because it became clear to him that it would eliminate any possibility of negotiation,\" trade policy expert William Reinsch, a former U.S. undersecretary of commerce for export administration and senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It would be trade prohibitive, and they would regard it basically as an act of economic warfare. So I think he went with a number that would not prevent future negotiations and would still send a signal, so he ended up with 10%.\"",
      "For now, Wall Street investors are also taking the countries' fresh trade sanctions in stride, betting that neither Mr. Trump nor Chinese President Xi Jinping are eager to start a mutually destructive economic war.",
      "\"It is all rhetoric for now. This is the negotiation stage,\" said Bill Dendy, a financial strategist at investment bank Raymond James. \"It is like two brothers starting to talk smack, and they'll start to throw punches, but they don't want to hurt each other. It's not good for anybody if it gets out of hand.\"",
      "Julian Evans-Pritchard, head of China economics at Capital Economics, told investors in a report that China's retaliatory measures have \"clearly been calibrated to try to send a message to the U.S. (and domestic audiences) without inflicting too much damage.\"",
      "Even such efforts to avert a full-blown trade war could falter, spurring Mr. Trump to pursue a harder line against China, which he has long claimed uses a range of unfair practices that disadvantage U.S. businesses and workers.",
      "\"Edge of a cliff\"",
      "Reinsch said he expects Mr. Trump and Xi to hold discussions toward a deal that could lead to tariffs being repealed, or at least put on hold. \"These are all leverage moves,\" Reinsch said. \"The purpose is to force a negotiation on whatever it is [Mr. Trump] wants to negotiate, and he is good at brinkmanship. He goes right up to the edge of the cliff like he did with Canada and Mexico, and then he backed off in a way that allowed him to declare victory.\"",
      "Mr. Trump on Feb. 1 announced 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico. But the U.S. quickly\u00a0paused those duties for one month\u00a0after leaders of both countries said they would increase their efforts to curb the flow of illicit drugs and migrants into the U.S.",
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum \"agreed to immediately supply 10,000 Mexican Soldiers on the Border separating Mexico and the United States,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social. Meanwhile, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canada would invest $1.3 billion in better protecting its southern border.",
      "\"Trudeau and Sheinbaum figured out that that's the way to play it. If Trump is given an off-ramp where he can say, 'Ok, I won,' he'll take it, and that's what happened,\" Reinsch said.",
      "Whether such dynamics will ultimately work with China, and whether Xi is willing to indulge them, remains uncertain. After all, during Mr. Trump's first term he repeatedly imposed tariffs on China, leading Beijing to retaliate each time. Some experts think Trump officials will have to push much harder to obtain the kind of changes likely to satisfy Mr. Trump.",
      "\"This marks the fifth time in a row that Beijing has retaliated to tariffs, rather than make needed reforms. The first four times happened during Trump's first term and also got zero results. At some point, President Trump needs to figure out that tariffs will not get him what he wants from China,\" Ryan Young, senior economist for the Competitive Enterprise Institute, an advocacy group that favors deregulation, said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Risks for consumers",
      "The risks of an escalating trade war between the U.S. and China are considerable, including rising inflation.",
      "\"If we continue to go down this road, that can be very detrimental to the U.S. consumer because it is the consumer that pays for these tariffs, as costs not easily absorbed by industries that have tight margins already,\" Dendy said.",
      "Unless the countries find a breakthrough, \"Americans can expect to pay a lot more for their technology goods, as well as their clothing and other things,\" he added.",
      "By contrast, U.S. prices are unlikely to soar in the short-term even if the conflict continues, economists note. For one, rising tariffs would likely slow economic growth, dampening inflation as consumers and businesses pare spending. Reinsch also notes that many American companies that import goods from China have prepared for the prospect of higher costs by preemptively building their inventories.",
      "One area where U.S. consumers could feel an immediate impact \u2014 their purchases of cheap clothing from Chinese fast-fashion retailers Shein and Temu. The new U.S. tariffs on China eliminate an exemption for packages worth less than $800, meaning that low-value goods are now subject to the levies.",
      "The U.S. receives roughly 1 billion such shipments annually.",
      "\"If you are Temu and Shein, you will probably to a hit on two grounds. They will have to start paying tariffs on dresses and T-shirts, so they will take a hit,\" Reinsch said. Those costs would be passed on the shoppers. Additionally, Mr. Trump has asked U.S. Customs and Border Protection to inspect low-value packages to screen them for fentanyl, which could create shipping delays.\"",
      "Implementing the 10% tariff on China, along with the 25% duties on imports from Canada and Mexico that are now on hold, would cost the typical U.S. household more than $1,200 a year, according to the Peterson Institute for International Economics.",

      "A violin made by the famed Antonio Stradivari in 1714 has the potential to become the most expensive musical instrument ever sold when it goes up for auction Friday at Sotheby's in New York.",
      "The auction house is estimating the value of the \"Joachim-Ma Stradivarius\" at $12 million to $18 million. If it sells at the top end of that range, it could best the $15.9 million paid in 2011 for another Stradivarius, the \"Lady Blunt,\" made in 1721 and named by Guinness World Records as the most expensive instrument ever sold at auction.",
      "Mari-Claudia Jimenez, Sotheby's Americas president and head of global business, said Stradivari made the violin during his \"Golden Period,\" which began around 1700 and was marked by an improvement in his craftmanship.",
      "\"So this is the peak of his output,\" Jimenez said. \"This is the best violin of this era.\"",
      "Sotheby's says the violin's preservation is remarkable and its ownership history extraordinary.",
      "It's named for two of its famed owners - violin virtuosos Joseph Joachim of Hungary, who lived from 1831 to 1907, and Si-Hon Ma, who was born in China in 1926, moved to the U.S. in 1948 and died in 2009.",
      "It's believed that legendary composer Johannes Brahms was influenced by the Joachim-Ma when he wrote his \"Violin Concerto in D Major\" because of its rich, resonant tone, and that Joachim played that violin during the concerto's 1879 premiere, according to Sotheby's.",
      "Ma acquired the violin in 1969 and his estate gifted it to the New England Conservatory in Boston after his death. Ma attended the conservatory, where he earned a master's degree in 1950. The conservatory is now putting the violin up for auction, with all the proceeds going to student scholarships.",

      "The move by DOGE, a Trump administration task force assigned to find ways to fire federal workers, cut programs and slash federal regulations, means it could have wide leeway to access important taxpayer data, among other things. Advocacy groups on Monday filed a lawsuit against the Treasury Department, calling the data sharing illegal.",
      "\"The scale of the intrusion into individuals' privacy is massive and unprecedented,\" said those in the\u00a0complaint filed by several plaintiffs including the Public Citizen Litigation Group, the Alliance for Retired Americans and the Service Employees International Union. \"People who must share information with the federal government should not be forced to share information with Elon Musk or his 'DOGE.'

The Washington Post on Friday reported that Lebryk resigned his position after Musk and his DOGE organization requested access to sensitive Treasury data.",
      "\"The Fiscal Service performs some of the most vital functions in government,\" Lebryk said in a letter to Treasury employees sent out Friday. \"Our work may be unknown to most of the public, but that doesn't mean it isn't exceptionally important. I am grateful for having been able to work alongside some of the nation's best and most talented operations staff.\"",

      "However, the losses moderated after Mr. Trump later on Monday said that he would pause the tariffs on Mexico and Canada for one month. His announcement, made on his Truth Social app, came after he said Mexico President Claudia Sheinbaum agreed to send 10,000 soldiers to the border. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his nation is implementing a $1.3 billion plan to protect the border.",

      "On Saturday, Mr. Trump signed an executive order that imposes 25%\u00a0tariffs on imports\u00a0from Canada and Mexico, while adding an additional 10% levy on goods from China. Hours later, Canada responded with retaliatory tariffs of its own, while Mexico said it was also planning to issue tariffs on the U.S. as well, adding to the potential fallout from a trade war with two of the U.S.' closest trading partners.",

      "\"This development came sooner than we anticipated in our baseline forecast and will lead us to downgrade our 2025 global forecast,\" Oxford Economics wrote in a Feb. 3 research note. \"The latest set of tariffs will lead to weaker GDP growth, higher unemployment, higher interest rates, and higher inflation this year in Canada, Mexico, and the U.S. than in our January baseline forecast.\"",

      "Mr. Trump's promise of tariffs in the lead-up to the election was part of the reason the Federal Reserve dialed back the number of interest rate cuts it expected to impose this year. Originally, the central bank had projected four cuts, but slashed that number to two at their December meeting, citing still-sticky inflation that could worsen under Mr. Trump's trade and immigration policies.",

      "Wright, CEO of Denver-based Liberty Energy, has been one of the industry's loudest voices against efforts to fight climate change. He says more fossil fuel production can lift people out of poverty around the globe and has promised to help Mr. Trump \"unleash energy security and prosperity.\"",
      "The Senate approved his nomination, 59-38.",
      "The centerpiece of Mr. Trump's energy policy is \"drill, baby, drill,\" and he has pledged to dismantle what he calls Democrats' \"green new scam\" in favor of boosting production of fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal that emit planet-warming greenhouse gases.",
      "\"President Trump shares my passion for energy,\" Wright said at his confirmation hearing last month, promising that if confirmed, he would \"work tirelessly to implement [Mr. Trump's] bold agenda as an unabashed steward for all sources of affordable, reliable and secure American energy.\"",

      "Mr. Trump's energy wishes are likely to run into real-world limits, including the fact that U.S. oil production is already at record levels. The federal government cannot force companies to drill for more oil, and production increases could lower prices and reduce profits.",

      "While Wright \"acknowledges that climate change is real, he knows more American energy is the solution \u2014 not the problem,'' Barrasso said, calling Wright's \"energy realism\" welcome news.",

      "\"While we don't always agree, we will work together because none of us have four years to wait to act,\" Hickenlooper said.",
      "Sen. Michael Bennet called Wright a successful Colorado entrepreneur with deep expertise in energy innovation and technology. He pledged to work with Wright to \"ensure Colorado continues to lead the country in energy production and innovation.\"",
      "While acknowledging that climate change is real, Wright said at his hearing that he believes \"there isn't dirty energy or clean energy.\" Rather, he said, there are different sources of energy with different tradeoffs.",
      "Wright, 60, has been chair\u00a0and CEO of Liberty Energy since 2011 and has no prior experience in government. He grew up in Colorado, earned an undergraduate degree at MIT and did graduate work in electrical engineering at the University of California, Berkeley and MIT. In 1992, he founded Pinnacle Technologies, which helped launch commercial shale gas production through hydraulic fracturing, or fracking.",
      "He later served as chairman of Stroud Energy, an early shale gas producer, before founding Liberty Resources in 2010.",
      "As energy secretary, Wright will join Interior Secretary Doug Burgum as a key player on energy policy. Both will serve on a new National Energy Council that Burgum will chair. The panel will include all executive branch agencies involved in energy permitting, production, generation, distribution, regulation and transportation, with a focus on \"cutting red tape\" and boosting domestic energy production, Mr. Trump said. The council's mission represents a near-complete reversal from actions pursued by former President Joe Biden, who made fighting climate change a top priority.",

    "summary": "America's closest neighbors and allies are racing to respond, or bracing for impact as Trump orders big tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico and China.",
    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0Canadian sports fans, angry at President Trump's unilateral imposition of 25% tariffs on virtually everything imported from Canada, reacted icily to the Star-Spangled Banner as it was sung at hockey and basketball games over the weekend. Many booed the U.S. national anthem in an uncharacteristic show of frustration after more than 150 years of peaceful, friendly relations along the vast border separating the neighbors.",
      "The reaction was representative of hurt feelings both north and south of the U.S. mainland's borders on Monday. Top officials in Canada and Mexico, which both faced 25% tariffs\u00a0with the stroke of Mr. Trump's pen on Saturday, were expected to hold conversations with the White House on the way forward in a new trade war that Mr. Trump had threatened for months. Both countries vowed to respond with their own trade measures.",
      "Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum announced in a brief statement Monday on social media that, after a phone call with Mr. Trump, the tariffs imposed on her country were \"on pause for one month from now.\" She said Mr. Trump had agreed to put the measures on hold after she committed to reinforcing Mexico's border with the U.S. \"with 10,000 members of the National Guard to prevent drug trafficking from Mexico to the United States.\"",
      "Mr. Trump confirmed the pause in his own social media post, saying the newly deployed Mexican forces \"will be specifically designated to stop the flow of fentanyl, and illegal migrants into our Country.\"",
      "Sheinbaum said Mr. Trump had \"committed to working to prevent the trafficking of high-powered weapons to Mexico.\"",
      "China was also hit by a new raft of tariffs and has warned that it, too, will respond in kind. America's major allies and trade partners in Europe, meanwhile, have been warned by Mr. Trump that the European Union is next on his list, while the United Kingdom appears to have a chance to negotiate a trade deal, but will find itself torn between its next-door neighbors and its storied \"special relationship\" with the U.S. if it hopes to dodge the same fate.",
      "Canada is the biggest export market for products coming from 36 U.S. states, according to the Reuters news agency, while Mexico is broadly considered the U.S.' largest trading partner overall.",
      "Below is a look at some of the reaction from the countries now facing new U.S. tariffs, which will come into effect on Tuesday, and those which might still be hoping to avoid them.",
      "Canada:",
      "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his government had no choice but to strike back with 25% tariffs of its own on more than $150 billion worth of U.S.-made imports.",
      "\"First, I want to speak directly to Americans, our closest friends and neighbors,\" said Trudeau. \"This is a choice that, yes, will harm Canadians, but beyond that, it will have real consequences for you, the American people.\"",
      "\"Like the American tariffs, our response will also be far reaching and include everyday items such as American beer, wine and bourbon. Fruits and fruit juices including orange juice, along with vegetables, perfume, clothing and shoes. It will include major consumer products like household appliances, furniture and sports equipment, and materials like lumber and plastics, along with much, much more.\"",
      "\"Now is the time to choose products made right here in Canada,\" Trudeau added to his own constituents in a post on social media. \"Check the labels. Let's do our part. Wherever we can, choose Canada.\"",
      "The first round of Canada's tariffs will kick in at the stroke of midnight on Monday evening \u2013 on $30 billion worth of U.S. goods. In 21 days, the remainder of the tariffs, covering an additional $125 billion worth of products, will kick in unless some new agreement is reached between the countries. The delay, said Trudeau, was aimed at giving Canadian companies time to seek supply chain options to soften the financial blow.",
      "Speaking to ABC News on Sunday, Canada's Ambassador to the U.S. Kirsten Hillman said many people in her country \"just don't understand where this is coming from... and probably, there's a little bit of hurt.\"",
      "Mexico:",
      "Canada's government is now looking south of the U.S. border, hoping to band together and increase trade ties with Mexico to help both nations absorb the impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs. The two countries have agreed \"to enhance the strong bilateral relations\" they share and officials have had extensive bilateral meetings with their counterparts.",
      "President Sheinbaum, who haD already mocked Mr.Trump's move to rename the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America, said on social media before the pause was announced that countermeasures against the U.S. tariffs would soon be implemented.",
      "\"I've instructed my economy minister to implement the plan B we've been working on, which includes tariff and non-tariff measures in defense of Mexico's interests,\" Sheinbaum said, without specifying which U.S. goods her government might target, or whether she would seek to match the 25% retaliatory tariffs set to be imposed by Canada.",
      "Mexican goods exported to the U.S. are wide-ranging, and include vehicles and other auto industry components, crude oil, natural gas, avocados, tomatoes, pork and cheese.",
      "China:",
      "For Beijing, it was deja-vu. During Mr. Trump's first term, he slapped 25% tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods, then 10% on an additional $300 billion worth of imports, which meant virtually everything Chinese was tariffed.",
      "China's Ministry of Commerce released a statement over the weekend saying Beijing was \"strongly dissatisfied and firmly opposes\" the new 10% tariffs, that the U.S.'s \"unilateral increase in tariffs seriously violates WTO rules,\" and that China \"will file a lawsuit with the World Trade Organization and take corresponding countermeasures,\" which implies Beijing will impose 10% retaliatory tariffs on select U.S.-made goods.",
      "Analysts say China better prepared than ever for trade war with U.S.",
      "Analysts say China better prepared than ever for trade war with U.S.",
      "In a Sunday statement, the Chinese Foreign Ministry didn't drop any hints as to what measures might be coming, but it said called \"on the United States to correct its wrongdoings, maintain the hard-won positive dynamics in the counternarcotics cooperation, and promote a steady, sound and sustainable development of China-U.S. relationship.\"",
      "The ministry said the U.S. should \"view and solve its own fentanyl issue in an objective and rational way,\" rather than \"threatening other countries with arbitrary tariff hikes.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said he was imposing the new 10% tariff on Chinese goods in part due to what he considers Beijing's failure to stem the flow of fentanyl and chemicals used to make the drug.",
      "The foreign ministry in Beijing said China was \"one of the world's toughest countries on counternarcotics, both in terms of policy and its implementation.\"",
      "The European Union:",
      "Mr. Trump said over the weekend that tariffs on the European Union were coming, but he did not say when or how steep they would be.",
      "\"It will definitely happen with the European Union. I can tell you that because they've really taken advantage of us,\" the U.S. president told reporters Sunday. \"They don't take our cars, they don't take our farm products. They take almost nothing and we take everything from them.\"",
      "European leaders were meeting Monday in Brussels, where they were discussing how to collectively address the threat.",
      "\"We were listening carefully to those words, and of course we are preparing also on our side,\" EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said Monday in Brussels, adding a warning that \"there are no winners in trade wars.\"",
      "If the Trump administration \"starts a trade war [with Europe], then the one laughing on the side is China,\" said Kallas. \"We are very interlinked.\"",
      "Chancellor Olaf Scholz, the leader of Europe's biggest economy, Germany, said the EU was strong enough to take the blow and respond to any U.S. tariffs, but added that \"the goal should be that things result in cooperation\" within Europe.",
      "For a quick fact check on Mr. Trump's criticism: He's not wrong about the lop-sided trade relationship between the U.S. and its close allies across the Atlantic. Through November 2024, the EU ran a trade deficit of $78 billion with the U.S., according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, and reports indicate that's on track to be a new record.",
      "The question many economic analysts and politicians across the world will keep asking, however, is whether huge tariffs taxing that trade are likely to help balance the books.",
      "The United Kingdom:",
      "Speaking to reporters early on Monday, Mr. Trump said \"the U.K. is out of line but\u2026 I think that one can be worked out,\" suggesting his administration was at least willing to negotiate with London over a new bilateral trade deal.",
      "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Sunday that he had spoken with Mr. Trump and stressed that he wants \"a strong trading relationship\" with the U.S., but the U.K. leader, five years after the \"Brexit\" withdrawal from the European Union, may now find himself caught between the formidable trade forces of the EU on his doorstep and Washington.",
      "Mr. Trump's tariffs on the EU and his looming, if tempered threat to hit Britain with the same will complicate Starmer's nascent efforts to \"reset\" U.K. trade ties with the EU. He's at the helm of the U.K.'s first Labour Party government in a decade and a half, and it was the former Conservative leadership that ushered in Brexit and soured the long-standing close ties with Europe.",
      "Starmer has moved cautiously as he sets out to mend fences with the EU, wary of riling up conservative voters who supported Brexit and who, to some degree, now support populist politicians such as the Trump-aligned, anti-immigration leader of the Reform U.K. party, Nigel Farage.",
      "The prime minister has ruled out rejoining the EU customs union or its single currency market, and he's so far resisted pressure from the continent to ease post-Brexit restrictions on U.K. and EU citizens living and working on either side of the border, at least for young people.",
      "But he still needs to get U.K.-EU trade moving again, and the extent to which he chooses to keep the bloc next door at arm's length, or to try to reinstate the close trade ties of before Brexit, could directly impact his chances of nailing down a favorable new trade agreement with Washington.",
      "Speaking Monday, a spokesperson for Starmer's government called the U.K.'s trade relationship with the U.S. \"fair and balanced,\" calling Washington \"an indispensable ally and one of our closest trading partners.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump wrote Thursday that the Gaza Strip \"would be turned over to the United States by Israel at the conclusion of fighting.\"",
    "story": [
      "Some Michigan voters who either sat out the election, voted for a third-party candidate or voted for President Trump are now revisiting their decision after he proposed Tuesday that the United States \"take over\" the Gaza Strip, rebuild it and relocate Palestinians elsewhere.",
      "In the town of Dearborn, Michigan, which has the largest Muslim population per capita in the country, 43% voted for President Trump in the 2024 election. Democratic nominee Vice President Kamala Harris won 37% of the vote, substantially lower than the 68% former President Joe Biden won in 2020, according to the city's election data.",
      "Sarah Chabaan, a college senior in Dearborn who voted for Mr. Trump, said she was \"disappointed\" with his proposal but remained skeptical \"he would actually implement what he's saying.\"",
      "Asked if she regrets her vote, Chabaan said \"a little bit\" but pointed to Mr. Trump's involvement in the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas.",
      "\"Had I voted for Kamala, I think maybe the war might have still been going on. That's the unfortunate situation,\" Chabaan said.",
      "Mr. Trump's Gaza idea has been defended by White House officials, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said it was \"worthwhile really pursuing this avenue.\" But the proposal was largely panned by Arab American and Muslim organizations in the U.S. Middle Eastern countries also rejected the premise.",
      "On Thursday morning, Mr. Trump wrote that the Gaza Strip \"would be turned over to the United States by Israel at the conclusion of fighting.\" He also stated that no U.S. troops would be involved, a sticking point for congressional Republicans. He has not revealed many more specifics about the idea, which prompted immediate criticism regarding the displacement of the Palestinians, the abandonment of a two-state solution and the idea that the U.S. would control Gaza.",
      "\"The U.S., working with great development teams from all over the World, would slowly and carefully begin the construction of what would become one of the greatest and most spectacular developments of its kind on Earth,\" the president wrote. On Tuesday, he suggested it could be the \"Riviera of the Middle East.\"",
      "Harris ended up with 15,000 fewer Dearborn voters than President Biden got four years earlier. That gap contributed to Harris' overall loss in the battleground state, where Trump won by 80,103 votes.",
      "Amer Zahr, who voted third-party for president but Democratic for other offices, said many in Dearborn don't believe Mr. Trump's proposal will actually happen, and said it's \"an outrageous idea posed by someone who doesn't know what he's talking about.\"",
      "But he pinned the blame on the Democratic Party and Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign for not doing more to win over disaffected Arab American and Muslim voters. He and other Michigan residents CBS News talked to brought up Mr. Trump's visit as a candidate to Dearborn, and the lack of a Palestinian American speaker at the Democratic National Convention.",
      "Zahr suggested that while there's a \"difference in style\" between Biden and Mr. Trump on the Israel-Hamas war, they still share a \"blind support for Israel.\"",
      "\"Now, Democratic politicians and liberals are willing to stand up against it a little bit because it's not their guy anymore,\" he said. \"The real news story is that Democrats and liberals are able to reject the notion of the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians. I hope they keep doing it.\"",
      "Osami Siblani, the publisher of The Arab American News, who did not vote for any presidential candidate, said \"the vote for Trump was not really a vote for Trump.\"",
      "\"It was a vote against the Biden-Harris administration, because they could not stop the carnage from happening in Gaza,\" said Siblani. \"We did not endorse Trump. We did not endorse Harris. We actually recommended that our community not vote for the top of the ticket.\"",
      "Siblani also decried Mr. Trump's proposal to own the Gaza Strip as \"insane.\"",
      "\"The people whose homes were burnt in L.A. because of the fire, they're gonna just leave it? Or they're gonna rebuild it and live there? People do not leave their lands.\"",
      "Much of Gaza has been decimated by Israeli military strikes that began after the Hamas terrorist attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. Over the past two weeks, about 200,000 displaced Palestinians returned to the northern part of the Gaza Strip after Israel authorized their movement as part of the ceasefire agreement with Hamas.",
      "Zaynah Jadallah, a Palestinian American and director at the Council of American Islamic Relation's (CAIR) Michigan chapter, said it was \"very dehumanizing\" for Palestinians to hear Gaza referred to as \"a piece of property, or talking about it like an opportunity for a real estate or an investment when it's their land.\"",
      "Other Michigan Arab American and Palestinian leaders condemned Mr. Trump's proposal, too. Abdullah Hammoud, the mayor of Dearborn, wrote that Trump's proposal \"is yet another chapter in the ongoing genocide.\"",
      "Dawud Walid, the executive director of the CAIR Michigan chapter, said \"any forced displacement of Palestinians in their land would be ethnic cleansing.\"",
      "\"Perhaps some people right now in our community are second guessing their vote for Trump,\" he added.",

      "Panama City\u00a0\u2014 Panamanian President Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino on Thursday denied the U.S. State Department's claim that his country had reached a deal to allow U.S. warships to transit the Panama Canal for free.",
      "Mulino said he had told U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth on Wednesday that he could neither set the fees to transit the canal nor exempt anyone from them and that he was surprised by the U.S. State Department's statement suggesting otherwise late Wednesday.",
      "\"I completely reject that statement yesterday,\" Mulino said during his weekly press conference, adding that he had asked Panama's ambassador in Washington to dispute the State Department's statement.",
      "On Wednesday evening, the U.S. State Department said in a social media post: \"U.S. government vessels can now transit the Panama Canal without charge fees, saving the U.S. government millions of dollars a year.\" The department had no immediate comment Thursday on Mulino's remarks.",
      "The Panama Canal Authority put out its own terse statement later Wednesday night saying it had \"not made any adjustments\" to the fees, adding that it was \"willing to establish a dialogue with the pertinent officials from the United States in regards to the transit of U.S. Navy ships.\"",
      "Mulino said the U.S. statement \"really surprises me because they're making an important, institutional statement from the entity that governs United States foreign policy under the president of the United States based on a falsity. And that's intolerable.\"",
      "The differing versions came just days after U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with Mulino and canal administrators and visited the critical trade route. He had carried a message from President Trump that China's influence at the canal was unacceptable, as the Trump administration makes a push for U.S. control of the canal, which it says it needs for America's economic security.",
      "The Panama Canal serves as a shortcut between the Pacific Ocean and the Atlantic Ocean. And although the U.S. led the construction of the major waterway that around 40% of the world's cargo ship traffic now moves through, its control was given to Panama in 1999.",
      "In their meeting, Rubio told the Panamanian leader that Mr. Trump had determined that China's influence on the canal constituted \"a threat to the canal and represents a violation of the Treaty Concerning the Permanent Neutrality and Operation of the Panama Canal,\" a spokesperson said in a statement.",
      "Mulino has refuted those claims, and he said Thursday that both Panama's constitution and laws regulating the Canal Authority make clear that neither the government nor the authority can waive fees.",

The move came\u00a0after President Trump pardoned about 1,500 Jan. 6 defendants immediately after taking office.",
      "The FBI subsequently turned over a list of about 5,000 individuals, which included information such as employee ID numbers and titles.",
      "However, lawsuits\u00a0filed by two groups of anonymous FBI agents resulted in a federal judge in Washington, D.C., on Thursday temporarily blocking the Justice Department from disclosing information about those agents to any other federal entity or outside group until further arguments are heard in the case.",

He was involved in writing the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 and worked as policy director for the 2024 Republican National Committee's platform committee.",
      "Overnight, more than a dozen Senate Democrats took to the floor, delivering scathing critiques of Vought's nomination in the wake of an OMB memo last week that sent shockwaves through the political sphere and beyond, directing all agencies to temporarily pause federal assistance. On Monday, a federal judge ordered the Trump administration to temporarily stop its freeze on federal assistance. But Democrats have seized on the move, which added fuel to their effort to stall Vought's confirmation.",
      "\"It may be back online, but no one knows whether that's for sure, because Russel Vought and Donald Trump think they may be above the law,\" Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat said Wednesday night.",

      "\"All 47 Democrats are opposed to Vought's nomination,\" Schumer said. \"His confirmation would be a disaster for working families, and a godsend to billionaires who don't pay their fair share in taxes.\"",
      "But Vought's confirmation was expected, after his nomination advanced Wednesday in a 53-47 party line vote that limited debate to up to 30 hours, which Democrats were eager to use. Democrats also voiced their opposition to Vought during the vote, though rules prohibit debate during voting.",
      "Vought will oversee the president's proposed budget while being responsible for executing Mr. Trump's agenda across the federal government. The broad oversight prompted Sen. Patty Murray, a Washington Democrat, to plead with senators to vote against Vought, saying \"We should not entrust someone to implement our laws\" who has made clear \"that he will not follow the law.\"",
      "Murray cited Vought's effort to \"give Trump unilateral authority\" to hold up security assistance to Ukraine during his first administration and override Congress' spending decisions, adding that more recently Vought has \"mapped out a lawless path\" that \"President Trump is already barreling down at full speed.\"",
      "The OMB withheld more than $200 million in security assistance to Ukraine when Vought previously served as director, which was later determined to be a violation of the Impoundment Control Act, which limits the president's ability to unilaterally freeze certain funds appropriated by Congress.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota praised Vought on Wednesday, citing his previous experience in the role, saying \"There's no question that he will be able to hit the ground running.\"",

      "Vought, in his opening statement to the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee last month, said that \"we have to use taxpayer dollars wisely\" because \"inflation driven by irresponsible federal spending taxes Americans twice.\"",
      "Vought said if confirmed, he would continue to strive to \"ensure every decision contributes to a more prosperous future for all Americans.\"",

      "Trump's claim mischaracterizes the federal government's spending on subscriptions.",
      "Data from USAspending.gov, a government website that tracks federal spending, shows government agencies collectively spent more than $8 million combined in payments for Politico subscriptions and products in 2024. This includes $24,000 spent by the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID, on subscriptions.",
      "The subscriptions, which include Politico Pro or E&E News by Politico, offer paywalled content including policy tracking and exclusive reporting. Data show federal agencies also paid for subscriptions to other news outlets in 2024, including The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal.",
      "On Wednesday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt announced that Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency was working to cancel all government subscriptions to Politico. Leavitt specifically criticized spending by USAID, the humanitarian aid agency that President Trump and Musk have targeted for funding cuts.",
      "\"I was made aware of the funding from USAID to media outlets, including Politico who has a seat in the room. I can confirm the more than $8 million taxpayer dollars have gone to essentially subsidizing subscriptions to Politico on the taxpayer's dime will no longer be happening,\" Leavitt said.",
      "Data from USAspending.gov shows of the $8 million spent on payments for Politico products in 2024, the Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Interior and Department of Energy each paid over $1 million in 2024. USAID paid $24,000 for Politico subscriptions in the 2024 fiscal year, up from $20,000 the previous year.",
      "In a letter to staff on Wednesday, Politico's editor-in-chief John Harris said, \"POLITICO has never been a beneficiary of government programs or subsidies \u2014 not one cent, ever, in 18 years.\" Harris also wrote that \"the overwhelming majority\" of Politico Pro subscriptions come from the private sector.",
      "Additionally, congressional records show both Republicans and Democrats and the committees they lead paid for Politico subscriptions in the last year.",
      "The office of Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert, who accused Politico of \"grift\" on social media Wednesday, paid more than $7,000 to Politico LLC for \"publications and reference material\" according to the House Statement of Disbursement for the first quarter of 2024.",
      "The same records show the Office of the Speaker of the House paid over $9,000 and the Republican-led House Committee on Energy and Finance paid over $58,000 to Politico LLC that quarter.",

      "Mr. Trump's comments during a joint press conference with Netanyahu where he outlined a new vision for Gaza, saying the U.S. would \"own it,\" sent diplomatic shockwaves around the world.",
      "Netanyahu, who praised Mr. Trump for having unconventional ideas, met Thursday with Senate Majority Leader John Thune and a bipartisan group of senators. Thune told reporters Wednesday in response to Mr. Trump's announcement that the president \"wants to bring a more peaceful and secure Middle East, and he's putting some ideas out there.\"",
      "Appearing alongside the group of senators before the meeting, Netanyahu was asked whether U.S. troops are needed in Gaza, to which he replied, \"no.\"",
      "Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, told reporters after leaving the meeting that what Mr. Trump proposed \"simply has no legs.\"",
      "\"There's general consensus that a forced evacuation of the Palestinians and United States troops on the ground are both unserious proposals as first articulated by President Trump and that they're nonstarters, essentially,\" Blumenthal said.",
      "Thune reiterated his support for Israel earlier in the week, saying at the Senate GOP weekly news conference that \"Israel is our closest ally in the Middle East,\" while criticizing Democrats for boycotting Netanyahu's remarks at the Capitol in the past \u2014 and blocking a measure to sanction the International Criminal Court over the decision to seek the arrests of top Israeli officials, including Netanyahu, over alleged war crimes.",
      "\"Republicans are here and ready when the Democrats decide it's time to actually work in the interest of, in defending America's greatest ally in the Middle East, Israel. Republicans have been consistent in doing that for the last year through the war with Hamas, Democrats have not,\" Thune said. \"We are ready to go to work and ensure that our allies' interests all around the world are protected, and we hope at some point to have the Democrats join us in that effort.\"",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson's meeting with Netanyahu was rescheduled to Friday morning after Johnson's meeting at the White House ran long on Thursday.

    "published": "Thu, 06 Feb 2025 18:27:15 -0500",
    "summary": "A group of unnamed FBI agents and the FBI Agents Association are seeking to prevent the Justice Department from disclosing a list of names of bureau employees who were tied to Jan. 6 probes.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge in Washington, D.C., on Thursday temporarily prevented the Justice Department from disclosing information about FBI agents who fear they will be targeted because of their work on cases involving President Trump and the Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol.",
      "U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb ordered that the Justice Department may not disclose the list of FBI agents who worked on the investigations to anyone outside the department \u2014 which would include any other federal entity or outside group, as well as public disclosure \u2014 until she hears arguments Friday as to whether to issue a temporary restraining order sought by unnamed FBI agents and the FBI Agents Association in a pair of cases brought earlier this week.",
      "Cobb's decision comes after an hourslong hearing, during which the Justice Department and lawyers for the agents discussed an order governing the potential disclosure of names of FBI personnel who were involved in the Jan. 6 cases, which was compiled by the bureau and turned over to the Justice Department this week.",
      "She said in her order, \"The government has represented that the information at issue in this case has not been shared outside of the DOJ.\"",
      "The brief hold will remain in place until the two sides reconvene for the continuation of the hearing or reach an agreement on the terms of the order.",
      "Cobb, who sits on the federal district court in Washington and was nominated for her seat by former President Biden in 2021, said during the hearing that if the list of names was to be released overnight, FBI agents could face \"significant and immediate danger.\"",
      "The challenge stemmed from a memorandum issued by Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove last week that directed the FBI to provide lists of current and former personnel assigned at any time to investigations and prosecutions related to the attack on the U.S. Capitol.",
      "The department required the FBI to turn over the information by Tuesday, and the bureau complied with the deadline, the Justice Department said. FBI Acting Director Brian Driscoll said in a message to the bureau that the data it provided identified employees by their Unique Employee Identifier, current title, title at the time of the Jan. 6 investigation, the office where they are currently assigned, role in the investigation of prosecution and date of last activity related to the probes.",
      "Mr. Trump has nominated Kash Patel, a close ally of the president's, to lead the FBI, but the Senate has not yet voted on his confirmation.",
      "A lawyer representing the unnamed FBI agents and employees said that were it not for Driscoll turning over identification numbers, the government would have a list of the names of agents who worked on Jan. 6 cases. The Justice Department also has information compiled through surveys sent to certain FBI employees about their activities related to the Jan. 6 investigations, including the extent of their roles, she warned.",
      "\"We are one step away from those names getting released,\" the lawyer said, adding that it will be \"irreparable\" if they are disclosed.",
      "The lawyer said a chief concern is the names of the FBI personnel could be leaked to a third party or published by the Trump administration.",
      "\"Our argument is that the threat to national security is so extreme that we cannot risk letting it happen first and then trying to put it back together,\" she said.",
      "The lawyer noted that since Mr. Trump returned to the White House, billionaire Elon Musk, through the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, has made public the names of other government employees. She also said that some Jan. 6 defendants who were granted clemency by Mr. Trump have also suggested on social media that they would target FBI agents.",
      "Mark Zaid, who is representing some of the unnamed FBI employees, estimated there are between 5,000 and 6,000 whose information was turned over to the Justice Department.",
      "A Justice Department lawyer, Jeremy Simon, went back and forth with Cobb about the language of a potential court order that would temporarily bar the Justice Department from disclosing without notice the list of FBI agents tied to Jan. 6 cases to entities and people outside of the department.",
      "Asked whether any other government agency intends to release that information while the court considers a motion for a preliminary injunction, Simon said he was not in a position to make representations about agencies outside of the Justice Department.",
      "Simon also declined to definitively confirm the names hadn't been shared outside of the Justice Department, telling the judge that there has not been an \"official disclosure.\"",
      "The Justice Department has argued in a court filing that it was seeking information about FBI employees who worked on Jan. 6 cases to start a review process in conjunction with Mr. Trump's executive order aimed at ending what he calls the weaponization of the federal government.",
      "Government lawyers argued in a court filing Thursday morning that they believed there should not be a temporary restraining order implemented because of \"speculation involving future predictions of potential harm\" \u2014 not actual harm in the eyes of the government \u2014 and the FBI agents' \"speculative\" belief that the list of agents may be leaked outside of the department.",
      "Bove, meanwhile, sought to assuage concerns that agents could be retaliated against in an email disseminated to the FBI on Wednesday, writing that \"no FBI employee who simply followed orders and carried out their duties in an ethical manner with respect to the January 6 investigations is at risk of termination or other penalties.\"",
      "The deputy attorney general, who served as a defense lawyer to Mr. Trump, wrote that \"the only individuals who should be concerned about the process initiated by my January 31, 2025, memo are those who acted with corrupt or partisan intent, who blatantly defied orders from Department leadership, or who exercised discretion in weaponizing the FBI.\"",
      "In their request for a temporary restraining order, the FBI agents argued the Justice Department is planning to take \"adverse employment actions\" and make public the names and identities of those targeted. One group of seven FBI agents and the FBI Agents Association said the disclosure would harm them, their colleagues and families, \"all but guaranteeing they will face threats of physical harm and emotional harassment in violation of their First Amendment and Due Process rights.\"",
      "Lawyers for the FBI agents wrote in their request that the Justice Department is seeking to retaliate against them by making public their identities \"simply because those individuals honorably performed their duties in connection with sensitive law enforcement investigations.\"",
      "\"Such acts are unconscionable, dangerous to the American public and illegal under the U.S. Constitution and numerous federal laws,\" they wrote.",
      "But Justice Department lawyers said the agents' request is based on a \"speculation involving future predictions of potential harm related to the information provided.\"",
      "\"Plaintiffs can point to nothing that suggests the government intends to make public the list in this case,\" they wrote in a filing. \"To the contrary, the department and FBI management have repeatedly stressed the purpose of the list is to conduct an internal review, not expose dedicated special agents to public insult or ridicule.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Thursday temporarily blocked the Office of Personnel Management's deadline for federal employees to accept the Trump administration's \"deferred resignation\" offer.",
      "U.S. District Judge George O'Toole prevented the agency from implementing the program's deadline during a brief hearing held hours before federal workers were required to notify OPM of whether they would accept or reject the offer to step away from their positions.",
      "A Justice Department lawyer said OPM would provide notice to federal employees that the deadline is paused pending further legal proceedings. The agency said that it is extending the deadline for federal employees to accept the deferred resignation offer to Monday at 11:59 p.m. ET in compliance with the court's order.",
      "\"The program is not being blocked or canceled. The government will honor the deferred resignation offer,\" OPM said.",
      "Lee Saunders, president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, one of the unions challenging the Trump administration's program, said the decision is a \"great first step.\"",
      "\"We all depend on federal workers to keep our communities safe, healthy and strong, and politics should never get between them and the essential services they provide,\" he said in a statement. \"They deserve to be treated with respect for their public service. We look forward to presenting our full case in the days to come.\"",
      "The White House personnel office sent out an email last week with the subject line \"Fork in the Road\" that offered the more than 2 million federal employees \"deferred resignation.\" Under the program, they could resign their positions and retain full pay and benefits until Sept 30. Federal workers who agreed to resign would also be exempt from in-person work requirements through September, the email stated.",
      "Employees previously had until Feb. 6 to accept or reject the offer. The program is not available to members of the military, U.S. Postal Service employees or those whose work is related to immigration and national security, according to OPM.",
      "For those who opted to keep their positions, the message from OPM noted that the Trump administration could not give \"full assurance regarding the certainty of your position or agency.\" It also noted that \"the majority of federal agencies are likely to be downsized through restructurings, realignments, and reductions in force\" as part of Mr. Trump's efforts to reform the federal workforce.",
      "In a list of \"frequently asked questions\" about the offer, the agency said workers who accept the proposed buyout would not be expected to work at their government job during the deferred resignation period and would be allowed to get a second job.",
      "Roughly 40,000 federal workers \u2014 or about 2% of the government workforce \u2014 have accepted the deal, according to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt. But the White House expects that number to rise.",
      "Leavitt said in response to the order that the Trump administration is \"grateful to the judge for extending the deadline so more federal workers who refuse to show up to the office can take the administration up on this very generous, once-in-a-lifetime offer.\"",
      "Days after OPM put forth its offer, a group of four unions that represent more than 800,000 federal employees sued the agency and its acting director, Charles Ezell, arguing the so-called Fork Directive, as the unions call it, violates federal law.",
      "\"If these employees leave or are forced out en masse, the country will suffer a dangerous one-two punch,\" the unions said in their complaint. \"First, the government will lose expertise in the complex fields and programs that Congress has, by statute, directed the Executive to faithfully implement. The government will have fewer qualified employees to execute the statutorily-required tasks that still remain. And second, when vacant positions become politicized, as this administration seeks to do, partisanship is elevated over ability and truth, to the detriment of agency missions and the American people.\"",
      "They noted that funding for federal agencies is set to expire March 14, and there is no appropriation in place from Congress to cover the salaries of government workers after that date.",
      "They asked the judge to block OPM from implementing the Feb. 6 deadline.",
      "The subject line of the OPM email is the same as a 2022 email that billionaire Elon Musk sent to employees of Twitter, the social media platform he purchased that year and renamed X. The White House has said Musk is working in the Trump administration as a \"special government employee\" leading the White House's Department of Government Efficiency,\u00a0or DOGE, which President Trump established with the goal of cutting spending and restructuring federal agencies.",
      "The proposed buyout offered by the Trump administration has raised concerns from employment lawyers, as components of it are unclear and lack guarantees, several told CBS News. It's also not clear the Trump administration has the authority to create such a program, as the unions have alleged in their legal challenge.",
      "A dozen state attorneys general have also cautioned federal employees against accepting what they said is a \"misleading\" offer to resign.",
      "The deferred resignation program is one of several initiatives undertaken Mr. Trump since he returned to the White House that aims to slash the size of the federal government. The president ordered\u00a0millions of federal workers to return to the office full-time and directed agencies to end remote work arrangements.",
      "His administration has also taken aim at the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID,\u00a0placing nearly all of its staff on leave and ordering its overseas missions to shut down.",

Essential to that progress, Sierra Leone's civil service advocates believe, is nurturing democracy and human rights. Fatorma's grassroots campaign was granted $1 million in U.S. funding in 2023 to continue work on those goals.",
      "Around two years later the project \u2014 which promoted meaningful participation of all citizens in their political systems, expanded the reach of civic education and encouraged female aspirants to run for office \u2014 ended last week when Secretary of State Marco Rubio ordered a pause on all new U.S. foreign assistance programs funded by the State Department and USAID. Almost all of the agency's workers are being put on leave.",
      "\"It came as a shock, and devastating,\" said Fatorma\u00a0from his office in Freetown, Sierra Leone's capital. He added the loss created \"a gap\" in funding and a \"vacuum in governance\" that he said Russia or China could rush to fill.",
      "USAID managed more than $40 billion in appropriations in 2023, according to the Congressional Research Service, a figure that is less than 1% of the federal budget. A large portion of the funding is awarded to U.S. organizations that grant monies to local partners or grassroots groups, which implement the projects in their respective countries.",

      "Freedom Collaborative, a global network of about 3,000 advocates against trafficking, had 80% of its budget cut after receiving a stop-work order last week, said CEO Julia Macher, who is based in Berlin.

      "Macher said since the freeze on federal funding, her group had been contacted by at least 50 partners. In a Freedom Collaborative newsletter, Macher cited organizations in the Balkans that provide direct services to survivors and in Thailand where workers in shelters don't have funds to pay for essentials like food, medical care and transportation. The work of\u00a0Cambodia's Chab Dai, a USAID-funded survivor support program, has been put on hold, affecting nine staff members and dozens of survivors, Freedom Collaborative said.",
      "The situation is especially dire for groups in Latin America, the newsletter said, including an organization in Ecuador that had to let go of 11 staff members working with migrants and trafficked individuals, and groups in Colombia that had to halt all their operations.",
      "Funding for this type of complex work \u2014 often done at great personal risk to local staff and victims \u2014 is already very difficult to secure. Often, the U.S. government would be the only donor willing to provide funds, Macher said. She stressed that the benefits of these programs reach far beyond the individuals receiving assistance.",
      "\"It helps with global stability, and that is the larger argument,\" she said. \"The work helps reduce organized crime. And if there is no response or watching these crime groups, they can start expanding, and that is very scary because then it's a ripple effect. It's not just about the humanitarian aspect.\"",

    "story": [
      "Millions of federal workers have more time to ponder their next career move after a judge on Thursday temporarily suspended the Office of Personnel Management's deadline for them to accept or reject the agency's\u00a0\"deferred resignation\" offer.",
      "The cutoff to take the deal had been set to expire at on Thursday at midnight Eastern time before the ruling from U.S. District Judge George O'Toole barred the OPM from implementing the deadline. A Justice Department lawyer said the agency, which sent the original offer, would notify government employees that the deadline is paused pending further legal proceedings.",
      "\"In compliance with the court order, the deadline for federal employees to accept the deferred resignation program is being extended to Monday, Feb. 10, at 11:59 p.m. EST,\" the OPM said in a social media post. \"The program is NOT being blocked or canceled. The government will honor the deferred resignation offer.\"",
      "Under the OPM's offer, employees who accepted it would continue getting paid through September but would be excused from reporting for workers. But if they opted to keep their jobs, they could get fired.",
      "That decision, one affecting the careers and livelihoods of 2.3 million civilian federal employees, is a fraught one, employment attorneys and government watchdogs said. In part, that's because the offer includes a number of provisions that are unclear and not guaranteed, posing financial and professional risks while leaving workers in danger of not getting what they signed up for, experts told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The Trump administration also may lack authority to extend such a deal, and as such the deferred resignation allegedly breaks numerous laws, a Feb. 4 lawsuit filed by several federal employee unions alleges. The plaintiffs in that suit are asking a court to block the government's offer, which they describe as \"arbitrary, capricious\" and in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, a 1946 law governing how federal agencies implement regulations.",
      "The deferred resignation offer is the brainchild of the second Trump administration, which has ordered federal workers to return to the office five days a week\u00a0while directing government agencies to end remote work arrangements. The White House expects to persuade up to roughly 10% of the federal civilian workforce to resign, saving $100 billion a year in costs.",
      "The offer isn't available to members of the armed forces, U.S. Postal Service workers, and those who work in jobs related to immigration enforcement and national security,\u00a0according\u00a0to the OPM.",
      "Through Feb. 5, about 40,000 federal workers had accepted the deal, or some 2% of the federal workforce, according to a CBS News source familiar with the matter.",
      "\"We encourage federal workers in this city to accept the very generous offer,\" White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said Thursday around the time of Judge O'Toole's ruling. \"They don't want to come into the office. If they want to rip the American people off, then they're welcome to take this buyout and we'll find highly qualified people\" to replace them.",
      "Risks to workers",
      "OPM's offer includes many gray areas that could present pitfalls to employees who accept it, legal sources and union officials said.",
      "\"There is a risk for employees to take this without knowing what would happen down the line,\" said Ryan Nerney, managing partner at law firm Tully Rinckey and an expert on federal employment law. \"If you decide to take this, and let's say there's a reduction in force and your job is eliminated, there is no guidance on what would happen in a circumstance like that. Would you still get paid through Sept. 30?\"",
      "The agency's email lacks specifics and guarantees about the offer, adding to government workers' confusion, Doreen Greenwald, president of the National Treasury Employees Union, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"It's very confusing \u2014 it says you won't have to do your position duties anymore, but there is a caveat that says if they need you, you have to keep doing that,\" Greenwald said, referring to the resignation letter that says employees aren't expected to work except in \"rare circumstances.\"",
      "A dozen state attorneys general around the country have also cautioned federal workers about accepting the offer, describing it as \"misleading\" and urging employees to closely scrutinize the terms.",
      "Elon Musk's \"Fork in the Road\"",
      "Federal workers received the Trump administration's offer in an email last month entitled \"A Fork in the Road,\" mirroring the subject line of a 2022 message\u00a0sent by billionaire Elon Musk to employees at Twitter, the social media platform he bought in October 2022 and later renamed X.",
      "Like Twitter's earlier deal, OPM's offer includes a demand that federal workers make a decision by a specific date. In his 2022 email, Musk told Twitter employees they had one day to decide to either agree to work in a \"hardcore\" style or quit and get three months of severance.",
      "Musk is spearheading the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, a nongovernmental task force tasked by President Trump with slashing federal costs. The Tesla CEO has touted the government's deferred resignation offer on X, claiming that employees who accept it can do \"whatever you like, including obtaining a new job\" while receiving government pay and benefits through September.",
      "Although that could strike some workers like a good deal, the unions' lawsuit claims OPM may not have the financial authority to make that offer. For instance, the agency's email states it will pay workers who agree to resign by Feb. 6 through Sept. 30, but funding for most federal agencies expires on March 14.",
      "That indicates the Trump administration is planning to spend money \"before an appropriation is authorized,\" the suit claims. If so, that could violate The Antideficiency Act, a law that prohibits federal agencies from spending above their appropriated levels, the complaint alleges.",
      "The deferred resignation offer allegedly also violates the Administrative Procedure Act, the lawsuit claims. That law says courts can find government agency actions to be unlawful if they are \"arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\"",
      "It's also not clear what could happen to federal workers who accept the offer if it is then found to be illegal by the courts, said Robert Weissman, co-president of government watchdog group Public Citizen. \"I could imagine going back to work and being told you did not work, and we're not going to pay you for an illegal program,\" he said.",
      "Government employees should \"be skeptical about what is actually going to be delivered through this offer,\" Weissman added.",
      "Impact on federal services?",
      "The offer also fails to consider the impact of widespread resignations on the government's ability to provide services to Americans, the union suit alleges. Twitter (now X) suffered from a number of issues after Musk cut the majority of its workforce, including a decline in advertisers and sharp drop in its valuation, the complaint states.",
      "A sweeping job-cutting measure could cause chaos if government agencies lacked enough staff to handle some services such as tax refund processing, Social Security verification, or providing health care through Medicaid and Medicare, experts say.",
      "\"There is no 10% across-the-board slush fund of employees that [the public] would not feel any harm by this,\" Greenwald said. \"The federal government is not Twitter \u2014 it is funded by Congress and budgeted by that process, and it is set to uphold the laws that Congress has passed.\"",
      "Federal employee unions are also chafing at the OPM's nine-day window for workers to make a decision, with the lawsuit calling it \"an arbitrary date ... selected to put maximum pressure on the federal workforce so that they would accept the offer, in many cases contrary to federal agency and federal employee interests.\"",
      "Giving federal employees just over a week to make a weighty career decision is a departure from previous voluntary resignation offers, with buyouts in the Clinton administration providing one year for workers to accept a deal, the lawsuit points out.",
      "Still, despite the unknowns in OPM's offer, it might make sense for some government workers, such as people who were already planning to retire soon, Nerney said.",

    "published": "Thu, 06 Feb 2025 17:59:50 -0500",
    "summary": "House Republicans met for several hours with Trump Thursday, after GOP senators planned move forward with their own plan to enact Trump's priorities.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Speaker Mike Johnson urged his Senate GOP colleagues to wait for the House to \"do its work\" to advance President Trump's agenda. He and House Republicans met with Mr. Trump for several hours Thursday to discuss the budget reconciliation process central to approving key components of the measure, which is expected, among other things, to extend and expand the 2017 tax cuts enacted in his first term.",
      "The speaker said after the White House meeting that Republicans would meet again Thursday night to \"finish up some final details\" and said their intention is to produce a resolution for the House Budget Committee to mark up potentially as early as next week.",
      "\"So our message to our friends and colleagues in the Senate is, 'Allow the House to do its work,'\" Johnson told reporters at the Capitol.",
      "The White House meeting came after Senate Republicans announced Wednesday that they\u00a0intended to move forward\u00a0with their own plan next week, since the House efforts to start the budget reconciliation process have stalled. Senate Republicans are expected to meet with Mr. Trump Friday night at Mar-a-Lago.",
      "Johnson sounded upbeat and described the meeting with Trump as \"very good\" and \"very productive\" and included a large cross-section of Republicans from the committees that will have jurisdiction on the legislation.",
      "Though he declined to offer details of the plan, he said there may be some announcements Friday. He praised the president for \"leaning in and doing what he does best, and that is put a steady hand at the wheel and get everybody working.\"",
      "House Majority Leader Steve Scalise added that Republicans \"are narrowing down the areas of differences\" after a lot of \"give and take\" among the members who attended the White House meeting Thursday. He, too, praised the president's involvement.",
      "\"We obviously have to go talk to other groups within our conference now, but, but we made serious progress, and have narrowed the gap to where we're very close to getting ready to bring this to Budget Committee,\" Scalise told reporters.",
      "He confirmed that the group discussed some of the most polarizing items being considered for inclusion in the legislation: state and local tax cap reform, known as the SALT tax, and the debt ceiling. Scalise said members made progress but didn't arrive at a resolution on either front.",
      "The White House and Republican leaders in Congress are pursuing a number of legislative priorities through the budget reconciliation process, including approving resources to bolster border security, extending 2017 tax cuts, incentivizing domestic manufacturing and investing in American energy, while working to pare government programs and address the debt limit.",
      "Though Republican leaders are generally united on the priorities, disagreement on the process has bogged down progress.",
      "Until Wednesday, Senate Republicans had deferred to the House to kick off the process, though they generally advocated for separating the priorities into two bills \u2014 one focused on border security while stressing that the tax legislation would take time to write and should come later.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters during the meeting that the president emphasized to lawmakers that his priorities included his no tax on tips or overtime pay proposals, no taxes on seniors' Social Security benefits, renewing the 2017 tax cuts and adjusting the state and local tax deduction cap, known as the SALT cap, among other items.",
      "\"This will be the largest tax cut in history for middle class working Americans,\" Leavitt said. \"The president is committed to working with Congress to get this done.\"",
      "Under the budget reconciliation process, Congress can avoid the 60-vote threshold typically required in the Senate. But the complicated maneuver requires that lawmakers first approve a budget resolution, and the House has faced a backlash from conservatives in recent days over the budget measure.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration's objective is to send groups of unauthorized migrants from the U.S. mainland to Guantanamo each day, using military aircraft to airlift and relocate detainees.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 U.S. government officials are moving rapidly to fulfill President Trump's orders to turn the American naval base at Guantanamo Bay into a massive immigration detention complex, making plans to send daily flights there with migrant detainees, two U.S. officials familiar with the deliberations told CBS News Thursday.",
      "So far, two U.S. military flights have been sent to Guantanamo Bay this week with fewer than two dozen migrant detainees who officials said have alleged ties to the notorious Venezuelan prison gang, Tren de Aragua, which is expected to be labeled a foreign terrorist group at Mr. Trump's direction.",
      "But the administration's objective is to send groups of unauthorized migrants from the U.S. mainland to Guantanamo each day, using military aircraft to airlift and relocate the detainees, the U.S. officials said, requesting anonymity to discuss internal plans that have not been formally announced.",
      "More migrant detainee flights to Guantanamo are planned for Friday and the weekend, one of the officials said.",
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem is planning to visit Guantanamo on Friday to assess officials' efforts to set up and prepare enough detention space to hold as many as 30,000 migrants, as the president called for in an executive order last week, sources familiar with the plans said.",
      "Military service members at the Naval Base have been setting up tents to act as holding sites with the goal of building enough for 2,000 migrants as part of an initial phase, though the alleged Venezuelan gang members transported to Guantanamo this week have been classified as \"high-threat\" detainees and held in cells inside the base's high-security prison. A separate part of the prison, created after the 9/11 attacks, also houses more than a dozen terrorism suspects.",
      "The plans illustrate how quickly and aggressively the administration is moving to transform Guantanamo Bay, a 45-square-mile stretch of Cuban land the U.S. has leased for over a century, into a focal point of Mr. Trump's plans to oversee the largest deportation operation in American history.",
      "Representatives for DHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Being able to house thousands \u2014 and potentially, tens of thousands \u2014 of migrants in Guantanamo Bay would be a significant breakthrough for the Trump administration's mass deportation goals. While deportation officers have increased immigration arrests operations across the country in Mr. Trump's first weeks in office, the government is running out of space to house them.",
      "This week, Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facilities reached 109% capacity, forcing the agency to release some migrant detainees after fitting them with ankle monitors.",
      "ICE has been scrambling to find additional detention space, making plans to set up as many as 18 new facilities within its own network of county jails and for-profit prisons, which currently have about 38,000 beds. On Tuesday morning, ICE had 42,000 detainees in custody.",
      "The agency is also asking other federal agencies and local law enforcement officials, like county sheriffs, to provide detention space. ICE has been permitted to use a Denver-area Space Force base to house its detainees, and other military sites are being considered for migrant detention. The agency is also considering using Border Patrol facilities, currently well under capacity due to a sharp drop in illegal border crossings, to hold those arrested in the U.S. interior.",
      "Still, the effort to convert the naval base in Guantanamo into a large-scale migrant holding site is already facing legal and operational challenges.",
      "Finding and mobilizing sufficient security guards to supervise the migrant detainees has been an issue limiting transfers to the base, the two U.S. officials said.",
      "For days, officials across federal agencies argued over who would have legal custody of the migrant detainees and what their legal rights would be, officials said. Ultimately, it was decided that ICE would continue to have legal custody over the detainees in Guantanamo Bay, pending their deportation.",
      "But it's unclear how long migrants will be detained in Guantanamo. The U.S. has not carried out deportations to Venezuela for a while due to frosty relations with the regime in Caracas. Mr. Trump recently announced a deportation deal with Venezuela's government, but it has not been implemented yet.",
      "The Trump administration and the government of President Nayib Bukele are forging an agreement that would allow the U.S. to deport non-Salvadoran migrants to El Salvador, including suspected Venezuelan gang members. But that arrangement also has not been finalized yet.",
      "For decades, under Democratic and Republican presidents alike, the U.S. has housed some migrants in the Guantanamo base. But that policy, until now, only applied to migrants intercepted at sea who were undergoing interviews to be resettled in third countries like Canada and Australia. Those migrants have been housed in a barrack-like facility that is separate from the newly-erected tents.",

It has to be programs that we can explain. It has to be programs that we can justify. Otherwise, we do endanger foreign aid,\" Rubio told about 200 staffers at the U.S. Embassy in Guatemala City, according to a partial transcript of his remarks obtained Wednesday by CBS News.",
      "\"This is not about politics, but foreign aid is the least popular thing government spends money on,\" Rubio added. \"And I spent a lot of time in my career defending it and explaining it, but it's harder and harder to do across the board \u2014 it really is. But for those of us in charge of doing the work of foreign policy, we understand it is essential.\"",
      "The State Department and embassy did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Over 14 years in the U.S. Senate, Rubio served at different times as top Republican on the Foreign Relations and Intelligence committees and became a lead GOP voice on foreign policy matters.",
      "This week he is on his first overseas mission, a five-day tour of Central America and the Caribbean that is designed to reinforce his belief that the U.S. needs to more directly engage its closest neighbors as it seeks to curb illegal immigration and the trade of illicit drugs.",
      "The trip has coincided with a dramatic overhaul of the U.S. Agency for International Development that came to a head last weekend as Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency confronted top agency officials, seeking to learn more about the scope of foreign aid. President Trump signed an executive order Monday essentially folding the agency's functions into the State Department and named Rubio its acting administrator.",
      "As part of the overhaul, USAID staff were told Tuesday that most staff would be placed on leave Friday night, with exceptions for \"mission-critical functions, core leadership and specially designated programs.\"",
      "Wednesday morning, when Rubio met with embassy personnel in Guatemala, he was asked by the head of USAID in Guatemala about the future of the agency.",
      "\"That's a question that deserves a straight and honest answer, and I'll give it to you,\" Rubio said, according to the transcript.",
      "He said he is hoping to choose all \"specially designated programs\" by Friday amid a broader review of all foreign aid.",
      "The secretary said he is now seeking input directly from ambassadors around the globe after receiving a list of USAID programs in Guatemala from U.S. Ambassador Tobin Bradley early Wednesday. But he also faulted agency officials in Washington for failing to cooperate with Musk's team.",
      "\"We hope to achieve \u2014 over the next 36 to 48 hours \u2014 what I'd hope to do in a more orderly way, from the top down ... now we're going to have to achieve it from the bottom up, defining what those special missions are,\" he said.",
      "Rubio cited USAID funding to combat Ebola and some projects run by the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS, or PEPFAR, as early examples of exceptions that will continue.",
      "\"It has to be done in a way that's transparent, and we weren't getting those answers. We just weren't, at least not from the top down,\" Rubio said. \"So now, we're going to have to pursue it from the bottom up. That's always been our goal with our intention here, and that's going to continue to be our goal and our intention.\"",
      "On Saturday, two top security officials at USAID headquarters in Washington were\u00a0placed on administrative leave, two sources confirmed to CBS News. Multiple sources said they were fired for attempting to block a DOGE team from accessing classified material in restricted areas.",
      "As a broader review of foreign aid continues, Rubio said he's seeking to continue some funding and has issued waivers to address aid delays for essential services. But a USAID staffer and multiple NGOs tell CBS News that operators on the ground are not able to distribute the aid because the operations, payment and computer systems are offline after they were shut down by the Department of Government Efficiency, effectively rendering Rubio's waiver powerless.",
      "Tom Hart, the CEO of InterAction, an alliance of 170 NGOs, says many of those groups now face bankruptcy because they cannot access credit or U.S. financing because USAID systems were taken down. About 40% of InterAction's members receive USAID funding.\"",
      "\"While the policy is in place through Secretary Rubio's order, and even paperwork has been delivered to some of our partner NGOs, they've not been able to get the assistance, the money, to continue operations,\" Hart said. \"So, we have the policy, we have the paperwork, we just don't have the funding flowing to keep that emergency relief going.\"",
      "Hart also pointed out that because USAID has revoked all its personnel and contractors, \"all those experts who help provide the evaluation of \u2014 does this program fit within the exemption that Secretary Rubio announced \u2014 are no longer there and working.\"",
      "The Tuesday notice put all USAID staff on administrative leave effective midnight Friday and ordered back to the U.S. all workers posted abroad within 30 days if their contracts are determined to be non-essential. The email to the USAID workers said the agency plans to consider \"case-by-case\" exceptions of staffers who need to stay on the job, and return travel extensions are possible based on \"personal or family hardship, mobility, or safety concerns.\"",
      "Rubio told diplomats Wednesday those exceptions \"came from input from the ground, not from anybody else.\" He cited examples of USAID employees who are married and have children with State Department staffers assigned to the same embassy.",
      "\"So now you're basically leaving them with the option of saying, 'So I have to leave behind my spouse and my children, potentially, and uproot myself and go.' That's not our intention. We don't want to achieve that,\" he said.",
      "He also noted, \"There are members of [USAID] that are in the third trimester of a pregnancy.\" Others, he said, might require special medical attention.",
      "\"We have a case, I know in particular, of someone who has to go to dialysis three times a week,\" he said. \"And so to be ordered to leave is disruptive in terms of, like, continuing with the course of care. And there are people that are deployed in places, frankly, where we don't want them stranded with them, because, it's not, you can't just catch a commercial flight and come home.\"",
      "He concluded his lengthy answer by asking the diplomats for grace.",
      "\"I know it's hard to ask for patience. I know it's hard to ask for trust, because you've never met me before. I've never been in charge of the State Department. I've never been acting USAID administrator before. I don't get paid double for doing that, by the way.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 05 Feb 2025 22:47:04 -0500",
    "summary": "CIA employees have received letters offering them buyouts if they volunteer to resign.",
    "story": [
      "The CIA confirmed Wednesday that it offered buyouts to employees who volunteer to resign, the latest group of federal workers to receive such a proposal as President Trump pushes to transform the federal government.",
      "A CIA spokesperson declined to say how many people received the offers or whether they face any deadline to decide.",
      "However, the buyout offered to CIA employees differs from the \"fork in the road\" offer extended to other federal employees and includes Voluntary Early Retirement Authority, known as VERA, and resignation options. And it will not be available to all CIA staff, CBS News has learned.",
      "VERA enables agencies that are being substantially restructured or reorganized to \"temporarily lower the age and service requirements in order to increase the number of employees who are eligible for retirement,\" according to OPM. It's intended to encourage more people to voluntarily separate from their positions earlier and allow employees \"to receive an immediate annuity years before they would otherwise be eligible.\"",
      "There are multiple national security exceptions for the CIA buyouts \u2014 though it's not immediately clear exactly who might be included in these. While the CIA received an agency-wide message similar to the email sent to Office of Personnel Management personnel, eligibility for CIA personnel is limited and based on the mission requirements of certain employees, CBS News has learned. Those who work on high-priority issues may not be approved for the buyout.",
      "For example, some personnel with specialized skill sets designed for intelligence collection, including fluency in some foreign languages, will not be eligible to receive the buyout.",
      "In a statement a CIA spokesperson said of the buyouts that CIA Director John Ratcliffe \"is moving swiftly to ensure the CIA workforce is responsive to the Administration's national security priorities,\" adding that \"these moves are part of a holistic strategy to infuse the Agency with renewed energy, provide opportunities for rising leaders to emerge, and better position the CIA to deliver on its mission.\" The Wall Street Journal first reported the CIA resignation offers.",
      "The Office of Personnel Management has already offered millions of\u00a0federal workers about eight months of salary if they agree by Thursday to leave their jobs. The CIA and other national security agencies were initially exempted, but the CIA offers suggest few corners of the government will escape Mr. Trump's overhaul.",
      "Mr. Trump has long criticized America's intelligence agencies, and his new CIA director, John Ratcliffe, has promised big changes, claiming the CIA has strayed from its original focus on human-collected intelligence.",
      "Since he took office last month, Mr. Trump has launched an attempt to gut and reshape several federal agencies, most notably the U.S. Agency for International Development, which has been largely dismantled by Trump and billionaire Elon Musk, the leader of Trump's so-called Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "National security experts have warned that deep cuts to the CIA and other agencies could put lives at risk by hampering their mission or reducing the flow of intelligence between the U.S. and its allies. Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the senior Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, urged CIA employees to carefully weigh the offer.",
      "\"There are few government agencies more essential to our national security than the CIA,\" Warner said in a statement. \"A lot of federal employees, including at the CIA, are my constituents, and I've been warning them that these 'buyouts' are empty promises, since Congress hasn't approved any money to do it. I'd hate to see people resign and then get stiffed like the contractors on President Trump's construction projects.\"",
      "Though the precise number is classified, the CIA employs thousands of people engaged in the collection and analysis of foreign intelligence, both at its headquarters in Virginia, as well as overseas postings.",
      "Ratcliffe told the Senate Intelligence Committee in January that the CIA must do a better job of harnessing technologies such as artificial intelligence and quantum computing while also expanding the agency's use of human intelligence collection.",
      "\"We're not where we're supposed to be,\" Ratcliffe said as senators considered his nomination.",

    "story": [
      "More employees of the Environmental Protection Agency were informed Wednesday that their jobs appear in doubt. Senior leadership at the EPA held an all-staff meeting to tell individuals that President Trump's executive order, \"Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing,\" which was responsible for the closure of the agency's Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion office, will likely lead to the shuttering of the Office of Environmental Justice and External Civil Rights as well.",
      "Employees of the EPA's DEI office were placed on administrative leave on Jan. 22, once the executive order went into effect. Staffers with the Office of Environmental Justice were informed their department is expecting a similar written notice as early as Thursday, but it was unclear if all employees will also go on administrative leave or be immediately terminated.",
      "CBS News has reached out to the EPA for comment.",
      "The Office of Environmental Justice and External Civil Rights supports the EPA's efforts to address vulnerable communities that the agency has determined have been disproportionately affected by environmental pollution and ensure they have equitable access to a healthy environment, as well as enforce federal civil rights laws.",
      "\"There were a lot of rumors all day,\" said Matthew Tejada, who was the deputy assistant administrator at the Office of Environmental Justice for over a decade before departing the EPA in Dec. 2023. \"The staff is freaked out and anxious.\"",
      "A current EPA staff member in the environmental justice office, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said senior leadership held a two-and-a-half hour call on Wednesday to discuss the logistics of the order, but said managers would not have many details to share until the official notice is issued.",
      "Many on the call were confused and concerned. EPA staffers already received the Office of Personnel Management's \"Fork in the Road\" email, which offered deferred resignations to anyone who agreed to leave their position by Feb. 6. But this individual received an email warning that they could be immediately terminated because of their probationary status as an employee with less than a year in their current role \u2014 which was created under an Inflation Reduction Act temporary program with a two-year probationary period. It's unclear if they will be eligible for administrative leave, or be immediately dismissed.",
      "Roughly 250 people work for the Environmental Justice and External Civil Rights Office at the agency's headquarters in Washington, D.C., and 10 regional offices across the country. The news was especially distressing for Tejada, who worked with many of the staff during his time leading the office, \"I hired all of them,\" he said.",
      "Tejada, now the senior vice president of environmental health at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said, \"Shuttering the environmental justice office will mean more toxic contaminants, dangerous air and unsafe water in communities across the nation that have been most harmed by pollution in the past.\"",

    "summary": "Senate Republicans say they'll move forward with their own plan to approve key parts of the Trump agenda beginning next week, amid House delays.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Senate Republicans said Wednesday that they intend to move forward with their own plan to approve key components of President Trump's agenda beginning next week, as the House efforts to start the budget reconciliation process have stalled.",
      "\"It's time for the Senate to move,\" Sen. Lindsey Graham told reporters Wednesday, after briefing Senate Republicans on the plan during their lunch meeting.",
      "Congressional leaders have been pursuing a massive legislative package through the budget reconciliation process to enact Mr. Trump's agenda, including resources to bolster border security, extend 2017 tax cuts, incentivize domestic manufacturing and invest in American energy, while working to pare government programs and address the debt limit. But top Republican leaders have appeared disjointed in how to proceed, prompting weeks of back and forth over whether to pursue a one- or two-bill approach.",
      "Until now, Senate Republicans had deferred to the House to kick off the process, though they generally advocated the two-bill approach that would include an initial effort to quickly secure a border win, while stressing that the tax legislation would take time to write and should be addressed in a separate measure.",
      "The budget reconciliation process allows Congress to fast-track certain types of legislation and avoid the 60-vote threshold typically required in the Senate. But it's a complicated maneuver that comes with its own limitations on what can be included. In order to approve legislation using budget reconciliation, lawmakers must first approve a budget resolution, but the House has faced a backlash from conservatives in recent days over the legislation.",
      "Graham, the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, said that while he appreciates \"what the House is trying to do,\" he thinks it's important to get the money to implement Mr. Trump's border security policy. He argued that \"one big beautiful bill,\" which Trump and House Republicans have said they prefer, is \"too complicated.\"",
      "\"It's important we put points on the board,\" Graham said, saying the president's plan on border security is \"running into a wall of funding.\" He said Senate Republicans are discussing a bill with $150 billion for border security that he said would be paid for.",
      "House Republican leaders outlined a timeline for the single-bill approach, which starts with the markup of a budget resolution that they aimed to hold this week \u2014 and a pledge to have the package on Trump's desk before May. The timing would fall within the first 100 days of Trump's second term, and allow for three vacancies in the House Republican ranks to be filled, improving their chances at winning approval for the bill.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters on Tuesday, as Senate Republicans began airing frustrations with the pace in the House, that \"we are well within the margins of time that we have to work on and I'm very optimistic about it,\" adding that \"we've made a lot of progress.\"",

    "story": [
      "Cambridge, England \u2014 Scientists have long said cutting methane emissions is key to addressing climate change, but many big industries aren't readily able to curb their production of the harmful greenhouse gas. A British company says it has an answer: Turn methane into something else.",
      "Methane is a menace. Climate scientists say the invisible gas warms the Earth's atmosphere 84 times faster than carbon dioxide. It's released into the atmosphere by organic material, such as food waste, rotting at landfill sites, sewage treatment facilities and by the digestive systems of cows.",
      "Levidian \u2014 a climate tech business in Cambridge, England \u2014 set out to tackle this climate change challenge, by giving methane a makeover.",
      "\"The magic happens in here,\" the company's CEO John Hartley told CBS News as he led our team on a guided tour of Levidian's patented LOOP system \u2014 a machine with a giant metal hopper shaped like a balloon.",
      "The technology uses microwave energy and a special nozzle system to split methane molecules into the gas' component parts \u2014 hydrogen and carbon \u2014 and captures them.",
      "Hydrogen is increasingly sought after, as it can be used to power factories, trucks, ships and other machinery. Levidian said it's a clean fuel, because, when burned, it yields heat and energy, but the only emission is water vapor, no carbon dioxide.",
      "The carbon from the broken-down methane, meanwhile, falls into the hopper as a solid called graphene, which has been known to science for only about two decades and which is often touted as the strongest material in the world.",
      "Dr. Ellie Galanis, head of commercial development at Levidian, was keen to show off a harvest of graphene from the LOOP hopper at the company's lab.",
      "\"It's such an exciting time to be involved in graphene,\" said the self-described \"graphene geek,\" shaking a cube filled with black, powder-like material. \"It's awesome.\"",
      "Galanis and her team have been busy working on ways to use the graphene Levidian produces to boost the durability of everyday products.",
      "\"When you put graphene into the tire tread, you can make it stronger. You can make it last longer and you can make it more fuel efficient,\" she said of one application.",
      "They have also tried adding it to concrete.",
      "\"Without graphene, it tends to crumble a lot easier, but with graphene it's much stronger,\" she said.",
      "The super-strong but flexible material can even be included in the manufacture of medical gloves.",
      "\"When surgeons do the 'snap test,' they're trying to check if it will break, and that doesn't happen when you add graphene in \u2014 it makes them much stronger and more puncture resistant,\" she told CBS News.",
      "Scientists say graphene also helps boost battery life in electric vehicles, and it can be mixed into plastic to help manufactures use less petroleum-derived materials in their bottles.",
      "Researchers only discovered graphene 20 years ago, at the University of Manchester, and Levidian sees years of growth ahead for the product.",
      "\"When you get in your car, you will have graphene enhanced tires that last longer. The battery in that car, if it's electric, will take you further because it will have more capacity to charge faster, and the concrete you use in the building you go into will be more durable and have a smaller carbon footprint,\" she predicted, adding that even \"the clothes that you wear might have graphene in them so they're more sustainable.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The world warmed to yet another monthly heat record in January, despite an abnormally chilly United States, a cooling La Nina and predictions of a slightly less hot 2025, according to the European climate service Copernicus.",
      "The surprising January heat record coincides with a new study by a climate science heavyweight, former top NASA scientist James Hansen, and others arguing that global warming is accelerating. It's a claim that's dividing the research community.",
      "January 2025 globally was 0.09 degrees Celsius (0.16 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than January 2024, the previous hottest January, and was 1.75 C (3.15 F) warmer than it was before industrial times, Copernicus calculated. It was the 18th month of the last 19 that the world hit or passed the internationally agreed upon warming limit of 1.5 Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times. Scientists won't regard the limit as breached unless and until global temperatures stay above it for 20 years.",
      "Copernicus records date to 1940, but other U.S. and British records go back to 1850, and scientists using proxies such as tree rings say this era is the warmest in about 120,000 years \u2014 or since the start of human civilization.",
      "By far the biggest driver of record heat is greenhouse gas buildup from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas, but the natural contributions to temperature change have not been acting quite as expected, said Samantha Burgess, strategic lead for climate for the European weather agency.",
      "The big natural factor in global temperatures is usually the natural cycle of changes in the equatorial Pacific Ocean waters. When the central Pacific is especially warm, it's an El Nino and global temperatures tend to spike. Last year was a substantial El Nino, though it ended last June and the year was even warmer than initially expected, the hottest on record.",
      "El Nino's cooler flip side, a La Nina, tends to dampen the effects of global warming, making record temperatures far less likely. A La Nina started in January after brewing for months. Just last month, climate scientists were predicting that 2025 wouldn't be as hot as 2024 or 2023, with the La Nina a major reason.",
      "\"Even though the equatorial Pacific isn't creating conditions that are warming for our global climate, we're still seeing record temperatures,\" Burgess said, adding much of that is because of record warmth in the rest of the world's oceans.",
      "Usually after an El Nino like last year, temperatures fall rapidly, but \"we've not seen that,\" Burgess told The Associated Press.",
      "For Americans, news of a record warm January might seem odd given how cold it was. But the U.S. is just a tiny fraction of the planet's surface, and \"a much larger area of the planet's surface was much, much warmer than average,\" Burgess said.",
      "January was unseasonably mild in the Arctic. Parts of the Canadian Arctic had temperatures 54 degrees Fahrneheit warmer than average and temperatures got so warm sea ice started melting in places, Burgess said.",
      "Copernicus said the Arctic this month tied the January record for lowest sea ice. The U.S.-based National Snow and Ice Data Center had it as second-lowest, behind 2018.",
      "February has already started cooler than last year, Burgess said.",
      "But don't count 2025 out in the race for hottest year, said Hansen, the former NASA scientist who has been called the godfather of climate science. He's now at Columbia University.",
      "In a study in the journal Environment: Science and Policy for Sustainable Development, Hansen and colleagues said the last 15 years have warmed at about twice the rate of the previous 40 years.",
      "\"I'm confident that this higher rate will continue for at least several years,\" Hansen told The Associated Press in an interview. \"Over the full year, it's going to be nip-and-tuck between 2024 and 2025.\"",
      "There's been a noticeable temperature rise even when taking out El Nino variations and expected climate change since 2020, Hansen said. He noted recent shipping regulations that have resulted in reduced sulfur pollution, which reflects some sunlight away from Earth and effectively reduces warming. And that will continue, he said.",
      "\"The persistence of record warmth through 2023, 2024 and now into the first month of 2025 is jarring to say the least,\" said University of Michigan environment dean Jonathan Overpeck, who wasn't part of the Hansen study. \"There seems little doubt that global warming and the impacts of climate change are accelerating.\"",
      "But Princeton's Gabe Vecchi and University of Pennsylvania's Michael Mann said they don't agree with Hansen on acceleration. Vecchi said there's not enough data to show that this isn't random chance. Mann said temperature increases are still within what climate models forecast.",

      "London \u2014\u00a0The Herculaneum scrolls have remained one of the many tantalizing mysteries of the ancient world for almost 2,000 years. Burnt to a crisp by lava from Mount Vesuvius in A.D.  79, the reams of rolled-up papyrus were discovered in a mansion in Herculaneum \u2014 an ancient Roman town near Pompeii \u2014 in the mid-18th century. Both towns were decimated by the Vesuvius eruption, and most of the scrolls were so badly charred they were impossible to open.",
      "Over the next two and a half centuries, attempts were made to unfurl some of the hundreds of scrolls using everything from rose water and mercury to vegetable gas and papyrus juice, according to the New Yorker.",
      "The few that could be opened were philosophical texts written in ancient Greek. But most of the scrolls were so badly damaged, they were considered illegible. More recently, researchers managed to decipher some select words using artificial intelligence, X-ray and CT scans to distinguish ink from the papyrus it was printed on.",
      "The mystery is still unravelling, and on Wednesday, a major breakthrough was announced. Researchers say they've now managed to digitally unroll and start reading one of the ancient scrolls. The scroll in question, known as PHerc. 172, is one of three stored at the University of Oxford's Bodleian Libraries in England.",
      "A team involved in the Vesuvius Challenge, a competition offering prize money to anyone who can help unlock the delicate scrolls, says it has virtually unwrapped the papyrus to reveal columns of text that Oxford scholars have already started working to decipher.",
      "\"This scroll contains more recoverable text than we have ever seen in a scanned Herculaneum scroll,\" said Brent Seales, one of the co-founders of the challenge.",
      "\"We're confident we will be able to read pretty much the whole scroll in its entirety, and it's the first time we've really been able to say that with high confidence,\" project lead Stephen Parsons told CBS News' partner network BBC News. \"Now we can work on making it show up more clearly. We're going to go from a handful of words to really substantial passages.\"",
      "The breakthrough came when the team at the Bodleian Libraries brought the blackened scroll to the Diamond Light Source research facility in nearby Oxfordshire, where technicians used a massive machine called a synchrotron to create a powerful X-ray beam that was able to peer into the fragile relic without damaging it.",
      "\"It can see things on the scale of a few thousandths of a millimeter,\" Adrian Mancuso,  the facility's director of physical sciences, told the BBC. \"We have to work out which layer is different from the next layer so we can unroll that digitally.\"",

      "Human brains contain higher concentrations of microplastics than other organs, according to a new study, and the amount appears to be increasing over time.",
      "In the study, published Monday in the journal\u00a0Nature Medicine, University of New Mexico Health Sciences researchers found microplastics in human brains have increased 50% over the past 8 years. They also found that people with dementia had up to 10 times as much plastic in their brains as everyone else.",
      "Microplastics are tiny fragments of degraded polymers that are found in the environment, including our air, water and soil, a news release explained. Previous studies have already shown these substances have made their way into the human body.",
      "The lead researcher, toxicologist Matthew Campen, said the rate of accumulation they found mirrors the increasing amounts of plastics waste on the planet. And he said in the news release that their findings should trigger alarm about the potential impact on human health.",
      "\"I have yet to encounter a single human being who says, 'There's a bunch of plastic in my brain and I'm totally cool with that,'\" he said.",
      "The study compared liver, kidney and brain tissue samples from autopsies conducted in 2016 and 2024, and found \"substantially higher concentrations\" in the 2024 brain tissue. The researchers also conducted similar analysis on older and more recent autopsies for people who died with confirmed dementia diagnoses, and found \"far greater\" concentrations.",
      "While it's unclear how particles are actually being transported into the brain, Campen said the size of the micro- and nanoplastics, measuring 200 nanometers or less, are not much larger than viruses and therefore small enough to cross the blood-brain barrier.",
      "In the study, researchers detected 12 different polymers, the most common of which was polyethylene, widely used for packaging and containers, including bottles and cups, the release noted.",
      "Campen suspects most microplastics in the body are ingested through food, particularly meat.",
      "\"The way we irrigate fields with plastic-contaminated water, we postulate that the plastics build up there,\" he said. \"We feed those crops to our livestock. We take the manure and put it back on the field, so there may be a sort of feed-forward biomagnification.\"",

      "The study authors, all affiliated with Canada's University of British Columbia, said that the probability of space debris hitting an airplane is small, but the risk is rising due to increases in both space debris reentries and flights. The study focused on rocket bodies, which pose a greater risk because of their size.",
      "\"While the probability of a strike is low, the consequences could be catastrophic,\" the researchers said in the study, which was published in Scientific Reports. The study builds on work by the authors presented at the annual International Orbital Debris Conference.",
      "Space debris and risks to airplanes",
      "The study authors worked to determine the odds of a rocket body reentering in an airspace. They found that high-density regions immediately around major airports have an 0.8% chance per year of being affected by an uncontrolled reentry, but in \"larger but still busy\" airspace areas like those found in the northeastern United States or around major cities Asia, the risk rose to 26%.",
      "The odds of debris striking an aircraft is small, the study authors said, but a collision between a commercial plane and space debris could \"lead to mass casualties.\"",
      "The risk will only grow as space debris remains in orbit, the study authors warned. Trackable objects in orbit have doubled in the last decade. The number of daily flights has also nearly doubled since 2000. Large reentries occur almost weekly, the study authors note.",
      "\"Over 2,300 rocket bodies are already in orbit and will eventually reenter in an uncontrolled manner,\" the study noted. \"Airspace authorities will face the challenge of uncontrolled reentries for decades to come.\"",
      "Closing airspace to avoid collisions",
      "The study authors highlighted an incident in 2022, when a 20-ton rocket body was set to reenter the atmosphere. Predictions the night before the reentry showed that it may land over southern Europe. European space and air traffic industries issued a safety bulletin recommending that authorities implement airspace restrictions. Spanish and French authorities wound up closing part of their airspace. It was the first time airspace was closed for an uncontrolled reentry.",
      "The closures delayed 645 aircraft for about 29 minutes, including diverting some planes that were in the air. Airspaces in Italy, Portugal and Greece that did not close saw an \"unexpected increase in air traffic\" from diverted flights, creating \"different, operational risks\" than those posed by the falling space debris.",
      "\"The incident highlighted, among other things, a lack of preparation for this eventuality and a lack of harmonization of responses among states,\" the study authors noted.",
      "The rocket body eventually fell in the Pacific Ocean. The study authors argued that better than closing airspace would be if all rocket missions required controlled reentries, with charted flight paths and scheduled landings. Fewer than 35% of launches currently have controlled reentries, the study authors said.",
      "\"Uncontrolled rocket body reentries are a design choice, not a necessity,\" the study noted. \"If controlled reentries were used by all operators, the risks to people and aircraft would be greatly reduced.\"",

    "story": [
      "Cambridge, England \u2014 Scientists have long said cutting methane emissions is key to addressing climate change, but many big industries aren't readily able to curb their production of the harmful greenhouse gas. A British company says it has an answer: Turn methane into something else.",
      "Methane is a menace. Climate scientists say the invisible gas warms the Earth's atmosphere 84 times faster than carbon dioxide. It's released into the atmosphere by organic material, such as food waste, rotting at landfill sites, sewage treatment facilities and by the digestive systems of cows.",
      "Levidian \u2014 a climate tech business in Cambridge, England \u2014 set out to tackle this climate change challenge, by giving methane a makeover.",
      "\"The magic happens in here,\" the company's CEO John Hartley told CBS News as he led our team on a guided tour of Levidian's patented LOOP system \u2014 a machine with a giant metal hopper shaped like a balloon.",
      "The technology uses microwave energy and a special nozzle system to split methane molecules into the gas' component parts \u2014 hydrogen and carbon \u2014 and captures them.",
      "Hydrogen is increasingly sought after, as it can be used to power factories, trucks, ships and other machinery. Levidian said it's a clean fuel, because, when burned, it yields heat and energy, but the only emission is water vapor, no carbon dioxide.",
      "The carbon from the broken-down methane, meanwhile, falls into the hopper as a solid called graphene, which has been known to science for only about two decades and which is often touted as the strongest material in the world.",
      "Dr. Ellie Galanis, head of commercial development at Levidian, was keen to show off a harvest of graphene from the LOOP hopper at the company's lab.",
      "\"It's such an exciting time to be involved in graphene,\" said the self-described \"graphene geek,\" shaking a cube filled with black, powder-like material. \"It's awesome.\"",
      "Galanis and her team have been busy working on ways to use the graphene Levidian produces to boost the durability of everyday products.",
      "\"When you put graphene into the tire tread, you can make it stronger. You can make it last longer and you can make it more fuel efficient,\" she said of one application.",
      "They have also tried adding it to concrete.",
      "\"Without graphene, it tends to crumble a lot easier, but with graphene it's much stronger,\" she said.",
      "The super-strong but flexible material can even be included in the manufacture of medical gloves.",
      "\"When surgeons do the 'snap test,' they're trying to check if it will break, and that doesn't happen when you add graphene in \u2014 it makes them much stronger and more puncture resistant,\" she told CBS News.",
      "Scientists say graphene also helps boost battery life in electric vehicles, and it can be mixed into plastic to help manufactures use less petroleum-derived materials in their bottles.",
      "Researchers only discovered graphene 20 years ago, at the University of Manchester, and Levidian sees years of growth ahead for the product.",
      "\"When you get in your car, you will have graphene enhanced tires that last longer. The battery in that car, if it's electric, will take you further because it will have more capacity to charge faster, and the concrete you use in the building you go into will be more durable and have a smaller carbon footprint,\" she predicted, adding that even \"the clothes that you wear might have graphene in them so they're more sustainable.\"",

    "story": [
      "Since ChatGPT was released just over two years ago, its use everywhere from the workplace to academia has expanded significantly. In schools across the country, teachers and administrators have been grappling with how to contend with this new tool. While some say it has benefits, others point out the negatives, like cheating.",
      "This is leading to a divide in classrooms across the country with some teachers encouraging the use of AI and others voting to ban it completely.",
      "\"We believe very strongly that AI literacy, actually teaching kids in developmentally appropriate ways, what A.I. is and isn't and then how to use those tools responsibly, is a better approach than just outright AI banning,\" Amanda Bickerstaff, CEO of AI For Education, a group that provides what it calls \"AI literacy training,\" told CBS.",
      "A former high school biology teacher, Bickerstaff now works with educators across K-12 and higher to adopt AI in their classrooms so students can learn how to use the tool ethically. She believes students need to be prepared for both the short- and long-term changes technology brings.",
      "However, philosophy professor James Taylor from The College of New Jersey disagrees.",
      "Taylor told CBS that he was open to using AI at first. But, after seeing many identical essays, often full of false or misleading information that was obviously AI-generated, he decided to ban it.",
      "\"If you type in a prompt, boom! There's the answer. But that means the student has now outsourced all of their thinking to a machine. They haven't worked out and developed the skills themselves,\" Taylor explained.",
      "In Taylor's philosophy classes, students have to complete handwritten assignments without any devices. Rather than allowing AI to do all the work, students are encouraged to discuss their views, analyze others' arguments and come to a conclusion on what's right.",
      "\"Using it responsibly is important, but I think there has to be some classroom spaces where it's prohibited and its use is eliminated,\" Taylor said.",
      "\"As soon as it's banned, it's forbidden fruit,\" Bickerstaff pointed out. She believes kids will use AI in ways that could be harmful if parents and educators don't allow or encourage their use.",
      "Instead, she's teaching students and teachers how to write effective AI prompts, which she says will enhance learning, and how to verify AI outputs.",
      "While both Bickerstaff and Taylor may not see eye-to-eye on bans, they both believe in taking a proactive, balanced approach to AI.",
      "\"We're living through an inflection point unlike anything we ever lived before,\" Bickerstaff said. \"Generative AI is becoming ubiquitous in a lot of our tools, social media and devices. If you have a new iPhone, then you already have generative A.I. models that are in your hands.\"",

      "In Bill Gates' new autobiography, \"Source Code: My Beginnings\" (published February 4 by Knopf), the computer pioneer and philanthropist writes of his formative years, and the experiences that led him to the then-burgeoning world of computers.",
      "Read an excerpt below about how, in eighth grade, he discovered BASIC, which introduced him to the elegance and exacting demands of computer code; and don't miss Lee Cowan's interview with Bill Gates on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" February 2!",

      "All these years later it still amazes me how so many disparate things had to come together for me to use a computer in 1968. Beyond the leap of faith made by those teachers and parents who got us the terminal, and beyond the stroke of luck that people were now sharing computers over phone lines, completing this miracle was the decision by two Dartmouth professors to create the BASIC programming language. Just four years old at the time, the \"Beginners' All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code\" was made to help students in nontechnical fields get started with computer programming. One of its attributes was that it used commands, such as GOTO, IF, THEN, and RUN, that made sense to humans. BASIC is what hooked me and made me want to come back.",
      "On the wall next to the terminal, a teacher had tacked up a half sheet of paper with the most rudimentary directions to get started, including how to sign in and which keys to press when something went wrong. It also warned ominously that typing \u00a0\"'PRINT' WITHOUT A STATEMENT NUMBER MAY CAUSE LOSS OF CONTROL.\"",

      "20 LET A=X+Y",
      "30 PRINT A",
      "40 END",
      "That was probably the first computer program I ever typed in. The elegance of the four lines of code appealed to my sense of order. Its instantaneous answer was like a jolt of electricity. From there, I wrote the first computer program of my own\u2014a game of tic-tac-toe. Getting it to work forced me to think through for the first time the most basic elements of the game's rules. Immediately, I learned that the computer was a dumb machine that I had to tell every single step it should take, under every single circumstance that could occur. When I wrote imprecise code, the computer couldn't infer or guess what I meant. I made a lot of errors trying to figure that out. When I finally got it right, the sense of accomplishment far outstripped the result. A game of tic-tac-toe is so simple, even kids learn it quickly. But it felt like a triumph to get a machine to do it.",
      "I loved how the computer forced me to think. It was completely unforgiving in the face of mental sloppiness. It demanded that I be logically consistent and pay attention to details. One misplaced comma or semicolon and the thing wouldn't work.",
      "It reminded me of solving mathematical proofs. Programming doesn't require math skills (beyond the basics), but it does demand the same kind of rigorous, logical approach to problem-solving, breaking problems down into smaller, more manageable parts. And like solving a problem in algebra, there are different ways to write programs that work\u2014some more elegant and efficient than others\u2014but infinite ways to make a program that fails. And mine failed all the time. Only after persevering, forcing myself to think smart, could I coax a program to run flawlessly.",
      "Another early program I wrote was a lunar lander game. The problem: safely touch down a lunar lander on the moon without crashing and before you run out of fuel. From that I had to break the problem down into steps. I had to solve how the game player moved the lander left and right, up and down, how much fuel it had, how fast it burned. I also had to describe what it looked like and how to display the ship in dashes and asterisks on the screen.",
      "Not long after Lakeside installed the terminal, Mr. Stocklin wrote a program that contained an infinite loop, meaning it ran continuously before someone eventually stopped it\u2014but not before it burned through over a hundred dollars of our precious rummage-sale budget. I'm not sure he showed his face again in that room. It was a lesson to all of us.",
      "To avoid racking up charges, I'd write out as much of my program as I could with pen and paper before elbowing into my place at the machine. With the machine offline to avoid time charges, I'd type it in and the program would print on a roll of inch-wide paper tape. That was step one. Then I'd dial the phone\u2014the rotary dial on the side of the terminal\u2014and wait for the buzz of the modem to confirm that I'd connected. I'd then feed my tape in, and chug-chug-chug, the program would input at a blistering ten characters per second. Finally, I'd type \"RUN.\" Typically there was a gaggle of other kids waiting for the computer, so if my program didn't work, I'd have to log off and find a spot to sort through where I went wrong, then wait my turn to get back on the teletype.",
      "This feedback loop was addictive. The feeling of getting better and better was a rush. Writing programs flowed from a combination of skills that came easy to me: logical thinking and an ability to focus intensely for long periods. Programming also stoked the persistent need I had to prove myself.",
      "The atmosphere of that computer room was a (mostly) healthy mix of cooperation and competition. We were a mosh pit of teenage boys all trying to outdo one another. A gap of only two or three years isn't much in the grand scheme of things but feels like a lot when you're thirteen, small for your age, with some indeterminate time until your growth spurt. Kent and I were among the youngest kids in that group. The assumed superiority of some of the older kids bothered us.",
      "I was an eighth-grader confident in my brain power and convinced that my intensity meant I could do anything the older guys could do\u2014if not better, then at least faster. I was determined to not let anyone get anything on me. Kent also hated being put-upon by someone else. Maybe even more than me.",
      "A sophomore named Paul Allen picked this up immediately, and he exploited it beautifully. \"Bill, you think you're so smart, you figure this thing out.\" Those are some of the first words said to me by the person who I would go on to cofound Microsoft with years later.",

    "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2025 05:00:05 -0500",
    "summary": "More than 60,000 people bleed to death every year in the U.S. Many of those deaths occur before the patient reaches a trauma center where blood transfusions can be given.",
    "story": [
      "One August afternoon in 2023, Angela Martin's cousin called with alarming news. Martin's 74-year-old aunt had been mauled by four dogs while out for a walk near her home in rural Purlear, North Carolina. She was bleeding heavily from bites on both legs and her right arm, where she'd tried to protect her face and neck. An ambulance was on its way.",
      "\"Tell them she's on Eliquis!\" said Martin, a nurse who lived an hour's drive away in Winston-Salem. She knew the blood thinner could lead to life-threatening blood loss.",
      "When the ambulance arrived, the medics evaluated Martin's aunt and then did something few emergency medical services crews do: They gave her a blood transfusion to replace what she'd lost, stabilizing her sinking blood pressure.",
      "The ambulance took her to the local high school, and from there a medical helicopter flew her to the nearest trauma center, in Winston-Salem. She needed more units of blood in the helicopter and at the hospital but eventually recovered fully.",
      "\"The whole situation would have been different if they hadn't given her blood right away,\" Martin said. \"She very well might have died.\"",
      "More than 60,000 people in the U.S. bleed to death every year from traumatic events like car crashes or gunshot wounds, or other emergencies, including those related to pregnancy or gastrointestinal hemorrhaging. It's a leading cause of preventable death after a traumatic event.",
      "But many of those people likely wouldn't have died if they had received a blood transfusion promptly, trauma specialists say. At a news conference last fall, members of the American College of Surgeons estimated that 10,000 lives could be saved annually if more patients received blood before they arrived at the hospital.",
      "\"I don't think that people understand that ambulances don't carry blood,\" said Jeffrey Kerby, who is chair of the ACS Committee on Trauma and directs trauma and acute care surgery at the University of Alabama-Birmingham Heersink School of Medicine. \"They just assume they have it.\"",
      "Of the more than 11,000 EMS agencies in the U.S. that provide ground transport to acute care hospitals, only about 1% carry blood, according to a 2024 study.",
      "The term \"blood deserts\" generally refers to a problem in rural areas where the nearest trauma center is dozens of miles away. But heavy traffic and other factors in suburban and urban areas can turn those areas into blood deserts, too. In recent years, several EMS agencies throughout the country have established \"pre-hospital blood programs\" aimed at getting blood to injured people who might not survive the ambulance ride to the trauma center.",
      "With blood loss, every minute counts. Blood helps move oxygen and nutrients to cells and keeps organs working. If the volume gets too low, it can no longer perform those essential functions.",
      "If someone is catastrophically injured, sometimes nothing can save them. But in many serious bleeding situations, if emergency personnel can provide blood within 30 minutes, \"it's the best chance of survival for those patients,\" said Leo Reardon, the Field Transfusion Paramedic Program director for the Canton, Massachusetts, fire department. \"They're in the early stages of shock where the blood will make the most difference.\"",
      "There are several roadblocks that prevent EMS agencies from providing blood. Several states don't allow emergency services personnel to administer blood before they arrive at the hospital, said John Holcomb, a professor in the division of trauma and acute care surgery at UAB's Heersink School.",
      "\"It's mostly tradition,\" Holcomb said. \"They say: 'It's dangerous. You're not qualified.' But both of those things are not true.\"",
      "On the battlefields in the Middle East, operators of military medical facilities would maintain that only nurses and doctors could do blood transfusions, said Randall Schaefer, a U.S. Army trauma nurse who was deployed there and now consults with states on implementing pre-hospital blood programs.",
      "But in combat situations, \"we didn't have that luxury,\" Schaefer said. Medical staff sometimes relied on medics who carried units of blood in their backpacks. \"Medics can absolutely make the right decisions about doing blood transfusions,\" she said.",
      "A quick response made a difference: Soldiers who received blood within minutes of being injured were four times as likely to survive, according to military research.",
      "Civilian emergency services are now incorporating lessons learned by the military into their own operations.",
      "But they face another significant hurdle: compensation. Ambulance service\u00a0payments are based on how far vehicles travel and the level of services they provide, with some adjustments. But the fee schedule doesn't cover blood products. If EMS responders carry blood on calls, it's usually low-titer O whole blood, which is generally safe for anyone to receive, or blood components \u2014 liquid plasma and packed red blood cells. These products can cost from $80 to $600 on average, according to Schaefer's study. And payments don't cover the blood coolers, fluid warming equipment, and other gear needed to provide blood at the scene.",
      "On Jan. 1, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services began counting any administration of blood during ambulance pre-hospital transport as an \"advanced life support, level 2\" (ALS2) service, which will boost payment in some cases.",
      "The higher reimbursement is welcome, but it's not enough to cover the cost of providing blood to a patient, which can run to more than $1,000, Schaefer said. Agencies that run these programs are paying for them out of their own operating budgets or using grants or other sources.",
      "Blood deserts exist in rural and urban areas. Last August, Herby Joseph was walking down the stairs at his cousin's house in Brockton, Massachusetts, when he slipped and fell. The glass plate he was carrying shattered and sliced through the blood vessels in his right hand.",
      "\"I saw a flood of blood and called my cousin to call 911,\" Joseph, 37, remembered.",
      "The ambulance team arrived in just a few minutes, evaluated him, and called in the Canton-based Field Transfusion Paramedic Program team, which began administering a blood transfusion shortly thereafter. The program serves 30 towns in the Boston area. Since the transfusion program began last March, the team has responded to more than 40 calls, many of them related to car accidents along the ring of interstate highways surrounding the area, Reardon said.",
      "Brockton has a Level 3 trauma center, but Joseph's injuries required more intensive care. Boston Medical Center, the Level 1 trauma center where the EMS team was taking Joseph, is about 23 miles from Brockton, and depending on traffic it can take more than a half hour to get there.",
      "Joseph was given more blood at the medical center, where he remained for nearly a week. He eventually underwent three surgeries to repair his hand and has now returned to his warehouse job.",
      "Although Boston has several Level 1 trauma centers, the region south of the city is pretty much a trauma desert, said Crisanto Torres, one of the trauma surgeons who cared for Joseph.",
      "Boston Medical Center partners with the Canton Fire Department to operate the field transfusion program. It's an important service, Torres said.",
      "\"You can't just put up a new Level 1 trauma center,\" he said. \"This is one way to blunt the inequity in access to care. It buys patients time.\"",

      "Some Michigan voters who either sat out the election, voted for a third-party candidate or voted for President Trump are now revisiting their decision after he proposed Tuesday that the United States \"take over\" the Gaza Strip, rebuild it and relocate Palestinians elsewhere.",
      "In the town of Dearborn, Michigan, which has the largest Muslim population per capita in the country, 43% voted for President Trump in the 2024 election. Democratic nominee Vice President Kamala Harris won 37% of the vote, substantially lower than the 68% former President Joe Biden won in 2020, according to the city's election data.",
      "Sarah Chabaan, a college senior in Dearborn who voted for Mr. Trump, said she was \"disappointed\" with his proposal but remained skeptical \"he would actually implement what he's saying.\"",
      "Asked if she regrets her vote, Chabaan said \"a little bit\" but pointed to Mr. Trump's involvement in the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas.",
      "\"Had I voted for Kamala, I think maybe the war might have still been going on. That's the unfortunate situation,\" Chabaan said.",
      "Mr. Trump's Gaza idea has been defended by White House officials, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said it was \"worthwhile really pursuing this avenue.\" But the proposal was largely panned by Arab American and Muslim organizations in the U.S. Middle Eastern countries also rejected the premise.",
      "On Thursday morning, Mr. Trump wrote that the Gaza Strip \"would be turned over to the United States by Israel at the conclusion of fighting.\" He also stated that no U.S. troops would be involved, a sticking point for congressional Republicans. He has not revealed many more specifics about the idea, which prompted immediate criticism regarding the displacement of the Palestinians, the abandonment of a two-state solution and the idea that the U.S. would control Gaza.",
      "\"The U.S., working with great development teams from all over the World, would slowly and carefully begin the construction of what would become one of the greatest and most spectacular developments of its kind on Earth,\" the president wrote. On Tuesday, he suggested it could be the \"Riviera of the Middle East.\"",
      "Harris ended up with 15,000 fewer Dearborn voters than President Biden got four years earlier. That gap contributed to Harris' overall loss in the battleground state, where Trump won by 80,103 votes.",
      "Amer Zahr, who voted third-party for president but Democratic for other offices, said many in Dearborn don't believe Mr. Trump's proposal will actually happen, and said it's \"an outrageous idea posed by someone who doesn't know what he's talking about.\"",
      "But he pinned the blame on the Democratic Party and Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign for not doing more to win over disaffected Arab American and Muslim voters. He and other Michigan residents CBS News talked to brought up Mr. Trump's visit as a candidate to Dearborn, and the lack of a Palestinian American speaker at the Democratic National Convention.",
      "Zahr suggested that while there's a \"difference in style\" between Biden and Mr. Trump on the Israel-Hamas war, they still share a \"blind support for Israel.\"",
      "\"Now, Democratic politicians and liberals are willing to stand up against it a little bit because it's not their guy anymore,\" he said. \"The real news story is that Democrats and liberals are able to reject the notion of the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians. I hope they keep doing it.\"",
      "Osami Siblani, the publisher of The Arab American News, who did not vote for any presidential candidate, said \"the vote for Trump was not really a vote for Trump.\"",
      "\"It was a vote against the Biden-Harris administration, because they could not stop the carnage from happening in Gaza,\" said Siblani. \"We did not endorse Trump. We did not endorse Harris. We actually recommended that our community not vote for the top of the ticket.\"",
      "Siblani also decried Mr. Trump's proposal to own the Gaza Strip as \"insane.\"",
      "\"The people whose homes were burnt in L.A. because of the fire, they're gonna just leave it? Or they're gonna rebuild it and live there? People do not leave their lands.\"",
      "Much of Gaza has been decimated by Israeli military strikes that began after the Hamas terrorist attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. Over the past two weeks, about 200,000 displaced Palestinians returned to the northern part of the Gaza Strip after Israel authorized their movement as part of the ceasefire agreement with Hamas.",
      "Zaynah Jadallah, a Palestinian American and director at the Council of American Islamic Relation's (CAIR) Michigan chapter, said it was \"very dehumanizing\" for Palestinians to hear Gaza referred to as \"a piece of property, or talking about it like an opportunity for a real estate or an investment when it's their land.\"",
      "Other Michigan Arab American and Palestinian leaders condemned Mr. Trump's proposal, too. Abdullah Hammoud, the mayor of Dearborn, wrote that Trump's proposal \"is yet another chapter in the ongoing genocide.\"",
      "Dawud Walid, the executive director of the CAIR Michigan chapter, said \"any forced displacement of Palestinians in their land would be ethnic cleansing.\"",
      "\"Perhaps some people right now in our community are second guessing their vote for Trump,\" he added.",

    "story": [
      "An Alabama inmate convicted of murdering a woman after breaking into her apartment as she slept was put to death Thursday evening in the nation's fourth execution using nitrogen gas.",
      "Demetrius Frazier, 52, was pronounced dead at 6:36 p.m. CST at a south Alabama prison for his murder conviction in the 1991 rape and killing of 41-year-old Pauline Brown. It was the first execution in Alabama this year and the third in the U.S. in 2025, following a lethal injection Wednesday in Texas and another last Friday in South Carolina.",
      "\"First of all I want to apologize to the family and friends of Pauline Brown. What happened to Pauline Brown should have never happened,\" Frazier said. He also criticized Michigan Gov. Gretchen Witmer for what he said was her failure to step in following appeals for him to be returned to serve out a previous life sentence in her state.",
      "\"I love everybody on death row. Detroit Strong,\" he said.",
      "Recently, Frazier's mother and death penalty opponents had appealed to Whitmer to take Frazier back to Michigan to complete his life sentence for the murder of a teenage girl before he was turned over years ago to Alabama authorities. Michigan does not have the death penalty.",
      "Michigan attorney general's office wrote in a January court filing that the state did not want Frazier back. It was in 1992 while in custody in Michigan that Frazier confessed to killing Brown, police had said.",
      "Michigan's Gov. Whitmer told The Detroit News prior to the execution that her predecessor in office, Rick Snyder, \"unfortunately\" agreed to send Frazier to Alabama where it was in the hands of officials there.",
      "\"It's a really tough situation,\" she told the media outlet before the execution was carried out. \"I understand the pleas and concerns. Michigan is not a death penalty state.\"",
      "Prosecutors said that on Nov. 27, 1991, Frazier, then 19, broke into Brown's apartment in Birmingham while she was asleep. Prosecutors said he demanded money and raped Brown at gunpoint after she gave him $80 from her purse. He then shot her in the head, they said, adding he returned later to have a snack and look for money.",
      "Frazier was sentenced to life in prison in Michigan for the 1992 murder of Crystal Kendrick, 14. Then in 1996, an Alabama jury convicted him of murdering Brown and recommended by a vote of 10-2 that he receive a death sentence. Frazier remained in Michigan custody until 2011 when the then-governors of the two states agreed to move him to Alabama's death row.",
      "Alabama became the first state to carry out executions with nitrogen gas when three inmates were put to death last year using the method. It involves placing a respirator gas mask over the person's face to replace breathable air with pure nitrogen gas, causing death by lack of oxygen.",
      "The execution began at about 6:10 p.m after a corrections officer did a final check of the respirator mask used to administer the nitrogen gas. Frazier moved his outstretched hands in a circular movement for the first minute or so before beginning to grimace and quiver on the gurney. At 6:13 p.m. he raised both legs several inches of the gurney",
      "He appeared to take a few gasping breaths. Then, his breathing slowed to a a series of sporadic breaths. He had no visible movement by 6:21 p.m. The curtains closed to the execution chamber at 6:29 p.m.",
      "Alabama Corrections Commissioner John Hamm said the gas flowed for about 18 minutes. He said instruments indicated that Frazier no longer had a heart beat 13 minutes after the gas began flowing.",
      "Hamm said that he believed that Frazier lost consciousness quickly, noting that the swirling motion of the hands had stopped. The commissioner said he believed the other movements, such as the raising of the legs and the periodic breaths were involuntary movements.",
      "A federal judge last week rejected a request to block Frazier's execution. His attorneys had argued the new method does not work as quickly as the state promised. Media witnesses, including The Associated Press, described how those put to death with the method shook on the gurney at the start of their executions.",
      "The judge, however, ruled that the descriptions of the executions did not support a finding that any of the men \"experienced severe psychological pain or distress over and above what is inherent in any execution.\"",
      "Some of Brown's family members witnessed the execution but opted not to make a statement to the media",
      "\"In Alabama, we enforce the law. You don't come to our state and mess with our citizens and get away with it. Rapists and murderers are not welcome on our streets, and tonight, justice was carried out for Pauline Brown and her loved ones,\" Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey said in a statement.",

      "Such a deadline for a large-scale disaster is unprecedented. Following the deadly wildfire that tore through the historic Hawaii town of Lahaina in August 2023, killing more than 100 people and destroying more than 2,000 buildings, it took the EPA more than four months to clear hazardous materials from 1,400 homes.

      "\"There's lots of different uses of eggs in cooking, so there's definitely not one vegan solution that covers everything. My thinking about it is very purpose-driven,\" chef Adam Sobel said.",
      "Eggs substitutes and when to use them",
      "Many of the egg alternatives out there are vegan. Aquafaba, the liquid found in cans of chickpeas and beans, can be whipped to use in a meringue substitute, but it imparts a slightly earthy flavor, Trout said. Sobel noted it can be whipped with a hand or stand mixer.",
      "People looking to swap out eggs in a recipe for baked good or pancakes may turn to a combination of flax meal and water, or try banana or applesauce, Trout said. A \"flax egg\" is made by combing a tablespoon of flaxseed with three tablespoons of water and allowing it to set for 5 minutes. After that, it can be used as a substitution for an egg in many baking recipes.",
      "Egg is often used to get a glossy sheen on baked goods, like challah bread. The inside of challah also often has a yellow tint from eggs, so Sobel includes a bit of turmeric or saffron in his recipe to get the color right for the dough. Instead of egg for the glaze, he uses some maple syrup or agave nectar combined with olive oil.",
      "Chef Chloe Coscarelli, owner of chloe.\u00a0in New York City, said she uses different substitutes for eggs depending on whether she's making something sweet or savory. In a sprinkle cake, she turns to apple cider vinegar as a binder. It creates a light and fluffy texture when combined with baking soda. A protein breakfast wrap at chloe. features a blend of extra-firm and silken tofu to replicate the texture of scrambled eggs.",
      "Tofu can also be used to add moisture to baked goods, Trout said.",
      "Many websites and cookbooks focused on vegan recipes provide options for adapting favorite dishes and baked goods without eggs.",
      "If you're looking for another option for a non-vegan egg swap in something like waffles, pancakes and quickbreads, try full-fat yogurt, Trout suggested.",
      "One extra benefit of trying out an egg alternative \u2014 there's no chance of accidentally getting shells in the food.",
      "\"If anything, it can be more beginner-friendly than what people are used to who are dealing with eggs,\" Sobel said.",
      "Unsure cooks should have faith in the process, he said.",
      "\"It seems scary until you do it once and then you're like 'oh, it's easy,'\" Sobel said.",

    "published": "Thu, 06 Feb 2025 18:36:15 -0500",
    "summary": "Top FAA officials pushed to close one of Reagan National Airport's runways following two close calls, multiple sources told CBS News.",
    "story": [
      "Top officials at the Federal Aviation Administration, including then-Administrator Michael Whitaker, pushed last summer to close one of three runways at Washington's Reagan National Airport following two close calls between airliners still on the ground, multiple sources told CBS News.",
      "Whitaker, who resigned as FAA administrator ahead of the transition to the Trump administration, and others at the FAA wanted to close Runway 4 to traffic following an incident in April and another about six weeks later in late May.",
      "On April 18, there was a close call between Southwest Flight 2937 to Orlando and JetBlue Flight 1554 to Boston. The Southwest Boeing 737 was told to cross Runway 4 at the same time as the JetBlue Embraer 190 was cleared to take off from the same runway. Air traffic controllers ordered both planes to stop, but they came within approximately 300 feet of colliding.",
      "On May 29, there was another concerning incident at the airport. American Airlines Flight 2134, an Airbus A319 cleared to take off for Boston, was forced to hit the brakes because a private King Air aircraft was cleared to land on an intersecting runway.",
      "Air traffic controllers caught the issue, telling the American flight to stop its takeoff roll \u2014 the plane was going about 92 mph at this point \u2014 and ordering the King Air to go around, but it had already landed. The American flight had 128 passengers and five crew members on board.",
      "The move to close the runway received notable pushback and included an argument that closing it would cause additional burdens on Runway 33 \u2014 the runway American Flight 5342 was supposed to land on last Wednesday, when it and an Army Black Hawk helicopter collided in midair, killing 67 people.",
      "According to an impact statement reviewed by CBS News, \"Runway 04 has the added benefit of not needing to cross any runways to reach. If Runway 04 is removed, Runway 33 usage will increase. In order to get to Runway 33, Ground must cross both Runway 01 and Runway 04 while traffic is holding in position waiting to depart and traffic is approaching a 2 mile final to Runway 01.\"",
      "The FAA told CBS News in a statement: \"Following the May 29, 2024, close call incident at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA), the FAA took action on May 31, 2024, by temporarily pausing flights on runway 4 at DCA, which is a limited-use runway used by small regional carriers, while we examined the complexity of multiple intersecting runways.\"",
      "Reagan National has three runways currently in use, according to the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority, which operates the airport. Runway 1/19, the primary runway, is 7,169 feet long. Runway 15/33 is 5,204 feet long while Runway 4/22 is 5,000 feet long.",
      "Because of its short length, Runway 4 is used infrequently and requires additional coordination with air traffic control. It is restricted to smaller aircraft landings \u2014 primarily regional jets like the Bombardier CRJ700 and CRJ900 and the Embraer 170 or E-190 airliners. Only about one-fifth of the airport's 407 daily departures are estimated to be eligible to use Runway 4. Instead, it's more commonly used as a taxiway to get around the congested airfield.",
      "The focus on congestion at Reagan National has been ongoing in recent months after the airport authority and several area lawmakers, including Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, came out against an effort to add additional flights to the capacity-restricted airport last year. The FAA pushed back against a report calling for additional flights to be added at Reagan citing existing airport congestion issues.",
      "Ultimately Congress opted to move ahead with adding five additional long distance flights.",
      "\"The slabs are federally controlled, federally mandated, and we have to follow federal regulations,\" Terry Liercke, a vice president for the airport authority and airport manager for Reagan National, told reporters Friday.",
      "Officials with the airport authority declined to directly address congestion concerns following last week's collision.",
      "\"The United States airspace is the safest in the world. Safety is our, one of our top priorities, and we continue to ensure that the airport is safe for operations,\" Liercke said in response to a reporter's questions Friday. \"... We work with the FAA. We are regulated by the FAA. We comply with all FAA safety regulations.\"",
      "Reagan is one of three capacity-controlled airports in the United States. It's sometimes referred to as slot-controlled, where each slot is a takeoff or a landing. A new route typically requires a slot pair. Since 2000, Congress has added 64 such slot pairs at Reagan, which would support an additional 32 flight routes every day.",

    "published": "Thu, 06 Feb 2025 18:27:15 -0500",
    "summary": "A group of unnamed FBI agents and the FBI Agents Association are seeking to prevent the Justice Department from disclosing a list of names of bureau employees who were tied to Jan. 6 probes.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge in Washington, D.C., on Thursday temporarily prevented the Justice Department from disclosing information about FBI agents who fear they will be targeted because of their work on cases involving President Trump and the Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol.",
      "U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb ordered that the Justice Department may not disclose the list of FBI agents who worked on the investigations to anyone outside the department \u2014 which would include any other federal entity or outside group, as well as public disclosure \u2014 until she hears arguments Friday as to whether to issue a temporary restraining order sought by unnamed FBI agents and the FBI Agents Association in a pair of cases brought earlier this week.",
      "Cobb's decision comes after an hourslong hearing, during which the Justice Department and lawyers for the agents discussed an order governing the potential disclosure of names of FBI personnel who were involved in the Jan. 6 cases, which was compiled by the bureau and turned over to the Justice Department this week.",
      "She said in her order, \"The government has represented that the information at issue in this case has not been shared outside of the DOJ.\"",
      "The brief hold will remain in place until the two sides reconvene for the continuation of the hearing or reach an agreement on the terms of the order.",
      "Cobb, who sits on the federal district court in Washington and was nominated for her seat by former President Biden in 2021, said during the hearing that if the list of names was to be released overnight, FBI agents could face \"significant and immediate danger.\"",
      "The challenge stemmed from a memorandum issued by Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove last week that directed the FBI to provide lists of current and former personnel assigned at any time to investigations and prosecutions related to the attack on the U.S. Capitol.",
      "The department required the FBI to turn over the information by Tuesday, and the bureau complied with the deadline, the Justice Department said. FBI Acting Director Brian Driscoll said in a message to the bureau that the data it provided identified employees by their Unique Employee Identifier, current title, title at the time of the Jan. 6 investigation, the office where they are currently assigned, role in the investigation of prosecution and date of last activity related to the probes.",
      "Mr. Trump has nominated Kash Patel, a close ally of the president's, to lead the FBI, but the Senate has not yet voted on his confirmation.",
      "A lawyer representing the unnamed FBI agents and employees said that were it not for Driscoll turning over identification numbers, the government would have a list of the names of agents who worked on Jan. 6 cases. The Justice Department also has information compiled through surveys sent to certain FBI employees about their activities related to the Jan. 6 investigations, including the extent of their roles, she warned.",
      "\"We are one step away from those names getting released,\" the lawyer said, adding that it will be \"irreparable\" if they are disclosed.",
      "The lawyer said a chief concern is the names of the FBI personnel could be leaked to a third party or published by the Trump administration.",
      "\"Our argument is that the threat to national security is so extreme that we cannot risk letting it happen first and then trying to put it back together,\" she said.",
      "The lawyer noted that since Mr. Trump returned to the White House, billionaire Elon Musk, through the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, has made public the names of other government employees. She also said that some Jan. 6 defendants who were granted clemency by Mr. Trump have also suggested on social media that they would target FBI agents.",
      "Mark Zaid, who is representing some of the unnamed FBI employees, estimated there are between 5,000 and 6,000 whose information was turned over to the Justice Department.",
      "A Justice Department lawyer, Jeremy Simon, went back and forth with Cobb about the language of a potential court order that would temporarily bar the Justice Department from disclosing without notice the list of FBI agents tied to Jan. 6 cases to entities and people outside of the department.",
      "Asked whether any other government agency intends to release that information while the court considers a motion for a preliminary injunction, Simon said he was not in a position to make representations about agencies outside of the Justice Department.",
      "Simon also declined to definitively confirm the names hadn't been shared outside of the Justice Department, telling the judge that there has not been an \"official disclosure.\"",
      "The Justice Department has argued in a court filing that it was seeking information about FBI employees who worked on Jan. 6 cases to start a review process in conjunction with Mr. Trump's executive order aimed at ending what he calls the weaponization of the federal government.",
      "Government lawyers argued in a court filing Thursday morning that they believed there should not be a temporary restraining order implemented because of \"speculation involving future predictions of potential harm\" \u2014 not actual harm in the eyes of the government \u2014 and the FBI agents' \"speculative\" belief that the list of agents may be leaked outside of the department.",
      "Bove, meanwhile, sought to assuage concerns that agents could be retaliated against in an email disseminated to the FBI on Wednesday, writing that \"no FBI employee who simply followed orders and carried out their duties in an ethical manner with respect to the January 6 investigations is at risk of termination or other penalties.\"",
      "The deputy attorney general, who served as a defense lawyer to Mr. Trump, wrote that \"the only individuals who should be concerned about the process initiated by my January 31, 2025, memo are those who acted with corrupt or partisan intent, who blatantly defied orders from Department leadership, or who exercised discretion in weaponizing the FBI.\"",
      "In their request for a temporary restraining order, the FBI agents argued the Justice Department is planning to take \"adverse employment actions\" and make public the names and identities of those targeted. One group of seven FBI agents and the FBI Agents Association said the disclosure would harm them, their colleagues and families, \"all but guaranteeing they will face threats of physical harm and emotional harassment in violation of their First Amendment and Due Process rights.\"",

    "summary": "Federal employees received an offer to resign their positions and retain full pay and benefits until Sept 30.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Thursday temporarily blocked the Office of Personnel Management's deadline for federal employees to accept the Trump administration's \"deferred resignation\" offer.",
      "U.S. District Judge George O'Toole prevented the agency from implementing the program's deadline during a brief hearing held hours before federal workers were required to notify OPM of whether they would accept or reject the offer to step away from their positions.",
      "A Justice Department lawyer said OPM would provide notice to federal employees that the deadline is paused pending further legal proceedings. The agency said that it is extending the deadline for federal employees to accept the deferred resignation offer to Monday at 11:59 p.m. ET in compliance with the court's order.",
      "\"The program is not being blocked or canceled. The government will honor the deferred resignation offer,\" OPM said.",
      "Lee Saunders, president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, one of the unions challenging the Trump administration's program, said the decision is a \"great first step.\"",
      "\"We all depend on federal workers to keep our communities safe, healthy and strong, and politics should never get between them and the essential services they provide,\" he said in a statement. \"They deserve to be treated with respect for their public service. We look forward to presenting our full case in the days to come.\"",
      "The White House personnel office sent out an email last week with the subject line \"Fork in the Road\" that offered the more than 2 million federal employees \"deferred resignation.\" Under the program, they could resign their positions and retain full pay and benefits until Sept 30. Federal workers who agreed to resign would also be exempt from in-person work requirements through September, the email stated.",
      "Employees previously had until Feb. 6 to accept or reject the offer. The program is not available to members of the military, U.S. Postal Service employees or those whose work is related to immigration and national security, according to OPM.",
      "For those who opted to keep their positions, the message from OPM noted that the Trump administration could not give \"full assurance regarding the certainty of your position or agency.\" It also noted that \"the majority of federal agencies are likely to be downsized through restructurings, realignments, and reductions in force\" as part of Mr. Trump's efforts to reform the federal workforce.",
      "In a list of \"frequently asked questions\" about the offer, the agency said workers who accept the proposed buyout would not be expected to work at their government job during the deferred resignation period and would be allowed to get a second job.",
      "Roughly 40,000 federal workers \u2014 or about 2% of the government workforce \u2014 have accepted the deal, according to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt. But the White House expects that number to rise.",
      "Leavitt said in response to the order that the Trump administration is \"grateful to the judge for extending the deadline so more federal workers who refuse to show up to the office can take the administration up on this very generous, once-in-a-lifetime offer.\"",
      "Days after OPM put forth its offer, a group of four unions that represent more than 800,000 federal employees sued the agency and its acting director, Charles Ezell, arguing the so-called Fork Directive, as the unions call it, violates federal law.",
      "\"If these employees leave or are forced out en masse, the country will suffer a dangerous one-two punch,\" the unions said in their complaint. \"First, the government will lose expertise in the complex fields and programs that Congress has, by statute, directed the Executive to faithfully implement. The government will have fewer qualified employees to execute the statutorily-required tasks that still remain. And second, when vacant positions become politicized, as this administration seeks to do, partisanship is elevated over ability and truth, to the detriment of agency missions and the American people.\"",
      "They noted that funding for federal agencies is set to expire March 14, and there is no appropriation in place from Congress to cover the salaries of government workers after that date.",
      "They asked the judge to block OPM from implementing the Feb. 6 deadline.",
      "The subject line of the OPM email is the same as a 2022 email that billionaire Elon Musk sent to employees of Twitter, the social media platform he purchased that year and renamed X. The White House has said Musk is working in the Trump administration as a \"special government employee\" leading the White House's Department of Government Efficiency,\u00a0or DOGE, which President Trump established with the goal of cutting spending and restructuring federal agencies.",
      "The proposed buyout offered by the Trump administration has raised concerns from employment lawyers, as components of it are unclear and lack guarantees, several told CBS News. It's also not clear the Trump administration has the authority to create such a program, as the unions have alleged in their legal challenge.",
      "A dozen state attorneys general have also cautioned federal employees against accepting what they said is a \"misleading\" offer to resign.",
      "The deferred resignation program is one of several initiatives undertaken Mr. Trump since he returned to the White House that aims to slash the size of the federal government. The president ordered\u00a0millions of federal workers to return to the office full-time and directed agencies to end remote work arrangements.",
      "His administration has also taken aim at the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID,\u00a0placing nearly all of its staff on leave and ordering its overseas missions to shut down.",

      "\"As the richest man in the world, Elon Musk is not used to being told 'no,' but in our country, no one is above the law. The president does not have the power to give away our private information to anyone he chooses, and he cannot cut federal payments approved by Congress,\" James said. \"This level of access for unauthorized individuals is unlawful, unprecedented, and unacceptable.

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Speaker Mike Johnson urged his Senate GOP colleagues to wait for the House to \"do its work\" to advance President Trump's agenda. He and House Republicans met with Mr. Trump for several hours Thursday to discuss the budget reconciliation process central to approving key components of the measure, which is expected, among other things, to extend and expand the 2017 tax cuts enacted in his first term.",
      "The speaker said after the White House meeting that Republicans would meet again Thursday night to \"finish up some final details\" and said their intention is to produce a resolution for the House Budget Committee to mark up potentially as early as next week.",
      "\"So our message to our friends and colleagues in the Senate is, 'Allow the House to do its work,'\" Johnson told reporters at the Capitol.",
      "The White House meeting came after Senate Republicans announced Wednesday that they\u00a0intended to move forward\u00a0with their own plan next week, since the House efforts to start the budget reconciliation process have stalled. Senate Republicans are expected to meet with Mr. Trump Friday night at Mar-a-Lago.",
      "Johnson sounded upbeat and described the meeting with Trump as \"very good\" and \"very productive\" and included a large cross-section of Republicans from the committees that will have jurisdiction on the legislation.",
      "Though he declined to offer details of the plan, he said there may be some announcements Friday. He praised the president for \"leaning in and doing what he does best, and that is put a steady hand at the wheel and get everybody working.\"",
      "House Majority Leader Steve Scalise added that Republicans \"are narrowing down the areas of differences\" after a lot of \"give and take\" among the members who attended the White House meeting Thursday. He, too, praised the president's involvement.",
      "\"We obviously have to go talk to other groups within our conference now, but, but we made serious progress, and have narrowed the gap to where we're very close to getting ready to bring this to Budget Committee,\" Scalise told reporters.",
      "He confirmed that the group discussed some of the most polarizing items being considered for inclusion in the legislation: state and local tax cap reform, known as the SALT tax, and the debt ceiling. Scalise said members made progress but didn't arrive at a resolution on either front.",
      "The White House and Republican leaders in Congress are pursuing a number of legislative priorities through the budget reconciliation process, including approving resources to bolster border security, extending 2017 tax cuts, incentivizing domestic manufacturing and investing in American energy, while working to pare government programs and address the debt limit.",
      "Though Republican leaders are generally united on the priorities, disagreement on the process has bogged down progress.",
      "Until Wednesday, Senate Republicans had deferred to the House to kick off the process, though they generally advocated for separating the priorities into two bills \u2014 one focused on border security while stressing that the tax legislation would take time to write and should come later.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters during the meeting that the president emphasized to lawmakers that his priorities included his no tax on tips or overtime pay proposals, no taxes on seniors' Social Security benefits, renewing the 2017 tax cuts and adjusting the state and local tax deduction cap, known as the SALT cap, among other items.",
      "\"This will be the largest tax cut in history for middle class working Americans,\" Leavitt said. \"The president is committed to working with Congress to get this done.\"",
      "Under the budget reconciliation process, Congress can avoid the 60-vote threshold typically required in the Senate. But the complicated maneuver requires that lawmakers first approve a budget resolution, and the House has faced a backlash from conservatives in recent days over the budget measure.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration's objective is to send groups of unauthorized migrants from the U.S. mainland to Guantanamo each day, using military aircraft to airlift and relocate detainees.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 U.S. government officials are moving rapidly to fulfill President Trump's orders to turn the American naval base at Guantanamo Bay into a massive immigration detention complex, making plans to send daily flights there with migrant detainees, two U.S. officials familiar with the deliberations told CBS News Thursday.",
      "So far, two U.S. military flights have been sent to Guantanamo Bay this week with fewer than two dozen migrant detainees who officials said have alleged ties to the notorious Venezuelan prison gang, Tren de Aragua, which is expected to be labeled a foreign terrorist group at Mr. Trump's direction.",
      "But the administration's objective is to send groups of unauthorized migrants from the U.S. mainland to Guantanamo each day, using military aircraft to airlift and relocate the detainees, the U.S. officials said, requesting anonymity to discuss internal plans that have not been formally announced.",
      "More migrant detainee flights to Guantanamo are planned for Friday and the weekend, one of the officials said.",
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem is planning to visit Guantanamo on Friday to assess officials' efforts to set up and prepare enough detention space to hold as many as 30,000 migrants, as the president called for in an executive order last week, sources familiar with the plans said.",
      "Military service members at the Naval Base have been setting up tents to act as holding sites with the goal of building enough for 2,000 migrants as part of an initial phase, though the alleged Venezuelan gang members transported to Guantanamo this week have been classified as \"high-threat\" detainees and held in cells inside the base's high-security prison. A separate part of the prison, created after the 9/11 attacks, also houses more than a dozen terrorism suspects.",
      "The plans illustrate how quickly and aggressively the administration is moving to transform Guantanamo Bay, a 45-square-mile stretch of Cuban land the U.S. has leased for over a century, into a focal point of Mr. Trump's plans to oversee the largest deportation operation in American history.",
      "Representatives for DHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Being able to house thousands \u2014 and potentially, tens of thousands \u2014 of migrants in Guantanamo Bay would be a significant breakthrough for the Trump administration's mass deportation goals. While deportation officers have increased immigration arrests operations across the country in Mr. Trump's first weeks in office, the government is running out of space to house them.",
      "This week, Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facilities reached 109% capacity, forcing the agency to release some migrant detainees after fitting them with ankle monitors.",
      "ICE has been scrambling to find additional detention space, making plans to set up as many as 18 new facilities within its own network of county jails and for-profit prisons, which currently have about 38,000 beds. On Tuesday morning, ICE had 42,000 detainees in custody.",
      "The agency is also asking other federal agencies and local law enforcement officials, like county sheriffs, to provide detention space. ICE has been permitted to use a Denver-area Space Force base to house its detainees, and other military sites are being considered for migrant detention. The agency is also considering using Border Patrol facilities, currently well under capacity due to a sharp drop in illegal border crossings, to hold those arrested in the U.S. interior.",
      "Still, the effort to convert the naval base in Guantanamo into a large-scale migrant holding site is already facing legal and operational challenges.",
      "Finding and mobilizing sufficient security guards to supervise the migrant detainees has been an issue limiting transfers to the base, the two U.S. officials said.",
      "For days, officials across federal agencies argued over who would have legal custody of the migrant detainees and what their legal rights would be, officials said. Ultimately, it was decided that ICE would continue to have legal custody over the detainees in Guantanamo Bay, pending their deportation.",
      "But it's unclear how long migrants will be detained in Guantanamo. The U.S. has not carried out deportations to Venezuela for a while due to frosty relations with the regime in Caracas. Mr. Trump recently announced a deportation deal with Venezuela's government, but it has not been implemented yet.",
      "The Trump administration and the government of President Nayib Bukele are forging an agreement that would allow the U.S. to deport non-Salvadoran migrants to El Salvador, including suspected Venezuelan gang members. But that arrangement also has not been finalized yet.",
      "For decades, under Democratic and Republican presidents alike, the U.S. has housed some migrants in the Guantanamo base. But that policy, until now, only applied to migrants intercepted at sea who were undergoing interviews to be resettled in third countries like Canada and Australia. Those migrants have been housed in a barrack-like facility that is separate from the newly-erected tents.",

    "summary": "For a second time this season, at least 41 states are reporting high or very high levels of the flu. Here's how to stay safe.",
    "story": [
      "For a second time this season, the flu is surging, with at least 41 states reporting high or very high levels of the virus.",
      "Emergency room visits for the virus have shot up nearly 30% this week compared to the week before. The increase in cases has led to temporary school closures in places around the country, including in Texas and Tennessee.",
      "Dr. Rabia de Latour, a gastroenterologist at NYU Langone Health, told \"CBS Mornings Plus\" Thursday that recent data show there have been more than 20 million cases, 250,000 hospitalizations and over 11,000 deaths so far this flu season.",
      "\"These cases are staggering, but they're not unlike numbers we saw pre-pandemic,\" she said, noting a few factors behind the rise.",
      "\"We got a little bit spoiled after the pandemic because of precautions that people were taking (to stop) the spread of coronavirus \u2014 we also saw decreased numbers in flu, RSV, the common cold, and what that resulted in is a little bit of an immunity gap,\" she said. \"Society as a whole is less immune, we have slightly lower vaccination rates, and so our defenses are slightly down.\"",
      "Is it too late to get a flu shot?",
      "It's not too late to get a flu shot \u2014 in fact, it is encouraged, according to de Latour.",
      "\"The rule of thumb for flu vaccination is: as long as that virus is circulating, you can absolutely get vaccinated,\" she said.",
      "Anyone 6 months and older can get vaccinated for the flu, according to longstanding recommendations.",
      "How long is the flu contagious?",
      "In most people who are infected, influenza viruses can be detected starting one day before symptoms begin, and for up to five to seven days after becoming sick.",
      "At-home flu tests, which are somewhat new, can help people determine what illness they have.",
      "\"The biggest utility of these is to help you define what you have so that you can prevent the spread,\" de Latour said. \"I think people are going to be a lot more willing to stay at home and isolate themselves if they have a diagnosis of the flu \u2014 to prevent it from getting to people who are immunocompromised in society or at school. So it helps you with information. Information is power.\"",
      "While there's no definitive treatment for the flu, there is a well-known antiviral medication called Tamiflu, which has been found to reduce the duration of symptoms.",
      "\"We don't recommend it for everyone,\" de Latour said. \"You're technically eligible if you're age 2 weeks and older, but we tend to recommend for people who are high risk \u2014 immunocompromised, very young children, pregnant women, people who have severe comorbidities like heart disease or diabetes, and you're at risk for getting pneumonia or getting sicker from the flu.\"",
      "Whooping cough cases also on the rise",
      "The flu isn't the only illness surging in the country. The U.S. has recorded a fourth straight week of accelerating pertussis or whooping cough infections, according to figures published late Wednesday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "Cases nationwide are up 27% from the week before, the data shows.",
      "Whooping cough is especially dangerous for infants and young children because of their small airways.",
      "\"The reason why it's called whooping cough \u2014 it's a cough, cough, cough, cough, and then they gasp for air, that's the whoop,\" CBS News chief medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook previously\u00a0said on \"CBS Mornings Plus.\" \"As an adult, when you get it, you may be sick, but probably going to be OK in terms of moving air in and out of your body. With infants, airways are so small that they can really have trouble breathing at all.\"",
      "An effective vaccine for whooping cough is part of a combined vaccine called Tdap, which protects against tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis. But babies can't get it until they're 2 months old, leaving the youngest infants vulnerable.",
      "\"So until then, you're really relying on the adults being immunized,\" LaPook said.",

      "Charlie McCrary, a member of Volusia County's citizens on patrol program, which allows residents to volunteer with the sheriff's office, was conducting his regular patrol of the lake when he saw a speedboat \"spinning around in the middle,\" according to a video released by the department on social media.",

      "Sheriff's deputies from the Marine Unit and members of Volusia County Fire Rescue responded to the scene. They determined that the driver of the speedboat was unresponsive, and needed to be rescued.",
      "Senior deputy Matt Seltzer said rescuers first tried to use the larger Marine Unit boat to push the speedboat and stop it, but found themselves getting too close to shore. Then, the unit tried to use the boat's wake to push the smaller boat closer to the shoreline so that it could be disabled without causing damage to the larger boat.",

Brodie Hughes. \n\nThe other two out on this crew were Capt. Anthony Shank and Volusia County Fire Rescue Acting Division Chief John Kyp. Great job all!",

    "story": [
      "The man is insistent: Our ship is in difficulty, so keep your distance, he instructs another vessel over the radio.",
      "\"Warship on your course,\" he says. \"I am drifting. I'm not under command.\"",
      "The broadcast, according to military officials, came from a Russian spy ship, the Kildin, as the vessel packed with intelligence-gathering equipment drifted temporarily out of control off the Syrian coast on Jan. 23, with flames and black fumes rising from its smokestack.",
      "The Associated Press obtained audio of the broadcast, as well as video and photos showing the blaze, that three military officials said were gathered by a ship from a NATO nation operating nearby. The officials, also from a NATO country, spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity to discuss the fire and radio transmission that Russian authorities haven't publicly reported.",
      "The audio provides an unusual peek inside Russia's fleet of spy ships that NATO nations are watching closely because of concerns that Moscow might sabotage underwater cables and pipelines amid tensions over the war in Ukraine. Even though the Kildin was in trouble, the secretive ship didn't respond to an offer of help from the NATO vessel, the officials said.",
      "The U.K. last month tracked another Russian vessel that it identified as a spy ship in the English Channel. The Defense Ministry said the Yantar \"was caught loitering over critical undersea infrastructure\" and that a Royal Navy submarine surfaced close to the ship \"to warn it had been secretly monitoring its every move.\"",
      "At the time, British Defense Secretary John Healey warned Russia's President Vladimir Putin: \"We know what you're doing.\"\u00a0 Healey said a Royal Navy submarine was authorized to surface close to the Yantar \"strictly as a deterrent measure\" and \"to make clear that we have been covertly monitoring its every move,\"\u00a0BBC News reported.",
      "Last month, the\u00a0Royal Navy revealed\u00a0that in late December the frigate HMS Somerset had tracked a Russian naval group as it sailed from the North Sea to the English Channel, although the group had stayed in international waters.",
      "Fire temporarily disables the ship",
      "The 55-year-old Kildin gathers intelligence on NATO activities in the Mediterranean and had been operating near naval exercises by alliance member Turkey before the fire, according to the officials who spoke to the AP.",
      "They said the blaze burned for at least four hours and that the Kildin's crew removed the covers from lifeboats though they never put them to sea.",
      "The Kildin also hoisted two black balls from its masts - a maritime signal that the ship can no longer steer, the officials said.",
      "They said the crew eventually regained control and that the Kildin is still stationed and gathering intelligence off the Syrian port of Tartus, accompanied by a frigate and a supply vessel. It is not clear what caused the blaze.",
      "Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said he wasn't aware of a fire aboard the Kildin and didn't say what the ship was doing at the time.",
      "He dismissed suggestions that it reflected poorly on Russian naval readiness. \"Assessing the state of the fleet based on the breakdown of one particular ship or one particular malfunction is not professional,\" Peskov said.",
      "Retired Vice Adm. Michel Olhagaray, a former head of France's center for higher military studies, said that even though the Kildin regained steering, the fire highlights the logistical difficulties for Russia of maintaining naval forces in the Mediterranean, far from its bases in the Arctic and the Baltic Sea.",
      "Moscow also is no longer able to use its Black Sea Fleet for Mediterranean patrols because during the Ukraine war Turkey isn't allowing warships to pass through the Bosporus, which links the Black and Mediterranean seas.",
      "\"The maintenance of this Russian fleet, particularly in the Mediterranean, is extraordinarily complex,\" Olhagaray said.",
      "Audio captures radio exchanges",
      "The audio gathered by the NATO ship is a 75-second radio exchange between the Kildin and a Togo-flagged cargo ship, Milla Moon, the officials said.",
      "The AP also obtained a second recording of conversations among crew members aboard the NATO ship. In that, they can be heard identifying the exchange they've just monitored as being between the Kildin and a Togolese vessel. Military officials provided both recordings to the AP, which was not able to independently authenticate them.",
      "Ship-tracking websites that use the data vessels emit on their identity, position, speed and course show the Milla Moon lifted anchor off Tartus and started cruising northward along Syria's coast on Jan. 23. That was the day of the Kildin fire, also in waters off Tartus, the military officials said.",
      "They said the Kildin at first identified itself to the Milla Moon as another ship, the Sky, and then asked to switch channels to continue the conversation.",
      "After the switch, the man with accented English is then heard identifying his vessel as a warship.",
      "\"Motor vessel Milla Moon, this is warship on your course,\" the voice can be heard saying on the clip. \"Please hear me.\"",
      "He asks the Milla Moon to steer clear.",
      "\"I am drifting. I'm not under command,\" he says.",
      "Milla Moon responds that it will plot a course away before signing off with, \"You are welcome. Good watch. Goodbye.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2025 06:08:33 -0500",
    "summary": "Paris' centuries-old Louvre Museum \u2014 home of da Vinci's iconic Mona Lisa \u2014 is getting an $800 million makeover, and American visitors will have to help pay for it.",
    "story": [
      "Paris \u2014 It is the most visited museum in the world, but management, staff and visitors agree the iconic Louvre in Paris \u2014 the home of Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa\u00a0\u2014 is in need of some serious TLC.",
      "\"We have problems with the building,\" Louvre Museum director Laurence des Cars acknowledged to CBS News. She said the issues are partly due to age, as the palace that houses the museum was initially constructed in the early 13th century.",
      "\"It's nine centuries of history, at the heart of Paris and at the heart of the history of France,\" said des Cars.",
      "But it's also an issue of upkeep. The last major renovation of the museum was more than three decades ago, when renowned architect I.M. Pei's now-iconic glass pyramid was added to serve as the main entrance.",
      "When that entrance was inaugurated in 1989, however, the architects were planning for about 4 million visitors per year. Last year, the Louvre drew 9 million people, and officials hope to see that annual footfall rise to 12 million in the years ahead.",
      "To allow for that increase, French President Emmanuel Macron last month announced an ambitious 10-year plan to refurbish and expand the museum. The plans include establishing a new entrance on the east side of the building, to help manage the flow of visitors.",
      "It will become the main entrance, as the pyramid is simply too small to cope with the current number of visitors, let alone the anticipated increase. The access point is small, space below it is limited, and in the summer it gets very hot under all the glass. The Louvre Pyramid will continue to be a visitor access point, however.",
      "The new entrance will open onto the museum's eastern courtyard, the Cour Carr\u00e9e, and the plan is to expand downwards, building new galleries underneath it. One of those galleries has been earmarked as a new home for the Louvre's most famous piece, the Mona Lisa.",
      "If you ask the people standing in line outside the museum what they're most looking forward to seeing, the vast majority will reply \"the Mona Lisa.\"",
      "Carlos from San Diego didn't even hesitate: \"I always wanted to see it, ever since I was little,\" he told CBS News. \"I'm a big fan and this is one of the things that I look forward to.\"",
      "\"You can never get enough of it,\" said Ella, visiting from Canada, who had already been to the Louvre on several previous visits to Paris.",
      "But once inside the room where Mona Lisa currently lives, her global allure means crowds jostling to catch a glimpse of her mysterious face. The painting's relatively small size often comes as a shock to visitors, some of whom are left using the zoom function on their smartphone cameras to get a closer look.",
      "Da Vinci's masterpiece is in the Salle des \u00c9tats, the largest room in the Louvre. It is also home to major works by the Venetian masters Titian, Tintoretto, and Veronese, which often go ignored. The remarkable piece, The Wedding Feast at Cana, by Veronese, fills the back wall, facing the Mona Lisa. But visitors often walk straight past it without even seeing it.",
      "\"She's a sort of universal masterpiece,\" says des Cars. \"People want to spend time with her, and that's okay. And we need to organize that. But the Louvre is filled with 1,000 Mona Lisas.\"",
      "She says one of the objectives of the renovation is to improve visitor flow, so that people can find the collections they most want to see more easily \"and also discover the wonders of the Louvre\".",
      "Des Cars believes the new main entrance will also link the museum to the city around it in a more concrete way. \"The Pyramid is a wonderful, wonderful piece of architecture,\" she says. \"But it is a bit isolated in Paris, not in direct contact with the city. The eastern entrance will allow us to connect directly to the city, and so we think it's a perfect balance for this extraordinary building.\"",
      "The ambitious refurbishment will take a total of 10 years: Six years for the expansion and another four for vital repairs to the building and upgrades to outdated technical installations. The security system will also be updated to accommodate the ever-increasing numbers who pass through the museum's doors.",
      "The project is expected to cost around $800 million. Macron promised that French taxpayers would not have to foot the bill - although government funds will cover the $10 million cost of the initial surveys and plans.",
      "To help pay for all the work, ticket pricing will change \u2014 and visitors from outside the European Union will have to pay more from next year. French and European taxes help fund public cultural institutions, so the argument is that they are already paying on top of the entry ticket, unlike visitors from farther afield.",
      "\"It's not to discourage international tourism or to punish anyone, but it's the reality of the economy,\" said des Cars.",
      "The Louvre has also launched a fundraising drive, hoping the museum's stature will open purse strings around the world, so that it can continue to hold on to its number one spot, while adapting to the times.",

      "Panama City\u00a0\u2014 Panamanian President Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino on Thursday denied the U.S. State Department's claim that his country had reached a deal to allow U.S. warships to transit the Panama Canal for free.",
      "Mulino said he had told U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth on Wednesday that he could neither set the fees to transit the canal nor exempt anyone from them and that he was surprised by the U.S. State Department's statement suggesting otherwise late Wednesday.",
      "\"I completely reject that statement yesterday,\" Mulino said during his weekly press conference, adding that he had asked Panama's ambassador in Washington to dispute the State Department's statement.",
      "On Wednesday evening, the U.S. State Department said in a social media post: \"U.S. government vessels can now transit the Panama Canal without charge fees, saving the U.S. government millions of dollars a year.\" The department had no immediate comment Thursday on Mulino's remarks.",
      "The Panama Canal Authority put out its own terse statement later Wednesday night saying it had \"not made any adjustments\" to the fees, adding that it was \"willing to establish a dialogue with the pertinent officials from the United States in regards to the transit of U.S. Navy ships.\"",
      "Mulino said the U.S. statement \"really surprises me because they're making an important, institutional statement from the entity that governs United States foreign policy under the president of the United States based on a falsity. And that's intolerable.\"",
      "The differing versions came just days after U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with Mulino and canal administrators and visited the critical trade route. He had carried a message from President Trump that China's influence at the canal was unacceptable, as the Trump administration makes a push for U.S. control of the canal, which it says it needs for America's economic security.",
      "The Panama Canal serves as a shortcut between the Pacific Ocean and the Atlantic Ocean. And although the U.S. led the construction of the major waterway that around 40% of the world's cargo ship traffic now moves through, its control was given to Panama in 1999.",
      "In their meeting, Rubio told the Panamanian leader that Mr. Trump had determined that China's influence on the canal constituted \"a threat to the canal and represents a violation of the Treaty Concerning the Permanent Neutrality and Operation of the Panama Canal,\" a spokesperson said in a statement.",
      "Mulino has refuted those claims, and he said Thursday that both Panama's constitution and laws regulating the Canal Authority make clear that neither the government nor the authority can waive fees.",

      "Abdul Fatorma, chief executive of the Campaign for Human Rights and Development International, had been working on expanding democracy in Sierra Leone for seven years.",
      "Civil war had plagued the West African coastal nation for decades, ending in 2002 \u2014 and slowly, peace had returned, helping to reduce migration and violence. Essential to that progress, Sierra Leone's civil service advocates believe, is nurturing democracy and human rights. Fatorma's grassroots campaign was granted $1 million in U.S. funding in 2023 to continue work on those goals.",
      "Around two years later the project \u2014 which promoted meaningful participation of all citizens in their political systems, expanded the reach of civic education and encouraged female aspirants to run for office \u2014 ended last week when Secretary of State Marco Rubio ordered a pause on all new U.S. foreign assistance programs funded by the State Department and USAID. Almost all of the agency's workers are being put on leave.",
      "\"It came as a shock, and devastating,\" said Fatorma\u00a0from his office in Freetown, Sierra Leone's capital. He added the loss created \"a gap\" in funding and a \"vacuum in governance\" that he said Russia or China could rush to fill.",
      "USAID managed more than $40 billion in appropriations in 2023, according to the Congressional Research Service, a figure that is less than 1% of the federal budget. A large portion of the funding is awarded to U.S. organizations that grant monies to local partners or grassroots groups, which implement the projects in their respective countries.",
      "Grassroots groups are involved in carrying out a range of humanitarian projects and activities, including working in hospitals or health clinics, fighting human trafficking, and running programs that advance democracy, entrepreneurship or conservation.",
      "The complex funding structure has routinely been criticized as not reaching grassroots groups quickly or directly enough, but regardless, thousands of advocates and workers around the world depended on USAID to carry out an enormous spectrum of civil society work.",
      "Freedom Collaborative, a global network of about 3,000 advocates against trafficking, had 80% of its budget cut after receiving a stop-work order last week, said CEO Julia Macher, who is based in Berlin. The organization said it is funded by a USAID subgrant through\u00a0Winrock International, an international development organization that manages 100 projects in 40 countries mostly for the U.S. government.",
      "Macher said since the freeze on federal funding, her group had been contacted by at least 50 partners. In a Freedom Collaborative newsletter, Macher cited organizations in the Balkans that provide direct services to survivors and in Thailand where workers in shelters don't have funds to pay for essentials like food, medical care and transportation. The work of\u00a0Cambodia's Chab Dai, a USAID-funded survivor support program, has been put on hold, affecting nine staff members and dozens of survivors, Freedom Collaborative said.",
      "The situation is especially dire for groups in Latin America, the newsletter said, including an organization in Ecuador that had to let go of 11 staff members working with migrants and trafficked individuals, and groups in Colombia that had to halt all their operations.",
      "Funding for this type of complex work \u2014 often done at great personal risk to local staff and victims \u2014 is already very difficult to secure. Often, the U.S. government would be the only donor willing to provide funds, Macher said. She stressed that the benefits of these programs reach far beyond the individuals receiving assistance.",
      "\"It helps with global stability, and that is the larger argument,\" she said. \"The work helps reduce organized crime. And if there is no response or watching these crime groups, they can start expanding, and that is very scary because then it's a ripple effect. It's not just about the humanitarian aspect.\"",
      "Stopping the work so suddenly has \"a huge impact on actual human lives,\" Macher said.",
      "Rubio told U.S. diplomats Wednesday that the United States does not plan to stop distributing foreign aid entirely, saying the agency needs to do a better job of explaining and defending where the money goes.",
      "\"We're going to continue to provide foreign aid and to be involved in programs, but it has to be programs that we can defend. It has to be programs that we can explain. It has to be programs that we can justify,\" Rubio said to about 200 staffers at the U.S. Embassy in Guatemala City, according to a partial transcript of his remarks obtained Wednesday by CBS News.",

      "A semi-submersible vessel loaded with over 5,000 pounds of cocaine was intercepted off the Pacific coast of Colombia, the country's navy said Wednesday. Officials said it marked the nation's first seizure of a so-called \"narco sub\" this year.",
      "In a social media post, Colombia's navy said it stopped the semi-submersible about 100 nautical miles from Tumaco, which is close to the Ecuador border. Officials said the \"narco sub\" was manned by two Colombians and one Ecuadorian and an image released by the navy showed three men being detained behind dozens of piles of packages containing the alleged drugs.",

      "A U.S. military plane carrying 104 deported Indian migrants arrived in the northern Indian city of Amritsar Wednesday, the first such flight to the country as part of a crackdown on undocumented migrants ordered by the Trump administration.",
      "The U.S. Department of Defense confirmed that an Air Force C-17 plane was used for the flight.",
      "Multiple Indian lawmakers alleged Thursday in parliament that the deportees' arms and legs were shackled during the entire journey, and the legislature was forced to adjourn proceedings as they disrupted the chamber with their chants.",
      "\"We are protesting precisely this issue \u2014 that the manner in which the U.S. did what they did was really unacceptable,\" Shashi Tharoor, a member of parliament with the Indian National Congress, told reporters Thursday. \"We believe they have a legal right to deport people who are illegally in their country. And if they are proven to be Indian nationals, we have a legal obligation to admit them, to accept them in our country. But the manner in which it was done, in handcuffs, squeezed into a military aircraft, in such an abrupt manner, is not acceptable.\"",

      "Cambridge, England \u2014 Scientists have long said cutting methane emissions is key to addressing climate change, but many big industries aren't readily able to curb their production of the harmful greenhouse gas. A British company says it has an answer: Turn methane into something else.",
      "Methane is a menace. Climate scientists say the invisible gas warms the Earth's atmosphere 84 times faster than carbon dioxide. It's released into the atmosphere by organic material, such as food waste, rotting at landfill sites, sewage treatment facilities and by the digestive systems of cows.",

      "Hydrogen is increasingly sought after, as it can be used to power factories, trucks, ships and other machinery. Levidian said it's a clean fuel, because, when burned, it yields heat and energy, but the only emission is water vapor, no carbon dioxide.",
      "The carbon from the broken-down methane, meanwhile, falls into the hopper as a solid called graphene, which has been known to science for only about two decades and which is often touted as the strongest material in the world.",

It has to be programs that we can explain. It has to be programs that we can justify. Otherwise, we do endanger foreign aid,\" Rubio told about 200 staffers at the U.S. Embassy in Guatemala City, according to a partial transcript of his remarks obtained Wednesday by CBS News.",
      "\"This is not about politics, but foreign aid is the least popular thing government spends money on,\" Rubio added. \"And I spent a lot of time in my career defending it and explaining it, but it's harder and harder to do across the board \u2014 it really is. But for those of us in charge of doing the work of foreign policy, we understand it is essential.\"",
      "The State Department and embassy did not respond to requests for comment.",

      "The trip has coincided with a dramatic overhaul of the U.S. Agency for International Development that came to a head last weekend as Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency confronted top agency officials, seeking to learn more about the scope of foreign aid. President Trump signed an executive order Monday essentially folding the agency's functions into the State Department and named Rubio its acting administrator.",
      "As part of the overhaul, USAID staff were told Tuesday that most staff would be placed on leave Friday night, with exceptions for \"mission-critical functions, core leadership and specially designated programs.\"",
      "Wednesday morning, when Rubio met with embassy personnel in Guatemala, he was asked by the head of USAID in Guatemala about the future of the agency.",
      "\"That's a question that deserves a straight and honest answer, and I'll give it to you,\" Rubio said, according to the transcript.",
      "He said he is hoping to choose all \"specially designated programs\" by Friday amid a broader review of all foreign aid.",
      "The secretary said he is now seeking input directly from ambassadors around the globe after receiving a list of USAID programs in Guatemala from U.S. Ambassador Tobin Bradley early Wednesday. But he also faulted agency officials in Washington for failing to cooperate with Musk's team.",
      "\"We hope to achieve \u2014 over the next 36 to 48 hours \u2014 what I'd hope to do in a more orderly way, from the top down ... now we're going to have to achieve it from the bottom up, defining what those special missions are,\" he said.",
      "Rubio cited USAID funding to combat Ebola and some projects run by the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS, or PEPFAR, as early examples of exceptions that will continue.",
      "\"It has to be done in a way that's transparent, and we weren't getting those answers. We just weren't, at least not from the top down,\" Rubio said. \"So now, we're going to have to pursue it from the bottom up. That's always been our goal with our intention here, and that's going to continue to be our goal and our intention.\"",
      "On Saturday, two top security officials at USAID headquarters in Washington were\u00a0placed on administrative leave, two sources confirmed to CBS News. Multiple sources said they were fired for attempting to block a DOGE team from accessing classified material in restricted areas.",
      "As a broader review of foreign aid continues, Rubio said he's seeking to continue some funding and has issued waivers to address aid delays for essential services. But a USAID staffer and multiple NGOs tell CBS News that operators on the ground are not able to distribute the aid because the operations, payment and computer systems are offline after they were shut down by the Department of Government Efficiency, effectively rendering Rubio's waiver powerless.",
      "Tom Hart, the CEO of InterAction, an alliance of 170 NGOs, says many of those groups now face bankruptcy because they cannot access credit or U.S. financing because USAID systems were taken down. About 40% of InterAction's members receive USAID funding.\"",
      "\"While the policy is in place through Secretary Rubio's order, and even paperwork has been delivered to some of our partner NGOs, they've not been able to get the assistance, the money, to continue operations,\" Hart said. \"So, we have the policy, we have the paperwork, we just don't have the funding flowing to keep that emergency relief going.\"",
      "Hart also pointed out that because USAID has revoked all its personnel and contractors, \"all those experts who help provide the evaluation of \u2014 does this program fit within the exemption that Secretary Rubio announced \u2014 are no longer there and working.\"",
      "The Tuesday notice put all USAID staff on administrative leave effective midnight Friday and ordered back to the U.S. all workers posted abroad within 30 days if their contracts are determined to be non-essential. The email to the USAID workers said the agency plans to consider \"case-by-case\" exceptions of staffers who need to stay on the job, and return travel extensions are possible based on \"personal or family hardship, mobility, or safety concerns.\"",
      "Rubio told diplomats Wednesday those exceptions \"came from input from the ground, not from anybody else.\" He cited examples of USAID employees who are married and have children with State Department staffers assigned to the same embassy.",
      "\"So now you're basically leaving them with the option of saying, 'So I have to leave behind my spouse and my children, potentially, and uproot myself and go.' That's not our intention. We don't want to achieve that,\" he said.",
      "He also noted, \"There are members of [USAID] that are in the third trimester of a pregnancy.\" Others, he said, might require special medical attention.",
      "\"We have a case, I know in particular, of someone who has to go to dialysis three times a week,\" he said. \"And so to be ordered to leave is disruptive in terms of, like, continuing with the course of care. And there are people that are deployed in places, frankly, where we don't want them stranded with them, because, it's not, you can't just catch a commercial flight and come home.\"",
      "He concluded his lengthy answer by asking the diplomats for grace.",

    "summary": "The world set yet another monthly heat record in January, despite an abnormally chilly U.S., a cooling La Nina\u200b\u200b and predictions of a slightly less hot 2025, the European climate service Copernicus says.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The world warmed to yet another monthly heat record in January, despite an abnormally chilly United States, a cooling La Nina and predictions of a slightly less hot 2025, according to the European climate service Copernicus.",
      "The surprising January heat record coincides with a new study by a climate science heavyweight, former top NASA scientist James Hansen, and others arguing that global warming is accelerating. It's a claim that's dividing the research community.",
      "January 2025 globally was 0.09 degrees Celsius (0.16 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than January 2024, the previous hottest January, and was 1.75 C (3.15 F) warmer than it was before industrial times, Copernicus calculated. It was the 18th month of the last 19 that the world hit or passed the internationally agreed upon warming limit of 1.5 Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times. Scientists won't regard the limit as breached unless and until global temperatures stay above it for 20 years.",
      "Copernicus records date to 1940, but other U.S. and British records go back to 1850, and scientists using proxies such as tree rings say this era is the warmest in about 120,000 years \u2014 or since the start of human civilization.",
      "By far the biggest driver of record heat is greenhouse gas buildup from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas, but the natural contributions to temperature change have not been acting quite as expected, said Samantha Burgess, strategic lead for climate for the European weather agency.",
      "The big natural factor in global temperatures is usually the natural cycle of changes in the equatorial Pacific Ocean waters. When the central Pacific is especially warm, it's an El Nino and global temperatures tend to spike. Last year was a substantial El Nino, though it ended last June and the year was even warmer than initially expected, the hottest on record.",
      "El Nino's cooler flip side, a La Nina, tends to dampen the effects of global warming, making record temperatures far less likely. A La Nina started in January after brewing for months. Just last month, climate scientists were predicting that 2025 wouldn't be as hot as 2024 or 2023, with the La Nina a major reason.",
      "\"Even though the equatorial Pacific isn't creating conditions that are warming for our global climate, we're still seeing record temperatures,\" Burgess said, adding much of that is because of record warmth in the rest of the world's oceans.",
      "Usually after an El Nino like last year, temperatures fall rapidly, but \"we've not seen that,\" Burgess told The Associated Press.",
      "For Americans, news of a record warm January might seem odd given how cold it was. But the U.S. is just a tiny fraction of the planet's surface, and \"a much larger area of the planet's surface was much, much warmer than average,\" Burgess said.",
      "January was unseasonably mild in the Arctic. Parts of the Canadian Arctic had temperatures 54 degrees Fahrneheit warmer than average and temperatures got so warm sea ice started melting in places, Burgess said.",
      "Copernicus said the Arctic this month tied the January record for lowest sea ice. The U.S.-based National Snow and Ice Data Center had it as second-lowest, behind 2018.",
      "February has already started cooler than last year, Burgess said.",
      "But don't count 2025 out in the race for hottest year, said Hansen, the former NASA scientist who has been called the godfather of climate science. He's now at Columbia University.",
      "In a study in the journal Environment: Science and Policy for Sustainable Development, Hansen and colleagues said the last 15 years have warmed at about twice the rate of the previous 40 years.",
      "\"I'm confident that this higher rate will continue for at least several years,\" Hansen told The Associated Press in an interview. \"Over the full year, it's going to be nip-and-tuck between 2024 and 2025.\"",
      "There's been a noticeable temperature rise even when taking out El Nino variations and expected climate change since 2020, Hansen said. He noted recent shipping regulations that have resulted in reduced sulfur pollution, which reflects some sunlight away from Earth and effectively reduces warming. And that will continue, he said.",
      "\"The persistence of record warmth through 2023, 2024 and now into the first month of 2025 is jarring to say the least,\" said University of Michigan environment dean Jonathan Overpeck, who wasn't part of the Hansen study. \"There seems little doubt that global warming and the impacts of climate change are accelerating.\"",
      "But Princeton's Gabe Vecchi and University of Pennsylvania's Michael Mann said they don't agree with Hansen on acceleration. Vecchi said there's not enough data to show that this isn't random chance. Mann said temperature increases are still within what climate models forecast.",

    "title": "What are the risks of a U.S.-China trade war, and can conflict be averted?",
    "published": "Wed, 05 Feb 2025 14:17:18 -0500",
    "summary": "The world's two biggest economies are on the brink of an economically destructive trade war. Here's what experts think could happen next.",
    "story": [
      "The quick-fire volley of tariffs between the U.S. and China in recent days has heightened global fears of a new trade war between the world's two largest economies. Yet while experts think the battle is likely to escalate, they also say the early skirmishes offer hope for an agreement on trade and other key issues that could head off a larger conflict.",
      "After the Trump administration's additional 10% levy on Chinese imports took effect Tuesday, China announced a 15% tariff\u00a0on U.S. coal and liquified natural gas, along with a 10% tariff on crude oil, agricultural machinery and some cars, that is set to kick in Feb. 10. China also put limits on exports of vital minerals used in high-tech products; opened an antitrust probe into Google; and placed two American companies on an \"unreliable entities\" list \u2014 PVH Group, which owns Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, and Illumina, a biotechnology company with offices in China.",
      "Notably, however, the U.S. opted to hit China with a relatively modest tariff, rather than levies of up to 60%, as President Trump had previously threatened. For its part, Beijing also pulled its punches by targeting less vital U.S. sectors, leaving the door open for the sides to reach a deal.",
      "\"I think [Mr. Trump] backed off bigger Chinese tariffs because it became clear to him that it would eliminate any possibility of negotiation,\" trade policy expert William Reinsch, a former U.S. undersecretary of commerce for export administration and senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It would be trade prohibitive, and they would regard it basically as an act of economic warfare. So I think he went with a number that would not prevent future negotiations and would still send a signal, so he ended up with 10%.\"",
      "For now, Wall Street investors are also taking the countries' fresh trade sanctions in stride, betting that neither Mr. Trump nor Chinese President Xi Jinping are eager to start a mutually destructive economic war.",
      "\"It is all rhetoric for now. This is the negotiation stage,\" said Bill Dendy, a financial strategist at investment bank Raymond James. \"It is like two brothers starting to talk smack, and they'll start to throw punches, but they don't want to hurt each other. It's not good for anybody if it gets out of hand.\"",
      "Julian Evans-Pritchard, head of China economics at Capital Economics, told investors in a report that China's retaliatory measures have \"clearly been calibrated to try to send a message to the U.S. (and domestic audiences) without inflicting too much damage.\"",
      "Even such efforts to avert a full-blown trade war could falter, spurring Mr. Trump to pursue a harder line against China, which he has long claimed uses a range of unfair practices that disadvantage U.S. businesses and workers.",
      "\"Edge of a cliff\"",
      "Reinsch said he expects Mr. Trump and Xi to hold discussions toward a deal that could lead to tariffs being repealed, or at least put on hold. \"These are all leverage moves,\" Reinsch said. \"The purpose is to force a negotiation on whatever it is [Mr. Trump] wants to negotiate, and he is good at brinkmanship. He goes right up to the edge of the cliff like he did with Canada and Mexico, and then he backed off in a way that allowed him to declare victory.\"",
      "Mr. Trump on Feb. 1 announced 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico. But the U.S. quickly\u00a0paused those duties for one month\u00a0after leaders of both countries said they would increase their efforts to curb the flow of illicit drugs and migrants into the U.S.",
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum \"agreed to immediately supply 10,000 Mexican Soldiers on the Border separating Mexico and the United States,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social. Meanwhile, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canada would invest $1.3 billion in better protecting its southern border.",
      "\"Trudeau and Sheinbaum figured out that that's the way to play it. If Trump is given an off-ramp where he can say, 'Ok, I won,' he'll take it, and that's what happened,\" Reinsch said.",
      "Whether such dynamics will ultimately work with China, and whether Xi is willing to indulge them, remains uncertain. After all, during Mr. Trump's first term he repeatedly imposed tariffs on China, leading Beijing to retaliate each time. Some experts think Trump officials will have to push much harder to obtain the kind of changes likely to satisfy Mr. Trump.",
      "\"This marks the fifth time in a row that Beijing has retaliated to tariffs, rather than make needed reforms. The first four times happened during Trump's first term and also got zero results. At some point, President Trump needs to figure out that tariffs will not get him what he wants from China,\" Ryan Young, senior economist for the Competitive Enterprise Institute, an advocacy group that favors deregulation, said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Risks for consumers",
      "The risks of an escalating trade war between the U.S. and China are considerable, including rising inflation.",
      "\"If we continue to go down this road, that can be very detrimental to the U.S. consumer because it is the consumer that pays for these tariffs, as costs not easily absorbed by industries that have tight margins already,\" Dendy said.",
      "Unless the countries find a breakthrough, \"Americans can expect to pay a lot more for their technology goods, as well as their clothing and other things,\" he added.",
      "By contrast, U.S. prices are unlikely to soar in the short-term even if the conflict continues, economists note. For one, rising tariffs would likely slow economic growth, dampening inflation as consumers and businesses pare spending. Reinsch also notes that many American companies that import goods from China have prepared for the prospect of higher costs by preemptively building their inventories.",
      "One area where U.S. consumers could feel an immediate impact \u2014 their purchases of cheap clothing from Chinese fast-fashion retailers Shein and Temu. The new U.S. tariffs on China eliminate an exemption for packages worth less than $800, meaning that low-value goods are now subject to the levies.",
      "The U.S. receives roughly 1 billion such shipments annually.",
      "\"If you are Temu and Shein, you will probably to a hit on two grounds. They will have to start paying tariffs on dresses and T-shirts, so they will take a hit,\" Reinsch said. Those costs would be passed on the shoppers. Additionally, Mr. Trump has asked U.S. Customs and Border Protection to inspect low-value packages to screen them for fentanyl, which could create shipping delays.\"",
      "Implementing the 10% tariff on China, along with the 25% duties on imports from Canada and Mexico that are now on hold, would cost the typical U.S. household more than $1,200 a year, according to the Peterson Institute for International Economics.",

    "summary": "Researchers used advanced technology to digitally \"unroll\" an ancient Greek text on carbonized papyrus, and now they're reading it.",
    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0The Herculaneum scrolls have remained one of the many tantalizing mysteries of the ancient world for almost 2,000 years. Burnt to a crisp by lava from Mount Vesuvius in A.D.  79, the reams of rolled-up papyrus were discovered in a mansion in Herculaneum \u2014 an ancient Roman town near Pompeii \u2014 in the mid-18th century. Both towns were decimated by the Vesuvius eruption, and most of the scrolls were so badly charred they were impossible to open.",
      "Over the next two and a half centuries, attempts were made to unfurl some of the hundreds of scrolls using everything from rose water and mercury to vegetable gas and papyrus juice, according to the New Yorker.",
      "The few that could be opened were philosophical texts written in ancient Greek. But most of the scrolls were so badly damaged, they were considered illegible. More recently, researchers managed to decipher some select words using artificial intelligence, X-ray and CT scans to distinguish ink from the papyrus it was printed on.",
      "The mystery is still unravelling, and on Wednesday, a major breakthrough was announced. Researchers say they've now managed to digitally unroll and start reading one of the ancient scrolls. The scroll in question, known as PHerc. 172, is one of three stored at the University of Oxford's Bodleian Libraries in England.",
      "A team involved in the Vesuvius Challenge, a competition offering prize money to anyone who can help unlock the delicate scrolls, says it has virtually unwrapped the papyrus to reveal columns of text that Oxford scholars have already started working to decipher.",
      "\"This scroll contains more recoverable text than we have ever seen in a scanned Herculaneum scroll,\" said Brent Seales, one of the co-founders of the challenge.",
      "\"We're confident we will be able to read pretty much the whole scroll in its entirety, and it's the first time we've really been able to say that with high confidence,\" project lead Stephen Parsons told CBS News' partner network BBC News. \"Now we can work on making it show up more clearly. We're going to go from a handful of words to really substantial passages.\"",
      "The breakthrough came when the team at the Bodleian Libraries brought the blackened scroll to the Diamond Light Source research facility in nearby Oxfordshire, where technicians used a massive machine called a synchrotron to create a powerful X-ray beam that was able to peer into the fragile relic without damaging it.",
      "\"It can see things on the scale of a few thousandths of a millimeter,\" Adrian Mancuso,  the facility's director of physical sciences, told the BBC. \"We have to work out which layer is different from the next layer so we can unroll that digitally.\"",
      "Last year, the Vesuvius Challenge announced that three young students had won its $700,000 grand prize for using AI to help researchers read about 5% of another scroll, the subject of which was Greek Epicurean philosophy.",
      "The scroll that the team at the Bodleian Libraries recently unfurled is assumed to be on the same subject.",
      "\"I just love that connection with whoever collected them, whoever wrote them, whoever rolled those scrolls up and put them on the shelves,\" Nicole Gilroy, head of book conservation at the Bodleian Libraries, told the BBC. \"There's a real human aspect to it that I just think is really precious.\"",

Judges typically disfavor pre-trial publicity that risks tainting a jury pool and, in fact, the federal judge has already warned both sides against litigating the case in the media. By launching a website and publicizing evidence, Baldoni\u2019s team might be seen as trying to win in the press rather than in court, which could hurt his credibility with the judge and jury. Additionally, his focus on narrative control over legal arguments might be viewed as a distraction tactic, especially given the allegations against him. If the court perceives his strategy as an attempt to sway public opinion rather than defend himself legally, it could lead to restrictions on his team\u2019s statements or even impact procedural decisions in the case.\"",

      "\"It will take a long time to get to trial,\" he added. \"In the meantime, this will be tried in the court of public opinion. Waiting until 2026 to reclaim his reputation does Baldoni no good. He needs to defend himself publicly because he's been attacked publicly.\"",

I think the stakes are a little bit different in this case. In Johnny's case, he was suing for defamation. He was really suing to get his reputation back. It was more of an existential issue for him. A challenge that we had, and I think the other side had, but I think they really have it in this case, is to convince a jury of laypeople why they should care about a dispute between two very powerful, successful, attractive actors. And I think that's a challenge irrespective of the serious nature of the allegations.\"",

      "\"I think we are seeing more artists shift to country from both a fiscal and cultural lens. From a financial standpoint, country music audiences are some of the most loyal listeners, and the genre still somewhat prioritizes more financially beneficial dissemination methods like album sales and radio play, as opposed to other genres that almost wholly rely on streaming.

Nonetheless, considering that she has yet to release her re-recording of her debut album, I could see a country album or tracks naturally following its release. This would align with both her musical evolution and her penchant for revisiting and revitalizing her earlier work. A return to country music would not only be a nod to her origins but also a strategic embrace of the genre\u2019s current resurgence in mainstream popularity. Whether this speculation comes to fruition remains to be seen, but it\u2019s certainly within the realm of possibility for an artist known for both her musical versatility and her strategic career moves.\""

      "Topping the list of chronic diseases are heart disease, cancer, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and diabetes.",

      "Dr. Aseem Malhotra, a cardiologist and public health campaigner based in London, believes a big part of what\u2019s fueling diseases are the foods on Americans\u2019 plates. (Dr. Aseem Malhotra)",
      "Studies have shown that only one in eight Americans has optimal metabolic health, which Malhotra defines as \"the state of balance the body maintains between storing fat and burning it for energy.\"",
      "What drives metabolic health?",
      "In his bestselling book, \"The 21-Day Immunity Plan,\" Malhotra writes that metabolic health is measured using five markers.",
      "Those include blood glucose levels, blood pressure, waist circumference, cholesterol profile (the body's levels of triglycerides, a type of harmful fat found in the blood), and high-density lipoprotein (a beneficial cholesterol-carrying molecule).",
      "'GOD-INTENDED FOODS' ARE KEY TO A HEALTHIER AMERICA, EXPERT SAYS",
      "\"A person is considered to have metabolic syndrome when they fail to meet three of these optimal values,\" he writes. \"For example, someone who has high blood pressure, high blood glucose and high triglycerides would be considered to be at the highest risk of experiencing health problems.\"",
      "Poor metabolic health is directly linked to the development of heart disease, type 2 diabetes and stroke, Malhotra cautioned.",
      "Improvements can happen within just 21 to 28 days, according to Malhotra \u2014 purely from changing dietary habits.\u00a0 (iStock)",
      "It also puts people at a higher risk of cancer and dementia, as well as complications from infections.",
      "The worst things someone can do for their metabolic health, Malhotra said, is to eat a diet high in ultraprocessed foods, sugar and other low-quality carbohydrates, such as flour-based products, rice and pasta.",
      "More than 133 million Americans (40%) had at least one chronic disease in 2022.",
      "To optimize metabolic health, he recommends eating whole foods, avoiding the aforementioned foods, keeping active and reducing stress through yoga, Pilates, meditation or even regularly hugging close friends and loved ones.",

      "LARA TRUMP ON SETTING A HEALTHY EXAMPLE FOR HER CHILDREN",
      "\"That means cutting out ultraprocessed foods and eliminating what we call low-quality carbohydrates \u2014 the refined breads, the pastas, rice, potatoes,\" he said. \"If you eliminate those \u2014 I'm not saying forever, but if you do that for four to six weeks, you will actually start to reset your metabolic health.\"",
      "\"And then, of course, you can have those foods occasionally.\"",
      "Topping the list of chronic diseases are heart disease, cancer, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and diabetes. (iStock)",
      "Optimizing metabolic health doesn\u2019t mean people can\u2019t enjoy food, said Malhotra, whose father taught him to cook when he was a teenager.",
      "\"I love food like most people \u2014 it's one of the greatest pleasures of life,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"I cook every day.\"",
      "\"But I have the resources to be able to afford healthy food as well, which a lot of people don't have, and that's a real issue,\" he added.",

      "In his daily diet, Malhotra avoids ultraprocessed foods \u2014 but it wasn\u2019t always that way. He refers to himself as a \"reformed junk food and sugar addict.\"",
      "\"I used to eat fast food all the time and lots of sugar,\" he shared. \"But when I realized it wasn't good for me, I looked to the research. I converted very quickly and broke that addiction.\"",

      "\"I think that would be one of the most important things that needs to be tackled \u2014 how do we curtail the consumption of ultraprocessed food while simultaneously increasing consumption of whole foods?\"",

      "Susanne Brander, an ecotoxicologist and associate professor in Oregon State University\u2019s College of Agricultural Sciences, added, \"It\u2019s very concerning that microfibers appear to move from the gut into other tissues such as muscle. This has wide implications for other organisms, potentially including humans.\"",
      "The findings were published in the journal Frontiers in Toxicology.",

      "\"Given that humans already consume microplastics from multiple sources \u2014 including water, air and packaged foods \u2014 the presence of microplastics in seafood should be considered within this broader context rather than as an isolated risk,\" she added.",

      "Nature's ingenious design",
      "Pine cones have these amazing scales that respond to moisture. When it's damp, they close up tight. But when it's warm and dry, they open wide to release their seeds. This simple yet effective mechanism has inspired scientists to develop a smart window system that could change the way we think about energy efficiency in buildings.",

      "SOLAR DEVICE TRANSFORMS USED TIRES TO HELP PURIFY WATER SO THAT ITS DRINKABLE",
      "The Solar Gate window system",
      "Scientists from Germany's universities of Stuttgart and Freiburg have developed what is known as the\u00a0Solar Gate window facade system. It's like having tiny pinecones built right into your windows. These smart windows have special elements that curl up when it's cool and moist, letting in sunlight to warm your home. But when it's hot and dry, they flatten out to block the sun and keep things cool inside.",
      "Solar Gate window facade system (ICD/IntCDC University of Stuttgart)",
      "NEVER NEED AN EV CHARGING STATION AGAIN WITH THESE ROOFTOP SOLAR POWER PANELS",
      "How it works",
      "The Solar Gate system consists of a gridded array of pine-cone-scale-inspired self-bending elements housed between two panes of glass in an aluminum-frame window unit. Each element is ingeniously crafted with three distinct layers, each serving a unique purpose. The bottom layer is composed of a cellulose powder and a thermoplastic blend that swells when exposed to moisture. Above this lies a middle layer made of thermoplastic, which remains unaffected by moisture.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The top layer consists of flexible biocomposite filaments that serve to hold the entire structure together. When exposed to moist air, the bottom layer expands, causing the element to curl upwards. Conversely, in dry conditions, it returns to its flattened state. This simple yet effective mechanism allows the window to respond automatically to changing weather conditions, providing optimal shading and light penetration as needed.",

      "SOLAR-POWERED BLIMP COULD BRING HIGH SPEED INTERNET TO YOUR AREA",
      "Real-world testing",
      "The Solar Gate system underwent rigorous real-world testing to prove its effectiveness. In a comprehensive year-long study, researchers installed 424 Solar Gate elements in the south-facing skylight of a research building at the University of Freiburg. The results of this extensive trial were nothing short of impressive.",
      "During the cool, wet winter months, the elements responded by curling upwards, allowing ample sunlight to penetrate the building. This natural response effectively warmed and illuminated the interior spaces, reducing the need for artificial heating and lighting. Conversely, as the seasons changed and brought warmer, drier summer conditions, the elements automatically flattened out.",
      "This flattening action served to block excess sunlight, effectively keeping the building's interior cool and comfortable without the need for energy-intensive air conditioning. The test demonstrated the system's ability to autonomously adapt to changing weather conditions, providing optimal comfort and energy efficiency throughout the year.",

For instance, studies have investigated the development of shading systems using wooden slats that can open and close in response to environmental conditions.",
      "In the realm of textiles, scientists are working on \"smart\" clothing fabrics that can adapt to ambient temperature, providing optimal comfort for wearers. Perhaps most intriguingly, these principles are even being applied to the field of robotics, with researchers developing tiny mobile robots that can respond to environmental stimuli in ways inspired by natural mechanisms.

The Better Business Bureau has warned about fraudulent sports betting apps encouraging users to place \"guaranteed bets on upcoming games.\"",

Sketchy ticket resellers flood search results and social media with deals that seem too good to be true. Online ticket fraud is becoming increasingly common. While some tickets may be legitimate, many are not, with fans spending hundreds or even thousands of dollars for nothing.",
      "Scammers often utilize automation and artificial intelligence to identify and target potential victims based on the language used in their posts. For instance, scammers search for popular buzzwords and hashtags that people use when looking to buy tickets, such as #SuperBowl, #SuperBowlTickets or #LookingForTickets. They then respond to these posts with messages that contain links to other platforms like WhatsApp, Telegram or Cash App, where they attempt to finalize fraudulent deals.",

These scams appear everywhere, promising fans exclusive giveaways if they cover a small shipping fee or provide personal details. The posts look official, sometimes even using fake endorsements from players or teams, making them easy to fall for.",
      "Scammers also use cross-platform operations to evade detection and bans by social media platforms. They will identify and initiate communications with you on one social media platform before requesting you switch to another. This is likely an attempt to prevent one social media platform from gaining full insight into fraudulent activity and banning accounts.",
      "The moment you enter your information or payment details, you have handed cybercriminals access to your bank account. And those free tickets or jerseys never arrive.

      "Finally, scammers may offer massive discounts for Super Bowl tickets to entice you to buy quickly. They may state they just want to sell the tickets \"last minute\" to justify large, attractive discounts, such as 50% off or more. They may also claim to have a personal or professional reason for not being able to attend the event, such as a family emergency or a work conflict. Scammers often use these excuses to pressure victims into making hasty decisions and transferring money without verifying the tickets.",

      "While scammers will try to prey on Super Bowl fans, you are not completely helpless. Dave Lewis, Global Advisory CISO at\u00a01Password, shared some tips on staying safe leading up to the games. These are not complicated strategies, just simple cybersecurity practices that are easy to follow.",
      "1) Buy tickets from trusted sources:\u00a0Only purchase from official sites/apps and other reputable channels. Double-check URLs to avoid lookalike sites (which are designed to mimic legitimate event pages). Platforms like Facebook Marketplace, Eventbrite and Nextdoor are also hot spots for scams, so be cautious of sellers \"requiring a deposit\" through peer-to-peer financial apps like Cash App, Venmo or Zelle.",
      "2) Watch out for event-related phishing attacks: If a deal seems too good to be true, it probably is. Cybercriminals often time their phishing attacks around large events like the Super Bowl, offering fake discount tickets, VIP experiences, free food vouchers, etc. Always verify offers through the event\u2019s official website or app and never agree to anything over the phone. Double-check the sender\u2019s email address and hover over links before clicking to ensure they lead to legitimate event sites.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3) Keep your phone software and apps updated:\u00a0Regularly update your device\u2019s operating system (i.e., iOS, macOS, Windows, Android, others). \"While constant notifications can be an annoyance at the moment, these updates are essential for keeping your devices secure,\" Lewis said. If you\u2019re not sure how to get started,\u00a0check out this extensive guide on how to update all your devices.",
      "4) Use strong, unique passwords and enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Create complex passwords for all your accounts, especially those related to ticket purchases or event information. Use a\u00a0password manager to generate and store these securely. Enable\u00a02FA wherever possible, particularly for email and payment accounts. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password. For the Super Bowl, this is especially crucial for any official NFL or ticketing apps you might be using.",
      "5) Be wary of QR codes:\u00a0While convenient, QR codes can be exploited by hackers for malicious purposes. Only scan QR codes from trusted sources, such as the official event organizer. If unsure, check for signs of tampering, like stickers placed over legitimate codes or poor print quality. When in doubt, don\u2019t scan it. As a precaution, always keep your antivirus software running to prevent malware infections from scanning a scam QR code.\u00a0If you don\u2019t have antivirus software, check out my top recommendations here.",
      "6) Beware of scammers using social engineering techniques: For example, they may encourage you to transfer money immediately as they allegedly have other prospective buyers. They may also use emotional appeals, such as sympathy, guilt or urgency, to manipulate you into making a decision. Scammers often use these tactics to pressure victims into paying before verifying the tickets.",
      "7) Be wary of individuals showing receipts or proof of purchase: This is not a guarantee that an individual is in possession of a ticket, and it can be easily faked.\u00a0Scammers can use fake receipts to convince victims that they bought the tickets from legitimate sources, such as Ticketmaster, StubHub or SeatGeek.",
      "8) Exercise caution when interacting with individuals asking for you to \"name your price\" or are selling below ticket value: This may be a sign that they are trying to lure you into a scam with a too-good-to-be-true offer. Scammers often use this strategy to attract victims who are looking for cheap or affordable tickets.",
      "9)\u00a0Be cautious when interacting with people claiming to sell tickets on behalf of a friend or family member: This may provide an excuse for scammers using compromised bank accounts with the account holder's name different from the social media account being used. Scammers often use this pretext to explain the discrepancy between the names on the accounts.",
      "10)\u00a0Review the account\u2019s recent history: Some scammers may claim to be selling tickets to multiple high-profile events, such as sports games, music concerts and conferences at one time. This may indicate that they are running a large-scale scam operation and are not genuine sellers. Scammers often post multiple ads for different events on the same or different platforms, using the same or similar images and descriptions.",
      "11) Exercise caution and validate ownership: Do this even when purchasing items from friends or friends of friends on social media. A family member or friend\u2019s account can be compromised and used by a scammer. Friends of the victim can vouch for the account user as a legitimate seller, not realizing the account had been hacked.",
      "MASSIVE SECURITY FLAW PUTS MOST POPULAR BROWSERS AT RISK ON MAC",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Scammers are always looking for new ways to take advantage of football fans, especially during major events like the Super Bowl. Whether it is fake ticket sales, phishing scams or bogus giveaways, the risks are real. You can easily avoid becoming a victim of these types of attacks by staying vigilant and being cautious of emails and links that ask for personal information.",

    "published": "Sun, 02 Feb 2025 10:00:55 -0500",
    "summary": "A new scam using Elon Musk&apos;s name is making the rounds, promoting &quot;energy-saving&quot; devices and falsely linking the Tesla and SpaceX leader to the products.",
    "story": [
      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson says cybercriminals are exploiting iMessage phishing protection, tricking users to reactivate links.",
      "Elon Musk, known for leading companies like Tesla, SpaceX, Neuralink and xAI and buying and rebranding Twitter as X, often finds his name linked to innovation and futuristic ideas. But his reputation also makes him a prime target for scammers.",
      "In the past, fraudsters have used Musk\u2019s name in cryptocurrency schemes. Now, a new scam is making the rounds. This time, scammers are promoting bogus \"energy-saving\" devices, falsely associating Musk with these products to gain credibility. These devices, which don\u2019t work as advertised, are being marketed as revolutionary solutions, duping people into spending money on what is essentially a scam.",
      "We received this email from Rick in Wilkesboro, North Carolina: \"I\u2019ve been receiving emails offering an energy-saving device developed by Elon Musk. It claims the device can reduce energy bills by 50%. I never attempted to contact anyone associated with Elon Musk, nor have I done any internet searches for such a device. Are these emails legit or another attempt by scammers hoping I click on their links?\"",
      "GET SECURITY ALERTS, EXPERT TIPS - SIGN UP FOR KURT\u2019S NEWSLETTER - THE CYBERGUY REPORT HERE",
      "Rick, it sounds like those emails are likely scams. There have been numerous reports of scammers using Elon Musk's name to promote fake energy-saving devices. These scams often claim that the device can drastically reduce energy bills, but there is no evidence that Elon Musk or any of his companies are involved in such products.",
      "Let's dive into how this scam works and share some ways you can stay safe.",
      "Illustration of a scammer at work (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How does Elon Musk's energy-saving scam work?",
      "The Elon Musk energy-saving scam works by using flashy online ads, unsolicited emails and other deceptive tactics to lure victims. Scammers promote so-called \"revolutionary\" devices through social media, pop-ups, emails and even search engine ads, claiming the products are backed by Musk.",
      "These ads often include fake customer reviews, exaggerated claims of slashing electricity bills by 50% or more and time-limited discounts to create urgency. Names of devices advertised in these scams include the Power Pro Save, Heunwa Power Save, Stop Watt, Miracle Watt, True Watt, Real Watt, Watt Rescue, Esaver Watt, Pro Power Save, Voltmod and more.",
      "Clicking on these ads leads you to sales websites designed to look legitimate. They feature fake logos, doctored before-and-after photos and bogus celebrity endorsements to build trust. The sites throw around pseudo-scientific jargon like \"stabilizing electrical currents\" or \"rebalancing loads\" to sound convincing. They also use tactics like showing inflated \"regular\" prices crossed out to make the current offer seem like a huge bargain.",
      "If you look closely, though, the red flags are clear. These sites lack basic details like a company address, contact number or business registration information. Instead, they push you to place an order through an online form, demanding full payment upfront via credit card or PayPal.",
      "After paying, customers might receive a cheap, non-functional plastic device, or sometimes nothing at all. These devices don\u2019t reduce electricity usage. They might even waste more power. But by the time you realize it, the scammers have already pocketed your money.",

      "DON\u2019T CLICK THAT LINK! HOW TO SPOT AND PREVENT PHISHING ATTACKS IN YOUR INBOX",
      "The truth about energy-saving devices",
      "Over the years, plenty of power-saving scams have promised to cut down or even eliminate your electricity bill by simply plugging in their devices. The reality is that there\u2019s no device you can plug in that will actually reduce your electricity usage or lower your household bill.",
      "These products often claim to \"stabilize voltage\" or \"reduce power waste.\" While voltage stabilization can be useful in industrial settings, it doesn\u2019t make much difference for typical home appliances. Most household appliances are already designed to run efficiently without the issues these devices claim to fix.",
      "If you\u2019re serious about saving on electricity, focus on\u00a0practical solutions like upgrading to energy-efficient appliances, using smart home devices or adjusting your energy usage schedule.",

      "Red flags to watch out for",
      "Too good to be true: Claims of reducing energy bills by 50% or more are often exaggerated and unrealistic.",
      "Unsolicited emails: Receiving emails out of the blue, especially when you haven't shown interest in such products, is a common tactic used by scammers.",
      "Use of celebrity names: Scammers frequently use well-known names like Elon Musk to lend credibility to their schemes.",
      "Suspicious links: Be cautious of clicking on links in unsolicited emails. They can lead to phishing sites designed to steal your personal information. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "10 ways to stay safe from such scams",
      "1. Verify the email: Phishing emails are a common tool scammers use to trick people into buying fake products or giving away personal information. These emails often look like they\u2019re from legitimate sources, but they contain links that lead to fraudulent websites or prompt you to download malicious attachments. Always check the sender's email address and look for signs of a fake message, like poor grammar or urgent calls to action.",
      "2. Verify claims: If you're curious about a product, do some research from reputable sources before taking any action.",
      "3. Do not click links: Avoid clicking on any links or downloading attachments from these emails. Instead, hover over the link to see its true destination. This can help you identify if it leads to a legitimate site or a malicious one.",
      "4. Have strong antivirus software actively running on your devices: Ensure you have reliable antivirus software installed on your devices. Antivirus software helps protect your devices from malware, viruses and other security threats. Regularly update the software to ensure it can detect and remove the latest threats. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "5. Examine the website carefully: Scammers often create websites that look professional, but they\u2019re easy to spot with a few simple checks. Look for missing or suspicious information, like the absence of a business address, phone number or business registration details. If there are fake testimonials or celebrity endorsements, that\u2019s a red flag.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "6. Don\u2019t fall for \"too good to be true\" deals:\u00a0Scammers rely on offering deals that seem too good to pass up, like massive discounts or a \"limited time offer.\" If an ad claims you can save 50% or more on a product, be skeptical. Real, quality products usually don\u2019t come with such extreme savings, and high-tech devices like those promoted by scammers rarely live up to the hype. If it feels like too good a deal, it probably is.",
      "7. Watch out for unusual payment methods: One of the easiest ways to spot a scam is by how the scammers ask you to pay. If a website asks for payment upfront via credit card or PayPal with no option to verify or ship the product first, it's a major red flag. Scammers take your money upfront and have no intention of sending you anything of value. Stick to reputable payment methods that offer buyer protection and avoid sites that ask for payment without proper verification.",
      "8. Mark spam email as junk or spam: Most email providers have a\u00a0feature that allows you to flag spam emails and move them to a separate folder. This can help you filter out spam emails from your inbox and also improve the spam detection of your email provider.",
      "9. Do not share your email address publicly or with unknown sources: This can reduce the chances of your email address being collected by spammers. You can also use a disposable email or email alias for signing up for online services that you do not trust or need.",
      "10. Use a personal data removal service:\u00a0Scammers can obtain your information from various online sources, including data brokers, people search sites and public records. Using a data removal service can help reduce your digital footprint, making it harder for scammers to access your personal information. This proactive step can be crucial in preventing identity theft and minimizing the chances of falling victim to scams.",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "YOUR EMAIL DIDN'T EXPIRE, IT'S JUST ANOTHER SNEAKY SCAM",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Impersonation scams are a common way scammers steal your money. They often use well-known names like Elon Musk or big companies like Microsoft and Walmart to make you trust them, then trick you into giving away your financial details. To stay safe, avoid unsolicited emails or texts that promote products or offers. If you need to buy something, stick to trusted sellers like Amazon, Best Buy or other reputable platforms. Always double-check the legitimacy of any offer before making a purchase, especially if it comes from an unfamiliar source.",

The vulnerability is a \"zero-day\" flaw, meaning criminals may have already exploited it, according to the latest security advisory from the company. Zero-day flaws like this are especially dangerous because they are exploited before developers can issue fixes. Apple confirmed this marks its first zero-day patch of 2025. The vulnerability affects iPhones dating back to 2018\u2019s XS model, as well as newer iPads, Macs, and even the Vision Pro headset.",
      "The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-24085, resides in Apple\u2019s Core Media framework, a software layer responsible for processing multimedia files. A \"use after free\" memory corruption error enabled hackers to manipulate the system into executing unstable code, granting them elevated privileges to bypass security protocols. Apple\u2019s advisory suggests hackers weaponized the flaw through malicious apps disguised as legitimate media players. These apps likely abused the Core Media framework by triggering corrupted files, enabling attackers to infiltrate devices.",

      "The history of Gaza that Trump was referring to is both a long and tumultuous one.",
      "Gaza\u2019s history dates back nearly 4,000 years, frequently appearing in biblical narratives. It was one of the five key cities of the Philistines, who arrived from the Aegean, known for their clashes with the Israelites. The story of Samson, who tore down a Philistine temple, is one of the earliest recorded tales of destruction and rebuilding in Gaza. Over centuries, it was conquered by the Egyptians, Babylonians and Persians, each bringing new rulers and forcing population shifts. Even then, Gaza was a land where people came and went, often not by choice.",
      "Under the Ottoman Empire (1517\u20131917), Gaza was a military stronghold. The Ottomans used it as a buffer zone, and while some periods saw growth, it was frequently abandoned during wars. In 1799, Napoleon\u2019s forces briefly occupied it before retreating. Once again, Gaza was left in ruins, and its population had to start over.",

      "As European Union leaders convened for a meeting in Brussels, Frederiksen addressed President Donald Trump's prospect of acquiring control of Greenland, a self-governing territory of Denmark, a U.S. ally, through military or economic force.\u00a0\"I think we have been very clear from the Kingdom of Denmark, with great support from the European partners and the European Union, that everybody has to respect the sovereignty of all national states in the world, and that Greenland is today a part of the Kingdom of Denmark, it is a part of our territory, and it's not for sale,\" Frederiksen told reporters, speaking in English. \"The chairman, the leader of Greenland, has been very clear that they are not for sale.\"",

They [the U.S.] are already there, and they can have more possibilities. And at the same time, we are willing to scale up from the Kingdom of Denmark. And I think NATO is the same. So if this is about securing our part of the world, we can find a way forward.\"",

      "\"You have to ask yourself, how are we going to solve that problem, solve our own national security if that means that we need to take more territorial interests in Greenland? That is what President Trump is going to do, because he doesn't care about what the Europeans scream at us. He cares about putting the interests of America's citizens first,\" Vance said, adding, \"You've got probably 55,000 people living on Greenland who are not actually happy with Danish government. They've got great natural resources there. They've got an incredibly bountiful country that the Danes aren't letting them develop and explore. Of course, Donald Trump would take a different approach if he was the leader of Greenland.\"",

      "Netanyahu was last at the White House on July 25, 2024, with then-President Biden having only invited the Israeli leader some 20 months after his re-election. This was widely viewed as a snub by Biden, whose party has increasingly distanced itself from traditional bipartisan support for the Jewish state.",

      "This proposal comes after Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with Bukele at his lakeside country house outside San Salvador on Monday.",
      "\"We have offered the United States of America the opportunity to outsource part of its prison system,\" Bukele wrote on X Monday night. \"We are willing to take in only convicted criminals (including convicted U.S. citizens) into our mega-prison (CECOT) in exchange for a fee. The fee would be relatively low for the U.S. but significant for us, making our entire prison system sustainable.\"",

      "\"We can send them, and he will put them in his jails,\" Rubio told reporters, referring to illegal immigrants behind bars in U.S. prisons. \"And, he\u2019s also offered to do the same for dangerous criminals currently in custody and serving their sentences in the United States, even though they\u2019re U.S. citizens or legal residents.\"",
      "While Bukele did extend the offer to include violent American criminals, it is highly unlikely that part of the offer would actually happen, since it is illegal to deport U.S. citizens. A U.S. official said the Trump administration has no plans to deport American citizens, but noted that Bukele's offer was significant.",
      "The proposal with El Salvador, known as a \"safe third country\" agreement, could potentially be an option for Venezuelan gang members convicted in the U.S. if Venezuela refuses to accept them, and Rubio said Bukele offered to accept detainees of any nationality.",
      "Bukele also said he would take back all Salvadoran MS-13 gang members in the U.S. illegally, and promised to accept and incarcerate criminal illegal aliens from any country, especially those affiliated with Venezuela's Tren de Aragua gang.",

      "Rubio was visiting El Salvador to push for more help in supporting President Donald Trump's mass deportation plan. He arrived in San Salvador shortly after watching a U.S.-funded deportation flight carrying 43 illegal immigrants leave from Panama for Colombia.",
      "The deportation flight had 32 men and 11 women detained by Panamanian authorities after illegally crossing the Darien Gap from Colombia. The State Department said the deportations send a message of deterrence.",
      "\"Mass migration is one of the great tragedies in the modern era,\" Rubio said afterward. \"It impacts countries throughout the world. We recognize that many of the people who seek mass migration are often victims and victimized along the way, and it\u2019s not good for anyone.\"",

    "story": [
      "On Monday,\u00a0a\u00a0team at IBM that is contracted to manage human resources data for more than 500,000 federal employees received an\u00a0unusual\u00a0request to provide \u201cread-only\u201d access for the HR records for\u00a0all\u00a014,000 employees of the General Services Administration, according to a source familiar with the contract.",
      "The email was from IBM\u2019s regular contact at the GSA, the agency that manages federal property.\u00a0But\u00a0the request was\u00a0odd since the agency already\u00a0had \u201cread and write\u201d access to the data.",
      "The request and the\u00a0questions it raised were one example of the suspicion and speculation in Washington as President Donald Trump and Elon Musk conduct an unprecedented effort to shrink the federal workforce and slash federal programs that is shrouded in secrecy.",
      "Democrats have criticized\u00a0Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency for failing to disclose the names of its staff members, its criteria for laying off certain government workers and its rationale for cutting programs. Which government data they are accessing remains not fully known.",
      "As of Wednesday, NBC News has confirmed that DOGE officials have been active at the Centers for\u00a0Medicare and Medicaid Services, which oversees health care for more than 139 million people; the U.S. Agency for International Development; the Department of Veterans Affairs; and the U.S. Treasury.",
      "A White House spokesperson did not\u00a0directly answer a question about whether\u00a0DOGE requested the human resources records of the 14,000 GSA employees from IBM.",
      "\u201cDOGE is fulfilling President Trump\u2019s commitment to making government more accountable, efficient, and, most importantly, restoring proper stewardship of the American taxpayer\u2019s hard-earned dollars,\u201d the spokesperson said.",
      "Six hours after NBC News asked the White House about the request for the GSA data, it was withdrawn, according to a source familiar with the contract.",
      "Republicans\u00a0have hailed DOGE. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., told reporters this week he was pleased with Musk. \u201cI think he\u2019s doing a very important service for the people in that he is digging into the details of how taxpayer dollars are being spent,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThat was a campaign promise that the president made,\u00a0we all made, and Elon is a big part of this.\u201d",
      "DOGE\u2019s plans at the GSA are unclear, but this week the commissioner of its Public Buildings Service wrote an email to staff members obtained by NBC News informing the workforce that the GSA \u201cis going to be a substantially smaller organization in the future.\u201d",
      "Questions persist",
      "More than two weeks after Trump signed a 660-word\u00a0executive order\u00a0that established DOGE,\u00a0confusion about it\u00a0persists.",

      "At the Defense Department on Thursday, officials had not responded to questions about who is on the Pentagon\u2019s DOGE team.",
      "Three\u00a0federal employees said a lack of transparency about DOGE exists at their agencies.\u00a0Another current employee who has been handling DOGE requests said Musk\u2019s team is\u00a0zeroing\u00a0in on data: \u201cIt\u2019s very focused on data; they want data.\u201d",
      "Jacqueline Simon,\u00a0policy director\u00a0for the\u00a0American Federation of Government Employees,\u00a0the union that represents more than 700,000 federal workers,\u00a0said workers across the federal government\u00a0have very little information about what DOGE is doing and who is doing it.",
      "\u201cWe have no information on how many people have been hired for DOGE specifically,\u201d\u00a0Simon said.",
      "Musk\u2019s DOGE\u00a0has bragged about its cuts at the GSA in posts online.\u00a0On Tuesday, DOGE\u2019s X account boasted about canceling contracts at the GSA.\u00a0Last week, a DOGE post singled out how the leases for government office space were canceled and claimed millions in taxpayer funds were saved.",
      "\u201cThe GSA terminated three leases of mostly empty office space, with tenants relocating to nearby buildings in the GSA portfolio,\u201d the post said. \u201cWith savings of $1.6M, these are the first steps to right size the Federal real estate portfolio of more than 7,500 leases.\u201d",
      "The\u00a0White House statement added: \u201cThose leading this mission with Elon Musk are doing so in full compliance with federal law, appropriate security clearances, and as employees of the relevant agencies, not as outside advisors or entities. The ongoing operations of DOGE may be seen as disruptive by those entrenched in the federal bureaucracy, who resist change. While change can be uncomfortable, it is necessary and aligns with the mandate supported by more than 77 million American voters.\u201d",
      "Sensitive data",
      "Simon, of the American Federation of Government Employees, said she doubts DOGE staff members have proper clearances to have access to sensitive government data.",
      "\u201cIt seems impossible that any of the DOGE people underwent proper security or background checks,\u201d\u00a0she said.\u00a0\u201cThere simply wouldn\u2019t have been enough time to perform these checks.\u201d",
      "The\u00a0White House spokesperson said concerns about the possible misuse of Social Security numbers, dates of birth and personnel records in human resources data viewed by DOGE were unnecessary. \u201cThey are not there to look at your Social Security number,\u201d the spokesperson said.",
      "The spokesperson declined to say how many employees DOGE had but said increasing its transparency was a goal of the White House."

    "story": [
      "The courts are slamming the brakes on some of President Donald Trump's efforts to quickly trim and transform the federal government.",
      "In his first weeks in office, Trump has signed more than 50 executive orders aimed at reshaping the government, from targeting birthright citizenship to changing how transgender inmates are housed. Government agencies have also used the orders to try to freeze federal funding nationwide and offer buyouts to the bulk of government employees.",
      "The flood of orders has led to over two dozen lawsuits to date and a number of court decisions halting \u2014 at least temporarily \u2014 some of Trump's actions. At least three such decisions were released Thursday.",
      "And on Thursday night, a pair of unions sued the Trump administration over its efforts to dismantle the U.S. Agency for International Development.",
      "Here's a look at Trump orders the courts have halted:",
      "DOGE",
      "Retirees and union members filed a legal challenge to the Treasury Department's decision to allow staffers from Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, access to the federal government\u2019s massive payment and collections system \u2014 and the personal data housed in it.",
      "Arguing that the move violated federal privacy laws, they're seeking an order barring DOGE from accessing the data and requiring the return of any data that has already been harvested. The Justice Department has agreed to restrict some access to the systems pending the results of a full hearing on the matter on Feb. 24.",
      "In a related case this week, a group of union members filed a suit seeking to block DOGE, which Trump created, from accessing confidential information from the Labor Department.",
      "Another challenge is in the pipeline: A coalition of 12 states announced plans Thursday to sue over DOGE's access to the Treasury system, as well.",
      "Government buyouts",
      "As part of Trump's effort to downsize the federal workforce, the Office of Personnel Management recently announced a mass \"deferred resignation\" program that would allow workers to resign now but get paid through September. The stated deadline to accept the offer was Thursday night, and a senior administration official said earlier in the day that 60,000 people had accepted.",
      "Labor unions for federal workers\u00a0sued to stop\u00a0the program, arguing that the Trump administration does not have legal authority to offer such buyouts.",
      "A federal judge in Boston blocked the government Thursday from implementing the buyouts until at least Monday, when he will have a hearing on the issue.",
      "One consequence of the judge's order is that it also extended how long workers have to respond to the resignation offer.",
      "\u201cWe are grateful to the Judge for extending the deadline so more federal workers who refuse to show up to the office can take the Administration up on this very generous, once-in-a-lifetime offer,\u201d White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told NBC News in a statement.",
      "Birthright citizenship",
      "One of the most controversial of Trump's executive orders was one called \u201cProtecting the Meaning and Value of American Citizenship,\u201d which seeks to restrict birthright citizenship. It seeks to limit such citizenship to people who have at least one parent who is a U.S. citizen or permanent resident, and it says that those born to parents who are in the country legally but temporarily will no longer be automatically guaranteed citizenship, including those with high-skill work visas and student visas.",
      "A number of lawsuits across the country are challenging the order. Federal judges in Maryland and Washington state this week issued nationwide preliminary injunctions blocking it from taking effect.",
      "In his ruling Thursday, U.S. District Judge John C. Coughenour wrote, \"Citizenship by birth is an unequivocal constitutional right.\"",
      "The judge in Seattle wrote, \"The President cannot change, limit or qualify this Constitutional right via an executive order.\"",
      "The Justice Department appealed the Seattle decision Thursday night.",
      "Funding freeze",
      "A pair of federal judges temporarily blocked a\u00a0federal aid funding freeze\u00a0directed by the Trump administration in response to his executive orders.",
      "A memo from the Office of Management and Budget last week directed federal agencies to \u201ctemporarily pause\u00a0all activities related to obligation or disbursement of all Federal financial assistance, and other relevant agency activities that may be implicated by the executive orders\u201d pertaining to topics like foreign aid and diversity, equity and inclusion programs.",
      "The memo said the pause would allow the administration to review which programs are \u201cconsistent\u201d with Trump\u2019s agenda.",
      "The vaguely worded memo was withdrawn after confusion about what aid would be halted spread and people and organizations reported being unable to access systems to receive federal aid.",
      "In a ruling Friday, U.S. District Judge John J. McConnell in Rhode Island signed off on a temporary restraining order after the memo was withdrawn, noting that Leavitt had tweeted to the public that \u201cThis is\u00a0NOT a rescission\u00a0of the federal funding freeze. It is simply a rescission of the OMB memo.\"",
      "The judge found the White House's actions appeared to violate the law. \u201cFederal law specifies how the Executive should act if it believes that appropriations are inconsistent with the President\u2019s priorities \u2014 it must ask Congress, not act unilaterally,\u201d he wrote.",
      "Before U.S. District Judge Loren AliKhan issued her ruling Monday in the separate Washington, D.C., case, she noted that even after the memo was withdrawn, there were \u201cindividuals who are still having issues accessing funding platforms.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat indicates to me the memo is still doing some work,\u201d she said.",
      "Transgender inmates",
      "Another of Trump\u2019s orders targeted transgender inmates, saying the federal Bureau of Prisons was now required to ensure that \u201cmales are not detained in women\u2019s prisons.\u201d",
      "That led to two lawsuits filed on behalf of four transgender women prisoners who were scheduled to be transferred to men's facilities. They argued that the order constituted cruel and unusual punishment because they would be at serious risk of violence and sexual assault in a facility for men.",
      "Two judges blocked the inmates from being moved.",
      "In a suit involving three of the prisoners, U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth in Washington, D.C., concluded that \u201cthe public interest in seeing the plaintiffs relocated immediately to male facilities is slight at best.\u201d",
      "Lamberth noted that \"by the defendants\u2019 own admission, there are only about sixteen male-to-female transgender women housed in female penitentiaries, including the plaintiffs.\u201d He said the government had not even alleged the three prisoners \u201cpresent any\u00a0threat to the female inmates housed with them, or that this threat cannot be managed locally by prison staff.\""

What\u2019s nagging me is the suspicion that this is all a scam.

      "Before the sun even rose in the nation\u2019s capital Thursday, an email once again went out widely to federal employees prompting them to resign. The email, carrying the subject line \u201cFinal Day Fork in the Road,\u201d cautioned workers that \u201cthere will not be an extension of this program.\u201d",
      "The so-called \u201cFork in the Road\u201d resembles an ultimatum that Musk sent employees when he took control of Twitter (now known as X) and told them to make a choice: stay and work in an \u201cextremely hardcore\u201d environment \u2014 or head to the exits with severance.",
      "In a message to Education Department employees Wednesday, the American Federation of Government Employees called the resignation package pitched by the Trump administration \u201ceerily similar to the situation at Twitter, where employees are still suing Elon Musk for severance pay promised under his own \u2018Fork in the Road\u2019 offers.\u2019 \u2026 We must not fall for the same trap.\u201d",
      "More than 60,000 workers had already accepted what\u2019s formally known as a \u201cdeferred resignation\u201d as of Thursday afternoon, according to a senior administration official.",
      "But large numbers of federal workers intended on resisting the mounting pressure and staying put. More than a dozen employees who spoke to NBC News in the last week said they were not even considering taking the offer.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not giving in no matter how many emails were sent today hounding us,\u201d one employee at Veterans Affairs said earlier this week.",
      "An employee at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency struck a similar chord: \u201cThe offer and those that are offering it assume that a large enough portion of the federal workforce is motivated primarily by money. While salary is important, we are driven by our commitment to the mission to protect our country and by our oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States.\u201d",
      "Still, large swaths of workers remain unsure how to proceed. In an interview, a human resources supervisor under the Department of Health and Human Services said she was \u201con the fence about the buyout and may take it.\u201d The sense of fear and confusion was rampant across her workplace; one colleague \u201ccalled me yesterday for an hour crying, trying to decide and overwhelmed\u201d about whether to accept the proposal from the OPM, she said.",
      "The human resources supervisor \u2014 who, like many federal workers who spoke to NBC News, asked not to be named \u2014 said she was worried the Trump administration\u2019s aggressive push to cut down the federal workforce and remake the architecture of the national government could create lasting harm.",
      "\u201cEveryone is saying, \u2018This isn\u2019t legal.\u2019 But ultimately, it doesn\u2019t matter whether it is. The entire system is being broken with no consequences.\u201d",
      "Shelly, an information systems security manager who asked that her last name and government agency not be specified, said she thought the first buyout email in her inbox might be junk because it looked unprofessional.",
      "\u201cThe very first message that came out, I thought it was spam,\u201d Shelly told \u201cNBC Nightly News\u201d this week. \u201cI thought it was a phishing message, and a lot of people thought the same thing. \u2026 I\u2019m the information security person, and we basically sent it to our security operations center because it did not look like normal information we get from OPM. It looks so unofficial.\u201d",
      "At the General Services Administration, which handles real estate and building services for the federal government, one employee said Wednesday the pressure to resign was unlike anything he previously experienced at a workplace.",
      "\u201cEvery two, three hours, we\u2019re getting these messages telling us to resign or face consequences,\u201d the GSA employee said. \u201cAnd we had staff meetings yesterday afternoon and this morning, and we were told, basically, not enough people have taken the resignation offer, therefore they\u2019re going to go ahead and start looking to implement reductions in force.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd they just keep telling us, \u2018take the offer to leave\u2019 and \u2018take the offer to leave,\u2019\u201d the person added. \u201cThat it\u2019s a better offer than what\u2019s coming down the line.\u201d",
      "In at least one instance, federal workers were notified about the \u201cfork in the road\u201d just days before the deadline. National Security Agency employees received emails offering a voluntary early retirement option on Tuesday night, according to a source with direct knowledge of the matter.",
      "In a subsequent town hall meeting with the director of the agency Wednesday, staff members did not get much clarity on whether people who accept the offer would receive the benefits and pensions to which they\u2019re entitled.",
      "In the case of at least one federal agency, employees have reason to suspect the government will not hold up its end of the buyout bargain.",
      "Top officials at the Education Department told staff members Wednesday that if they say yes to the administration\u2019s deferred resignation package, Trump\u2019s education secretary may later cancel it \u2014 leaving employees without any recourse and potentially depriving them of promised pay.",
      "It was not immediately clear whether that caveat applied to other federal agencies.",
      "In responses to requests for comment, spokespeople for the Education Department and the OPM pointed to a memo that said the resignation offer\u2019s \u201cassurances are binding on the government. Were the government to backtrack on its commitments, an employee would be entitled to request a rescission of his or her resignation.\u201d",
      "However, the memo includes a sample agreement that has a clause saying the agency heads can rescind the deals \u2014 and that employees waive the right to challenge them in front of the Merit Systems Protection Board, an independent agency that reviews federal workers\u2019 claims, \u201cor any other forum.\u201d",
      "A sample agreement circulated among Education Department employees, obtained by NBC News, included similar language and stipulated that taking the resignation offer is final.",
      "In response to the federal judge\u2019s pause on the buyout program, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said: \u201cWe are grateful to the Judge for extending the deadline so more federal workers who refuse to show up to the office can take the Administration up on this very generous, once-in-a-lifetime offer.\u201d"

    "title": "How Elon Musk boosted false USAID conspiracy theories to shut down global aid",
    "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2025 10:00:00 GMT",
    "summary": "Elon Musk drove fringe viewpoints on USAID into the mainstream on X, as the Trump administration halted the humanitarian relief agency\u2019s work.",
    "story": [
      "Until recently, Elon Musk seldom posted about the U.S. Agency for International Development on X, where he is wont to share his thoughts on nearly every subject.",
      "Then on Sunday came a flurry of posts wherein the world\u2019s richest person, the Trump-appointed head of the new Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, described USAID, the foreign humanitarian assistance agency, as \u201ca viper\u2019s nest of radical-left marxists who hate America,\u201d \u201cevil\u201d and \u201ca criminal organization.\u201d",
      "\u201cTime for it to die,\u201d Musk posted.",
      "Musk\u2019s sudden \u2014 and consequential \u2014 interest in USAID did not emerge from a vacuum: The agency has long been a target of criticism that its aid programs masked nation-meddling and overspent American tax dollars abroad. Some conspiracy theories alleged that the global humanitarian programs were a cover for biowarfare research or that USAID\u2019s funding enriched an elite few who control the world.",
      "But until very recently, those claims were largely outside the mainstream, and USAID, which delivers billions of dollars of food and medicine to more than 100 countries, generally enjoyed bipartisan support in Washington.",
      "That is no longer the case: President Donald Trump told reporters Monday that while he appreciated \u201cthe concept\u201d of USAID, the people in the agency \u201cturned out to be radical left lunatics.\u201d Trump signed an executive order freezing foreign aid, and the agency is expected to be reduced to about 290 workers of the more than 5,000 foreign service officers, civil servants and personal service contractors it currently employs, according to two sources familiar with the plans.",
      "Most of Musk\u2019s more than 160 posts about USAID have been responses to a handful of small but influential verified accounts, many of them using pseudonyms. The most popular \u2014\u00a0including posts from Wall Street Apes, Kanekoa the Great, Chief Nerd and Autism Capital \u2014 have been viewed hundreds of millions of times, amplified by Musk and his 216 million followers, according to X metrics. As the theories spread, they are repackaged, and in many cases added upon, to further the claims.",
      "A review of the accounts\u2019 profiles reveals how a lengthy crusade to paint USAID as a malevolent force built up in recent years in relatively fringe internet circles, only to be suddenly elevated and acted upon by Musk. The pattern is similar to one that played out with the so-called Twitter Files in 2022, when selectively framed narratives and out-of-context internal documents were weaponized to fuel allegations of a grand government censorship conspiracy. And it is one likely to continue under Trump and Musk, who have histories of trafficking in falsehoods.",
      "Musk has not offered evidence for his descriptions of USAID \u2014 in an X Space, he called it \u201ca ball of worms.\u201d Trump said a report on its \u201ctremendous fraud\u201d is forthcoming and released a list of projects funded by the agency, including efforts to support diversity and inclusion, and examples of projects that had unintended and problematic consequences, including agriculture work that wound up supporting poppy farming in Afghanistan.",
      "The Trump administration, Musk and the State Department, which now oversees USAID, did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "In recent days, Musk has promoted the anonymous account DataRepublican and a corresponding searchable website of government grants and charities. X users have taken to plugging in the names of politicians and media figures who have spoken against the shuttering of USAID and charting organizations they are connected to, misrepresenting their opposition.",
      "\u201cThe money laundering is done through several intermediaries,\u201d Musk posted Thursday.",
      "Influencers often collaborate with their audiences in that way to build conspiracy theories, according to Kate Starbird, a professor at the University of Washington, who was one of the earliest researchers to study online rumors.",
      "\u201cBut now many of those influencers have immense power, both financial and political,\u201d Starbird said. \u201cNot only are they shaping the content and flow of those conspiracy theories, but [they are also] making hugely impactful decisions and shaping the structure of political institutions based upon them.\u201d",
      "The overarching message seems to be resonating beyond X, to networks like Gab and Telegram, according to Pyrra, a platform that monitors social media.",
      "\u201cTwo narratives permeate the MAGA argument against USAID,\u201d said Eric Curwin, Pyrra\u2019s chief technology officer: \u201cthat it\u2019s a tool of the left\u201d and that \u201cit\u2019s a lawless organization, without oversight and rife with fraud.\u201d",
      "A key voice behind both the Twitter Files and the USAID conspiracy theories is Mike Benz, a former Trump administration official-turned-conservative researcher whom Musk has promoted and interacted with on X more than 40 times in the past week.",
      "Benz, a self-described cybersecurity expert who briefly worked as an assistant deputy for international communications for the State Department under Trump, started tweeting about USAID in 2022. He framed its funding of a handbook on disinformation from a nonprofit democracy consortium as evidence of an agency-run global internet censorship program.",
      "Over the next two years, he posted waves of tweets and dozens of hours of video presentations marked with highlighted texts and red notes, scribbles, circles and arrows, flicking at a sprawling narrative of USAID as a covert operations division of the CIA in which staff members sought to enrich themselves, spread leftist ideology at home and abroad and harm Trump. The theory alleged that USAID was behind the mass censorship of Americans, as well as global efforts to manipulate social media, rig elections and quash dissent.",
      "\u201cBenz runs the same playbook every time,\u201d said Renee DiResta, an associate research professor at Georgetown University and author of a book about how fringe creators, including Benz, increasingly influence public opinion. \u201cHe picks a villain, pretends it has ties to the CIA or some 'deep state' and acts as if he has inside knowledge when he\u2019s really just decontextualizing public content. The remarkable thing is that the masters of the universe seem to repeatedly fall for it.\u201d",
      "Benz did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "USAID provided humanitarian assistance to foreign countries as an independent agency. It has always faced criticism from groups arguing that it lacks accountability, that its results are difficult to quantify and that its projects do not always align with a clear national agenda, said Andrew Natsios, USAID\u2019s administrator during the George W. Bush administration. But never has the entire agency, which Natsios said safeguards against the international spread of disease, famine-induced immigration and a host of other dangers to the United States, been so demonized.",
      "Ian Bremmer, the president and founder of the Eurasia Group, a geopolitical consulting firm, agreed.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a big organization in a huge government, and clearly there are lots of inefficiencies, plenty of programs that I\u2019m sure any sensible American would find that we\u2019re spending too much money on or that shouldn\u2019t be continued,\u201d Bremmer said.",
      "\u201cIf you ask me does an organization like USAID scream for reform, along with pretty much every part of the U.S. government, the answer is, of course, yes,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut the idea that the organization is somehow criminal or evil or that all the money is wasted is, on its face, ludicrous.\u201d",
      "But according to Benz\u2019s posts, USAID\u2019s crimes are plenty, and they go straight to the top, accusations he lobs in rapid speeches filled with acronyms and hyperbole.",
      "Benz paints a federal grant to a journalism outfit as proof USAID funded the 2019 impeachment of Trump; in reality, the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, a global investigative news consortium in part funded by USAID, has produced significant reporting, including the Panama Papers, a massive leak of financial details about secret offshore accounts in 2016, and it revealed Rudy Giuliani\u2019s political activities in Ukraine.",
      "For Benz, funding to a scientific research nonprofit is evidence that USAID played a role in starting the pandemic. He draws that conclusion based on contributions of funding by USAID \u2014\u00a0along with the National Institutes of Health, the Defense Department and other government agencies \u2014 to the EcoHealth Alliance, in part to identify emerging infectious diseases. One organization EcoHealth worked with was the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China, a potential origin point of the Covid pandemic, though scientists and authorities are divided over the lab-leak theory.",
      "\u201cSo our U.S. tax dollars were used effectively to, in the end, kill Americans, which is insane,\u201d Musk said of USAID in an X Space on Monday.",
      "Benz also cites unspecified \u201csource docs\u201d as substantiation that USAID was censoring social media. From former President Barack Obama to the Bush family, \u201cthey\u2019re all in on it,\u201d he told a Newsmax host Tuesday.",
      "Benz was a relative unknown until 2022, when he positioned himself as the primary researcher behind a conservative fight against perceived government censorship. His Twitter Files research \u2014 which he rolled out in hourslong videos and posted on X, then known as Twitter \u2014\u00a0consisted of poring over government websites, academic documents, news reports and internal Twitter communications to draw what he claimed were connections among them that showed intent to silence conservatives.",
      "Few seemed to question Benz\u2019s qualifications, and fewer still seemed to be aware of his identity as a former alt-right vlogger, a self-described white identitarian who posted videos under the alias Frame Game alleging a mass censorship conspiracy against white people, with links to Jewish organizations, the U.S. government and social media companies. (After NBC News published an article connecting Benz, who is Jewish, to Frame Game in 2023, he said the account was a covert effort intended to somehow combat the antisemitism it espoused.)",
      "Since then, his profile has only grown in conservative circles, where he runs a \u201cfree speech watchdog\u201d organization and has been promoted by Musk, Donald Trump Jr., Tucker Carlson and Joe Rogan. In 2023, he made $253,889 in consulting fees from the Institute for Citizen Focused Service, a nonprofit public policy think tank led by former Trump officials, tax filings show.",
      "Benz\u2019s USAID theories have again made him a darling of right-wing media. This week, he has appeared on NewsNation, Glenn Greenwald\u2019s Rumble show and Steve Bannon\u2019s \u201cWar Room.\u201d On Wednesday, Benz hosted a full hour of Charlie Kirk\u2019s podcast.",
      "Before Musk led the charge to terminate USAID, his companies worked with and took funding from it. Tesla holds a stake in a company called Zola, which is funded in part by USAID to bring renewable energy to agricultural communities in sub-Saharan Africa. And Musk\u2019s aerospace and defense contractor, SpaceX, partnered with USAID to bring its Starlink satellite internet service to Ukraine in 2022 after Russia\u2019s invasion destroyed telecommunications infrastructure.",
      "While Musk and his businesses were lauded initially for bringing Wi-Fi service to Ukraine, controversy erupted after SpaceX withheld Starlink access from Ukraine\u2019s military, effectively thwarting its drone attack on Russia\u2019s Black Sea Fleet in 2022, which Musk said he did to avoid being complicit in a \u201cmajor act of war.\u201d Russian troops also reportedly obtained and began using Starlink against Ukraine within its borders. Musk denied Starlink terminals were sold to Russia. Last year, Democrats on the House Oversight Committee initiated a probe, and USAID\u2019s inspector general was investigating Starlink\u2019s use in Ukraine as part of its own accountability checks.",
      "On Wednesday, Musk shared a faked video claiming USAID had sponsored celebrity visits to Ukraine. Darren Linvill, a co-director of Clemson University\u2019s Media Forensics Hub, told NBC News the video was manufactured Russian propaganda.",
      "The impact of false conspiracy theories on USAID \u2014 whether they have directly shaped Musk\u2019s actions at the agency or provided a convenient justification \u2014 is already being felt. Critical medical supplies, essential medicines and food aid are being withheld from their intended international recipients, and aid workers are scrambling to comply with the ordered shutdown of the agency on Friday.",
      "\u201cAll of these things have been in the mix for a long time,\u201d said Joseph Uscinski, a professor at the University of Miami who studies conspiracy theories. \u201cNow it\u2019s coming from the president, and it\u2019s got real teeth attached to it.\u201d",
      "On Tuesday, Benz took to X to suggest more was coming.",
      "\u201cI know this is going to sound weird but I feel like I haven\u2019t even begun to unload on USAID and how dark it all goes,\u201d Benz posted.",
      "\u201cWow,\u201d Musk replied."

      "The final jobs report capturing a snapshot of the economy during the Biden administration will be released Friday.",
      "Notably, it will include regularly scheduled revisions to jobs figures going back to March. Those figures are likely to be revised significantly downward, upending the extent of previously reported job gains.",
      "The Bureau of Labor Statistics already announced last summer that an initial estimate of 818,000 fewer jobs were created in 2023 and early 2024 than were initially reported.",
      "Still, economists continue to maintain that, on balance, the U.S. labor market remains in decent shape, though there were still some signs of weakness heading into President Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration.",
      "Forecasters surveyed by Dow Jones were expecting a gain of 169,000 payrolls for January, down from 256,000 in December, with the unemployment rate unchanged at 4.1%.",
      "\u201cInitial jobless claims and surveys indicating firms are reducing employment both remain low, suggesting no substantial pick-up in layoffs,\u201d analysts with Citigroup said in a research note this week. \u201cBut surveys also continue to suggest consumers perceive jobs are harder to get, consistent with low quits and not a sign of confidence in the labor market. And most importantly, we have not seen indications of a pick-up in demand for workers as hiring remains very low.\u201d",
      "Despite those weaker indicators, other surveys suggested employers were optimistic that Trump would establish a more business-friendly environment through tax-cut extensions and deregulation and were indicating they planned to add more workers.",
      "\u201cHiring intentions have gone up across the board,\u201d said Eric Wallerstein, chief markets strategist at the Yardeni Research consultancy. Trump\u2019s election, he said, has boosted the \u201canimal spirits\u201d that generally signal more economic growth.",
      "Adding to those favorable conditions is an interest-rate environment that is stabilizing. Economists now believe the Federal Reserve is unlikely to dramatically alter interest-rate levels \u2014\u00a0and even Trump recently said the central bank\u2019s decision in late January to hold rates at their current levels was the right one.",
      "Uncertainty of any kind is among the most feared conditions for businesses, and Wallerstein said there is now widespread agreement that borrowing rates will not move much from here. While that may disappoint consumers who were hoping to pay less on things like credit card and auto loan bills, greater certainty generally supports economic growth.",
      "Separately, Trump\u2019s tariff threats have also caused market turbulence, and some Wall Street analysts have signaled they would revise their economic growth estimates should he begin to fully implement them.",
      "In a research note this week, Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY (formerly Ernst & Young), said GDP could contract by as much as 1.5% this year, with inflation climbing an average of 0.4 additional percentage points, depending on the extent of Trump\u2019s tariff levies.",
      "\u201cRising trade policy uncertainty will heighten financial market volatility and strain the private sector, despite the administration\u2019s pro-business rhetoric,\u201d Daco wrote.",
      "Meanwhile, given how low hiring rates are and how narrowly job gains are concentrated in a handful of sectors like health care and state and local government, many people looking for jobs are still likely to encounter difficulties.",
      "But overall, official job indicators remain in good shape. Unemployment is relatively low, while labor force participation, or the extent of the population that is active in the workforce, and employment-population ratios are at or near all-time highs."

    "summary": "Casey DeSantis, the wife of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, has long been rumored as a potential 2026 candidate, but the prospect is inching closer to reality.",
    "story": [
      "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. \u2014 Republican donors at a gathering last week in Palm Beach County openly discussed the prospect of Casey DeSantis' running for governor in 2026, and for the first time, Florida\u2019s first lady is seriously considering the idea.",
      "Gov. Ron DeSantis, her husband, faces term limits and cannot seek re-election. There has long been speculation about whether Casey, a mainstay on the campaign trail for her husband, would herself one day run for office, but those plans seem to be coming closer to reality, five people directly familiar with the donor event and Casey DeSantis' thought process told NBC News.",
      "\u201cI would say this: I have heard donors have been urging her to run and that while it\u2019s not something she has wanted to do, they are causing her to at least stop and listen,\u201d a source familiar with her thinking said.",
      "Casey DeSantis couldn\u2019t be reached for comment for this article.",
      "Her entrance into the 2026 Republican primary field, which isn't yet set, would have significant ripple effects across both the Florida and the national political landscapes, potentially setting up a proxy war between Gov. Ron DeSantis and President Donald Trump.",
      "The other Republican who has openly said he is considering a run for governor is Rep. Byron Donalds, a close Trump ally.",
      "\u201cIt is a real possibility,\u201d another person familiar with the conversations said of the chances Casey DeSantis runs for governor, though they noted they don\u2019t know yet whether it\u2019s a \u201cprobable scenario.\u201d",
      "Before the South Florida donor event last week, the prospect was mostly political conjecture. But even then, the idea had gotten enough traction that Casey DeSantis has had to address it.",
      "\u201cI will tell you this, when people talk about me running for governor, I think it speaks highly about the governor himself,\u201d she told the \u201cConservative Review\u201d podcast in May. \u201cI think when people see me, it is because they are so happy about everything that this governor has done for the state of Florida.",
      "\u201cWhen people start talking about \u2018Oh, you know, you should run,\u2019 that\u2019s because Gov. DeSantis is a rock star and that\u2019s because people are so proud of everything that he\u2019s done for this state,\u201d she added.",
      "Along with Donalds, state Agriculture Commissioner Wilton Simpson is also believed to be considering a run. Though he doesn\u2019t have the national profile of either Casey DeSantis or Donalds, he is a well-known statewide elected official in Florida with upward of $30 million already in the bank from past fundraising efforts.",
      "If Casey DeSantis were to run, the race would almost certainly be viewed, in part, as a proxy war between Trump and her husband.",
      "The two became close allies after Trump endorsed Ron DeSantis\u2019 2018 bid for governor, but they had a high-profile falling-out when DeSantis ran against Trump in the 2024 Republican presidential primaries.",
      "Their relationship has warmed, but the dynamics of a potential race between the sitting governor's wife and Donalds, widely believed to be the candidate Trump\u2019s team would support, would resurrect the rivalry and the fight over who is the true kingmaker in Florida Republican politics.",
      "DeSantis and Donalds were once so close that Donalds introduced DeSantis and his family at DeSantis\u2019 2022 election night victory party; the two fell out when Donalds endorsed Trump in the presidential primary.",
      "Similarly, DeSantis has had a strained relationship with Simpson. Last month, the two men openly sparred after the GOP-dominated Legislature proposed a plan to strip DeSantis of immigration oversight authority in the state to give it to Simpson, which DeSantis vocally opposed.",
      "Originally, DeSantis wanted former state Attorney General Ashley Moody, a longtime ally, to run for governor. He saw her as the best prospect to beat Donalds, but he ultimately decided to appoint her to the Senate seat left open when Trump picked Marco Rubio to be his secretary of state.",
      "With Moody's exit, DeSantis was forced to find another candidate who was aligned with him who he believed could become governor.",
      "The governor sees his wife's running \"as his best opportunity to set the future leaderships for the state and prevent a Simpson or Donalds governorship,\u201d another source familiar with the thinking said. \u201cThat\u2019s what finally opened him up to a Casey run.\"",
      "A top Donalds adviser told NBC News about having \"heard the rumblings\" of a Casey DeSantis bid for governor but declined to comment further.",
      "The existing tensions between DeSantis and both men make it nearly impossible that DeSantis, the state\u2019s sitting two-term governor, would endorse either in a governor\u2019s race and left him searching for his own candidate whom he can support to replace him.",
      "DeSantis has already said he would be active in the 2026 governor\u2019s race.",
      "Last month, DeSantis said he would use his state-level political committee, the Florida Freedom Fund, to back a candidate in the 2026 governor\u2019s race. He used the committee last year to help defeat ballot measures that would have legalized recreational marijuana in the state and another that would have enshrined abortion rights in the Florida Constitution.",
      "\u201cThe Florida Freedom Fund was instrumental in raising huge sums of $ to defeat Amendment 3 and 4 in 2024,\u201d he posted on X last month. \u201cFor the 2026 cycle, the FFF will raise even more resources (1) to ensure support of a strong gubernatorial candidate and (2) to support strong conservative candidates in legislative primaries.\u201d",
      "It has left many wondering whom DeSantis would end up supporting. The candidate who answers that question may already live in the Governor\u2019s Mansion.",
      "\"She's going to run. I think at this point most see that,\" a person familiar with Casey DeSantis' thinking said. \"There is a lot to be worked out, but at this point the rumors are not just that \u2014 it's feeling very real.\""

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s calls for the United States to \u201ctake over\u201d and \u201cdevelop\u201d the Gaza Strip have handed Islamic terrorist groups a rallying cry to recruit and inspire attacks against Americans at home and abroad, security experts and former intelligence officials say.",
      "Trump\u2019s\u00a0comments this week, proposing that the United States would control the Palestinian enclave while its residents would be forced to relocate abroad, have caused\u00a0shock\u00a0and outrage around the world \u2014 and terrorists will pounce on that anger to attract more support and organize attacks, experts said.",
      "\u201cI think every CIA station chief in the Middle East woke up this morning with a migraine headache, because there\u2019s a potential for a generational counterterrorism nightmare here,\u201d Marc Polymeropoulos, a former CIA officer who worked in the region, said Wednesday in an interview on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe.\"",
      "Polymeropoulos highlighted the language Trump has used in recent days \u2014 that the United States would \"take over\" and \"own\" Gaza.",
      "\u201cThese are triggering mechanisms for Islamic extremist groups,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cThis kind of language only is going to galvanize groups that want to kill Americans.\"",
      "U.S. law enforcement and intelligence officials have repeatedly warned in recent months of a heightened global terrorist threat, mainly due to the fallout from the 15-month Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.",
      "Israel launched an invasion of Gaza after Hamas militants staged a surprise attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people, most of them civilians. More than 46,000 Palestinians have been killed in the fighting in the enclave, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry.",
      "The Islamic State and other Islamic extremists have seized on the Gaza conflict and the suffering of Palestinian civilians as material for propaganda and to encourage attacks on governments painted as enemies of Muslims, said Lucas Weber, senior threat analyst at Tech Against Terrorists, a nonprofit organization.",
      "\u201cThis most recent development will hypercharge these existing trends and provide fodder for the Islamic State to tap into it and leverage it to build support, empower its rhetoric, recruit and even incite violence,\u201d Weber said.",
      "Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., called Trump\u2019s remarks \u201cliterally bulletin board recruiting material today for our terrorist enemies, whether or not we ever go into Gaza.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe idea that we\u2019re going to clear Gaza out of Palestinians, that drives young men to extremist groups, to violence, to groups that are based around violence,\u201d Murphy, a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, said Wednesday in an interview on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe.\"",
      "The White House has defended Trump\u2019s comments, saying he has shown a willingness to question conventional wisdom about the Middle East and scored a breakthrough in his first term by securing an agreement between Israel and four Arab countries to establish diplomatic ties.",
      "\u201cThe truth is President Trump is the only president to broker a peace agreement between four Muslim-majority countries and Israel,\" Brian Hughes, a spokesperson for the White House National Security Council, said in an email. \"He\u2019s the only modern-day president to have a record of success in the Middle East.\"",
      "Trump has defended his remarks and renewed his calls for a U.S. takeover, though he said Thursday it would not involve American boots on the ground.",
      "In past decades, suicide terrorist attacks have spiked in response to the U.S. or other foreign militaries\u2019 occupying, or being perceived to be occupying, territory that terrorists see as their homeland, according to research\u00a0by Robert Pape, a professor of international relations at the University of Chicago.",
      "The 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq and the subsequent occupation touched off \u201cthe largest suicide terrorist campaign in modern times,\u201d said Pape, who has compiled a database of thousands of suicide attacks worldwide.",
      "As the United States has scaled back its military footprint in the Middle East, the relative terrorist threat against it has receded since the U.S. war in Iraq, he said.",
      "But Trump\u2019s vow to exert U.S. authority over Gaza gives groups like ISIS a major boost and puts Americans in the crosshairs, Pape said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really been quite some time since they\u2019ve had this shot of energy,\u201d he said. \u201cA group like Al Qaeda has been desperate for something like this.\u201d",
      "Islamic militants will most likely try to organize terrorist attacks against U.S. targets to signal to Washington that they will not tolerate a possible U.S. occupation, he said.",
      "\u201cThey will start attacking Americans to deter us from starting down this road again,\u201d Pape said.",
      "Christopher O\u2019Leary, a former senior FBI official who worked on counterterrorism cases, said Trump\u2019s language could prompt Palestinian militants to focus on targeting Americans abroad and possibly inside the United States, something not seen since the 1970s and \u201980s.",
      "And Islamic extremists will seize on his words to stoke anger and paint a picture of the United States as a foreign occupier, he said.",
      "\u201cGlobal jihadist groups will also use a narrative of the United States occupying Arab lands as a rallying cry for new recruits,\u201d said O\u2019Leary, senior vice president at the Soufan Group, a global security consultancy.",
      "O\u2019Leary and other former government officials said Trump\u2019s statements were especially worrying as they coincide with a time of uncertainty and upheaval at U.S. law enforcement and intelligence agencies.",
      "In recent days the Trump administration has launched a review of the conduct of FBI agents who worked on cases related to the Jan. 6, 2021, attacks on the Capitol, and it is seeking to drastically reduce the federal workforce by offering so-called buyouts to employees at the FBI, the CIA and elsewhere.",
      "\u201cThe addition of the Gaza announcement coupled with the erosion of our security services could really elevate the terrorist threat,\u201d O\u2019Leary said.",
      "Trump\u2019s proposal to take control of Gaza \u2014\u00a0and potentially expel the roughly 2.2 million Palestinians living there \u2014\u00a0has sparked fury and confusion in the Middle East and around the world. Many foreign government officials, regional analysts and human rights groups say his plan amounts to ethnic cleansing.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio and White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt sought to play down and walk back his comments Wednesday.",
      "But Trump doubled down Thursday, defending his proposal and saying the United States could take over Gaza without needing to send U.S. troops.",
      "Trump said on Truth Social that Palestinians could be \u201cresettled in far safer and more beautiful communities, with new and modern homes, in the region.\u201d His contradictory comments added fresh confusion about the future of Palestinians in Gaza.",
      "Even if Trump renounces his comments or never follows through on his ideas about U.S. control of Gaza, Islamic militants now believe the United States \u2014 which has already invaded one Muslim country in the Middle East \u2014 has its sights set on the Gaza Strip, Pape and other analysts said.",
      "The damage has been done, Pape said. \u201cWe\u2019re not getting ourselves out of this by somehow spinning the facts.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Saquon Barkley\u2019s transformation from expendable in New York to invaluable during Philadelphia\u2019s run to Sunday\u2019s Super Bowl did not happen over the course of just one offseason.",
      "It started four and a half years earlier.",
      "The No. 2 overall draft pick out of Penn State in 2018, Barkley entered 2020 having rushed for at least 1,000 yards in each of his first two NFL seasons. But only 19 attempts into this third, he injured the meniscus and tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee, his 2020 season over after two games.",
      "Physically, Barkley was healthy enough to start 13 games for the Giants the very next season. Yet players who have suffered ACL injuries often describe the rehab as a multi-year process because mental confidence in the injury often takes far longer to return than physical strength.",
      "For Barkley, that confidence began to click last spring, in the weeks after New York \u2014 which had committed $160 million to quarterback Daniel Jones only a year earlier \u2014 was hesitant to commit to re-sign Barkley to another expensive contract, allowing him to join Philadelphia as a free agent on a three-year contract worth a reported $37.75 million.",
      "One of Barkley\u2019s first official acts as an Eagle was joining quarterback Jalen Hurts for offseason workouts.",
      "\u201cI know this offseason, a lot of it was the mental strength or confidence from the injury,\u201d Southern Mississippi head coach Charles Huff, who recruited Barkley to Penn State and was his position coach in college, told NBC News. \u201cYou talk about an injury, the ACLs, you\u2019re talking nine months of just physical rehab, right? So even that doesn\u2019t get you back to full strength. So I know this year was big for him from that perspective.",
      "\u201cObviously, I think we all can say he\u2019s back.\u201d",
      "Barkley\u2019s full-circle recovery from his 2020 injuries has allowed him to become only the ninth 2,000-yard rusher in NFL history. Entering Sunday\u2019s Super Bowl matchup against Kansas City, Barkley is 30 yards from breaking Terrell Davis\u2019 1998 record of 2,447 yards in the regular season and the postseason combined.",
      "\u201cHe is motivated when someone or something says, \u2018You can\u2019t,\u2019\u201d Huff said. \u201cHe is motivated by, you know, \u2018I bet you can\u2019t hit this three-pointer.\u2019 \u2018Yes, I can.\u2019 It\u2019s not vindictive to prove anyone wrong, it\u2019s more to show you that he can.\u00a0...",
      "\u201cI haven\u2019t talked to him personally about the New York situation, because I know who he is, so I don\u2019t have to call and say, \u2018Well, what happened?\u2019 There was a business side to things. And I don\u2019t think, I don\u2019t know anybody in New York, so \u2026 I don\u2019t think anyone made a decision thinking, OK, he\u2019s not a good player or he\u2019s not good or we don\u2019t want him. You know, there\u2019s a business side. But for him, personally, he wants to prove to himself, first, that he is still the best back in the league,\" Huff said.",
      "\"And for him, it\u2019s more of through actions than through words. OK, if you don\u2019t think I run inside zone well, I\u2019ve got to work on running inside zone. If you don\u2019t think I catch the ball out of the backfield, well, I\u2019m going to work on catching the ball out of the backfield.\u201d",
      "Huff first saw Barkley\u2019s obsession with precision while at Penn State, where Huff would hold competitions in meetings with offensive players over who could diagram plays most accurately. Barkley could nail small details on the greaseboard, from the depth a receiver would break his route, to the protections on the offensive line.\u00a0Only quarterbacks were technically required to know that level of detail.",
      "\u201cAnd that was the moment you\u2019re like, \u2018OK, this kid gets it,\u2019\u201d Huff said.",
      "Barkley also became engrossed with Kobe Bryant\u2019s obsessive focus after reading Bryant\u2019s 2018 book, \u201cThe Mamba Mentality,\u201d Huff said.",
      "But Barkley\u2019s college coach was quick to say that Barkley was not driven by \u201cpersonal gain,\u201d an assessment that was supported in October, when Philadelphia coach Nick Sirianni asked whether Barkley, who was 13 yards shy of his single-game career-high, wanted to re-enter a blowout win against the Giants to set a new career best. Barkley declined, in a moment caught on camera.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a guy that he hasn\u2019t said it, you know, publicly, but I believe he\u2019s a guy that would rather win the Super Bowl than have the rushing title because the Super Bowl is a team accolade,\u201d Huff said.",
      "\u201cHe could care less if he carried the ball every play or no play, as long as the team wins, you know. And I think that\u2019s why he was so affected by the decision that New York made, because he gave a lot for the team, and he gave a lot for the organization and a lot for the city and the community and, you know, just like any of us, when you get those things and you don\u2019t get the return, it\u2019s kind of like, you know, you feel slighted a little bit so, but that\u2019s who he is. He\u2019s extremely humble. He is extremely competitive. He wants to be the best. He will work his tail off to be the best.\u201d",
      "If Barkley spent his last offseason regaining full confidence in his knee, the process may have been made easier by the teammates surrounding him.\u00a0The Giants\u2019 offensive line was ranked worst in the NFL in 2023 by Pro Football Focus; the Eagles this season ranked No. 1 for a third consecutive season.",
      "Philadelphia rushed for 3,048 yards in the regular season and has averaged 227 rushing yards in the postseason to trail only Baltimore in each category.",
      "The Eagles have \u201cone of the best o-lines, ever,\u201d NBC Sports analyst Chris Simms\u00a0told\u00a0The Dan Patrick Show, comparing the Eagles\u2019 offensive line to the 1990s-era Dallas Cowboys that helped back Emmitt Smith become the NFL\u2019s all-time yardage leader.\u00a0Four-fifths of the Eagles\u2019 line has been honored in some way as among the NFL\u2019s best already. Tackles Lane Jonson and Jordan Mailata each were named second-team all-pro last month. Johnson, guard Landon Dickerson and center Cam Jurgens also were named to the Pro Bowl.",
      "The Giants were not alone last offseason in their reticence to offer a running back a long-term, lucrative contract. But behind Barkley\u2019s one-season resurgence, and bounce-back seasons from other running backs, the market could be altered. It was a historic season, years in the making.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s kind of how football works,\u201d Barkley told reporters this week. \u201cYou have guys at a certain position dominate, have great years, and the money just goes up.\u201d"

      "Against Buffalo, Kansas City was able to have success in part because of tendency. Allen favored running to his left on sneaks, something multiple Chiefs coaches and players mentioned after the game. Kansas City\u2019s defense cheated in that direction in short yardage, and it paid off. (In fact, Allen\u2019s second and final conversion on a sneak in the AFC championship game occurred when he dove over the top as opposed to running left.)",

      "\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any secret,\u201d Spagnuolo said when he was asked how he can stop the sneak. \u201cThe secret is probably in trying to have 11 rugby players on your team who can push it the other way.\u201d",
      "Spagnuolo isn\u2019t fully joking about the rugby angle, by the way.

    "story": [
      "When Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes takes the field for Super Bowl LIX on Sunday, he\u2019ll have an opportunity to do what no quarterback has done in NFL history: Win three Super Bowls in a row.",
      "The Chiefs\u2019 appearance in the game is a record in itself, as no team has made five Super Bowls in a six-year span before this season.",
      "While Kansas City has had several key contributors during this run \u2014 such as head coach Andy Reid, tight end Travis Kelce and defensive tackle Chris Jones, to name only a few \u2014 the team\u2019s success is spearheaded by Mahomes.",
      "The Chiefs drafted Mahomes in 2017 and made him their starting quarterback the next year. In that season, Mahomes threw 50 touchdowns and won MVP. Since he entered the league, Mahomes has won two MVPs, three Super Bowl MVPs and has made at least the AFC championship game in every season as a starter.",

      "As you can see, Mahomes has a clear edge over Brady in nearly every single statistical category relevant to quarterbacks. Some of that can be attributed to the eras each QB spent their first eight seasons in, though it also paints a picture as to how dominant and well-rounded Mahomes has been so far.",
      "Notably, these stats don\u2019t include Sunday\u2019s game, which means Mahomes actually has a chance to pull ahead of Brady\u2019s Super Bowl pace. If the Chiefs win Super Bowl LIX, Mahomes will have four championships in his first eight seasons compared to Brady\u2019s three.",

      "Before Friday, both the White House and the Islamic Republic had this week signaled a change in tone from the first Trump administration, during which the President withdrew from a 2015 pact intended to curb Iran's nuclear program signed by the Obama administration, and reinstated crippling sanctions.",
      "Shortly after, the U.S. withdrew from the deal in 2018, Iran violated the previously agreed-upon enrichment limitations.",
      "But Khamenei pointed to that history on Friday, saying that Iran had made \u201cmany concessions\u201d with the U.S. in the 2010s, but that in the end, \u201cAmericans did not honor the deal.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur government at the time engaged in negotiations, held meetings, had discussions, smiled, shook hands, and built relationships,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cThe very person who is now in power tore up the agreement.\u201d",

      "Trump's executive order Tuesday also triggered a response from Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, who told the Iranian news agency Tasmin on Wednesday that \u201cmaximum pressure is a failed experience, and repeating it will lead to another failure.\"",
      "Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian also played down the impact of U.S. sanctions on Iran. On Wednesday, he urged\u00a0his Iran's fellow members of the\u00a0Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to unite against possible U.S. sanctions on the major oil producer, later saying that \u201cIran is a powerful and resource-rich country that can navigate challenges by managing its resources.\u201d",
      "Iranian officials in recent days have repeatedly claimed the country isn't actively pursuing a nuclear weapon, reiterating that it is a signatory of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, an international agreement to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and technology.",
      "While Iran has not yet pursued building a nuclear bomb, a 2023 report released by watchdog International Atomic Energy Agency\u00a0found the country had begun enriching uranium close to weapons-grade levels.",
      "Speaking at a news conference Tuesday, President Trump indicated that the executive order he signed this week was intended to deter Iran from further developing its nuclear capabilities.",
      "\u201cWe will once again enforce the most aggressive possible sanctions to drive Iranian oil exports to zero and diminish the regime\u2019s capacity to fund terror throughout the region and through the world,\u201d Trump said.",
      "Still, despite American efforts to target Iran's economy, RUSI's Dolzikova said that the use of sanctions is \u201cprobably not as strong of a lever as it will have been four or five years ago,\u201d because the Iranian economy has since adapted to the pressure by expanding its relations with Russia and China.",
      "She added that \u201cif the Trump administration does go after those continued exports to China, as they seem set to do, then that might create additional pressure.\u201d"

    "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2025 11:48:15 GMT",
    "summary": "Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba is set to meet with President Donald Trump at the White House on Friday.",
    "story": [
      "HONG KONG \u2014 What a difference a few months makes.",
      "The U.S. and its longtime allies Japan and South Korea have been strengthening ties in recent years, both individually and as a three-way partnership, in an effort to counter an increasingly assertive China and North Korea. But recent political changes in all three countries have injected new uncertainty into their relations.",
      "South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol is facing an impeachment trial over his botched attempt in December to declare martial law, and it will be months before the country has a clear leader. In Japan, Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba is hamstrung by a minority government after his scandal-ridden Liberal Democratic Party performed poorly in an October parliamentary election.",
      "And in the United States, voters elected a president in November who disdains alliances and prefers to deal with countries individually, and who in his first term accused Japan and South Korea of \u201cfreeloading\u201d under the U.S. security umbrella.",
      "On Friday, Ishiba is set to meet with President Donald Trump at the White House, in the first major indication of how the new U.S. administration will interact with the two Asian democracies.",
      "Like the U.S., both countries are wary of China\u2019s rise but also count it among their top trading partners. The challenge for Ishiba will be to sell Trump on the importance of U.S. security commitments in Asia and avoid the kinds of tariffs that Trump has imposed on China and threatened to impose on U.S. allies Canada and Mexico.",
      "Ishiba said he planned \u201cto work hard to establish a relationship of mutual trust\u201d during his visit with Trump.",
      "\u201cI hope that we can confirm that by Japan and the U.S. cooperating on issues such as the economy and security, this will bring peace and allow for development not for the free and open Indo-Pacific region but also for the rest of the world,\u201d the Japanese leader told reporters in Tokyo on Thursday.",
      "Japanese visit",
      "Ishiba is looking for a \u201cneutral outcome\u201d from the visit, and is most likely just happy to be the second foreign leader to meet with Trump after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said Michael Cucek, an assistant professor of Asian studies at Temple University in Japan.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s not going to try to win any points or get any gifts from the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cHe knows that there are none available.\u201d",
      "Ishiba is likely to emphasize Japan\u2019s role as the largest foreign investor in the U.S. \u2014 in December, the head of the Japanese tech conglomerate SoftBank, Masayoshi Son, pledged to invest $100 billion in the U.S. over the next four years at a meeting with Trump.",
      "Business ties with Japan have been strained by the $15 billion bid by its largest steelmaker, Nippon Steel, for Pittsburgh-based U.S. Steel, which former President Joe Biden blocked last month citing national security concerns. Trump also opposes the deal, which Nippon Steel says it has not given up on.",
      "The blocking of the deal is unlikely to fundamentally alter the U.S.-Japan relationship, said Anthony Rapa, partner and co-chair of the International Trade practice group at Blank Rome in Washington, given both countries are more concerned with Indo-Pacific security and countering China.",
      "\u201cThat said, the rejection of the deal genuinely did sting, considering the historical closeness of the two nations, Japan\u2019s standing as the top U.S. investor, and the fact that no Japanese investment had ever been blocked on national security grounds before, at least not publicly,\u201d he said in an email.",
      "Takahiro Mori, vice chairman of Nippon Steel, said Thursday that the company would be watching the Ishiba-Trump summit closely and that he hoped it would be \u201ca catalyst that would open the way towards the future.\u201d",
      "Cucek said Ishiba would \u201cutterly avoid\u201d raising the topic with Trump, especially since Nippon Steel is suing over the blocking of the deal.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no reason to bring it up,\u201d Cucek said. \u201cThere\u2019s no advantage that he gets out of it.\u201d",
      "Ishiba is unlikely to get along with Trump as well as Shinzo Abe, the former Japanese prime minister who was assassinated in 2022 and who had a close personal relationship with Trump. Cucek said that the current Japanese leader has a fundamentally different temperament from Abe \u2014 who won over the President with a charm offensive that involved flattery and golf.",
      "\u201cNevertheless, in dealing with Donald Trump, he has this playbook from Abe of simply flattering the man,\u201d he said.",
      "Anxiety in South Korea",
      "In South Korea, there are worries that the country could be falling behind in engaging with the Trump administration due to the political instability after Yoon\u2019s short-lived martial law order.",
      "The Constitutional Court has up to 180 days to decide whether Yoon, who is suspended from presidential duties after being impeached by lawmakers, should indeed be removed from office. If he is, South Korea would then have 60 days to hold a presidential by-election.",
      "Though Trump had a phone call with Yoon shortly after his election victory in November, he has not spoken with acting South Korean President Choi Sang-mok.",
      "\u201cThere is no way that Trump will actually engage directly\u201d with an acting president, said Jennifer Lee, a principal at the Asia Group in Washington who focuses on the Korean Peninsula.",
      "\u201cSo waiting six months to have that kind of highest-level meeting will definitely hurt the country,\u201d she said, \u201cespecially given the uncertainty around the Trump administration\u2019s policies.\u201d",
      "There has been other contact, however, including a phone call last month between Secretary of State Marco Rubio and his South Korean counterpart, Cho Tae-yul, and a call Wednesday between National Security Adviser Mike Waltz and his South Korean counterpart, Shin Won-sik.",
      "One area where South Korea is eager to coordinate with the U.S. is North Korea, where leader Kim Jong Un has been advancing his nuclear and ballistic missile programs and ratcheting up his hostile rhetoric against the U.S., South Korea and others.",
      "Trump has said he plans to reach out to Kim, whom he met with three times during his first term.",
      "\u201cThere is a lot of anxiety, especially on them not being included in the possible U.S.-North Korea dialogue,\u201d said Lee, who recently returned from a trip to South Korea.",
      "Japan, which is also directly threatened by North Korea, shares a number of potential challenges with South Korea in a new Trump administration.",
      "Both countries host thousands of U.S. troops, and both countries came under pressure during Trump\u2019s first term to shoulder more of the cost for that.",
      "Tariffs are another potential concern, after Trump announced 25% tariffs on U.S. allies Canada and Mexico before putting them on hold at the last minute.\u00a0 South Korea, which has a highly export-dependent economy, is considered especially vulnerable, and South Korean companies such as Hyundai, Samsung and LG are exposed because of their facilities in Mexico and China, where the U.S. did impose a 10% tariff on Tuesday.",
      "Though both South Korea and Japan would be affected if Trump imposes a blanket tariff on all U.S. imports as he has floated, both Lee and Cucek said there is no obvious reason for them to be directly targeted the way Canada, Mexico and China were over their alleged roles in the U.S. fentanyl crisis.",
      "\u201cThere is nothing that provides the excuse for the use right now of tariffs,\u201d Cucek said.",
      "Jennifer Jett reported from Hong Kong, Arata Yamamoto from Tokyo and Stella Kim from Seoul, South Korea."

      "NEW DELHI \u2014 India\u2019s Parliament was disrupted Thursday as opposition lawmakers protested the alleged mistreatment of 104 Indian immigrants deported by the United States.",
      "A U.S. military plane carrying Indian migrants arrived Wednesday in a northern Indian city, the first such flight to the country as part of a crackdown ordered by President Donald Trump\u2019s administration.",
      "Renuka Chowdhury, a lawmaker in the Congress party, said the deportees were \u201chandcuffed, had their legs chained and even struggled to use the washroom.\u201d Her colleague, Gaurav Gogoi, called it \u201cdegrading.\u201d",
      "Parliament adjourned as the opposition chanted slogans and demanded a discussion about flights.",
      "The protests mirrored concerns after a contentious deportation flight to Brazil on Jan. 25 prompted that country\u2019s government to seek an explanation for the \u201cdegrading treatment\u201d of 88 passengers.",
      "U.S. civilian authorities also shackle migrants by their ankles and wrists, but deportation flights to India are rare. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement had three flights to the city of Amritsar last year, according to Witness at the Border, an advocacy group that tracks flight data.",
      "The Trump administration\u2019s use of military aircraft for deportations to countries including Guatemala and Ecuador is a departure from previous practice, which relied on ICE\u2019s use of chartered and commercial planes.",
      "Parliament Speaker Om Birla tried to calm the lawmakers, saying the transportation of the deportees was a matter of U.S. foreign policy and that the U.S. \u201calso has its own rules and regulations.\u201d",
      "One deportee, Jaspal Singh, said the immigrants\u2019 handcuffs and leg chains were taken off only at the Amritsar airport in India.",
      "Singh, 36, said they initially thought they were being taken to another camp in the U.S. and only found out about their deportation once on the plane. \u201cThe flight was into 8-9 hours and an officer informed (us) that we are being deported\u201d to India, he said.",
      "Opposition lawmakers, including Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, also protested outside the Parliament as they demanded a response from the government. Some wore handcuffs and carried placards that read: \u201cHumans, not prisoners.\u201d",
      "\u201cIndians deserve Dignity and Humanity, NOT Handcuffs,\u201d Gandhi wrote on the social media platform X.",
      "Gandhi uploaded a video showing another deportee, Harvinder Singh, as saying they were handcuffed and their feet chained for 40 hours. \u201cWe were not allowed to move an inch from our seats. It was worse than hell,\u201d he said.",
      "Later Thursday, Indian External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar told the Parliament\u2019s upper house that U.S. regulations have allowed for the use of restraints since 2012, on both military and civilian flights. He said the U.S. authorities have informed them that women and children are not restrained.",

After her selfless act was unappreciated by the rest of the cast, The \u201cReal Housewives of New York City\u201d star bickered with British royal Lord Ivar Mountbatten and a few others, placing a target on her back.

Then, she struggled after Wells\u2019 elimination as he was one of her closest friends and allies in the house. In Episode 3, the Traitors decided to murder another housewife to create more confusion in the castle. As \u201cThe Real Housewives of Dubai\u201d star learned her fate, she became emotional and questioned how the Traitors could be so cruel.",
      "Tony Vlachos",
      "Tony Vlachos, a two-time \u201cSurvivor\u201d winner, had his stint on Season 3 cut short after placing his trust in the wrong people. During the third mission, Bob Harper called out Tony for not volunteering to go first and risk his safety. Tony didn\u2019t appreciate being put on blast and voiced his irritations during the car ride home. At the roundtable, Bob Harper learned Tony was upset with him and started to wonder if Tony was a Traitor. Although the \u201cSurvivor\u201d star tried to prove his innocence, a majority of the cast voted him out in Episode 3. Before departing, a hurt Tony confirmed he was a Faithful and labeled fellow \u201cSurvivor\u201d alum Rob Mariano a \u201csellout\u201d for turning on him.",
      "Jeremy Collins",
      "Episode 4 began with the conclusion of a special task for the Traitors. They were required to meet in a secret room in the castle and scribe three names, either Faithfuls or Traitors, onto a hidden parchment, shortlisting them for murder. The Traitors selected \"Survivor\" winner Jeremy Collins, \"Summer House\" star Ciara Miller and retired professional wrestler Nikki Garcia. Each person then had to lie down in a coffin and await their fate. Although Jeremy offered to work with the Traitors if he was spared, they chose to murder him since he correctly suspected \"Big Brother\" star Danielle Reyes was a Traitor. In his final confessional, Jeremy became emotional as he spoke about not bringing home the prize pot to his family.",
      "Bob the Drag Queen",
      "Bob the Drag Queen's devilishly cunning run on Season 3 was cut short in Episode 4 when his fellow Traitors, particularly Rob, turned on him. Bob had been vocal throughout the season, trying to cast suspicion onto others and throw his adversaries off his scent. But when he suggested the group question if the three newcomers \u2014 Rob, Wes and Derrick \u2014 were possible Traitors, Rob took it as an opportunity stab the \"RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race\" winner in the back. Rob convinced the group to banish Bob, stunning him. After being voted out, Rob stood before the cast and proudly confirmed he had lied and was a Traitor.",
      "Robyn Dixon",
      "After a roaring roundtable that resulted in one of their own being exposed, the remaining Traitors plotted in Episode 5 to murder someone who would draw suspicion away from them. They debated back and forth, with one Traitor failing to be heard. Ultimately, they decided that murdering Robyn Dixon would add to the confusion permeating throughout the castle. When \"The Real Housewives of Potomac\" star learned she had been eliminated, she said, \"I knew it was coming because I am a threat to the Traitors.\" In her parting words, she advised the Traitors to \"work harder\" after losing Bob the Drag Queen.",
      "Nikki Garcia",
      "Nikki Garcia was living on borrowed time in the castle after the Traitors set up her inevitable downfall. After being selected as one of the three contestants to lie in the coffin in Episode 4, the rest of the contestants assumed that at least one cast member chosen was a Traitor. The former WWE star deflected suspicion at first, but in Episode 5, one of her closest allies, Chrishell Stause, started to doubt her. Chrishell voiced her concerns about Nikki during the roundtable, leading most of the group to vote her out. \"The win for me is that I do get to go home to my son. The loss for all of you is that I'm a Faithful,\" Nikki said as she left.",
      "Bob Harper",
      "As Episode 6 began, the trust between the Traitors was at an all time low.  They met in the turret and discussed their \"dysfunctional family\" before listing their targets. They settled on Bob Harper, who was vocal at the most recent roundtable about who the Faithfuls couldn't trust. The three remaining Traitors labeled him as \"the more imminent threat\" and agreed to murder him. When \"The Biggest Loser\" trainer didn't show up for breakfast the next morning, the cast, excluding the Traitors, were stunned. After Bob H. read his letter from the Traitors, he said, \"No f---ing way. I think the Traitors are playing a really ballsy game. They're very invincible right now because they are so hidden. I'm angry. I'm just angry over the train of thought of why I was murdered. I hate the Traitors.\"",
      "Wes Bergmann",
      "At the end of the Episode 6, Wes Bergmann planned to turn on Rob, but the \"Survivor\" winner beat him to it. Throughout the episode, Wes had been suggesting Rob's name to multiple people. When everyone arrived at the roundtable, Rob used Wes' scheming ways against him and pointed out that Wes pushed for Nikki to be banished. To defend himself, Wes warned that he would target anyone who voted against him. His tactic didn't work and pushed the Faithfuls in the opposite direction, making them vote to banish him. \"The Challenge\" star delivered one of his signature boastful speeches before he left, calling himself \"one of the greatest reality competition players of all time.\" He added, \"I don't care about any of you. You are all chess pieces on a board. And so to all those people that have died until I got to this circle right here, I have no idea who killed them because I'm a Faithful.\"",
      "Derrick Levasseur",
      "Derrick Levasseur took a chance during the roundtable in Episode 6 and voiced his theory about Rob being a traitor. The next episode, his boldness came back to bite him. When the Traitors met in secret at the beginning of Episode 7, they begrudgingly decided the \"Big Brother\" winner needed to go to help rebuild trust between them. As Derrick learned his fate, he was unsurprised. \"I knew that after I called out Rob directly last night, and he chose to instead go at Wes, that he was not going to give me another roundtable, which I guess I have to take as a compliment,\" Derrick said. He proudly added, \"I'm the most dangerous person in here for the Traitors, and they know it.\" He said he would have made the same move and that he was \"honored\" to have been a part of the season.",
      "Rob 'Boston Rob' Mariano",
      "Rob's smooth-talking and cunning ways could no longer save him by Episode 7. Before he departed, Derrick planted seeds to his fellow Faithfuls, cautioning them that Rob was a Traitor. At breakfast, Rob posed the theory that the Traitors had murdered Derrick to make the \"Survivor\" star look guilty. But \"Vanderpump Rules\" star Tom Sandoval was unconvinced and realized that it was the third time a Faithful was murdered after publicly going against Rob. So, Tom presented that evidence during the roundtable, hoping that others would jump on board. After everyone voted, Rob received a majority of votes \u2014 including two from his fellow Traitors \u2014 and was banished, ending his masterful run this season. \"First of all, I just want to tell all of you that I have really enjoyed meeting you and playing this game with you. I've had a ton of fun,\" he said during his final speech. \"I am, and always have been, from the very beginning, a Traitor.\""

      "\u201cIt really became a jumping off point for us,\u201d she tells\u00a0TODAY.com. \u201cI don\u2019t know what Belle talked about in real life, I can only speculate what motivated her. And so this is our fictional account.\u201d",
      "She also explains why the show ends shortly after Gibson\u2019s scam is revealed, rather than exploring where the real Gibson is now.",
      "\u201cI liked the idea of ending Belle in, I would say, a fragile place of hope,\u201d Strauss\u00a0says.\u00a0\u201cMaybe she\u2019s learned not to do this again, you know, maybe she won\u2019t repeat the cycles of her own past.\u201d",
      "Strauss adds that as far as she knows, Gibson has never paid a fine or gone to jail for her actions.",
      "\u201cIn lots of ways, social media was her punishment,\u201d she says.",
      "In September 2017, the Federal Court of Australia ordered Gibson\u00a0to pay $410,000 in relation to her \u201cunconscionable conduct.\u201d",
      "As of early 2020, Gibson had still not paid the fine, according to the\u00a0Australian Associated Press, via The Guardian. Gibson\u2019s home\u00a0was raided in 2021.",
      "In late 2023, Donelly and Toscano received another update from Consumer Affairs Victoria, which they shared in their book.",
      "A spokesperson told them the agency was \u201ccontinuing to pursue\u201d Gibson and said the \u201centire amount\u201d of her debt is \u201cstill outstanding.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Woman Who Fooled the World\u201d authors Donelly and Toscano received another update from Consumer Affairs Victoria in 2023, which they shared in their book.",
      "The agency was \u201ccontinuing to pursue\u201d Gibson and she still owed the entire amount of her debt.",
      "Which \u2018Apple Cider Vinegar\u2019 characters are based on real people?",
      "Several characters in \u201cApple Cider Vinegar\u201d are directly based on real people, with their names left unchanged.",
      "The character of Belle Gibson is based on the real-life Australian influencer who faked cancer for years as she built her wellness empire. Gibson admitted to lying about her diagnosis in an interview with\u00a0Australia\u2019s The Weekly\u00a0in 2015.",
      "Belle\u2019s boyfriend in the show, Clive Rothwell, played by Ashley Zuckerman, appears to be based on a real person.",
      "According to \u201cThe Woman Who Fooled the World,\u201d the real Rothwell is an IT consultant from Adelaide, Australia, which closely mirrors his character on the show.",
      "Gibson described Rothwell as her housemate and friend in a 2019 court hearing, per\u00a0The Guardian.",
      "In the miniseries, Rothwell is seen beginning to question Gibson\u2019s illness. However, he backs off because he wants to stay involved in the life of Gibson\u2019s young son.",
      "This appears to be creative speculation on the show\u2019s part; the real Rothwell has never spoken publicly about whether he was aware of Gibson\u2019s cancer deception, and about the nature of any private conversations they may have had about her health.",
      "The real Gibson has a son, according to \u201cThe Woman Who Fooled the World.\u201d",
      "Gibson\u2019s real-life mother, Natalie Dal-Bello, and her husband, Andrew Dal-Bello, are also portrayed using their real names in \u201cApple Cider Vinegar.\u201d",
      "Some lines from Natalie Dal-Bello, played by Essie Davis, appear to be inspired by real quotes from Dal-Bello, either from interviews Dal-Bello gave to Donelly and Toscano for \u201cThe Woman Who Fooled the World,\u201d or from her 2015 interview with The Weekly.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t begin to tell you how embarrassed we are by what that girl has done. And for all the poor people who she has deceived, for the small part that we have played in her life, I am deeply and profoundly sorry,\u201d the Natalie character says in the show, which closely echoes a statement the real Dal-Bello made to The Weekly.",
      "The character of publisher Julie Gibbs, played by Catherine McClements, appears to be directly inspired by the\u00a0real-life Julie Gibbs, the\u00a0former director of Lantern, an imprint of the Penguin publishing house\u00a0focused on cookbooks.",
      "The real Gibbs worked with\u00a0Gibson on her Whole Pantry cookbook. She left\u00a0Penguin in 2015 following the unraveling of Gibson\u2019s cancer story, according to Donelly and Toscano. She declined to be interviewed for \u201cThe Woman Who Fooled the World",
      "Which \u2018Apple Cider Vinegar\u2019 characters are fictional?",
      "Some characters in \u201cApple Cider Vinegar\u201d are fictional, though they appear to be at least partly inspired by people who encountered Belle Gibson.",
      "The character of Milla Blake, a wellness influencer who claims she cured herself of cancer using natural methods, is an \u201camalgamation of wellness influences at the time,\u201d Alycia Debnam-Carey, who played Milla in the series, told TODAY.com.",
      "Debnam-Carey says \u201cparallels can be made\u201d between Milla\u2019s character and Jess Ainscough, an Australian influencer known to her supporters as \u201cThe Wellness Warrior.\u201d",
      "Similar to what is shown in Milla\u2019s storyline, Ainscough found lumps on her arm in her early 20s and was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer. Doctors advised her to amputate her left arm at her shoulder, but she declined this surgery and tried chemotherapy instead. This worked temporarily, according to \u201cThe Woman Who Fooled the World.\u201d",
      "When the cancer recurred a year later, Ainscough decided not to amputate, and instead searched for alternative healing methods. She ended up devoting herself to Gerson therapy, a controversial regimen developed in the 1920s that claims to \u201cdetoxify\u201d the body through methods including a clean diet, juicing and frequent coffee enemas.",
      "According to multiple studies from The National Cancer Institute and the American Cancer Society, Gerson therapy has \u201cdemonstrated no benefit\u201d and \u201ccannot be recommended\u201d to people with cancer, and in some cases may have adverse effects.",
      "Ainscough gained a large following as she posted about her wellness journey on social media, and in 2013 she released a bestselling book, \u201cMake Peace With Your Plate.\u201d",
      "Seven years after she was first diagnosed with cancer, Ainscough died at 29 in 2015.",
      "Milla\u2019s story in \u201cApple Cider Vinegar\u201d has close parallels with Ainscough\u2019s life, and the controversial Hirsch Institute Milla attends in Mexico seems to be a fictionalized version of the Gerson Institute.",
      "However, their stories diverge in places. In the show, Milla is shown as turning away from conventional medical treatments from the beginning. Ainscough\u2019s family, however, has said she was willing to try chemotherapy at first.",
      "\u201cIt has \u2026 been said that Jess shunned conventional treatment and doctors, this \u2026 is incorrect,\u201d her family said in a tribute to Ainscough shared by Australia\u2019s The Sunshine Coast Daily.",
      "Still, while there are several similarities between Ainscough and Milla, Debnam-Carey says Milla\u2019s character was invented as someone who could go \u201ctoe-to-toe with Belle.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat parallel dynamic of the two of them was such an interesting story,\u201d she said. \u201cBelle is someone who\u2019s lying to the world, but Milla is sort of lying to herself, but also convinced that she\u2019s done this to herself, that she\u2019s caused the cancer that\u2019s in her.\u201d",
      "The character of Lucy (Tilda Cobham-Hervey), a woman with breast cancer who is inspired by Belle\u2019s social media posts, is also fictional.",
      "The show\u2019s creator, Samantha Strauss, describes Lucy as \u201cthe heart of the show,\u201d and says Lucy represents the many people who were influenced by Gibson\u2019s messaging.",
      "\u201cLucy\u2019s us,\u201d Strauss tells TODAY.com. \u201cLucy is the people who could suffer because of people like Belle.\u201d",
      "While Lucy is fictional, her story shares similarities with Kate Thomas, who is featured extensively in \u201cThe Woman Who Fooled the World.\u201d",
      "Like Lucy, Thomas was diagnosed with breast cancer in her 30s. As she underwent chemotherapy, she came across Gibson on social media and was drawn to her discussion of alternative treatment methods.",
      "\u201cTo see that she had gone through this, but had done it the natural way, was inspiring,\u201d Thomas told Donelly and Toscano for their book. \u201cShe gave hope to people like me that maybe we didn\u2019t have to put ourselves through such intense treatment. Maybe we could survive.\u201d",
      "Thomas\u2019 partner, Nik Donaldson, was skeptical of Gibson\u2019s claims, according to the book, which mirrors the dynamic between Lucy and Justin on the show.",
      "After learning about Gibson\u2019s scam, Thomas said she felt betrayed and furious on behalf of people who had abandoned proven medical treatments based on Gibson\u2019s advice.",
      "\u201cI just don\u2019t know how she can live with herself,\u201d Thomas told Donelly and Toscano. \u201cPeople would be saying, \u2018You\u2019re such an inspiration, I\u2019ve decided not to do chemo\u2019 \u2026 Belle would have been reading those comments and knowing that people were stopping treatment. That is not OK.\u201d",
      "Ultimately, Thomas decided to continue with conventional treatment. In May 2024, an interview with Thomas in Australia\u2019s Geelong Advertiser stated that Thomas was at that time \u201cclear of cancer.\u201d",
      "Actor Aisha Dee describes her character Chanelle as \u201ca voice of reason\u201d who \u201crepresents the audience in a way.\u201d",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s kind of seeing things in the same way that I think you see it when you\u2019re watching it on your TV at home,\u201d she tells TODAY.com.",
      "Gibson did have a friend named Chanelle in real life who was interviewed for \u201cThe Woman Who Fooled the World,\u201d but their stories have some differences.",
      "The Chanelle character in the show works with both Milla Blake and Gibson.\u00a0There is no evidence that the real Chanelle did the same.",
      "According to \u201cThe Woman Who Fooled the World,\u201d the real Chanelle did challenge Gibson about her cancer claims, and recalled a time Gibson faked a seizure at her son\u2019s birthday party, as shown in the series."

      "At the February 2023 game, which resulted in a Chiefs victory 38-35, Ed and Donna Kelce became the first-ever NFL parents to have sons on opposing teams at the Super Bowl. From the players box, Donna Kelce had a jacket that ensured she was cheering on both teams.",

      "Ed coached Jason and Travis in baseball growing up",
      "After asking their dad to recount which organized sport first inspired their passion for the game, Ed Kelce reminded them that their love began on their living room floor.",
      "\"The first thing you did was you were a toddler on the living room floor and you rolled a ball to me, you rolled it back and we played that way and that\u2019s where it all started,\" he said on the \"New Heights\" podcast.",
      "Growing up in Cleveland Heights, Ed Kelce coached his sons, Travis Kelce in T-ball and Jason Kelce in coach pitch baseball. He even built them areas to play sports in their garage and threw a ball around with his two boys in their front yard.",
      "Though he beamed talking about his sons' athletic abilities from a young age, Ed Kelce said he always reminded his sons the value of hard work and humility \u2014 both as a coach and as a dad.",

      "However, her stepmom encouraged her to get involved in athletics, where she went on to win \u201cseveral medals\u201d at the Junior Olympics in running and high jump, she told her sons on their podcast.",
      "Donna Kelce added that her brother, Don Blalock, played football at Purdue University, as well.",

      "When pressed by both sons on what traits Travis Kelce resembles of his father, Ed Kelce declined to comment further, letting out a laugh.",
      "Donna lied to Ed about who Travis was named after",
      "When initially asked by her two sons on the podcast about kids, Donna Kelce revealed that they were trying to have children about five years after getting married, \"but it wasn't working for whatever reason.\"",

      "\"No. 2, keep at it,\" she continued. \"Go up to teachers. Not the parent \u2014 the child has to do this. 'What do I have to do to get more playing time? What do I need to work on?' The parent cannot do it. They cannot be the ones that are on the coach\u2019s backs all the time. It\u2019s got to come from the kid.\"",

He started doing some stuff.\u201d",
      "Jason Kelce joked, \u201cHe\u2019s probably saying, \u2018I\u2019ve taken all of your CDs out at the local library and I burned them into my computer, because that is legal as a taxpaying citizen.\u2019\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian's emotional, and often tense, first conversation with her ex-husband, Lamar Odom, in nine years unfolds in the Season 6 premiere of \"The Kardashians.\"",
      "The reality star and the basketball pro married in 2009. Four years later, she\u00a0filed for divorce, citing irreconcilable differences as the reason for their split.",
      "Odom was\u00a0found unresponsive\u00a0in 2015 after an overdose and was hospitalized on life support. Kardashian\u00a0remained by his side during his recovery.",
      "The duo officially got divorced in 2016. Kardashian started an on-again, off-again relationship with NBA player Tristan Thompson, who is the father of her two kids,\u00a0True, 6, and Tatum, 2.\u00a0Kardashian and Thompson have since broken up.",
      "During the Season 6 episode, Kardashian reflected more on the highs and lows of their relationship.",
      "\u201cWe were married. When it was great, it was spectacular. When it was bad, it was horrific. There wasn\u2019t a lot of in between. We went full throttle, or you hit the emergency brake,\u201d she said.",
      "After their year apart, Kardashian explained she wanted to see Odom again to give back some of his belongings, especially before she turned 40. The pair made plans to meet at Kardashian's best friend Malika Haqq's house.",
      "Odom arrived 52 minutes late, much to Kardashian's annoyance, bearing cake, flowers and champagne. When Kardashian pressed him about being late, Odom said it was because he was busy shopping.",
      "As he took a seat next to Kardashian, the former couple started to make small talk, which made Kardashian think of their past relationship.",
      "\"Just in the first glance of seeing Lamar, I feel a little bit of \u2014 God, this is so familiar and so unchartered all at the same time. I don't know this person anymore. I don't know. It's really just a mindf--k. I don't know how else to explain it,\" she said in her confessional.",
      "Kardashian also remarked that Odom looked \"visually uncomfortable,\" \"scared\" and \"nervous\" during their conversation, which made her start to feel uncomfortable too.",
      "\"I don't know what he thinks about me, like, if I'm going to go off on him. He just seems very scared, and I don't want anyone to be that uncomfortable. It's just making me more uncomfortable, too,\" she said.",
      "Kardashian asked Odom directly, \"What are you so nervous about? Everything's' fine.\"",
      "Odom responded, \"I don't know, Khlo\u00e9.\"",
      "\"Take a breather,\" she said.",
      "They reminisced about the last time they saw each other. Kardashian said she was leaving for Las Vegas and she was \"kicking (him) out of the Calabasas house.\"",
      "When asked what he's been up to since then, Odom said, \"A little bit of this. A little bit of that. Hustle, man.\"",
      "To break the ice, Kardashian gave Odom back a custom diamond necklace that she had gifted him long ago. The necklace featured three angel wings on it to represent his late mother, grandmother and son, who passed away at 6 months old.",
      "\"Aww, Khlo\u00e9, you are the best,\" the former NBA player said after taking the gift.",
      "\"Just as you left it,\" Kardashian replied.",
      "Kardashian then gave Odom back a few more of his possessions, such as his mother's driver's license, his wedding bands and his NBA sixth man of the year award that he got while playing for the Los Angeles Lakers.",
      "\"I have dealt with so much trauma in this relationship for years, and this was such the love of my life that that to learn how to un-love someone, to have to go through all that \u2014 it's almost like a death,\" she said.",
      "\"My wife is the s--t,\" he told her after she gave back his jewels and a basketball award.",
      "\"OK, calm down,\" she said.",
      "Kardashian later said in a confessional, \"Him calling me 'his wife' \u2014 words are empty.\"",
      "After Odom received his items, the two were able to reach a place of deeper vulnerability \u2014 though it wasn't without difficulty.",
      "\u201cI can see Lamar is having such a hard time speaking. And I understand. We have been through so much. Maybe I remind him of a time in his life that\u2019s a really dark time. I don\u2019t know. But right now it\u2019s just uncomfortable memories and feelings,\u201d Kardashian said in a confessional.",
      "Odom, looking at his ex, called the conversation \"an out of body experience,\" and remarked Kardashian's son looks a lot like her.",
      "Odom seems to reference their time together.",
      "\"I took you through a lot, huh?\" he said.",
      "\"I can't say that was the easiest time,\" she responded.",
      "\"No, not for me either,\" he said. \"Yeah, I f--d up ... with you. I love you for trying your hardest with me, man.\"",
      "\"Thank you.\"",
      "\"That love \u2014 I don't think it will ever go away. I know it wont.\"",
      "Kardashian, after he said that, looked into the corner. The conversation will continue in the next episode."

    "story": [
      "\u201cApple Cider Vinegar\u201d is a based-on-a-true-story drama that takes inspiration from the experiences of Belle Gibson, a wellness influencer who lied about a cancer diagnosis.\u00a0But some\u00a0other characters in the Netflix show are also loosely inspired by real people, take Milla Blake for instance.",
      "Milla, played by Alycia Debnam-Carey, is a fellow wellness influencer who has made a career out of sharing her cancer journey through alternative treatments. Unlike Belle, Milla actually has cancer. (The real Belle Gibson admitted\u00a0to lying about having cancer in an interview with Australia\u2019s\u00a0The Weekly\u00a0in 2015.)",
      "In the show, doctors find cancer in Milla\u2019s arm. Rather than follow their recommendations and amputate, the 22-year-old opts for an alternate medical regimen involving juice and coffee enemas. She builds a career on the idea that she healed her cancer holistically. It seems to work for a while, until the cancer comes back. This time, the spread is fatal and Milla dies.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about the facts and fiction of Milla.",
      "Who is Milla Blake based on in real life?",
      "\u201cMilla is an amalgamation of wellness influencers at the time,\u201d Debnam-Carey tells\u00a0TODAY.com. \u201cWe created Milla as her own thing. That was what was so great about it \u2026 we could boost her up so that she could be going toe-to-toe with Belle.\u201d",
      "She says the character was inspired in part by\u00a0Jessica Ainscough, the editor of a teen magazine who was diagnosed with epithelioid sarcoma when she was 22, and nicknamed\u00a0herself\u00a0\u201cThe Wellness Warrior.\u201d",
      "Indeed, Ainscough and Milla share similarities. In Ainscough\u2019s now-deleted blog post on her five-year diagnosis anniversary in 2013, viewed on the Internet Archive, Ainscough remembered hearing of the diagnosis of epithelioid sarcoma, the same cancer Milla has in the show.",
      "\u201c'The results have told us that you have a rare type of cancer called epithelioid sarcoma.\u2019 I went numb. \u2018It\u2019s not treatable with chemotherapy or radiation, and there\u2019s a good chance we will have to amputate your arm but this disease is essentially terminal,\u2019\u201d\u00a0she wrote.",
      "She wrote that she \u201cdidn\u2019t buy into\u201d the doctor\u2019s \u201cpresumptions\u201d that she\u2019d be dead in five years and, five years later, was \u201cliving and thriving with cancer.\u201d",
      "Ainscough began\u00a0Gerson Therapy, which involves a diet \u201cbased on the theory that it addresses the cause of cancer by detoxifying the body and stimulating metabolism so that the body can heal itself,\u201d per\u00a0Sloan Kettering.",
      "Gerson Therapy is not scientifically proven, per Sloan Kettering. Ainscough, however, said it worked for her.",
      "In a\u00a0now-deleted article on Dolly.com, written four years after she was diagnosed, entitled, \u201cI\u2019m healing myself from cancer naturally,\u201d she wrote she was \u201cecstatic to report\u201d that Gerson worked.",
      "\u201cI have had no cancer spread, no more lumps pop up (they were popping up rapidly before) and I can actually see some of my tumors coming out through my skin and disappearing,\u201d she said.",
      "Ainscough went on to host \u201cWellness Warrior\u201d events, inviting other wellness figures in the space to join her on stage and speak about their experiences.",
      "What happened to Jess Ainscough?",
      "There are other similarities between Ainscough and\u00a0the\u00a0Milla Blake\u00a0character.\u00a0Like Milla, Ainscough was in a relationship. She and Tallon Pamenter were engaged and planning to be married in 2015, per her\u00a0Instagram.",
      "Also like Milla, Ainscough\u2019s mother was also diagnosed with cancer. Sharyn Ainscough died in 2013 of breast cancer.",
      "Ainscough herself died in 2015. According to a statement from her family released after her death by the\u00a0Sunshine Coast Daily, Ainscough did try \u201cconventional treatment\u201d before her death, but it was unsuccessful.",
      "\u201cIt has been speculated by people who have never met or treated Jess that, had she chosen to amputate her arm or undergo further conventional treatment, her chances of survival would have increased. Her treating oncologists do not agree with this uninformed view,\u201d the statement read.",
      "Did Belle Gibson and Jess Ainscough know each other?",
      "The book \u201cThe Woman Who Fooled the World,\u201d which inspired \u201cApple Cider Vinegar,\u201d gets into Ainscough and Gibson\u2019s relationship.",
      "According to the book, they met two years before Ainscough died at a conference outside of Melbourne. Gibson approached Ainscough about her Whole Pantry app.",
      "The book said they were \u201cnot friends,\u201d and that Ainscough later said \u201csomething was off\u201d about Gibson.",
      "Gibson attended Ainscough\u2019s funeral services and, according to the book, \u201chysterically sobbed.\u201d",
      "According to the book, Ainscough\u2019s manager clarified on Instagram that there was \u201cno relationship\u201d between the two women.",
      "But Gibson was certainly aware of Ainscough, and four years before her death, was \u201cpositioning herself as the next poster girl for holistic health and wellness,\u201d\u00a0according to the book."

      "Last November, the ICC sparked bipartisan backlash in Washington by issuing arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, former Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant\u00a0and several Hamas leaders simultaneously. The Trump administration order claims this created a \u201cshameful moral equivalency.\u201d",
      "The court said there was reason to believe that Netanyahu and Gallant used \u201cstarvation as a method of warfare\u201d by restricting humanitarian aid and intentionally targeting civilians in Israel\u2019s campaign in Gaza \u2014 charges Israeli officials dismissed as false and antisemitic.",
      "A spokesperson for the court condemned Trump\u2019s order \u201cseeking to impose sanctions on its officials and harm its independent and impartial judicial work.\u201d",

      "Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Friday rejected the idea of holding talks with the Trump administration, saying that experience had shown it was \u201cnot rational, intelligent, or honorable\u201d to do so.",
      "\u201cNegotiations with America do not solve any of our problems,\u201d Khamenei said in a speech Friday, according to the Iranian news agency, Tasnim.",
      "Khamenei\u2019s comments came after Trump on Wednesday indicated a willingness to negotiate a nuclear deal with Iran \u201cimmediately.\u201d Days earlier, the President renewed his \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign against Tehran, signing an executive order aimed at preventing it from obtaining nuclear weapons and eliminating its oil exports.",
      "\u201cWe will see whether or not we can arrange or work out a deal with Iran,\" Trump said in a post on Truth Social.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t want to be tough on Iran. We don\u2019t want to be tough on anybody,\" he added, expressing a preference for \u201ca Verified Nuclear Peace Agreement, which will let Iran peacefully grow and prosper.\u201d",
      "The comments that Khamenei, 85, made in a speech to Air Force officers also appeared to contradict his own earlier remarks, in which he left the door open to discussions over whether Iran would be prepared to negotiate with the U.S. over enriching weapons-grade uranium and sanctions on billions of dollars worth of exports.",
      "In recent days, both sides have sent \"mixed messages\" as to whether they would engage in nuclear talks, said Darya Dolzikova\u200b, a Research Fellow with London-based think tank RUSI\u2019s Proliferation and Nuclear Policy program.",
      "\u201cThe intention of [the U.S.] engaging in nuclear diplomacy with Iran is certainly a good one. I guess where the challenges come in is, when the rubber really hits the road, what does that actually look like?\u201d Dolzikova told NBC News in a phone interview.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll just have to see what that looks like in practice,\u201d she added.",
      "Before Friday, both the White House and the Islamic Republic had this week signaled a change in tone from the first Trump administration, during which the President withdrew from a 2015 pact intended to curb Iran's nuclear program signed by the Obama administration, and reinstated crippling sanctions.",
      "Shortly after, the U.S. withdrew from the deal in 2018, Iran violated the previously agreed-upon enrichment limitations.",
      "But Khamenei pointed to that history on Friday, saying that Iran had made \u201cmany concessions\u201d with the U.S. in the 2010s, but that in the end, \u201cAmericans did not honor the deal.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur government at the time engaged in negotiations, held meetings, had discussions, smiled, shook hands, and built relationships,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cThe very person who is now in power tore up the agreement.\u201d",
      "While both European and American officials have since attempted to engage with Iran on the issue of nuclear proliferation, those talks have rarely, if ever, ended with a mutually satisfactory outcome.",
      "Trump's executive order Tuesday also triggered a response from Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, who told the Iranian news agency Tasmin on Wednesday that \u201cmaximum pressure is a failed experience, and repeating it will lead to another failure.\"",
      "Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian also played down the impact of U.S. sanctions on Iran. On Wednesday, he urged\u00a0his Iran's fellow members of the\u00a0Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to unite against possible U.S. sanctions on the major oil producer, later saying that \u201cIran is a powerful and resource-rich country that can navigate challenges by managing its resources.\u201d",
      "Iranian officials in recent days have repeatedly claimed the country isn't actively pursuing a nuclear weapon, reiterating that it is a signatory of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, an international agreement to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and technology.",
      "While Iran has not yet pursued building a nuclear bomb, a 2023 report released by watchdog International Atomic Energy Agency\u00a0found the country had begun enriching uranium close to weapons-grade levels.",
      "Speaking at a news conference Tuesday, President Trump indicated that the executive order he signed this week was intended to deter Iran from further developing its nuclear capabilities.",

      "Still, despite American efforts to target Iran's economy, RUSI's Dolzikova said that the use of sanctions is \u201cprobably not as strong of a lever as it will have been four or five years ago,\u201d because the Iranian economy has since adapted to the pressure by expanding its relations with Russia and China.",
      "She added that \u201cif the Trump administration does go after those continued exports to China, as they seem set to do, then that might create additional pressure.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Israel's defense minister said Thursday that he had instructed his military to prepare a plan to allow Palestinians to voluntarily leave the Gaza Strip, after his country's leadership embraced President Donald Trump's widely condemned remarks in which he said the United States may seek ownership of the territory.",
      "Welcoming what he called Trump's \"bold initiative,\" Israel Katz said in a statement Thursday that Palestinians in Gaza \"should be granted the freedom to leave and emigrate, as is customary everywhere in the world.\" He said the plan would include \"exit options\" for Palestinians to leave Gaza via land crossings, with the possibility of \"special arrangements\" for departures by sea and air.",

      "Trump made contradictory comments on whether he foresaw Palestinians being able to live in the enclave, with White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt on Wednesday seeking to clarify his statements.",
      "The president is \"committed to rebuilding Gaza and to temporarily relocating\" Palestinians during those reconstruction efforts, she said, adding that Trump has not committed to sending U.S. troops to Gaza as part of the effort.",

      "MAE SOT, Thailand \u2014 For people fleeing the conflict in Myanmar, the injuries are often more than just physical.",
      "Four years after a military coup that has morphed into a grinding civil war, experts say there is a growing mental health crisis in the Southeast Asian nation, made worse by the junta\u2019s atrocities against civilians and a humanitarian disaster that has left more than 3 million people displaced.",
      "They find some relief at the Mae Tao Clinic on the outskirts of Mae Sot, a border town in neighboring Thailand.",
      "Each morning, hundreds of Burmese arrive at the clinic, waiting to see a doctor, receive vaccinations or get a prenatal checkup. Some are living in refugee camps along the Thai-Myanmar border, while others have jobs as migrant workers or have crossed into Thailand illegally.",
      "The donor-funded clinic, which opened in the 1980s with only four beds, has since evolved into a full-fledged primary health facility that offers a range of free services, including psychiatric care. It says its 700 doctors, nurses, medics and volunteers treat 120,000 people a year, a number that may increase after a freeze on foreign aid by the Trump administration that threatens to close U.S.-supported health care facilities treating Myanmar refugees in Thai border camps.",
      "Those who have fled Myanmar \u201chave so many traumas,\u201d said Thein, a Myanmar refugee who is one of the psychiatric care unit\u2019s two Burmese-speaking psychiatrists.",
      "On Tuesdays and Fridays, the two days the unit is open, Thein walks past the bustling outpatient wards and crosses a tranquil bamboo garden to his office. It is a single-story cement building painted light blue, with the windows and doors covered in translucent black film to protect patients\u2019 privacy.",
      "Thein, 36, sees about 10 patients a day in one-on-one sessions. They include rebel soldiers injured on the front lines as well as political refugees and migrant workers.",
      "\u201cThey have flashbacks and nightmares at night and they cannot sleep,\u201d said Thein, who has been in Mae Sot for a year and asked not to be identified by his full name to protect his safety and that of his family.",
      "While the clinic has social workers and counselors for patients with milder mental health issues, Thein works with the most serious cases.",
      "\u201cI can give counseling to them, like mindfulness or meditation or breathing,\u201d he said. But often his patients also require medication, which the clinic provides for free.",
      "Thein said he sometimes struggles with anxiety himself stemming from the abuse he received from the junta.",
      "Like most of his patients, Thein\u2019s life took a turn on Feb. 1, 2021, when the Myanmar military \u2014 which has ruled the former British colony for much of its history since it gained independence in 1948 \u2014 overthrew democratically elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi. Peaceful protests broke out immediately, to which the new military government responded with deadly violence.",
      "According to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, a nonprofit group that has documented killings and arrests since the coup, the junta has killed at least 6,000 people and arrested more than 28,000. On Friday, Myanmar state media reported that the state of emergency that has been in place since the coup had been extended for another six months, further delaying promised elections.",
      "Though the junta remains in charge, its hold on power has slipped in the face of a coordinated offensive by ethnic rebel groups that have fought the Myanmar military for decades. In the past year the government has lost control of vast swaths of territory around the country, creating instability along Myanmar\u2019s borders with Thailand, India, China and others.",
      "\u201cI want to help my friends, but I don\u2019t want to kill people,\u201d Thein said. \u201cSo I treated the wounded people or wounded soldiers.\u201d",
      "Thein was arrested in 2022 on suspicion of helping the resistance and sent to Myanmar\u2019s notorious Insein Prison.",
      "\u201cThey tortured me with a whip. I think six people beat me during the interrogation. It was really scary,\u201d Thein recalled, as he raised his hands around his head to demonstrate how he tried to protect himself.",
      "Thein was released after a year of detention. Fearing another arrest, he left his life in Yangon, Myanmar\u2019s largest city, and fled to Thailand.",
      "Mae Sot has long been a place for Burmese to seek sanctuary, but it is an uneasy refuge. It is filled with people waiting for resettlement, living with constant anguish while facing the risk of arrest and deportation.",
      "Every month, Burmese who lack the documents needed to stay in Thailand legally have to pay local police 300 baht ($9) to obtain a card that prevents them from being detained or deported, but many find this fee unaffordable.",
      "\u201cSome patients were arrested on the way to the clinic by the Thai police because they have no documents,\u201d Thein said.",
      "The clinic\u2019s founder, Cynthia Maung, was also a doctor in Myanmar before she fled in 1988 amid a crackdown by the military government on a pro-democracy uprising.",
      "\u201cI think the struggles now and back then are very similar,\u201d she said.",
      "Mental health is often neglected in Myanmar, where Thein was trained. According to the World Health Organization, as of 2019 there were only 117 psychiatrists and two mental health hospitals in the country of 54 million people.",
      "Shwe Zin Aung is one of Thein\u2019s patients and has been struggling with bipolar disorder for a decade.",
      "The 35-year-old teacher arrived in Mae Sot from Myanmar\u2019s capital city, Naypyidaw, in early December, following in her brother\u2019s footsteps. She said that in addition to free medication, the clinic provided her with a safe place to talk about her feelings.",
      "Though she said she had not personally faced any abuse from the junta, \u201cit is so frustrating to see them brutally shoot the protesters,\u201d she said.",
      "Back home, Thein and his patients had respectable careers and stable lives, but here they are stateless \u2014 as are more than half a million people in Thailand, most of them from Myanmar.",
      "Though Bangkok has not ratified the 1951 United Nations Refugee Convention and does not officially recognize refugees, Thai authorities have largely tolerated the influx of people from Myanmar, even before the coup in 2021.",
      "In October, the government of Thailand said it would grant citizenship to nearly 500,000\u00a0long-term residents as well as some children born in the country in an effort to address their legal status.",
      "Though her clinic is well known in Myanmar, Maung, 65, has not been in the country for almost four decades.",
      "When she first arrived in Thailand at the age of 28, Muang assumed she would return home in a few months once the political environment stabilized. But months soon turned into years.",
      "She felt newly hopeful in November 2020, when Suu Kyi\u2019s National League for Democracy was elected to a second consecutive term in a landslide. The military coup took place within three months, shattering Maung\u2019s dreams.",
      "Among those driven out of Myanmar by the coup, she said, were psychiatrists and psychologists who came to Mae Sot and have enabled the clinic to expand its services to help others struggling with displacement.",

    "story": [
      "HONG KONG \u2014 What a difference a few months makes.",
      "The U.S. and its longtime allies Japan and South Korea have been strengthening ties in recent years, both individually and as a three-way partnership, in an effort to counter an increasingly assertive China and North Korea. But recent political changes in all three countries have injected new uncertainty into their relations.",
      "South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol is facing an impeachment trial over his botched attempt in December to declare martial law, and it will be months before the country has a clear leader. In Japan, Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba is hamstrung by a minority government after his scandal-ridden Liberal Democratic Party performed poorly in an October parliamentary election.",
      "And in the United States, voters elected a president in November who disdains alliances and prefers to deal with countries individually, and who in his first term accused Japan and South Korea of \u201cfreeloading\u201d under the U.S. security umbrella.",
      "On Friday, Ishiba is set to meet with President Donald Trump at the White House, in the first major indication of how the new U.S. administration will interact with the two Asian democracies.",
      "Like the U.S., both countries are wary of China\u2019s rise but also count it among their top trading partners. The challenge for Ishiba will be to sell Trump on the importance of U.S. security commitments in Asia and avoid the kinds of tariffs that Trump has imposed on China and threatened to impose on U.S. allies Canada and Mexico.",
      "Ishiba said he planned \u201cto work hard to establish a relationship of mutual trust\u201d during his visit with Trump.",
      "\u201cI hope that we can confirm that by Japan and the U.S. cooperating on issues such as the economy and security, this will bring peace and allow for development not for the free and open Indo-Pacific region but also for the rest of the world,\u201d the Japanese leader told reporters in Tokyo on Thursday.",
      "Japanese visit",
      "Ishiba is looking for a \u201cneutral outcome\u201d from the visit, and is most likely just happy to be the second foreign leader to meet with Trump after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said Michael Cucek, an assistant professor of Asian studies at Temple University in Japan.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s not going to try to win any points or get any gifts from the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cHe knows that there are none available.\u201d",
      "Ishiba is likely to emphasize Japan\u2019s role as the largest foreign investor in the U.S. \u2014 in December, the head of the Japanese tech conglomerate SoftBank, Masayoshi Son, pledged to invest $100 billion in the U.S. over the next four years at a meeting with Trump.",
      "Business ties with Japan have been strained by the $15 billion bid by its largest steelmaker, Nippon Steel, for Pittsburgh-based U.S. Steel, which former President Joe Biden blocked last month citing national security concerns. Trump also opposes the deal, which Nippon Steel says it has not given up on.",
      "The blocking of the deal is unlikely to fundamentally alter the U.S.-Japan relationship, said Anthony Rapa, partner and co-chair of the International Trade practice group at Blank Rome in Washington, given both countries are more concerned with Indo-Pacific security and countering China.",
      "\u201cThat said, the rejection of the deal genuinely did sting, considering the historical closeness of the two nations, Japan\u2019s standing as the top U.S. investor, and the fact that no Japanese investment had ever been blocked on national security grounds before, at least not publicly,\u201d he said in an email.",
      "Takahiro Mori, vice chairman of Nippon Steel, said Thursday that the company would be watching the Ishiba-Trump summit closely and that he hoped it would be \u201ca catalyst that would open the way towards the future.\u201d",
      "Cucek said Ishiba would \u201cutterly avoid\u201d raising the topic with Trump, especially since Nippon Steel is suing over the blocking of the deal.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no reason to bring it up,\u201d Cucek said. \u201cThere\u2019s no advantage that he gets out of it.\u201d",
      "Ishiba is unlikely to get along with Trump as well as Shinzo Abe, the former Japanese prime minister who was assassinated in 2022 and who had a close personal relationship with Trump. Cucek said that the current Japanese leader has a fundamentally different temperament from Abe \u2014 who won over the President with a charm offensive that involved flattery and golf.",
      "\u201cNevertheless, in dealing with Donald Trump, he has this playbook from Abe of simply flattering the man,\u201d he said.",
      "Anxiety in South Korea",
      "In South Korea, there are worries that the country could be falling behind in engaging with the Trump administration due to the political instability after Yoon\u2019s short-lived martial law order.",
      "The Constitutional Court has up to 180 days to decide whether Yoon, who is suspended from presidential duties after being impeached by lawmakers, should indeed be removed from office. If he is, South Korea would then have 60 days to hold a presidential by-election.",
      "Though Trump had a phone call with Yoon shortly after his election victory in November, he has not spoken with acting South Korean President Choi Sang-mok.",
      "\u201cThere is no way that Trump will actually engage directly\u201d with an acting president, said Jennifer Lee, a principal at the Asia Group in Washington who focuses on the Korean Peninsula.",
      "\u201cSo waiting six months to have that kind of highest-level meeting will definitely hurt the country,\u201d she said, \u201cespecially given the uncertainty around the Trump administration\u2019s policies.\u201d",
      "There has been other contact, however, including a phone call last month between Secretary of State Marco Rubio and his South Korean counterpart, Cho Tae-yul, and a call Wednesday between National Security Adviser Mike Waltz and his South Korean counterpart, Shin Won-sik.",
      "One area where South Korea is eager to coordinate with the U.S. is North Korea, where leader Kim Jong Un has been advancing his nuclear and ballistic missile programs and ratcheting up his hostile rhetoric against the U.S., South Korea and others.",
      "Trump has said he plans to reach out to Kim, whom he met with three times during his first term.",
      "\u201cThere is a lot of anxiety, especially on them not being included in the possible U.S.-North Korea dialogue,\u201d said Lee, who recently returned from a trip to South Korea.",
      "Japan, which is also directly threatened by North Korea, shares a number of potential challenges with South Korea in a new Trump administration.",
      "Both countries host thousands of U.S. troops, and both countries came under pressure during Trump\u2019s first term to shoulder more of the cost for that.",
      "Tariffs are another potential concern, after Trump announced 25% tariffs on U.S. allies Canada and Mexico before putting them on hold at the last minute.\u00a0 South Korea, which has a highly export-dependent economy, is considered especially vulnerable, and South Korean companies such as Hyundai, Samsung and LG are exposed because of their facilities in Mexico and China, where the U.S. did impose a 10% tariff on Tuesday.",
      "Though both South Korea and Japan would be affected if Trump imposes a blanket tariff on all U.S. imports as he has floated, both Lee and Cucek said there is no obvious reason for them to be directly targeted the way Canada, Mexico and China were over their alleged roles in the U.S. fentanyl crisis.",
      "\u201cThere is nothing that provides the excuse for the use right now of tariffs,\u201d Cucek said.",
      "Jennifer Jett reported from Hong Kong, Arata Yamamoto from Tokyo and Stella Kim from Seoul, South Korea."

    "story": [
      "It's a major scientific leap \u2014 or at least a hop.",
      "Researchers in Australia said Thursday that they have for the first time successfully produced the first kangaroo embryos through in-vitro fertilization, in a breakthrough that may help save endangered species from extinction.",
      "Australia is not short of kangaroos \u2014 the bouncing creatures are commonly eaten there \u2014 but they are from the marsupial group of mammals that is mostly found in the country and has lost many species to extinction.",
      "The researchers' use of IVF on kangaroo eggs and sperm may help support the conservation of those marsupials, said Andres Gambini,  lead researcher and University of Queensland lecturer.",
      "\u201cOur team built on years of experience working with reproductive technologies in domestic animals like livestock and horses,\u201d Gambini told NBC News via email. \u201cBy adapting these techniques to the unique biology of kangaroos, we were able to create an embryo in the lab for the first time.\u201d",
      "The research will help scientists learn more about how marsupial embryos grow because the class reproduces differently compared to other mammals.",
      "\u201cKangaroos have a very short pregnancy, and the embryo can go into suspended animation for several months,\u201d Gambini said. \u201cOur success with IVF helps us better understand these early stages of development.\u201d",
      "Australia is one of the world's most biodiverse countries but also has the highest rate of mammal extinction. Australia\u2019s invasive species council says that since the European settlement, at least 33 mammal species have become extinct, with many of those marsupials.",
      "A historically high rate of extinction led the Australian government in 2022 to announce a 10-year\u00a0\u201czero extinctions\u201d plan to protect those under threat, reserving at least 30% of the country\u2019s land mass for conservation.",
      "\u201cIf we keep doing what we\u2019re doing, more plants and animals will become extinct,\u201d Australian Environment Minister Tanya Plibersek said in the report. \u201cEven koalas are now endangered on the east coast of Australia.\u201d",
      "Now, more than 2,200 species in the country are classified as threatened with extinction, according to a 2023\u00a0report\u00a0by the nonprofit Australian Conservation Foundation.",
      "\u201cThe laws that are meant to be protecting Australia\u2019s nature are failing,\u201d the report said, adding that the country\u2019s major conservation policy as it existed then was \u201cbarely monitored, rarely enforced and full of loopholes that allow businesses to destroy nature.\u201d",
      "While kangaroos are not endangered, the University of Queensland researchers hope the latest breakthrough can help to preserve other endangered marsupial species native to the continent, including koalas, Tasmanian devils and northern hairy-nosed wombats.",
      "\u201cThis work gives us a new tool to help preserve genetic material in endangered species,\u201d Gambini said. \u201cBy creating and freezing embryos, we can safeguard the unique genetic of these animals.\u201d",
      "It's not the first time IVF has been used as a tool to preserve endangered species.",
      "Last year, scientists in Italy achieved the world\u2019s first IVF rhino pregnancy, offering hope for saving Kenya's northern white rhino \u2014 of which there are only two animals left on the planet \u2014 from extinction. They did so by transferring a lab-created rhino embryo into a surrogate mother.",
      "Still, the latest IVF breakthrough is just one step on a long road to a more comprehensive solution, Gambini said.",
      "\u201cThere are many unknowns, as we are just on the beginning and there is lot to discover yet,\u201d he said, adding that when combined with other strategies, \u201cit can make a real difference for species at risk.\u201d"

      "ATHENS, Greece \u2014\u00a0Hundreds more people were expected to leave Greece\u2019s\u00a0Santorini\u00a0island on Wednesday as tremors shook the popular summer tourist destination for a sixth day.",
      "About 10,000 people have left on ferries and planes in recent days as hundreds of small quakes were registered in the surrounding sea, shaking buildings, kicking up dust on the island\u2019s rocky cliffs, and raising fears of a major earthquake.",
      "The island\u2019s population swells in summer when millions of tourists visit the traditional white-painted villas that line its steep hillsides. The 2021 census puts\u00a0Santorini\u2019s permanent population at 15,000, so it is likely that a few thousand remain on the island, given that it is off-season.",
      "Authorities have introduced safety measures, including halting construction, shutting schools on\u00a0Santorini\u00a0and the nearby islands of Ios, Amorgos and Anafi, and ordering residents and hotels to empty their pools to reduce the burden on the ground.",
      "Government officials and seismologists who met on Wednesday to assess the situation pointed to a high risk of landslides, including near the island\u2019s main port Athinios which serves some 1.5 million passengers a year.",
      "Local authorities have restricted access to some high-risk areas, while first responders, vessels and a helicopter were on alert in case of emergency.",
      "\u201cThe whole state mechanism has been activated...so that we are ready for any possibility with the hope that things will get better and the phenomenon will decrease in intensity,\u201d Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said on Wednesday.",
      "Two ferry routes from the port of Piraeus to\u00a0Santorini\u00a0and vice versa were cancelled on Wednesday due to rough seas. Bad weather was not expected to disrupt six Aegean Airlines flights, including two emergency ones, scheduled for Wednesday.",
      "Seismologists estimate that the high seismic activity could take days or weeks to abate, although locals and government officials said the shaking had lessened on Wednesday.",
      "\u201cIt has not shaken much today, I haven\u2019t felt anything since 0400 (0200GMT),\u201d said Nikos Sakorafos, owner of a travel agency in the popular tourist village of Fira.",
      "\u201cNow, it\u2019s a dead season for the island, most people don\u2019t have work so it\u2019s easier for them to leave.\u201d",
      "Greece is one of the most earthquake-prone countries in Europe as it sits at the boundary of the African and Eurasian tectonic plates whose constant interaction prompts frequent quakes.",
      "Santorini\u00a0took its current shape following one of the largest volcanic eruptions in history, around 1600 BC. The last eruption in the area occurred in 1950."
