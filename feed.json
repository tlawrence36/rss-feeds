      "Tom Cruise finally has an Academy Award",
      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Tom Cruise, at 63 still the biggest movie star in a room full of them, finally got to hold his own Oscar on a Hollywood stage on Sunday night.",
      "\u201cMaking movies is not what I do, it's who I am,\u201d said Cruise. He was composed as always, but at moments seemed near tears as he spoke, grasping the gold honorary statuette that celebrated his more than 40 years at the apex of the industry at the film academy's annual Governors Awards.",
      "\u201cIn that theater we laugh together, we feel together, we hope together,\u201d he said after a two-minute ovation.",
      "Production designer Wynn Thomas and choreographer and actor Debbie Allen were also selected by the academy's board of governors to be honored for their storied careers, and an absent Dolly Parton was honored for a lifetime of philanthropy at the ceremony at the Ray Dolby Ballroom in Los Angeles.",
      "A competitive Oscar has eluded Cruise, who's been nominated four times: as an actor for 1989\u2019s \u201cBorn on the Fourth of July,\u201d 1996\u2019s \u201cJerry Maguire\u201d and 1999\u2019s \u201cMagnolia,\u201d and as a producer for 2022\u2019s \u201cTop Gun: Maverick.\u201d",
      "Before he took the stage, the audience saw a long montage of clips from those and his other films \u2014 loaded with death-defying stunts he often did himself \u2014 from 1981's \u201cTaps\u201d through this year's \u201cMission: Impossible -- The Final Reckoning.\u201d",
      "It was fitting that the Governors Awards aren't televised. Tom Cruise doesn't do TV, and he's been among the biggest champions of the theatergoing experience over streaming.",
      "\u201cI will always do everything I can to help this art form,\u201d Cruise said. \u201cTo support and champion new voices, to protect what makes cinema powerful. Hopefully without too many more broken bones.\u201d",
      "Oscar-winning director Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu presented Cruise the award. The two have spent several months shooting a film in London set for release in 2026. The collaboration suggests that Cruise, who has stuck to blockbuster franchise fare in recent years, might not be done trying to win an Academy Award the old-fashioned way.",
      "\u201cThis may be his first Oscar,\u201d I\u00f1\u00e1rritu said, \u201cbut from what I have seen and experienced, this will not be the last.\u201d",
      "The list of stars who attended suggests that the campaign for the next competitive Oscars is low-key underway. The banquet tables were filled with potential nominees, including Leonardo DiCaprio, Michael B. Jordan, Sydney Sweeney, Dwayne Johnson, Ariana Grande and Jacob Elordi.",
      "Here's a look at Sunday night's other honorees:",
      "Allen, 75, has never been nominated for an Oscar. But the multi-hyphenate entertainer has played an integral role in the Oscars show, having choreographed seven ceremonies over the years, four of them nominated for Emmys.",
      "As an actor she appeared in \u201cRagtime\u201d and both the film and television series \u201cFame.\u201d She was also a producer of the film \u201cAmistad,\u201d whose director, Steven Spielberg, hugged her as she took the stage.",
      "A tearful Allen thanked the room for \u201cthis glorious golden moment in the sun.\u201d",
      "Cynthia Erivo presented the award to Allen, whom she considers an \u201caunty,\u201d and praised her for lifting up her fellow Black artists.",

      "Allen thanked her sister, actor Phylicia Rashad, and her husband of 40 years, former NBA all-star and LA Laker Norm Nixon, both of whom sat at her table.",

      "But he's best known for his decades of collaborations with director Spike Lee on films including \u201cDo The Right Thing,\u201d \u201cMalcolm X\u201d and \u201cDa 5 Bloods.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy journey to storytelling began as a poor Black kid in one of the worst slums in Philadelphia,\u201d Thomas said after accepting his statuette from Octavia Spencer. \u201cThe local gangs looked down on me and called me sissy.

      "Parton has twice been nominated for best original song Oscars, including for \u201c9 to 5,\u201d the title song of her first film in an acting career that also included \u201cSteel Magnolias.\u201d",
      "Her \u201c9 to 5\u201d co-star Lily Tomlin presented the award, turning her struggles to read the teleprompter into comic improv. She fondly recalled the baby-doll pajamas Parton wore at the impromptu slumber parties they had with co-star Jane Fonda.",
      "Tomlin said the song \u201c9 to 5\u201d became \u201can anthem for our times\u201d and was itself an example of Parton's philanthropy with its emphasis on worker struggles.",
      "She said it's ironic that there is so much artifice in Parton's appearance, because \u201cshe is the most authentic person I have ever known.\u201d",
      "Cruise, in typically hyper-prepared fashion, didn't just shout out his fellow nominees from the stage, but gave each their own detailed tribute. He told Thomas the exact date and theater he first saw one of his films, Spike Lee's \u201cShe's Gotta Have It.\u201d He praised Parton for showing that \u201ccompassion and creativity are not separate.\u201d And for Allen he quoted from the work of her mother, poet and playwright Vivian Ayers Allen.",
      "Allen gave her own tribute to Cruise, recalling the early-career signature moment when he danced and lip-synced in his underwear in \u201cRisky Business.\u201d",
      "\u201cHoney, we loved when you slid out in those tighty-whiteys,\u201d she said.",

Lionsgate\u2019s \u201cNow You See Me: Now You Don\u2019t\u201d pulled in $21.3 million, while Paramount\u2019s \u201cThe Running Man\u201d made $17 million, according to studio estimates Sunday.",

Including ticket sales from 64 international territories, its worldwide opening is estimated to be around $75.5 million. Going into the weekend, it was expected to be a closer race between the two newcomers.",
      "\u201cHonestly, I didn\u2019t see us being number one for the weekend about 10 days ago,\u201d Kevin Grayson, the president of worldwide distribution for Lionsgate's motion picture group, said Sunday. \u201cBut as we started to get closer and ticket sale numbers started to pop, we saw that there was going to be a horse race. Then we pulled away Saturday morning.\u201d",
      "Grayson said it's a testament not only to the franchise but the marketing and publicity strategies which, \u201creally helped us get into a position where we now can play all the way through the holiday corridor.\u201d",

One key difference is that women made up more of the \u201cNow You See Me\u201d audience (54%). They only accounted for 37% of \u201cThe Running Man\u201d ticket buyers.",
      "Edgar Wright directed and co-wrote \u201cThe Running Man,\u201d the second adaptation of Stephen King\u2019s novel, first published in 1982. The first film starred Arnold Schwarzenegger and was released in 1987 to mixed reviews and a tepid box office, earning only $38 million against a $27 million budget.

Someone who could almost always find the humor in this crazy ride on Planet Earth.\u201d",
      "Snider's family and friends had said in a Friday statement that he had been diagnosed with pneumonia at a hospital in Hendersonville, Tennessee, and that his situation had since grown more complicated and he was transferred elsewhere. The diagnosis came on the heels of the cancellation of a tour after Snider had been the victim of a violent assault in the Salt Lake City area, according to a Nov. 3 statement from his management team.",

      "The scrapped tour was in support of his most recent album, \u201cHigh, Lonesome and Then Some,\u201d which released in October.

In reviews of his recent albums, The Associated Press called him a \u201csinger-songwriter with the persona of a fried folkie\u201d and a \u201cstoner troubadour and cosmic comic.\u201d",

      "\u201cPalm Royale\u201d made a splash in its first season with a starry cast, high production values, and its ubiquitous grasshopper cocktail",
      "NEW YORK -- When Kristen Wiig steps out of a vintage Rolls-Royce in the opening scene of Season 2 of \u201cPalm Royale,\u201d she\u2019s sporting a tall, yellow, fringed hat, gold platform sandals and sunny bell bottoms, with fabric petals that sway with every determined step. It\u2019s the first clue that the costumes on the female-driven comedy are taking center stage.",
      "The Apple TV show made a splash in its first season with the starry cast, high production values and ubiquitous grasshopper cocktail. Wiig\u2019s character, Maxine, tries to break into Palm Beach high society in 1969 and bumps heads with co-stars Carol Burnett, Allison Janney, Leslie Bibb and Laura Dern. But also playing a starring role are the vintage designer frocks that reflect each character.",
      "For Season 2, which premiered this week, Emmy-winning costume designer Alix Friedberg says she and her team coordinated \u201cthousands\u201d of looks that reflect the characters\u2019 jet-setting style. She says 50-60% of the brightly colored and graphic print costumes are original vintage designer pieces, sourced by shoppers and costume designers.",
      "\u201cThe looks are so iconic. Sometimes Kristen will walk in in something, and it brings tears to my eyes,\u201d Kaia Gerber \u2014 who plays Mitzi \u2014 told The Associated Press in a recent interview.",
      "If not original vintage, Friedberg\u2019s team builds the costumes, and if a character has to wear an outfit in multiple scenes or in big dance numbers, the team may create duplicates to preserve continuity. Friedberg says she was lucky to find so many vendors with vintage designer pieces in great condition.",
      "\u201c(Bibb\u2019s character) Dinah wears a few original Oscar de la Renta pieces that are really so perfect. Bill Blass was a big one, Oleg Cassini,\u201d Friedberg says. \u201cThere\u2019s a dress that (Janney\u2019s character) Evelyn wears that's this all emerald green jersey, it\u2019s an original Halston and it\u2019s so stunning on her and it really does sort of evoke what\u2019s to come in the '70s.\u201d",
      "Janney calls Friedberg \u201cbrilliant\u201d and marveled at her talent at finding pieces that are like works of art. Some of her favorites were the characters\u2019 apr\u00e8s-ski looks in the Swiss Alps \u2014 but she finds it hard to pick an ultimate favorite.",
      "\u201cAll of them just make me feel divine. And the hair is just a masterpiece, and the makeup \u2014 it all goes together to just create Evelyn and I barely have to do anything,\u201d Janney says.",
      "The costumes also help heighten the comedy. Friedberg says Evelyn\u2019s stoic and deadpan character elicits laughs with some of her over-the-top getups.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s delivering this dialogue, these lines with, like, seven wigs on top of her,\u201d Friedberg says. \u201cThe absurdity comes out really in how these women present themselves time and time again. \u2026 It was just so much fun to get to laugh and wink at the audience.\u201d",
      "Burnett called costume fittings on the show \u201cgreat fun\u201d and said they helped her find her character, the scheming Norma. \u201cI work from the outside in. I have to know what I\u2019m going to look like,\u201d she says.",

      "The costumes also help set the tone for the female empowerment theme that permeates this season. \u201cEvelyn wore a lot more pants \u2014 which seems ridiculous to say today \u2014 but back then that was a real power move,\u201d Friedberg says.",

I always have been obsessed with Sharon Stone in \u2018Casino,\u2019\u201d Bibb says \u2014 and so they \u201cstole\u201d a bit of that look. \u201cWe really have Dinah going into pantsuits and just a different sense of her and she\u2019s really becoming her most modern self.\u201d",

      "\u201cWhat if we approach Douglas where he\u2019s always been dressed by women in his life? He\u2019s always been dressed by someone else.

      "He's in fact the rare character who repeats outfits, Friedberg notes. \u201cYou can kind of see them, as the series goes along, getting a little bit more and more threadbare,\u201d she says.",
      "Gerber\u2019s character gets a major makeover this season after coming into money. The actor gushed about Friedberg\u2019s intentional designs as Mitzi finds her \u201cwomanhood and her power.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was so fun to be able to be wearing these expensive gowns and jewelry and the hair and the makeup, and how that really sort of parallels Mitzi\u2019s inner journey as well,\u201d she says.",
      "The costumes may be eye candy, but Friedberg says each look also carries deeper meaning.",
      "\u201cMaxine wears this dress that was an original Oscar de la Renta dress,\u201d Friedberg says. \u201cIt\u2019s very much something that Norma would wear, and it is saying to the audience without saying to the audience that she\u2019s arrived, it\u2019s her time, it\u2019s time for her to rule.\u201d",

      "The BBC has apologized to U.S. President Donald Trump over a misleading edit of his speech on Jan. 6, 2021, but said it strongly disagreed that there was a basis for a defamation lawsuit",
      "LONDON -- The BBC has issued a public apology to U.S. President Donald Trump over a misleading edit of his speech on Jan. 6, 2021, but said it \u201cstrongly disagreed there is a basis for a defamation claim.\u201d",
      "Since it was established more than a century ago, Britain's public broadcaster has been no stranger to controversy. Over the past week, it has been embroiled in one of its deepest-ever crisis as its director general stepped down, its head of news quit, questions were raised over the veracity of its journalism and Trump said he is mulling a billion-dollar lawsuit.",
      "Here's what to know.",
      "Pressure on the broadcaster has been growing since the right-leaning Daily Telegraph newspaper published parts of a dossier compiled by the BBC's adviser on standards and guidelines on Nov. 3.",
      "As well as criticizing the BBC\u2019s coverage of transgender issues and raising concerns of anti-Israel bias in the BBC\u2019s Arabic service, the dossier said that an edition of the BBC\u2019s flagship current affairs series \u201cPanorama\" \u2014 titled \u201cTrump: A Second Chance?\u201d \u2014 broadcast days before the 2024 U.S. presidential election was misleading.",
      "Specifically, it showed how the third-party production company that made the film spliced together three quotes from two sections of the Jan. 6, 2021 speech into what appeared to be one quote in which Trump urged supporters to march with him and \u201cfight like hell.\u201d",
      "By doing so, it made it look like Trump was giving the green light to his supporters to storm the U.S. Capitol as Congress was poised to certify President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s victory in the 2020 election that Trump falsely alleged was stolen from him.",
      "The outcry from opponents of the BBC \u2014 and there are many both in the U.K. and abroad \u2014 was immediate and vociferous.",
      "The broadcaster, which is funded by an annual license fee of 174.50 pounds ($230) paid by all U.K. households who watch live TV or any BBC content, was accused of bias against Trump, symptomatic of they say an inherent liberal bias within the organization.",
      "For days, the BBC said very little, saying it did not report to leaked reports. Many thought that was a misjudgement as it allowed the narrative around the edit to be led by its opponents.",
      "By Nov. 9, the pressure on the BBC was becoming increasingly acute, prompting its top executive, Tim Davie, and head of news Deborah Turness to resign over what the broadcaster called an \u201cerror of judgment.\u201d",
      "It was also revealed that Trump was demanding a retraction, apology and compensation over the sequence. \u201cI guess I have to,\u201d Trump said when asked about whether he would go through with his legal threat. \u201cBecause I think they defrauded the public and they\u2019ve admitted it.\u201d",
      "Trump had set a deadline of Friday, Nov. 14 for the BBC to respond to his challenge.",

      "While the BBC statement doesn\u2019t respond to Trump\u2019s demand that he be compensated for \u201coverwhelming financial and reputational harm,\u201d the headline on its news story about the apology said it refused to pay compensation.",
      "The U.S. president has yet to respond to the BBC's apology and its rejection of of his demands for compensation.",
      "Legal experts have said that Trump would face challenges taking the case to court in the U.K. or the U.S. They said that the BBC could show that Trump wasn\u2019t harmed because he was ultimately elected president in 2024.",
      "While many legal experts have dismissed the president\u2019s claims against the media as having little merit, he has won some lucrative settlements against U.S. media companies and he could try to leverage the BBC mistake for a payout, potentially to a charity of his choice.",
      "However this latest crisis pans out in the days and weeks ahead, the heat will remain on the BBC, especially in its newsrooms where any mistake, or seeming bias, will no doubt be picked up opponents.",
      "As a public broadcaster, the BBC has to be impartial in the way it covers news events. It's a fine balancing act that often gets the BBC into trouble. Some think it leans too much to the right, while others think it goes the other way. Whatever the truth of the matter, many think that the BBC is often cowed in its coverage, particularly on domestic political matters.",

      "The four 1940s-era sketches are titled \u201cSo You Want to See the President!\u201d and depict people from all walks of life hanging out in the White House lobby as they anticipate meeting President Franklin D. Roosevelt. They were put up for sale by a grandson of the White House official who received them as a gift from Rockwell after a court battle over their ownership was settled.",
      "The sketches are set to be sold by a Dallas-based auction house Friday. In keeping with its mission to help the White House collect and display artifacts that represent American history and culture, including the history of the White House, the association hopes to prevail. It wants to add the drawing to the vast White House collection of art, furniture and other items.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re so different from any of the other art that was exhibited in the West Wing,\u201d said Anita McBride, who sits on the association's board of directors.",
      "McBride remembers seeing the drawings in 1981 when she went to work in Ronald Reagan\u2019s administration. They were a \u201cfocal point\u201d when staffers took visitors on tours, she said. \u201cPeople just loved seeing\u201d the \u201cwide array and depiction of Americans that have access to their president.\u201d",
      "The series, created in 1943 and published in the Saturday Evening Post during World War II, \u201coffers an intimate and deeply human portrayal of American democracy in action,\u201d according to a description on the Heritage Auctions website.",
      "The sketches show a variety of people \u2014 journalists, military officers and even a Miss America Pageant winner and her publicist \u2014 waiting on plush-looking red chairs in the West Wing lobby as they waited to meet Roosevelt. A Secret Service agent stands watch in one of the scenes.",
      "\u201cIn a way, it sort of illustrates how FDR always talked about the \u2018arsenal of democracy\u2019 and what made the United States unique,\u201d said Matthew Costello, the association\u2019s chief education officer. \u201cIt\u2019s an incredible series of renderings.\u201d",
      "The sketches are Rockwell\u2019s only known collection of four interrelated paintings that he conceived to tell a story, the auction house said.",
      "Rockwell gave the original drawings to Stephen Early, who was Roosevelt's longtime press secretary, seen in a drawing smoking a pipe as reporters huddle around him. A family member turned them over to the White House in 1978, and they were on display throughout the West Wing for more than four decades, sometimes in a hallway between the press offices that are mere steps from the Oval Office.",

      "Bidding will start at $2.5 million and clients are \u201cready and waiting to compete for this American icon,\u201d Christina Rees, director of communications for Heritage Auctions, said in an email. The auction house has estimated the drawings will sell for between $4 million and $6 million.",
      "That price tag could present a hurdle for the White House Historical Association, which was created in 1961 by first lady Jacqueline Kennedy to help preserve the museum quality of the interior of the White House and educate the public. It is a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization that receives no government funding. It raises money mostly through private donations and merchandise sales, including an annual Christmas ornament.",

Don\u2019t waste your time on the people who don\u2019t,\u201d Coppola recalled Wednesday night in New York at the Museum of Modern Art Film Benefit, where she was being honored for her films.",

      "But it's a distinction that was hard earned. Just over 27 years after her father Francis Ford Coppola encouraged her to make her first short film, Coppola reflected on starting a filmmaking career at a time when she was thought of as \u201ca nepo baby before they were charming\u201d and \u201cthe amateur actress who had single-handedly ruined \u2018The Godfather\u2019 films.\u201d",

      "Fanning remembered meticulously planning her outfit to meet Coppola for the first time at age 11, where she would go on to be cast as the daughter of a famous movie star in \u201cSomewhere.\u201d A few years prior she had convinced her grandmother to take her to see \u201cMarie Antoinette\u201d and she immediately became a fan.",
      "\u201cLiving in that cinema, in Sofia\u2019s world for a few hours, it would change my girlhood forever,\u201d Fanning said. \u201cIt was the place that I felt safe and seen, and I wanted to live in it a hundred times over.\u201d",
      "On \u201cSomewhere,\u201d Coppola made Fanning feel like an equal on set and saw beauty in things like her glasses and retainer and made them \u201ccool\u201d through her approval. At 18, she\u2019d reunite with Coppola to play the \u201cbad girl\u201d in the Civil War era film \u201cThe Beguiled.\u201d",
      "Hartnett also thanked Coppola for giving him one of his first big roles as a teenage heartthrob in \u201cThe Virgin Suicides.\u201d He recalled being in awe of her, the mixtapes she made for the cast and her \u201cincredible chill\u201d under the immense pressure of directing her first feature at only 26.",
      "\u201cSofia showed me at a young age what it is to be an artist,\u201d Hartnett said.",

    "story": [
      "Filmmaker Lotfy Nathan has turned the apocryphal Infancy Gospel of Thomas into a supernatural thriller called \u201cThe Carpenter\u2019s Son,\u201d starring Nicolas Cage",
      "LOS ANGELES -- In the second century, as the canonical Gospels were being copied and circulated throughout the Roman Empire, another text about the life of Jesus was simultaneously spreading. Although the Infancy Gospel of Thomas didn\u2019t make it into the New Testament, it remained popular among Christians for centuries.",
      "When filmmaker Lotfy Nathan was introduced to the apocryphal text about Jesus\u2019 childhood by his history-loving father, he immediately began poring over it as a springboard for what would eventually become \u201cThe Carpenter\u2019s Son,\u201d the supernatural thriller starring Nicolas Cage and opening in theaters Friday.",
      "\u201cThe thought gave me chills,\u201d recalled the writer and director, who was raised Coptic Orthodox. \u201cThe novelty of this, in a way, being an origin story that hadn\u2019t been told before.\u201d",
      "The film, which stars FKA twigs and Noah Jupe alongside Cage, follows Jesus as a young boy being tempted by Satan to rebel against his father, Joseph (Cage). The film\u2019s source material is established with an opening title card. \u201cBased on the Infancy Gospel of Thomas,\u201d it reads. But Nathan concedes he couldn\u2019t rely solely on the text and had to fill in narrative gaps, as with a storyline involving Satan.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s written like a laundry list of events. It doesn\u2019t really have an arc, so to speak,\u201d he said of the apocryphal account of Jesus\u2019 life from ages 5 to 12. \u201cI had a historian pull a lot of research for me before I wrote the first draft.\u201d",
      "As fate would have it, Cage had already read the Infancy Gospel of Thomas years ago, during a period in his life of deep philosophical curiosity and reflection. When Nathan came to the Oscar winner with the script, Cage said he saw a through line to a type of story he\u2019s long been attracted to.",
      "\u201cFamily dramas, it\u2019s no secret, is one of my favorite subject matters or genres. I couldn\u2019t think of a more compelling family dynamic than the Nativity,\u201d Cage told The Associated Press. \u201cAs I read it and thought about it, I never thought of it as a horror film per se. I saw it as a family drama about an existential crisis.\u201d",
      "The Infancy Gospel of Thomas might seem novel and obscure for some contemporary audiences, but history attests to both its popularity and longevity, according to Tony Burke, a professor at York University in Toronto whose specialties include early Christian apocrypha.",
      "Stories within it permeated ancient Christian lore, art and even some medieval plays. One account from the text about Jesus giving life to clay birds even made its way into the Quran.",
      "Also referred to as the Paidika \u2014 a nod to its original Greek title, \u201cPaidika Iesou,\u201d which translates to \u201cThe Childhood Acts of Jesus\u201d \u2014 the Infancy Gospel of Thomas often surprises modern readers.",
      "\u201cThis is not the Jesus that they expect \u2014 a Jesus that kills a boy in the marketplace or strikes down his teacher,\u201d Burke said, though he argues that Christian audiences during that time wouldn\u2019t have been bothered by this characterization. \u201cIn the ancient world, it was not that uncommon to tell stories of revered holy men cursing as well as blessing.\u201d",
      "Many Christians today reject its legitimacy and say it conflicts with the Jesus of the Bible.",

      "Although Jesus movies aren't often described as horror films or supernatural thrillers, the second century text upon which \u201cThe Carpenter\u2019s Son\u201d is based is \u201cquite disturbing,\u201d argues Joan E. Taylor, a professor of early Christianity at King\u2019s College London. She recently wrote \u201cBoy Jesus: Growing Up Judaean in Turbulent Times.\u201d",
      "\u201cJesus is portrayed as having these powers but not really having the moral compass in terms of how he uses his powers, or at least not the moral compass we would expect from, say, the Gospel of Luke,\u201d she said of the Paidika. \u201cYou have this child who has these supernatural powers and punishes those who come in his way.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Carpenter\u2019s Son\u201d isn\u2019t the only recent film to reimagine the apocryphal gospel. \u201cThe Young Messiah,\u201d the 2016 drama based upon Anne Rice's novel \u201cChrist the Lord: Out of Egypt,\u201d also pulls from the Paidika.",
      "Both films reinterpret some of the aspects of the text that are ostensibly at odds with the Jesus of the canonical Gospels. In \u201cThe Young Messiah,\u201d for example, it\u2019s Satan who kills the boy in the marketplace, then frames Jesus. That encounter is left out of \u201cThe Carpenter\u2019s Son\u201d entirely.",
      "Despite their popularity, telling any story about Jesus on-screen is tricky, especially when filmmakers veer into territory outside of the canonical Gospels. Cage recalled seeing \u201cThe Last Temptation of Christ,\u201d Martin Scorsese\u2019s notoriously controversial 1988 drama starring Willem Dafoe as Jesus, in theaters when it first came out.",
      "\u201cI was in line to get my tickets and I remember there were the picketers and they were angry. And I said, \u2018Well have you seen the movie?\u2019 And they said no,\u201d Cage recalled. \u201cDon\u2019t you think you should see it before you make a statement about it or judge it?\u201d",
      "Still, he\u2019s cognizant of the fact that any film tackling subjects sacred to people is vulnerable to critique. The American Family Association, a conservative Christian advocacy group, has denounced the film and urged people to sign a petition blocking its release.",
      "\u201cNobody wanted to offend anybody in the making of this movie,\u201d Cage said emphatically. \u201cIf anyone does go to this movie, they would see that everyone treated it with love and not with any approach of mockery or contempt. It was all about love.\u201d",

      "Fans of Danmei same-sex romance stories in China say the government is cracking down harder than ever on the popular genre",
      "For Cindy Zhong, like many young Chinese women, a relaxing night used to mean curling up with a steamy story about two men in love. Then her favorite authors, and their tales, started disappearing.",
      "Fans of the popular Danmei same-sex romance genre, written and read mainly by straight women, say the Chinese government is carrying out the largest crackdown yet on it, effectively neutering the enjoyment.",
      "In the vast world of fantasy, Danmei is relatively straightforward: Two men stand in for idealized relationships, from chaste to erotic. Some scholars believe the stories appeal to Chinese women as a way to sidestep the country\u2019s conservative gender values and imagine relationships on a more equal footing.",
      "\"Women turn to Danmei for pure love, especially as they face pressure from families, peers and society to get married and have kids,\u201d said Aiqing Wang, a senior lecturer at the University of Liverpool who studies Chinese popular culture and internet literature.",
      "The once-niche Chinese literary subculture has seen a boom in recent years, with novels adapted into blockbuster television series and translated into Western languages.",
      "Danmei \u2014 also known as \u201cBoys Love\u201d in English \u2014 has also caught the eye of Chinese authorities. At least dozens of writers have been interrogated, arrested and charged with producing and selling obscene materials in China in the past year, according to media reports and witness accounts online.",
      "Some writers have stopped publishing or taken work offline. Websites have shut down or removed many stories, leaving the tamest behind.",

      "China\u2019s government has been tightening its grip on the LGBTQ+ community, shutting down rights groups and social media accounts, despite removing homosexuality from its list of mental illness in 2001. Same-sex relationships are not criminalized.",
      "Even though China\u2019s censorship apparatus has long disapproved of same-sex love stories, the most popular Danmei stories have become bestselling books and been adapted into cartoons, video games and TV series. Adaptations often get around censorship by changing the characters to a heterosexual couple or presenting the relationship between male leads as an intense \u201cfriendship.\u201d",
      "The stories, usually published online by amateurs, are some of the most widely read fiction in China. Ranging from the flowery to the heavily erotic, they can include scenes of men fighting with a sword and a flute in ethereal ancient costumes or sex scenes in nature after rainfall.",
      "Danmei is \u201ca utopian existence,\u201d said Chen Xingyu, a 32-year-old freelance teacher living in the southwestern city of Kunming. \u201cI would be less happy without it.\u201d",

      "Prosecutors are urging a judge to reject Harvey Weinstein\u2019s claims that his June sexual assault conviction was marred by threats and bullying among jurors",
      "NEW YORK -- Prosecutors urged a judge on Wednesday to reject Harvey Weinstein \u2019s claims that his June sexual assault conviction was marred by threats and bullying among jurors.",
      "The disgraced movie mogul\u2019s lawyers submitted sworn affidavits last month from two jurors who said they regretted voting to convict Weinstein and only did so because others on the panel bullied them during five contentious days of deliberations.",
      "The Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office said the jurors\u2019 claims were \u201cinconsistent and implausible\u201d and that they provided no legal basis for Weinstein\u2019s lawyers to challenge his conviction.",
      "One juror who claimed in an affidavit that he observed \u201cthreats\u201d and \u201cintimidation\u201d had told the judge during deliberations that he only saw \u201cplayground stuff,\" prosecutors said. Immediately after the trial ended, the same juror told reporters, \u201cit\u2019s not like a fight was going to break out. No, obviously not.\u201d",
      "Weinstein\u2019s bid to overturn his first-degree criminal sex act conviction \u201cutterly fails, on both the law and the facts, to meet the standard necessary to set aside the guilty verdict,\u201d prosecutors Matthew Colangelo, Nicole Blumberg, Shannon Lucey and Becky Mangold wrote.",
      "They cited a centuries-old rule that the U.S. Supreme Court has said gives \u201csubstantial protection to verdict finality\u201d and assures that once a trial is over, jurors won\u2019t be \"harassed or annoyed by litigants seeking to challenge the verdict.\u201d",
      "Judge Curtis Farber said he'll rule on Dec. 22.",
      "Prosecutors said they declined to interview any jurors before responding to the defense\u2019s claims because doing so would \u201ccause the very harms\u201d the centuries-old rule was meant to avoid.",
      "Weinstein\u2019s defense team, led by attorney Arthur Aidala, argued in court papers last month that the verdict was marred by \u201cthreats, intimidation, and extraneous bias,\u201d and that Farber failed to properly deal with it at the time.",
      "The two jurors said in their affidavits that they felt overwhelmed and intimidated by others on the panel who wanted to convict Weinstein on the criminal sex act charge, which accused him of forcing oral sex on TV and film production assistant and producer Miriam Haley in 2006.",

      "Meghan Trainor will release her seventh studio album in April",
      "NEW YORK -- In the decade following her debut album, Meghan Trainor has lived myriad lives \u2014 but the message of her bright, cheery pop music has remained the same: Stay true to who you are and ignore the haters. That spirit endures on her lead single, the jovial \u201cStill Don't Care,\u201d the first tease of her forthcoming seventh full-length album, \u201cToy with Me,\u201d out April 24.",
      "And in true Trainor fashion, \u201cStill Don't Care\u201d was inspired by real life situations. \u201cI was seeing a lot of hate all over the world, but I was getting a lot of hate when I started posting more pictures of ... my fitness journey and my health journey. And I didn\u2019t really expect that,\u201d Trainor told The Associated Press. \u201cI would get really upset at comments and I was like, \u2018I wish I didn\u2019t feel like this. I wish I didn\u2019t give them so much power.\u2019",
      "\u201cAnd so, when I write songs, I always write in the perspective of how I wish I thought, like \u2018All About That Bass.\u2019 I didn\u2019t feel like that when I wrote it,\u201d she continued. \u201cAnd all my self-love anthems. But when I perform them and I see how it affects other people, I start believing them.\u201d",
      "\u201cStill Don't Care\u201d is yet another example, with its maximalist, \u201880s pop production and choir courtesy of Pentatonix\u2019s Scott Hoying. Her mom, brother and sister-in-law contribute background vocals on it as well \u2014 perhaps softening the song's gloves-up approach to combating online hate. \u201cYou could tear me apart,\u201d Trainor sings. \u201cBut I sleep well at night.\u201d",
      "It's the first taste of \u201cToy with Me,\u201d which Trainor teases will have a few self-love bops, songs to excise her anger through and lots of familial love. \u201cThe only features I have right now in this moment are my kids, Riley and Barry, because I wrote them a beautiful song, the only, like, slower song. It\u2019s called \u2018Little One' and it's about how I wish they could stay little forever,\u201d she said, smiling. \u201cWhen I play it, Riley goes, \u2018Oh, this is my song. Play my song!' It\u2019s literally my lullaby for them. And at the end of the song they say, \u2018I love you, Mama,\u2019 and it\u2019s just the cutest thing ever. And that\u2019s when everyone\u2019s crying.\u201d",
      "Trainor said she worked on the album for eight months. \u201cI exhausted myself, and I went a little too hard. I got excited to be home with the kids and work on my songs, but then I definitely, I overdid it, and my body started doing weird things, giving me signals. Like, my tongue started burning one day. And I was like, \u2018What\u2019s this?\u2019 And it wouldn\u2019t go away forever. And the dentist was like, \u2018Oh, you\u2019re stressed,\u2019\u201d she recalled.",
      "Songwriting, too, was a challenge. \u201cI usually write a song in one day and I\u2019m done with it, but each song on this album took, like, months to finish,\u201d she said. \u201cSo that was the only difference from this album than any other album I\u2019ve done.\u201d",

      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- Hundreds of bagpipers claimed a new world record on Wednesday by belting out AC/DC\u2019s rock and roll classic \u201cIt\u2019s a Long Way to the Top.\u201d",
      "Billed as \u201cThe Great Melbourne Bagpipe Bash,\u201d the eclectic performance took place in Melbourne\u2019s Federation Square, on Swanston Street, which was the scene of the Australian hard rock band\u2019s 1976 film clip in which they played the hit on the back of a flatbed truck traveling slowly through downtown traffic with music blaring from speakers.",
      "Federation Square is also a short stroll from the Melbourne Cricket Ground where AC/DC is scheduled to play their first Australian gig in a decade on Wednesday. Guitarist Angus Young, 70, is the only band member who played on the truck and is performing on the latest Australian tour.",
      "Thousands of spectators crammed the square for the world record attempt. Many of the 374 pipers had to squeeze through the crowd to the stage area. The oldest piper was 98-years-old, organisers said.",
      "Among the bagpipers was Les Kenfield and Kevin Conlon, two of the three members of Rats of Tobruk Memorial Pipes and Drums who played with AC/DC on the truck 49 years ago.",
      "\u201cIt didn't strike you at the time how big this event is until now,\" Kenfield told Australian Broadcasting Corp. \u201cNow it\u2019s one of the greatest things \u2014 probably the greatest thing I\u2019ve ever done in my life.\u201d",
      "Having been declared world record holders, the massed pipers played \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d on request, followed by an impromptu \u201cAmazing Grace\u201d to a cheering crowd, many using their phones to record the moment.",
      "The Australian Book of Records, which has been certifying records since 2012, confirmed that 374 pipers had together broken a record set by 333 pipers in Bulgaria in 2012. The U.K.'s better known Guinness World Records, which confirmed the Bulgarian record, told The Associated Press that it hadn\u2019t been approached to assess the Melbourne record attempt.",
      "Many of the enthusiastic spectators wore AC/DC T-shirts. Asked from the stage who among them were going to the concert afterwards, many hands went up.",
      "One AC/DC fan who didn\u2019t see the record set was Keegan Kohler, 23, a self-employed electrician from Columbus, Ohio. He had been waiting outside the concert stadium since 4:50 a.m. to ensure he\u2019d be first in when the gates opened at 5 p.m. The bagpipes record was set nearby at 5:15 p.m.",
      "Kohler had seen AC/DC perform their \u201cPower Up Tour\u201d this year in Cleveland, Washington, D.C., Detroit and Pittsburgh, but expects the experience will be better in the band\u2019s home country. He will see two shows in Melbourne and one in the band's hometown of Sydney.",

      "The Monkey King, a beloved figure in Chinese mythology, is now the star of an opera",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- A rascally superhero born from a stone egg, the Monkey King is beloved in Chinese mythology, appearing in everything from a 16th century epic to modern comics, animated movies and video games \u2014 even in poetry by Mao Zedong.",
      "And now he\u2019s the star of an opera.",
      "\u201cThe Monkey King,\u201d with music by Huang Ruo and libretto by David Henry Hwang, has its world premiere at the San Francisco Opera on Friday with performances through Nov. 30.",
      "It\u2019s adapted from \u201cJourney to the West,\u201d a 100-chapter novel inspired by the true story of a 7th-century Chinese monk who traveled to India to find Buddhist sutras, or scriptures, and bring them back home.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s essentially an allegory of how Buddhism came to China,\u201d Hwang said.",
      "His libretto, in both English and Mandarin, is based on early chapters of the epic, portraying Monkey King\u2019s birth and daring exploits, as well as the arrogance and pride that lead him to be imprisoned for 500 years until he learns humility, compassion and discipline. At the end of the opera he is finally worthy of accompanying the monk on his journey.",
      "For Hwang, part of the Monkey King\u2019s appeal is the way he undercuts stereotypes.",
      "\u201cEveryone associates the Chinese persona with respect and deference and conformity,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd Monkey represents this whole other side that doesn\u2019t normally get expressed in terms of being individualistic, being rebellious, being egotistical.",
      "\u201cAlso given the fact that Monkey is rebelling against a corrupt administration, people can look at that however they want to see it.\u201d",
      "Mounting the opera is an ambitious undertaking for the company, which has a long track record of producing new work but faced unique challenges in bringing Monkey\u2019s fantastical adventures to life.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s flying on clouds, diving underwater, soaring to the heavens,\u201d director Diane Paulus said. \u201cI thought, oh, my gosh, how are we going to do this on the stage? How do we realize this and in what style?\u201d",
      "One answer was to collaborate with puppeteer Basil Twist, who designed the sets as well as puppets, making extensive use of his trademark silks.",
      "\u201cThe whole notion of the ephemeral and letting go of things and the power of transformation to me is beautifully expressed by silk that can become water that then disappears and becomes clouds, and then becomes a giant column,\u201d she said.",
      "Since Monkey King has to perform supernatural feats, engage in acrobatic fighting, shift his shape at will, and also \u2014 this is an opera, after all \u2014 perform arias accompanied by full orchestra, the creators represent him by three different figures: a singer, a puppet and a dancer.",
      "\u201cI call it the Holy Trinity of Monkey King,\u201d said Kang Wang, the Chinese-Australian tenor who sings the title role.",
      "While that spares Wang from having to perform backflips or other complicated dance moves, it doesn\u2019t mean he can stand up straight the whole time. Whenever he\u2019s not singing full out, he has to crouch in a semi-squat the way a character would who is half-monkey, half-man.",

My colleagues were telling me they could see me losing weight. \u2026 It\u2019s like a CrossFit session every day.\u201d",
      "Other characters in the opera include the corrupt Jade Emperor, sung by tenor Konu Kim, and Guanyin, the Goddess of Mercy who guides the Monkey King, sung by soprano Mei Gui Zhang. Carolyn Kuan conducts the orchestra, chorus and soloists.",
      "Huang Ruo, who has composed several other operas as well as concertos and chamber music, was born in China and studied music there before moving to the US. He uses a Western orchestra for \u201cThe Monkey King\u201d with the addition of a pipa, a Chinese four-stringed lute.",
      "\u201cI said I\u2019m not going to write a Western opera, or a Chinese opera, but I\u2019m going to call it a magical Kung Fu opera,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause we have singing, and orchestra, all the good things, story-telling, emotional moments, all this from the operatic art form. But we also have Kung Fu fighting, operatic dance, and puppetry, and mixed media to convey this magical world.\u201d",
      "For Matthew Shilvock, the company\u2019s general director, the score is \u201cincredibly propulsive \u2026 but also lyrical.",
      "\u201cWe keep going in and out between two different sound worlds,\u201d Shilvock said. \u201cThere\u2019s all these hijinks with the Monkey in the battle sequences where he is taking on the gods \u2026 and then you have these moments of incredible serenity.\u201d",
      "Shilvock is hopeful the opera will appeal to audiences across cultural lines.",
      "\u201cFor people who grew up with the Monkey King there\u2019s a huge sense of nostalgia about it, so it\u2019s tapping into something deep,\u201d he said. \u201cFor people who are getting to know it for the first time you\u2019re being introduced to this extraordinary piece of world literature\u2026 so there\u2019s a wonderful sense of discovery.\u201d",
      "If Huang Ruo has his way, this may not be his last opera about the Monkey King.",
      "Borrowing inspiration from Richard Wagner whose \u201cRing\u201d cycle stretches over four operas, the composer said he and Hwang \u201chave this pipe dream to create the Monkey King Cycle.",
      "\u201cWhen we get to the last opera, they reach the land of bliss, where Buddha and his disciples live,\u201d he said. \u201cThe journey didn\u2019t start yet. It\u2019s just the beginning of the story-telling.\u201d",

      "At the halfway point of annual United Nations climate negotiations in Brazil, it appears the talks may do more than just focus on implementing past promises, as some observers had expected",
      "BELEM, Brazil -- Going into United Nations climate negotiations, the Brazilian hosts weren\u2019t looking for big end-of-session pronouncements on lofty goals. This conference was supposed to hyperfocus on \u201cimplementation\u201d of past promises not yet kept.",
      "Throw that out the window.",
      "The urgency of climate change is causing some negotiators to push for more big-picture action \u2014 on weak plans to cut emissions of heat-trapping gases, on too little money to help nations wracked by climate change, on putting teeth into phasing out coal, oil and gas. Because of that pressure to do more \u2014 including from Brazil President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva \u2014 the diplomat chairing the talks said Saturday he'll consider a big-picture, end-of-negotiations communiqu\u00e9, sometimes known as a decision or cover text.",
      "\u201cI think things have changed, which is a very good thing,\u201d said veteran observer Jean Su of the Center for Biological Diversity. \u201cSo I think there\u2019s momentum that we will get some type of decision text, and our hope is that in particular there\u2019s going to be some commitment on phasing out fossil fuels.\u201d",
      "\u201cI would say that what\u2019s at stake now is probably higher than the last several COPs because you\u2019re looking at an ambition gap,\u2033 said former Philippine negotiator Jasper Inventor, international program director at Greenpeace International. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of expectation, there\u2019s a lot of excitement here, but there\u2019s also a lot of political signals that\u2019s been sent by President Lula.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re at the middle of the COP, and at the middle of COP is usually where the negotiators stare each other eye-to-eye. It\u2019s almost like a staring contest,\u201d Inventor said. \u201cBut next week, this is where the negotiations need to happen, where political decisions are made by the ministers.\u201d",
      "Because this process stems from the Paris climate Agreement, which is mostly voluntary, these end statements grab headlines and set global tone but have limited power. The last few COP end statements have made still-unfulfilled pledges for rich countries to give money to poor nations to cope with climate change and the world to phase out fossil fuels.",
      "Key among those issues is the idea of telling nations to go back to the drawing board on what experts consider inadequate climate-fighting plans submitted this year.",
      "In the 2015 Paris agreement, which is being celebrated here on its 10th anniversary, nations are supposed to have submitted climate-fighting, emissions-curbing plans every five years. So far 116 of 193 countries have filed theirs this year, but what they promised isn\u2019t much. United Nations and Climate Action Tracker, a group of scientists, calculates that these new pledges barely reduced future projections for Earth's warming.",
      "Even if the world does all it promises, Earth would be about seven-tenths of a degree Celsius (1.3 degrees Fahrenheit) above the Paris goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times, the groups estimated.",
      "So small island nations, led by Palau, asked that this conference confront the gap between what\u2019s planned in national pledges and what\u2019s needed to keep the world from hitting the temperature danger zone.",
      "That's not on the agenda for these talks. Nor are specific details on how to fulfill last year\u2019s pledge by rich nations to provide $300 billion annually in climate financial aid.",
      "So when nations early on wanted to address these issues, COP President Andr\u00e9 Corr\u00eaa do Lago, a veteran Brazilian diplomat, set up special small confabs to try to decide if the controversial topics should be discussed.",
      "On Saturday, the conference punted the issue to the incoming ministers.",
      "\u201cThe parties will decide how they want to proceed,\u201d do Lago said at a Saturday evening news conference. Given what countries are saying and past history that usually means a final end-of-COP message to the world, several experts said.",

      "NEW YORK -- When Jennifer Austin met Molly in second grade, they quickly became best friends. They giggled through classes until the teacher separated them, inspiring them to come up with their own language. They shared sleepovers and went on each other's family vacations.",
      "But they gradually drifted apart after Austin's family moved to Germany before the girls started high school. Decades passed before they recently reconnected as grown women.",
      "\u201cStrong friendships really do stay for the long haul,\" Austin, 51, said. \"Even if there are pauses in between and they fade, that doesn\u2019t mean they completely dissolve or they go forgotten. They\u2019re always there kind of lingering like a little light in the back.\u201d",
      "Early friendships are some of the deepest: the schoolmates who shared bike rides and their favorite candy. The roommates who offered comfort after breakups. The ones who know us, sometimes better than we know ourselves.",
      "But as adults take on jobs and the responsibilities of homes and families, it can be challenging to stay connected with everyone we've loved.",

      "Years passed with occasional holiday cards and texts but few meaningful interactions. DiPasquantonio saw photos on social media of Robb skiing and traveling with other friends. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure there was so much room for me, from a distance,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cAww, I feel badly about that,\u201d Robb replied. \u201cI would argue that's the bad side of social media.\u201d",

      "More than 100,000 people in the U.S. have become allergic to red meat since 2010 because of the syndrome, according to one estimate.",

      "A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention spokesperson said the agency was not involved in this investigation and could not speak definitively about whether it's the first such death. The CDC recently released a free online training module to increase awareness and improve diagnosing, she added.",
      "Dr. Scott Commins, a leading alpha-gal syndrome researcher at the University of North Carolina, called the death an \u201cunmitigated tragedy.\u201d",

      "The company that makes OxyContin, members of the Sackler family who own it and many groups that sued over its role in the opioid crisis are asking a judge to approve a settlement plan",
      "NEW YORK -- Lawyers representing OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma, branches of the Sackler family that own it, cities, states, counties, Native American tribes, people with addiction and others across the U.S. are expected to deliver a nearly unanimous message for a bankruptcy court judge Friday: Approve a plan to settle thousands of opioid-related lawsuits against the company.",
      "If U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane abides, it will close a long chapter \u2014 and maybe the entire book \u2014 on a legal odyssey over efforts to hold the company to account for its role in an opioid crisis connected to 900,000 deaths in the U.S. since 1999, including deaths from heroin and illicit fentanyl.",
      "Closing arguments were expected Friday in the third day of a hearing over a bankruptcy plan for the company, which filed for protection six years ago as it faced lawsuits with claims that grew to trillions of dollars.",
      "The saga has been emotional and full of contentious arguments between the many groups that took Purdue to court, often exposing a possible mismatch between the quest for justice and the practical role of bankruptcy court.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court rejected a previous deal because it said it was improper for Sackler family members to receive immunity from lawsuits over opioids. In the new arrangement, entities who don't opt into the settlement can sue them. Family members are collectively worth billions, but much of their assets are held in trusts in offshore accounts that would be hard to access through lawsuits.",
      "This time, the government groups involved have reached an even fuller consensus and there's been mostly subdued opposition from individuals. Out of more than 54,000 personal injury victims who voted on whether the plan should be accepted. just 218 said no. A larger number of people who are part of that group didn't vote.",
      "A handful of objectors spoke Thursday at the hearing, sometimes interrupting the judge. Some said that only the victims, not the states and other government entities, should receive the funds in the settlement. Others wanted the judge to find the members of the Sackler family criminally liable \u2014 something Lane said is beyond the scope of the bankruptcy court, but that the settlement doesn't bar prosecutors from pursuing.",

      "\u201cThe natural laws of karma suggest the Sacklers and Purdue Pharma should pay for what they have done,\u201d Pamela Bartz Halaschak said via video.",
      "A flood of lawsuits filed by government entities against Purdue and other drugmakers, drug wholesalers and pharmacy chains began about a decade ago.",

None have been on its board or received payments since 2018. Unlike a similar hearing four years ago, none were called to testify in this week's hearing.",
      "The company would get a name change and new overseers who would dedicate future profits to battling the opioid crisis.",
      "There are also some non-financial provisions. Certain members of the Sackler family would be required to give up involvement in companies that sell opioids in other countries.",
      "Family members would also be barred from having their names added to institutions in exchange for charitable contributions. The name has already been removed from museums and universities.",
      "And company documents, including many that would normally be subject to lawyer-client privilege, are to be made public.",
      "Unlike the other major opioid settlements, individuals harmed by Purdue\u2019s products would be in line for some money as part of the settlement. About $850 million would be set aside for them, with more than $100 million of that amount carved out to help children born dealing with opioid withdrawal.",
      "About 139,000 people have active claims for the money. Many of them, however, have not shown proof that they were prescribed Purdue\u2019s opioids and will receive nothing. Lawyers expect that those who had prescriptions for at least six months would receive about $16,000 each and those who had them more briefly would get around $8,000. Legal fees would reduce what people actually receive.",

      "\u201cUnlike synthetic pharmaceuticals, peptides are naturally recognized by your body,\u201d Brecka told his more than 2 million Instagram followers in February.",
      "Critics point out that the peptides for sale are often imperfect synthetics and are taken at doses much higher than any peptides in the body, raising the risk of allergic reactions and other harms.",
      "Brecka sells more than a half-dozen peptides, including ipamorelin and CJC-1295 \u2014 both of which the FDA has flagged for serious safety risks.",
      "Like other peptides sold on Brecka\u2019s website, the ipamorelin vials carry the labeling: \u201cresearch use only.\u201d",
      "The \u201cresearch use\u201d language is pervasive across the peptide space, even in forums where users trade tips for buying, dosing and \u201cstacking\u201d different drug combinations.",
      "One Facebook group instructs members what words to avoid: \u201cinstead of \u2018taking\u2019 you are \u2019researching' peptides.\u201d",
      "Lawyers who work in the field say the language is an attempt to skirt FDA regulations. The agency does not oversee chemicals that aren\u2019t intended for human use.",
      "It\u2019s often unclear whether such peptides are being produced in the U.S. by pharmacies and mislabeled for research, or whether they are being purchased from chemical manufacturers, many located in China and not subject to FDA drug quality standards.",
      "\u201cResearch-grade peptides are going to have junk in them,\u201d said Paul Knoepfler, a cellular biologist at the University of California Davis. \u201cThey\u2019re going to have chemicals used in the purification process and fragments of peptides that you don\u2019t want.\u201d",
      "On platforms like TikTok, companies in China and other countries offer to ship dozens of peptide varieties to the U.S. for as little as $5 a vial.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s actually in there?\u201d Knoepfler said. \u201cIf someone injects it under their skin, what are they getting?\"",
      "During the COVID-19 pandemic, the FDA issued over a half-dozen warning letters to businesses promoting peptides with \u201cimmune-boosting powers.\"",
      "Then in 2023, the agency added nearly 20 peptides to a list of substances that should not be compounded due to safety risks. Pharmacies violating the measure risk fines, legal action or potential loss of their state licenses.",
      "That triggered pushback from wellness entrepreneurs and compounding pharmacies, including lawsuits.",
      "One coalition, Save Peptides, warned its followers: \u201cOur basic human rights to access alternative medical care using regenerative peptides is being stripped away by the FDA.\u201d",
      "A lawsuit brought by a large compounding pharmacy alleged that regulators had skipped legally required steps when adding peptides to FDA's list of high-risk substances. The litigation forced the agency to backtrack, and the FDA late last year agreed to convene two public meetings of outside advisers to review several peptides flagged for safety risks.",
      "In each case, the experts agreed with the FDA, voting that the substances were too risky to be compounded.",
      "Some in the industry disagree.",
      "\u201cPhysicians should have every available arrow in the quiver to treat illness and, because of the FDA\u2019s inaction, they don\u2019t,\u201d said Lee Rosebush, who helped bring the lawsuit against FDA and represents a group of large compounding pharmacies.",
      "The FDA, under Kennedy's authority, recently removed a number of experts from the compounding advisory panel.",
      "That could pave the way for appointing more peptide-friendly experts who might vote to allow some of the drugs that the FDA previously barred. Alternately, the FDA could simply release a list of peptides and tell pharmacies and clinics that the agency won't enforce bans against them.",
      "For now, doctors say they are fielding more questions from patients excited about peptides and seeking prescriptions.",
      "\u201cPatients should be really asking their health care professionals: Are these medications safe long term?\u201d says Dr. Anita Gupta of the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, who served on FDA\u2019s compounding committee until earlier this year. \u201cThat\u2019s the question I would ask if I was a patient.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump has signed a government funding bill that ends a record 43-day shutdown",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump signed a government funding bill Wednesday night, ending a record 43-day shutdown that caused financial stress for federal workers who went without paychecks, stranded scores of travelers at airports and generated long lines at some food banks.",
      "The shutdown magnified partisan divisions in Washington as Trump took unprecedented unilateral actions \u2014 including canceling projects and trying to fire federal workers \u2014 to pressure Democrats into relenting on their demands.",
      "The Republican president blamed the situation on Democrats and suggested voters shouldn\u2019t reward the party during next year\u2019s midterm elections.",
      "\u201cSo I just want to tell the American people, you should not forget this,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWhen we come up to midterms and other things, don\u2019t forget what they\u2019ve done to our country.\u201d",
      "The signing ceremony came just hours after the House passed the measure on a mostly party-line vote of 222-209. The Senate had already passed the measure Monday.",
      "Democrats wanted to extend an enhanced tax credit expiring at the end of the year that lowers the cost of health coverage obtained through Affordable Care Act marketplaces. They refused to go along with a short-term spending bill that did not include that priority. But Republicans said that was a separate policy fight to be held at another time.",
      "\u201cWe told you 43 days ago from bitter experience that government shutdowns don\u2019t work,\u201d said Rep. Tom Cole, the Republican chairman of the House Appropriations Committee. \"They never achieve the objective that you announce. And guess what? You haven\u2019t achieved that objective yet, and you\u2019re not going to.\u201d",
      "The frustration and pressures generated by the shutdown was reflected when lawmakers debated the spending measure on the House floor.",
      "Republicans said Democrats sought to use the pain generated by the shutdown to prevail in a policy dispute.",
      "\u201cThey knew it would cause pain and they did it anyway,\u201d House Speaker Mike Johnson said.",
      "Democrats said Republicans raced to pass tax breaks earlier this year that they say mostly will benefit the wealthy. But the bill before the House Wednesday \u201cleaves families twisting in the wind with zero guarantee there will ever, ever be a vote to extend tax credits to help everyday people pay for their health care,\u201d said Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass.",
      "Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries said Democrats would not give up on the subsidy extension even if the vote did not go their way.",
      "\u201cThis fight is not over,\u201d Jeffries said. \u201cWe\u2019re just getting started.\u201d",
      "The House had not been in legislative session since Sept. 19, when it passed a short-term measure to keep the government open when the new budget year began in October. Johnson sent lawmakers home after that vote and put the onus on the Senate to act, saying House Republicans had done their job.",
      "The legislation is the result of a deal reached by eight senators who broke ranks with the Democrats after reaching the conclusion that Republicans would not bend on using a government funding to bill to extend the health care tax credits.",
      "The compromise funds three annual spending bills and extends the rest of government funding through Jan. 30. Republicans promised to hold a vote by mid-December to extend the health care subsidies, but there is no guarantee of success.",
      "The bill includes a reversal of the firing of federal workers by the Trump administration since the shutdown began. It also protects federal workers against further layoffs through January and guarantees they are paid once the shutdown is over. The bill for the Agriculture Department means people who rely on key food assistance programs will see those benefits funded without threat of interruption through the rest of the budget year.",

      "Democrats also decried language in the bill that would give senators the opportunity to sue when a federal agency or employee searches their electronic records without notifying them, allowing for up to $500,000 in potential damages for each violation.",
      "The language seems aimed at helping Republican senators pursue damages if their phone records were analyzed by the FBI as part of an investigation into Trump's efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss. The provisions drew criticism from Republicans as well. Johnson said he was \u201cvery angry about it.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat was dropped in at the last minute, and I did not appreciate that, nor did most of the House members,\u201d Johnson said, promising a vote on the matter as early as next week.",
      "The biggest point of contention, though, was the fate of the expiring enhanced tax credit that makes health insurance more affordable through Affordable Care Act marketplaces.",
      "\u201cIt's a subsidy on top of a subsidy. Our friends added it during COVID,\u201d Cole said. \u201cCOVID is over. They set a date certain that the subsidies would run out. They chose the date.\"",
      "Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said the enhanced tax credit was designed to give more people access to health care and no Republican voted for it.",
      "\u201cAll they have done is try to eliminate access to health care in our country. The country is catching on to them,\u201d Pelosi said.",
      "Without the enhanced tax credit, premiums on average will more than double for millions of Americans. More than 2 million people would lose health insurance coverage altogether next year, the Congressional Budget Office projected.",
      "It\u2019s unclear whether the parties will find any common ground on health care before the December vote in the Senate. Johnson has said he will not commit to bringing it up in his chamber.",
      "Some Republicans have said they are open to extending the COVID-19 pandemic-era tax credits as premiums will soar for millions of people, but they also want new limits on who can receive the subsidies. Some argue that the tax dollars for the plans should be routed through individuals rather than go directly to insurance companies.",
      "Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said Monday that she was supportive of extending the tax credits with changes, such as new income caps. Some Democrats have signaled they could be open to that idea.",
      "House Democrats expressed great skepticism that the Senate effort would lead to a breakthrough.",
      "Rep. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, the top Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, said Republicans have wanted to repeal the health overhaul for the past 15 years. \u201cThat\u2019s where they\u2019re trying to go,\u201d she said.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The longest government shutdown in history could conclude as soon as Wednesday, Day 43, with almost no one happy with the final result.",
      "Democrats didn't get the heath insurance provisions they demanded added to the spending deal. And Republicans, who control the levers of power in Washington, didn't escape blame, according to polls and some state and local elections that went poorly for them.",
      "The fallout of the shutdown landed on millions of Americans, including federal workers who went without paychecks and airline passengers who had their trips delayed or canceled. An interruption in nutrition assistance programs contributed to long lines at food banks and added emotional distress going into the holiday season.",
      "The agreement includes bipartisan bills worked out by the Senate Appropriations Committee to fund parts of government \u2014 food aid, veterans programs and the legislative branch, among other things. All other funding would be extended until the end of January, giving lawmakers more than two months to finish additional spending bills.",
      "Here's a look at how the shutdown started and is likely to end:",
      "Democrats made several demands to win their support for a short-term funding bill, but the central one was an extension of an enhanced tax credit that lowers the cost of health coverage obtained through Affordable Care Act marketplaces.",
      "The tax credit was boosted during the COVID-19 pandemic response, again through President Joe Biden's big energy and health care bill, and it's set to expire at the end of December. Without it, premiums on average will more than double for millions of Americans. More than 2 million people would lose health insurance coverage altogether next year, the Congressional Budget Office projected.",
      "\u201cNever have American families faced a situation where their health care costs are set to double \u2014 double in the blink of an eye,\u201d said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.",
      "While Democrats called for negotiations on the matter, Republicans said a funding bill would need to be passed first.",
      "\u201cRepublicans are ready to sit down with Democrats just as soon as they stop holding the government hostage to their partisan demands,\u201d Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said.",
      "Thune eventually promised Democrats a December vote on the tax credit extension to help resolve the standoff, but many Democrats demanded a guaranteed fix, not just a vote that is likely to fail.",
      "Thune's position was much the same as the one Schumer took back in October 2013, when Republicans unsuccessfully sought to roll back parts of the Affordable Care Act in exchange for funding the government. \u201cOpen up all of the government, and then we can have a fruitful discussion,\u201d Schumer said then.",
      "The first year of President Donald Trump's second term has seen more than 200,000 federal workers leave their job through firings, forced relocations or the Republican administration's deferred resignation program, according to the Partnership for Public Service. Whole agencies that don't align with the administration's priorities have been dismantled. And billions of dollars previously approved by Congress have been frozen or canceled.",
      "Democrats have had to rely on the courts to block some of Trump's efforts, but they have been unable to do it through legislation. They were also powerless to stop Trump's big tax cut and immigration crackdown bill that Republicans helped pay for by cutting future spending on safety net programs such as Medicaid and SNAP, formerly known as food stamps.",
      "The Democrats' struggles to blunt the Trump administration's priorities has prompted calls for the party's congressional leadership to take a more forceful response.",
      "Schumer experienced that firsthand after announcing in March that he would support moving ahead with a funding bill for the 2025 budget year. There was a protest at his office, calls from progressives that he be primaried in 2028 and suggestions that the Democratic Party would soon be looking for new leaders.",

      "This time around, Schumer demanded that Republicans negotiate with Democrats to get their votes on a spending bill. The Senate rules, he noted, requires bipartisan support to meet the 60-vote threshold necessary to advance a spending bill.",
      "But those negotiations did not occur, at least not with Schumer. Republicans instead worked with a small group of eight Democrats to tee up a short-term bill to fund the government generally at current levels and accused Schumer of catering to the party's left flank when he refused to go along.",
      "\u201cThe Senate Democrats are afraid that the radicals in their party will say that they caved,\u201d House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said at one of his many daily press conferences.",
      "The political stakes in the shutdown are huge, which is why leaders in both parties have held nearly daily press briefings to shape public opinion.",

      "At least three-quarters of Americans believe each deserves at least a \u201cmoderate\u201d share of blame, underscoring that no one was successfully evading responsibility.",
      "Both parties looked to the Nov. 4 elections in Virginia, New Jersey and elsewhere for signs of how the shutdown was influencing public opinion. Democrats took comfort in their overwhelming successes. Trump called it a \u201cbig factor, negative\" for Republicans. But it did not change the GOP's stance on negotiating. Instead, Trump ramped up calls for Republicans to end the filibuster in the Senate, which would pretty much eliminate the need for the majority party to ever negotiate with the minority.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office says that the negative impact on the economy will be mostly recovered once the shutdown ends, but not entirely. It estimated the permanent economic loss at about $11 billion for a six-week shutdown.",
      "Beyond the numbers, though, the shutdown created a cascade of troubles for many Americans. Federal workers missed paychecks, causing financial and emotional stress. Travelers had their flights delayed and at times canceled. People who rely on safety net programs such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program saw their benefits stopped, and Americans throughout the country lined up for meals at food banks.",
      "\"This dysfunction is damaging enough to our constituents and economy here at home, but it also sends a dangerous message to the watching world,\" said Sen.

      "Andr\u00e1s B\u00edr\u00f3-Nagy, director of the Budapest-based Policy Solutions think tank, says Magyar\u2019s near-constant \u201cgrassroots campaigning\u201d in rural Hungary \u2014 and his focus on bread-and-butter issues like the cost of living and poor public services \u2014 have contributed to his success in small towns that traditionally gravitated toward Orb\u00e1n\u2019s nationalist message.",
      "On Thursday, Magyar visited Tab, a community of fewer than 4,000 people in southwestern Hungary. The stop was one of dozens he plans across the country on a tour he calls \u201cRoad to Victory.\u201d",
      "Hundreds filled the town\u2019s socialist-era community center and listened to Magyar speak for nearly two hours. As Erika Bogn\u00e1r, a 76-year-old widowed retiree, walked into the event, she declared angrily that her monthly pension was too low to survive on, and that she wanted \u201ca system change, because this system sucks.\u201d",
      "\u201cEverywhere in the shops people are grumbling they can\u2019t make ends meet,\u201d she said. \u201cWe live in misery, we have been pushed completely into misery.\u201d",
      "Bogn\u00e1r\u2019s experience reflects that of many Hungarians who are dissatisfied with the country's economy. The European Union has frozen some 14 billion euros ($16.2 billion) in funding to Hungary over rule-of-law and corruption concerns, a deficit that has exacerbated chronically stagnant economic performance.",
      "Orb\u00e1n\u2019s government has sought to mitigate the economic pain by introducing price caps on many products, and to woo voters with pre-election government spending like low-interest loans for first-time home buyers and abolishing income tax for mothers with at least two children.",
      "Still, Bogn\u00e1r, who says she\u2019s rarely voted in elections until now, blames Orb\u00e1n\u2019s government for rising costs of living, and believes that if Magyar is elected, \u201cit won\u2019t get any worse.\u201d",
      "Orb\u00e1n has sought to portray his opponent as an existential danger that \u2014 through his inexperience and alleged foreign allegiances \u2014 would bankrupt the country and drag it into the war in neighboring Ukraine, allegations Magyar has denied.",
      "Unlike nearly every other EU leader, Orb\u00e1n has refused to supply Ukraine with economic aid or weapons to assist in its defense against Russia's full-scale invasion, and has cast as warmongers those countries that do support Kyiv.",
      "He has also cast the EU as an oppressive force, and compared the bloc to the Soviet Union, which dominated and occupied Hungary for decades in the 20th century.",

      "However, public scrutiny remains intense during an ongoing corruption investigation. Fire Point\u2019s executives insist they have nothing to hide and are operating under strict martial law protocols, even commissioning an independent audit to appease investigators. Critics, however, question the company\u2019s opaque origins and the monopoly of its contracts with the Defense Ministry, and point to alleged links to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s notorious associate Tymur Mindich, who is implicated in a major corruption scandal.",

The investigation by anti-corruption organizations, launched a year ago, is still ongoing, she said. \u201cWe will be waiting for the results to come.\u201d",
      "The Associated Press was given exclusive access to a factory in Ukraine where its cruise missile, known as the Flamingo or FP-5, is assembled. The AP was given access on the condition the exact location is not named, due the risk of Russian attacks.",
      "Fire Point, which rose to prominence after initially being relatively unknown following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, now reports around $1 billion in revenue this year. It is also constructing a factory in Denmark to manufacture essential rocket propellent.",

      "Ukraine is working to resume prisoner exchanges with Russia, potentially bringing home 1,200 Ukrainian prisoners",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- Ukraine is working to resume prisoner exchanges with Russia that could bring home 1,200 Ukrainian prisoners, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Sunday, a day after his national security chief announced progress in negotiations.",
      "\u201cWe are ... counting on the resumption of POW exchanges,\u201d Zelenskyy wrote on X. \u201cMany meetings, negotiations and calls are currently taking place to ensure this.\u201d",
      "Rustem Umerov, Secretary of Ukraine\u2019s National Security and Defense Council, said Saturday he held consultations mediated by Turkey and the United Arab Emirates on resuming exchanges.",
      "He said the parties agreed to activate prisoner exchange agreements brokered in Istanbul to release 1,200 Ukrainians. Moscow did not immediately comment.",
      "The Istanbul agreements refer to prisoner-exchange protocols established with Turkish mediation in 2022 that set rules for large, coordinated swaps. Since then, Russia and Ukraine have traded thousands of prisoners, though exchanges have been sporadic.",
      "Umerov said technical consultations would be held soon to finalize procedural and organizational details, expressing hope that returning Ukrainians could \u201ccelebrate the New Year and Christmas holidays at home \u2014 at the family table and next to their relatives.\u201d",
      "In other developments, energy infrastructure was damaged by Russian drone strikes overnight into Sunday in Ukraine\u2019s Odesa region, Ukraine\u2019s State Emergency Service said. A solar power plant was among the damaged sites.",
      "Ukraine is desperately trying to fend off relentless Russian aerial attacks that have brought rolling blackouts across Ukraine on the brink of winter.",
      "Combined missile and drone strikes on the power grid have coincided with Ukraine\u2019s efforts to hold back a Russian battlefield push aimed at capturing the eastern stronghold of Pokrovsk.",

      "ROME -- Millions of tourists visit the Colosseum and Sistine Chapel each year, yet only a tiny fraction ever step inside the gilded halls of Rome\u2019s most exclusive site: the Colonna Palace.",
      "The private home-museum hides in plain sight, spread out in four wings over an entire block in the city center.

Doors open to small groups, 10 people at a time, guided by art historians for a few hours on Friday and Saturday mornings.",
      "\u201cWe cannot have mass tourism. It is not the wish,\u201d said Elisabetta Cecchini, a restorer at the palace, adding that the reason any visitors are allowed is because art dies in the absence of public appreciation. \u201cIt is not intended as a museum to be commodified.\u201d",
      "The family\u2019s sitting prince, Don Prospero Colonna, still resides there, granting infrequent approval to hold events like the release of Pope John Paul II\u2019s book in 2005 and the 2018 Metropolitan Museum of Art exhibition of Catholic fashion, attended by designer Donna Versace and Vogue magazine\u2019s Anna Wintour. Both marked rare instances of journalists gaining admission.",

    "story": [
      "President Alexander Stubb of Finland told The Associated Press that a ceasefire in Ukraine is unlikely before spring",
      "HALVALA, Finland -- A ceasefire in Ukraine is unlikely before the spring and European allies need to keep up support despite a corruption scandal which has engulfed Kyiv, President Alexander Stubb of Finland told The Associated Press.",
      "Europe, meanwhile will require \u2018\u2019sisu\u2019\u2019 \u2013 a Finnish word meaning endurance, resilience and grit \u2014 to get through the winter months, he said, as Russia continues its hybrid attacks and information war across the continent.",
      "Stubb also needs that quality as one of the key European interlocutors between U.S. President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. As the leader of one of Europe's smaller countries, but one that shares a 1,340-kilometer (830-mile) border with Russia, he is well aware of what's at stake.",
      "In the 1940s, after two wars with Russia, Finland lost about 10% of its territory to Moscow and agreed to become militarily neutral, a stance only reversed after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, when the Finns joined NATO. Stubb leverages his good relationship with Trump \u2014 the two men have played golf together and speak regularly \u2014 to argue the case for Ukraine.",
      "\u201cI can explain to President Trump what Finland went through or how I see the situation on the battlefield, or how do you deal with (Russian President Vladimir) Putin? And then, you know, if he accepts one out of 10 ideas, that\u2019s good,\u201d he said.",
      "Stubb spoke to AP Saturday at a military base north of the capital Helsinki where he observed Finnish volunteers take part in defense training. Wearing a jacket with the word \u201csisu\u201d emblazoned across the back, he watched as volunteers practiced evacuating wounded soldiers from a conflict zone in freezing temperatures.",
      "Stubb told AP that Zelenskyy must deal quickly with allegations of kickbacks and embezzlement, saying the scandal plays into the hands of Russia. Nonetheless, he urged European leaders to look at boosting financial and military support for Kyiv which is also facing creeping gains by Russia on the battlefield.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not very optimistic about achieving a ceasefire or the beginning of peace negotiations, at least this year,\u201d Stubb said, adding it would be good to \u201cget something going\u201d by March.",
      "The three big questions on the road to a ceasefire are security guarantees for Ukraine, rebuilding its economy and coming to some sort of understanding about territorial claims, he said.",
      "To bring peace to Ukraine, Stubb said, Trump and European leaders need to maximize pressure on Russia and on Putin in order to change his strategic thinking. Putin \"basically wants to deny the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine,\" aims that have not altered since the war began nearly four years ago, Stubb said.",
      "To do this, he suggested using tools such as the hundreds of billions of dollars in frozen Russian assets held in Europe as collateral to fund Ukraine, as well as increasing military pressure on Moscow.",
      "Stubb praised Trump for sanctioning the major Russian energy companies Lukoil and Rosneft in October, saying he did \u201can excellent job,\u201d but argued more must be done to give Ukraine the capacity to hit Russia\u2019s \u201cmilitary or defense industry.\"",
      "Last month Trump denied a Ukrainian request for long-range Tomahawk missiles which would theoretically allow Ukraine to strike deeper into Russia \u2013 although Kyiv does not currently have any launchers or platforms from which to fire them.",
      "Ukraine is still negotiating with the U.S. for more firepower, Stubb indicated.",
      "In mid-October the White House announced Trump would meet Putin in Budapest before abruptly canceling the meeting less than a week later.",
      "The decision came after a call between Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov where Rubio probably realized that \u201cthe Russians haven\u2019t moved an inch,\u201d Stubb said, and there was \u201cno point in taking President Trump into a situation whereby he doesn\u2019t get a deal or anything.\u201d",

      "The cancellation was \u201canother example of a strategic mistake by the Russians. They had an opportunity and they blew it,\u201d Stubb said.",
      "Trump has swung back and forth between seeking rapprochement with Putin and applying pressure to him, and has done the same with Zelenskyy. Stubb said he deals with any shifts by being \u201cquite patient\u201d and living with \u201creality.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t have illusions about things that you would like to see happening,\u201d the Finnish president said. \u201cI\u2019ve tried personally to focus on things such as: We need security guarantees for Ukraine. How to build those? We need a ceasefire. How can we get that?",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a bit of a grind. I guess you need \u2018sisu\u2019 in these types of negotiations as well.\"",
      "But, he said, the work is paying off and the military options for guaranteeing Ukraine\u2019s security once a ceasefire or peace negotiation is reached are now \u201cclear,\u201d with various countries having committed resources \u2014 although he declined to give more details, citing confidential military planning.",
      "Despite some of Ukraine's missteps, Stubb is unstinting in his praise for Zelenskyy. \u201cI admire a lot of the things that he\u2019s doing because to lead a country in a war ... is existential. You learn a lot from other human beings in that situation,\u201d he said.",
      "When it comes to dealing with Donald Trump, Stubb is in a better position than many European leaders. In his youth, he studied in the United States on a golf scholarship, and in March the two spent about seven hours playing a round at Mar-a-Lago.",
      "Golf was a \u201cdoor-opener,\u201d and helped him create a bond with the U.S. president, he suggested. While Trump and Zelenskyy have a notoriously tempestuous relationship, Stubb said he and other European leaders can help act as a bridge between them.",
      "\u201cWe interpret President Trump to President Zelenskyy and vice versa,\u201d he said.",
      "But when it comes to Putin, only one person should negotiate directly and publicly with him and that\u2019s Trump, Stubb indicated, suggesting the European Union is unlikely to open a direct channel of communication with the Russian leader any time soon.",
      "At the same time Trump is leading negotiations with Putin, multiple European countries have faced incursions from Russian drones \u2014 suspected or confirmed \u2014 as well as fighter jets and an alleged widespread Russian sabotage campaign.",
      "Russia is not only conducting a kinetic war in Ukraine but also a hybrid war in Europe, Stubb told AP.",
      "\u201cThe line between war and peace has been blurred,\u201d Stubb said",
      "Russia, he said, is trying to destabilize Europe and \u201ccause havoc and panic,\u201d with attacks including arson, vandalism and propaganda.",
      "The way to deal with those threats is to \u201cbe Finnish,\u201d Stubb said.",

      "The Czech Republic plans to build two new reactors at its Dukovany plant to expand the country's nuclear energy capacity",
      "DUKOVANY NUCLEAR PLANT, Czech Republic -- The eight huge cooling towers of the Dukovany power plant overlook a construction site for two more reactors as the Czech Republic pushes ahead with plans to expand its reliance on nuclear energy.",
      "Mobile drilling rigs have been extracting samples 140 meters below ground for a geological survey to make sure the site is suitable for a $19 billion project as part of the expansion that should eventually at least double the country\u2019s nuclear output and cement its place among Europe\u2019s most nuclear-dependent nations.",
      "South Korea\u2019s KHNP beat France\u2019s EDF in a tender to construct a new plant whose two reactors will have an output of over 1,000 megawatts each. After becoming operational in the second half 2030s, they will complement Dukovany\u2019s four 512-MW reactors that date from the 1980s.",
      "The KHNP deal gives the Czechs an option to have two more units built at the other nuclear plant in Temel\u00edn, which currently has two 1,000-megawatt reactors.",
      "Then, they are set to follow up with small modular nuclear reactors.",
      "\u201cNuclear will generate between 50% and 60% around 2050 in the Czech Republic, or maybe slightly more,\" Petr Z\u00e1vodsk\u00fd, chief executive of the Dukovany project, told The Associated Press in an interview.",
      "The nuclear expansion is needed to help the country wean itself off fossil fuels, secure steady and reliable supplies at a reasonable price, meet low emission requirements and enable robust demand for electricity expected in the coming years to power data centers and electric cars, Z\u00e1vodsk\u00fd said.",
      "The Czech expansion comes at a time when surging energy demand and looming deadlines by countries and companies to sharply cut carbon pollution are helping to revive interest in nuclear technology. While nuclear power does produce waste, it does not produce greenhouse gas emissions, like carbon dioxide, the main driver of climate change.",
      "The European Union has accepted nuclear by including it in the classification system for environmentally sustainable economic activities, opening the door to financing.

      "A new analysis of consumer data shows that more people in the United States are falling behind on their utility bills",
      "WASHINGTON -- More people are falling behind on paying their bills to keep on the lights and heat their homes, according to a new analysis of consumer data \u2014 a warning sign for the U.S. economy and another political headache for President Donald Trump.",
      "Past due balances to utility companies jumped 9.7% annually to $789 between the April-June periods of 2024 and 2025, said The Century Foundation, a liberal think tank. The increase has overlapped with a 12% jump in monthly energy bills during the same period.",
      "Consumers usually prioritize their utility bills along with their mortgages and auto debt, said Julie Margetta Morgan, the foundation's president. The increase in both energy costs and delinquencies may suggest that consumers are falling behind on other bills, too.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of information out there about rising utility costs, but here we can actually look at what that impact has been on families in terms of how they\u2019re falling behind,\" Margetta Morgan said.",
      "Troubles paying electricity and natural gas bills reflect something of an economic quandary for Trump, who is promoting the buildout of the artificial intelligence industry as a key part of an economic boom he has promised for America. But AI data centers are known for their massive use of electricity, and threaten to further increase utility bills for everyday Americans.",
      "These troubles also come as Trump faces political pressure from voters fed up with the high cost of living.",
      "Ever since Republicans saw their fortunes sag in off-year elections this month and affordability was identified as the top issue, Trump has been trying to convince the public that prices are falling. Fast-rising electricity bills could be an issue in some congressional battlegrounds in next year's midterm elections.",
      "Trump has put a particular emphasis on prices at the pump. Gasoline accounts for about 3% of the consumer price index, slightly less than the share belonging to electricity and natural gas bills \u2014 meaning that possible savings on gasoline could be more than offset by higher utility bills.",
      "The president maintains that any troubling data on inflation is false and that Democrats are simply trying to hurt his administration's reputation.",
      "\u201cIn fact, costs under the TRUMP ADMINISTRATION are tumbling down, helped greatly by gasoline and ENERGY,\" Trump posted on social media Friday. \"Affordability is a lie when used by the Dems,\u201d",
      "Nearly 6 million households have utility debt \u201cso severe\u201d that it will soon be reported to collection agencies, according to the foundation's analysis, drawn from the University of California Consumer Credit Panel.",

      "Both Margetta Morgan and Pierce previously worked at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a government agency formed in part to track trends in household borrowing to prevent potential abuses. The Trump administration has essentially shut down the bureau.",
      "The administration has so far said it has no responsibility for any increases in electricity prices, since those are often regulated by state utility boards. The White House maintains that utility costs are higher in Democratic states that rely on renewable forms of energy.",
      "\u201cElectricity prices are a state problem,\u201d Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told ABC News this month. \u201cThere are things that the federal government can control. Local electricity prices are not one of them.\u201d",

Emirates relies heavily on the double-decker Airbus A380 and the Boeing 777, and has also started flying the Airbus A350.",

The airline currently flies 95 Boeing 737 variants, with Airbus wanting to break into the carrier's fleet.

It plans a $35 billion project to expand to five parallel runways and 400 aircraft gates, to be completed within the next decade.

      "Analysts said a 9.4% quarter-on-quarter drop in private residential investment, which translates to a 32.5% drop in annualized terms, was mainly due to revisions of Japan's building code that caused housing starts to plunge after they took effect in April, the start of Japan's fiscal year.",

Fire Point\u2019s executives insist they have nothing to hide and are operating under strict martial law protocols, even commissioning an independent audit to appease investigators. Critics, however, question the company\u2019s opaque origins and the monopoly of its contracts with the Defense Ministry, and point to alleged links to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s notorious associate Tymur Mindich, who is implicated in a major corruption scandal.",

The investigation by anti-corruption organizations, launched a year ago, is still ongoing, she said. \u201cWe will be waiting for the results to come.\u201d",
      "The Associated Press was given exclusive access to a factory in Ukraine where its cruise missile, known as the Flamingo or FP-5, is assembled. The AP was given access on the condition the exact location is not named, due the risk of Russian attacks.",
      "Fire Point, which rose to prominence after initially being relatively unknown following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, now reports around $1 billion in revenue this year. It is also constructing a factory in Denmark to manufacture essential rocket propellent.",

They are also in high demand among Ukrainian forces as Western missiles remain hard to access in sufficient quantities to debilitate Russian capabilities.",
      "Fire Point has successfully tested Flamingo on the battlefield at least four times, company executives said. In late August it was used to strike an FSB base in Armiansk in the occupied Crimean Peninsula. This week, the missile was used to strike targets in the Russian city of Oryol. The company did not provide its current production capacity, citing security concerns.",
      "Production is going according to plans, company executives said, without elaborating on precise figures for security concerns.",
      "On the factory floor, dozens of hollowed hulls of missile frames lay scattered. These are made with carbon fiber, a material better suited to eluding Russian radars than aluminum, Maksym, the head of design told the AP. He spoke on condition that only his first name be used for security reasons.",
      "Fire Point is a significant beneficiary of the so-called Danish model, a financing mechanism spearheaded by Denmark, in which foreign governments directly fund Ukrainian defense companies, rather than procuring weapons from their own industries to send as aid. A factory to produce solid rocket fuel for missiles, including the Flamingo, is being established in Denmark.",

      "Cows can move to several farms in their lifetime \u2014 born on one pasture, sold to a different farmer, or two or three or more, until they\u2019ve grown to their full weight and are sold to a processor, said Marina Piatto, executive director of the Brazilian agriculture and conservation NGO Imaflora.",
      "Tracking those movements effectively can be a way to discourage deforestation. That's where the tagging comes in.",
      "Starting next year, all cattle being transported in Para have to be tagged. Each animal actually gets a tag in each ear. One is a written number that is registered with the government in an official database. The other is an electronic chip that links to the same information as the number registered to the cow \u2014 like when and where it was born, where it was raised, the owner, the breed and more. By 2027, all cattle in Para, including cattle born on ranches in the state, have to have tags.",
      "Once a tag is removed, it\u2019s broken and can\u2019t be put back, a measure to help avoid fraud.",
      "When the cattle moves, owners are required to report those movements and buyers are required to log the transaction. To be able to sell their animals, ranchers must have tags and a clean history. Locations registered with the government where the animals have been can be checked against satellite images to detect illegal deforestation, or against maps that show Indigenous territories that are supposed to be off-limits for cattle.",
      "\u201cThe only solution is individual cattle traceability because then you can know for each movement where that cattle has been and if it has been in a place that has been deforested in the past,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Otavio Passos, the Brazilian Amazon director with The Nature Conservancy.",
      "Mauro Lucio, 60, has 2,600 cattle on his farm in Paragominas about 290 kilometers (180 miles) south of Belem. He said the new tagging program was an easy transition for him because he's been tagging his cattle since 2000. He did it to track his own herd, but he sees the benefit of the government now being involved.",
      "\u201cFor me, this is the same tool,\" he said.",

      "JBS, the world\u2019s largest meatpacker, is donating 2 million tags to the effort.

      "Jefferies' Simons expects the September employment report to show that employers added 65,000 jobs that month \u2014 unimpressive, but up from a meager 22,000 in August. He figures that unemployment remained at a low 4.3%.",

      "The operator of the Keystone Pipeline says preliminary findings indicate a fatigue crack caused an oil spill in North Dakota in April",
      "BISMARCK, N.D. -- A fatigue crack in the Keystone Pipeline led to an oil spill in North Dakota earlier this year that released thousands of barrels of oil onto farmland, according to the pipeline operator.",
      "In a quarterly report released Thursday, South Bow said initial findings show, \u201cthe failure resulted from a fatigue crack that originated along the pipe\u2019s manufactured long-seam weld.\u201d A fatigue crack develops from stress over time. A mechanical and metallurgical analysis found the pipe and welds met industry standards, the company said.",
      "Spill-related costs total around $55 million, which the company said it expects to recover through insurance early next year. Through September, South Bow had received about $16 million in reimbursements from its insurance policies.",
      "The U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration ordered several corrective actions after the spill. The federal government shutdown delayed the release of a third-party \u201croot cause analysis,\u201d South Bow said.",
      "It's unclear when those findings will come. A South Bow spokesperson said PHMSA is leading that process and \u201cout of respect for the process, we can\u2019t speak for them.\u201d",
      "The spill occurred April 8. An employee at the rural site about 60 miles southwest of Fargo heard a \u201cmechanical bang\u201d and shut down the pipeline within two minutes, a state official has said.",
      "An estimated 3,500 barrels or 147,000 gallons of oil spilled in a field near Fort Ransom, a small town in a forested area with outdoor recreation and scenic views. South Bow sent vacuum trucks and more than 200 workers to aid the cleanup. The pipeline restarted after a six-day shutdown.",
      "State regulators inspected the site several times in the months after the spill, noting in September that \u201cthe vegetation is recovering well,\u201d and that it should be checked again in spring 2026, according to an incident report.",

      "Roughly 5 acres of land were impacted by the spill, though South Bow utilized 40 acres or more for the entire staging area and access, Hammer said. People and vehicles were on site as recently as Thursday, he said. The area of the spill is in gently rolling farmland.",

    "story": [
      "Walmart CEO Doug McMillon is planning to retire early next year and his successor has been named",
      "NEW YORK -- Walmart CEO Doug McMillon, who turned America's largest retailer into a tech-powered giant and spearheaded a period of robust sales growth since becoming chief executive in 2014, plans to retire early next year, the company said Friday in a surprise announcement.",
      "John Furner, 51, the head of Walmart's U.S. operations, will take over on Feb. 1, the day after McMillon's retirement becomes effective, the company said. Although McMillon is set to spend a year advising his successor, Walmart shares fell 3% immediately in premarket trading after the news of the unexpected leadership change.",
      "Unlike Amazon's Jeff Bezos or Tesla's Elon Musk, McMillon isn't a household name, but he played a key role in the U.S. economy. Walmart's performance serves as a barometer of consumer spending given its size and vast customer base. The company maintains that 90% of U.S. households rely on Walmart for a range of products, and more than 150 million customers shop on its website or in its stores every week.",
      "Walmart also is the nation's largest private employer, with 1.6 million workers.",
      "The pending CEO switch comes at a challenging time for retail companies and other employers that have spent almost 11 months navigating an uncertain economic environment as President Donald Trump\u2019s administration adopted volatile policies on tariffs and initiated an immigration crackdown that threatened to shrink the supply of workers.",
      "McMillon started with Walmart in 1984 and became chief executive three decades later. During his tenure as CEO, he invested heavily in employees by increasing wages, expanding parental leave and launching a program for employees seeking advancement and education opportunities to earn certificates and degrees.",
      "Under his leadership, Walmart has been laser-focused on maintaining low prices while embracing new technology like artificial intelligence and robotics.",
      "\u201cOver more than a decade as CEO, Doug led a comprehensive transformation by investing in our associates, advancing our digital and e-commerce capabilities, and modernizing our supply chain,\" Walmart Chairman Greg Penner, the son-in-law of the late Walmart founder Sam Walton, said. \"He leaves Walmart stronger, more innovative, and better aligned with our purpose to help people save money and live better.\u201d",
      "Furner started at Walmart in 1993, working as an hourly store associate in Bentonville, Arkansas, where the company is based. He served as president and CEO of the U.S. division of Sam's Club, the membership warehouse-store chain that Walmart owns, before taking the same roles at Walmart U.S.",
      "Under McMillon, Walmart's annual revenue has grown from $485.7 billion to $681 billion in its latest fiscal year. Its stock was hovering around $25 per share when he came to the helm; now, it is over $102.",
      "When he became CEO, stores were messy and worker morale was low. McMillon thought the company needed to increase pay and create pathways for hourly workers to advance in their careers. In 2015, Walmart announced a three-year, $2.7 billion investment to increase wages and create new education and training opportunities.",

The company gradually regained investors' confidence with higher sales, new customers and greatly improved employee retention rates.",
      "Walmart also invested heavily in e-commerce and faster deliveries. The company said in August that roughly one-third of recent deliveries from its U.S. stores involved orders asking for goods to arrive in three hours or less, and 20% of those orders made it to customers in a half-hour or under.",
      "Walmart has also looked for new sources of revenue like advertising and launched a membership program called Walmart + to compete with Amazon Prime, its rival's free shipping program.",
      "During the coronavirus pandemic, Walmart powered through worldwide supply chain kinks and saw a sales surge as homebound consumers stocked up. Walmart used its clout with suppliers again to maintain low prices and attract more customers during the period of inflation that followed the pandemic.",
      "The company has said it is absorbing some of the extra import costs from Trump's tariffs on foreign goods but that customers would see some price increases.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re doing what we said we would do,\u201d McMillon told stock analysts in August. \u201cWe\u2019re keeping our prices as low as we can for as long as we can. Our merchants have been creative and acted with urgency to avoid what would have been additional pressure for our customers and members.\u201d",

      "LONDON -- A London judge ruled Friday that global mining giant BHP Group is liable in Brazil\u2019s worst environmental disaster when a dam collapse 10 years ago unleashed tons of toxic waste into a major river, killing 19 people and devastating villages downstream.",
      "High Court Justice Finola O\u2019Farrell said Australia-based BHP was responsible despite not owning the dam at the time, finding its negligence or carelessness led to the collapse.",
      "Anglo-Australian BHP owns 50% of Samarco, the Brazilian company that operates the iron ore mine where the tailings dam ruptured on Nov. 5, 2015. Enough mine waste to fill 13,000 Olympic-size swimming pools poured into the Doce River in southeastern Brazil.",
      "Sludge from the burst dam destroyed the once-bustling village of Bento Rodrigues in Minas Gerais state and badly damaged other towns.",

      "The judge agreed with lawyers representing 600,000 Brazilians in the class-action case who argued that BHP was heavily involved in the Samarco operation and could have prevented the disaster, but instead encouraged raising the dam to allow more production.",
      "\u201cThe risk of collapse of the dam was foreseeable,\u201d O'Farrell wrote in the 222-page decision. \"It is inconceivable that a decision would have been taken to continue raising the height of the dam in those circumstances and the collapse could have been averted.\"",

      "Germany\u2019s governing coalition has agreed to subsidize energy prices for heavy industry over the next three years",
      "BERLIN -- Germany's governing coalition agreed to subsidize energy prices for heavy industry over the next three years as it tries to breathe new life into a stubbornly slow economy that is weighing on Europe's performance.",
      "Chancellor Friedrich Merz said he and other coalition leaders agreed Thursday evening to introduce an electricity price of about 5 euro cents (6 U.S. cents) per kilowatt hour starting Jan. 1, through 2028, to \u201csupport companies that use a lot of electricity and face international competition.\u201d",
      "Talks on the plan with the European Union's executive commission are near-complete and \u201cwe assume we will get permission for this,\" Merz said.",
      "The German economy, Europe's biggest, has shrunk for the past two years and has not seen significant growth for much longer. The conservative Merz's coalition government with the center-left Social Democrats has made revitalizing it a priority since taking office in early May.",
      "Still, results haven't shown through yet, with gross domestic product stagnating in the third quarter. This week, the government's panel of independent economic advisers forecast it will grow by an unimpressive 0.9% next year after edging up 0.2% this year.",
      "The country\u2019s economy, which is heavy on manufacturing and exports, has been held back by multiple factors including high energy prices, competition from Chinese producers of autos and industrial machinery, a lack of skilled workers and excessive bureaucracy.",

The government promises to cut red tape and speed up the country\u2019s lagging digitization.",
      "ING economist Carsten Brzeski, who put the current energy price at some 15 euro cents (17 U.S. cents) per kilowatt hour, said Friday that the planned subsidy \u201csends a strong signal and could provide industry not only short-term relief but also clarity and stability for years to come.\u201d",
      "Holger L\u00f6sch, deputy managing director of the Federation of German Industries, said the subsidized price would \u201chelp particularly energy-intensive industrial companies to remain competitive internationally,\u201d adding that he hopes the EU allows Germany the flexibility to reduce a large number of companies' costs.",
      "Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil put the expected cost of the measure at between 3 and 5 billion euros ($3.4 billion and $5.8 billion).",
      "Coalition leaders also agreed to cut a tax on airline tickets starting in July, something the air transport industry has long demanded. The measures will need parliamentary approval.",

      "Cities and states in the U.S. are turning to AI to improve road safety",
      "As America\u2019s aging roads fall further behind on much-needed repairs, cities and states are turning to artificial intelligence to spot the worst hazards and decide which fixes should come first.",
      "Hawaii officials, for example, are giving away 1,000 dashboard cameras as they try to reverse a recent spike in traffic fatalities. The cameras will use AI to automate inspections of guardrails, road signs and pavement markings, instantly discerning between minor problems and emergencies that warrant sending a maintenance crew.",
      "\u201cThis is not something where it\u2019s looked at once a month and then they sit down and figure out where they\u2019re going to put their vans,\u201d said Richard Browning, chief commercial officer at Nextbase, which developed the dashcams and imagery platform for Hawaii.",
      "After San Jose, California, started mounting cameras on street sweepers, city staff confirmed the system correctly identified potholes 97% of the time. Now they're expanding the effort to parking enforcement vehicles.",
      "Texas, where there are more roadway lane miles than the next two states combined, is less than a year into a massive AI plan that uses cameras as well as cellphone data from drivers who enroll to improve safety.",
      "Other states use the technology to inspect street signs or build annual reports about road congestion.",
      "Hawaii drivers over the next few weeks will be able to sign up for a free dashcam valued at $499 under the \u201cEyes on the Road\u201d campaign, which was piloted on service vehicles in 2021 before being paused due to wildfires.",
      "Roger Chen, a University of Hawaii associate professor of engineering who is helping facilitate the program, said the state faces unique challenges in maintaining its outdated roadway infrastructure.",
      "\u201cEquipment has to be shipped to the island,\u201d Chen said. \u201cThere\u2019s a space constraint and a topography constraint they have to deal with, so it\u2019s not an easy problem.\u201d",
      "Although the program also monitors such things as street debris and faded paint on lane lines, the companies behind the technology particularly tout its ability to detect damaged guardrails.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re analyzing all guardrails in their state, every single day,\u201d said Mark Pittman, CEO of Blyncsy, which combines the dashboard feeds with mapping software to analyze road conditions.",
      "Hawaii transportation officials are well aware of the risks that can stem from broken guardrails. Last year, the state reached a $3.9 million settlement with the family of a driver who was killed in 2020 after slamming into a guardrail that had been damaged in a crash 18 months earlier but never repaired.",
      "In October, Hawaii recorded its 106th traffic fatality of 2025 \u2014 more than all of 2024. It's unclear how many of the deaths were related to road problems, but Chen said the grim trend underscores the timeliness of the dashboard program.",
      "San Jose has reported strong early success in identifying potholes and road debris just by mounting cameras on a few street sweepers and parking enforcement vehicles.",

      "Utilities are producing eye-popping forecasts about the amount of electricity they'll need to power massive new data centers that are feeding the fast-growing AI economy",
      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- The forecasts are eye-popping: utilities saying they'll need two or three times more electricity within a few years to power massive new data centers that are feeding a fast-growing AI economy.",
      "But the challenges \u2014 some say the impossibility \u2014 of building new power plants to meet that demand so quickly has set off alarm bells for lawmakers, policymakers and regulators who wonder if those utility forecasts can be trusted.",
      "One burning question is whether the forecasts are based on data center projects that may never get built \u2014 eliciting concern that regular ratepayers could be stuck with the bill to build unnecessary power plants and grid infrastructure at a cost of billions of dollars.",
      "The scrutiny comes as analysts warn of the risk of an artificial intelligence investment bubble that's ballooned tech stock prices and could burst.",
      "Meanwhile, consumer advocates are finding that ratepayers in some areas \u2014 such as the mid-Atlantic electricity grid, which encompasses all or parts of 13 states stretching from New Jersey to Illinois, as well as Washington, D.C. \u2014 are already underwriting the cost to supply power to data centers, some of them built, some not.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s speculation in there,\u201d said Joe Bowring, who heads Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog in the mid-Atlantic grid territory. \u201cNobody really knows. Nobody has been looking carefully enough at the forecast to know what\u2019s speculative, what\u2019s double-counting, what\u2019s real, what\u2019s not.\u201d",
      "There is no standard practice across grids or for utilities to vet such massive projects, and figuring out a solution has become a hot topic, utilities and grid operators say.",
      "Uncertainty around forecasts is typically traced to a couple of things.",
      "One concerns developers seeking a grid connection, but whose plans aren't set in stone or lack the heft \u2014 clients, financing or otherwise \u2014 to bring the project to completion, industry and regulatory officials say.",
      "Another is data center developers submitting grid connection requests in various separate utility territories, PJM Interconnection, which operates the mid-Atlantic grid, and Texas lawmakers have found.",
      "Often, developers, for competitive reasons, won't tell utilities if or where they've submitted other requests for electricity, PJM said. That means a single project could inflate the energy forecasts of multiple utilities.",
      "The effort to improve forecasts got a high-profile boost in September, when a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission member asked the nation\u2019s grid operators for information on how they determine that a project is not only viable, but will use the electricity it says it needs.",
      "\u201cBetter data, better decision-making, better and faster decisions mean we can get all these projects, all this infrastructure built,\u201d the commissioner, David Rosner, said in an interview.",
      "The Edison Electric Institute, a trade association of for-profit electric utilities, said it welcomed efforts to improve demand forecasting.",
      "The Data Center Coalition, which represents tech giants like Google and Meta and data center developers, has urged regulators to request more information from utilities on their forecasts and to develop a set of best practices to determine the commercial viability of a data center project.",
      "The coalition's vice president of energy, Aaron Tinjum, said improving the accuracy and transparency of forecasts is a \u201cfundamental first step of really meeting this moment\u201d of energy growth.",

      "States also are trying to do more to find out what\u2019s in utility forecasts and weed out speculative or duplicative projects.",
      "In Texas, which is attracting large data center projects, lawmakers still haunted by a blackout during a deadly 2021 winter storm were shocked when told in 2024 by the grid operator, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, that its peak demand could nearly double by 2030.",
      "They found that state utility regulators lacked the tools to determine whether that was realistic.",
      "Texas state Sen. Phil King told a hearing earlier this year that the grid operator, utility regulators and utilities weren\u2019t sure if the power requests \u201care real or just speculative or somewhere in between.\u201d",
      "Lawmakers passed legislation sponsored by King, now law, that requires data center developers to disclose whether they have requests for electricity elsewhere in Texas and to set standards for developers to show that they have a substantial financial commitment to a site.",
      "PPL Electric Utilities, which delivers power to 1.5 million customers across central and eastern Pennsylvania, projects that data centers will more than triple its peak electricity demand by 2030.",
      "Vincent Sorgi, president and CEO of PPL Corp., told analysts on an earnings call this month that the data center projects \u201care real, they are coming fast and furious\u201d and that the \u201cnear-term risk of overbuilding generation simply does not exist.\u201d",
      "The data center projects counted in the forecast are backed by contracts with financial commitments often reaching tens of millions of dollars, PPL said.",
      "Still, PPL's projections helped spur a state lawmaker, Rep. Danilo Burgos, to introduce a bill to bolster the authority of state utility regulators to inspect how utilities assemble their energy demand forecasts.",
      "Ratepayers in Burgos' Philadelphia district just absorbed an increase in their electricity bills \u2014 attributed by the utility, PECO, to the rising cost of wholesale electricity in the mid-Atlantic grid driven primarily by data center demand.",
      "That's why ratepayers need more protection to ensure they are benefiting from the higher cost, Burgos said.",

      "The AI company Anthropic said this week that it disrupted a cyber operation that its researchers linked to the Chinese government. The operation involved the use of an artificial intelligence system to direct the hacking campaigns, which researchers called a disturbing development that could greatly expand the reach of AI-equipped hackers.",
      "While concerns about the use of AI to drive cyber operations are not new, what is concerning about the new operation is the degree to which AI was able to automate some of the work, the researchers said.",
      "\u201cWhile we predicted these capabilities would continue to evolve, what has stood out to us is how quickly they have done so at scale,\" they wrote in their report.",
      "The operation was modest in scope and only targeted about 30 individuals who worked at tech companies, financial institutions, chemical companies and government agencies. Anthropic noticed the operation in September and took steps to shut it down and notify the affected parties.",
      "The hackers only \u201csucceeded in a small number of cases,\u201d according to Anthropic, which noted that while AI systems are increasingly being used in a variety of settings for work and leisure, they can also be weaponized by hacking groups working for foreign adversaries.

      "The 321-foot (98-meter) New Glenn blasted into the afternoon sky from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, sending NASA\u2019s twin Mars orbiters on a drawn-out journey to the red planet. Liftoff was stalled four days by lousy local weather as well as solar storms strong enough to paint the skies with auroras as far south as Florida.",
      "In a remarkable first, Blue Origin recovered the booster following its separation from the upper stage and the Mars orbiters, an essential step to recycle and slash costs similar to SpaceX. Company employees cheered wildly as the booster landed upright on a barge 375 miles (600 kilometers) offshore. An ecstatic Bezos watched the action from Launch Control.",
      "\u201cNext stop, moon!\u201d employees chanted following the booster's bull's-eye landing. Twenty minutes later, the rocket's upper stage deployed the two Mars orbiters in space, the mission's main objective. Congratulations poured in from NASA officials as well as SpaceX's Elon Musk, whose booster landings are now routine.",
      "New Glenn\u2019s inaugural test flight in January delivered a prototype satellite to orbit, but failed to land the booster on its floating platform in the Atlantic.",
      "The identical Mars orbiters, named Escapade, will spend a year hanging out near Earth, stationing themselves 1 million miles (1.5 million kilometers) away. Once Earth and Mars are properly aligned next fall, the duo will get a gravity assist from Earth to head to the red planet, arriving in 2027.",
      "Once around Mars, the spacecraft will map the planet\u2019s upper atmosphere and scattered magnetic fields, studying how these realms interact with the solar wind. The observations should shed light on the processes behind the escaping Martian atmosphere, helping to explain how the planet went from wet and warm to dry and dusty. Scientists will also learn how best to protect astronauts against Mars' harsh radiation environment.",

      "It\u2019s a relatively low-budget mission, coming in under $80 million, that's managed and operated by UC Berkeley. NASA saved money by signing up for one of New Glenn\u2019s early flights. The Mars orbiters should have blasted off last fall, but NASA passed up that ideal launch window \u2014 Earth and Mars line up for a quick transit just every two years \u2014 because of feared delays with Blue Origin's brand-new rocket.",

      "Several lawsuits emerged across the U.S. \u2014 and were later consolidated \u2014 after AT&T notified millions of customers that information ranging from Social Security numbers to call records were compromised in these breaches last year. Plaintiffs alleged that the telecommunications giant \u201crepeatedly failed\u201d to protect consumer data. While AT&T has continued to deny wrongdoing, it opted to settle earlier this year.",

At the time, AT&T said the breach impacted roughly 7.6 million current and 65.4 million former account holders \u2014 with leaked data including some sensitive info like Social Security numbers and passcodes.",
      "The other breach involved call and text records of nearly all AT&T customers from May through October of 2022, as well as a small subset from Jan. 2, 2023. AT&T said it learned that data was \u201cillegally downloaded from our workspace on a third-party cloud platform\u201d in April of last year \u2014 and began notifying customers in July 2024, after launching an investigation.

      "There's a new frontier in treating autoimmune diseases",
      "Scientists are trying a revolutionary new approach to treat rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, lupus and other devastating autoimmune diseases \u2014 by reprogramming patients\u2019 out-of-whack immune systems.",
      "When your body\u2019s immune cells attack you instead of protecting you, today\u2019s treatments tamp down the friendly fire but they don\u2019t fix what\u2019s causing it. Patients face a lifetime of pricey pills, shots or infusions with some serious side effects \u2014 and too often the drugs aren\u2019t enough to keep their disease in check.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re entering a new era,\u201d said Dr. Maximilian Konig, a rheumatologist at Johns Hopkins University who\u2019s studying some of the possible new treatments. They offer \u201cthe chance to control disease in a way we\u2019ve never seen before.\u201d",
      "How? Researchers are altering dysfunctional immune systems, not just suppressing them, in a variety of ways that aim to be more potent and more precise than current therapies.",
      "They\u2019re highly experimental and, because of potential side effects, so far largely restricted to patients who\u2019ve exhausted today\u2019s treatments. But people entering early-stage studies are grasping for hope.",
      "\u201cWhat the heck is wrong with my body?\u201d Mileydy Gonzalez, 35, of New York remembers crying, frustrated that nothing was helping her daily lupus pain.",
      "Diagnosed at 24, her disease was worsening, attacking her lungs and kidneys. Gonzalez had trouble breathing, needed help to stand and walk and couldn\u2019t pick up her 3-year-old son when last July, her doctor at NYU Langone Health suggested the hospital\u2019s study using a treatment adapted from cancer.",
      "Gonzalez had never heard of that CAR-T therapy but decided, \u201cI\u2019m going to trust you.\u201d Over several months, she slowly regained energy and strength.",
      "\u201cI can actually run, I can chase my kid,\u201d said Gonzalez, who now is pain- and pill-free. \u201cI had forgotten what it was to be me.\u201d",
      "CAR-T was developed to wipe out hard-to-treat blood cancers. But the cells that go bad in leukemias and lymphomas \u2014 immune cells called B cells \u2014 go awry in a different way in many autoimmune diseases.",
      "Some U.S. studies in mice suggested CAR-T therapy might help those diseases. Then in Germany, Dr. Georg Schett at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg tried it with a severely ill young woman who had failed other lupus treatment. After one infusion, she\u2019s been in remission \u2014 with no other medicine \u2014 since March 2021.",
      "Last month, Schett told a meeting of the American College of Rheumatology how his team gradually treated a few dozen more patients, with additional diseases such as myositis and scleroderma \u2014 and few relapses so far.",
      "Those early results were \u201cshocking,\u201d Hopkins\u2019 Konig recalled.",
      "They led to an explosion of clinical trials testing CAR-T therapy in the U.S. and abroad for a growing list of autoimmune diseases.",
      "How it works: Immune soldiers called T cells are filtered out of a patient\u2019s blood and sent to a lab, where they\u2019re programmed to destroy their B cell relatives. After some chemotherapy to wipe out additional immune cells, millions of copies of those \u201cliving drugs\u201d are infused back into the patient.",
      "While autoimmune drugs can target certain B cells, experts say they can\u2019t get rid of those hidden deep in the body. CAR-T therapy targets both the problem B cells and healthy ones that might eventually run amok. Schett theorizes that the deep depletion reboots the immune system so when new B cells eventually form, they\u2019re healthy.",
      "CAR-T is grueling, time consuming and costly, in part because it is customized. A CAR-T cancer treatment can cost $500,000. Now some companies are testing off-the-shelf versions, made in advance using cells from healthy donors.",
      "Another approach uses \u201cpeacekeeper\u201d cells at the center of this year\u2019s Nobel Prize. Regulatory T cells are a rare subset of T cells that tamp down inflammation and help hold back other cells that mistakenly attack healthy tissue. Some biotech companies are engineering cells from patients with rheumatoid arthritis and other diseases not to attack, like CAR-T does, but to calm autoimmune reactions.",
      "Scientists also are repurposing another cancer treatment, drugs called T cell engagers, that don\u2019t require custom engineering. These lab-made antibodies act like a matchmaker. They redirect the body's existing T cells to target antibody-producing B cells, said Erlangen's Dr. Ricardo Grieshaber-Bouyer, who works with Schett and also studies possible alternatives to CAR-T.",

      "Rather than wiping out swaths of the immune system, Hopkins\u2019 Konig aims to get more precise, targeting \u201conly that very small population of rogue cells that really causes the damage.\u201d",
      "B cells have identifiers, like biological barcodes, showing they can produce faulty antibodies, Konig said. Researchers in his lab are trying to engineer T cell engagers that would only mark \u201cbad\u201d B cells for destruction, leaving healthy ones in place to fight infection.",
      "Nearby in another Hopkins lab, biomedical engineer Jordan Green is crafting a way for the immune system to reprogram itself with the help of instructions delivered by messenger RNA, or mRNA, the genetic code used in COVID-19 vaccines.",
      "In Green's lab, a computer screen shines with brightly colored dots that resemble a galaxy. It\u2019s a biological map that shows insulin-producing cells in the pancreas of a mouse. Red marks rogue T cells that destroy insulin production. Yellow indicates those peacemaker regulatory T cells \u2014 and they're outnumbered.",
      "Green's team aims to use that mRNA to instruct certain immune \u201cgenerals\u201d to curb the bad T cells and send in more peacemakers. They package the mRNA in biodegradable nanoparticles that can be injected like a drug. When the right immune cells get the messages, the hope is they'd \u201cdivide, divide, divide and make a whole army of healthy cells that then help treat the disease,\" Green said.",

      "A drug for Type 1 diabetes \u201cis forging the path,\u201d said Dr. Kevin Deane at the University of Colorado Anshutz.",
      "Type 1 diabetes develops gradually, and blood tests can spot people who are brewing it. A course of the drug teplizumab is approved to delay the first symptoms, modulating rogue T cells and prolonging insulin production.",
      "Deane studies rheumatoid arthritis and hopes to find a similar way to block the joint-destroying disease.",
      "About 30% of people with a certain self-reactive antibody in their blood will eventually develop RA. A new study tracked some of those people for seven years, mapping immune changes leading to the disease long before joints become swollen or painful.",
      "Those changes are potential drug targets, Deane said. While researchers hunt possible compounds to test, he\u2019s leading another study called StopRA: National to find and learn from more at-risk people.",
      "On all these fronts, there\u2019s a tremendous amount of research left to do \u2014 and no guarantees. There are questions about CAR-T's safety and how long its effects last, but it is furthest along in testing.",
      "Allie Rubin, 60, of Boca Raton, Florida, spent three decades battling lupus, including scary hospitalizations when it attacked her spinal cord. But she qualified for CAR-T when she also developed lymphoma \u2014 and while a serious side effect delayed her recovery, next month will mark two years without a sign of either cancer or lupus.",
      "\u201cI just remember I woke up one day and thought, \u2018Oh my god, I don\u2019t feel sick anymore,\u2019\u201d she said.",
      "That kind of result has researchers optimistic.",

      "Hamad is one of dozens of \u201csolar mamas\u201d trained in Zanzibar by Barefoot College International, a global nonprofit, through a program that brings light to rural communities and provides jobs for local women. So far in Zanzibar, it has lit 1,845 homes.",
      "The program selects middle-aged women, most with little or no formal education, from villages without electricity and trains them over six months to become solar power technicians. It is one of a small number of programs in Africa including Solar Sister.",
      "The women return to their communities with at least 50 sets of household solar panel kits as well as the skills and equipment to set them up and keep them running.",

      "The Zanzibar campus is in its 10th year of teaching local women. Before that, it sent women for training in India, where Barefoot College International was founded.",

      "It's incomplete. Among others, the list doesn't include Carrier Group, which offered to donate an HVAC system for the ballroom, and artificial intelligence chipmaker Nvidia, whose CEO, Jensen Huang, publicly discussed its donation.",
      "The White House hasn't said how much each donor is giving, and almost none was willing to divulge that. Very few commented on their contributions when contacted by The Associated Press.",
      "A senior White House official said the list has grown since it was first released in October, but some companies don't want to be publicly named until required to do so by financial disclosure regulations.

Cook also donated $1 million to Trump\u2019s inauguration fund. In the spring, Trump threatened the computing giant with tariffs after Apple announced plans to build manufacturing facilities in India.

      "Google Background: During his first term, Trump\u2019s administration sued Google for antitrust violations. While a candidate last year, Trump suggested he might seek to break up the search engine behemoth. Once Trump won the election, Google donated $1 million to his inauguration, and its CEO, Sundar Pichai, joined other major tech executives in attending the ceremony. Google's subsidiary, YouTube, agreed in September to pay $24.5 million to settle a lawsuit with Trump after it suspended his account following the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol.

CEO Satya Nadella has also met with Trump numerous times, as Microsoft has supported the administration\u2019s relaxation of regulations on artificial intelligence. He met previously with Biden, too.

      "Researchers have found that shouting is more effective than speaking when trying to scare off seagulls",
      "LONDON -- Sweet talk won't get you far if you want to scare off a seagull trying to snatch your food. Try shouting.",
      "Researchers set out to find if a man's voice was enough to deter bandit gulls from their penchant for purloining food in seaside towns and found it was effective if delivered with more urgency.",
      "\"Talking might stop them in their tracks, but shouting is more effective at making them fly away,\u201d said Neeltje Boogert of the University of Exeter's Center for Ecology and Conservation at the Cornwall campus.",

      "Previous research had shown that gulls could be dissuaded from snatching snacks by approaching them or making eye contact with them. They were also averse to shouting \u2014 the louder, the faster they fled.",

      "Global leaders have descended upon Brazil for COP30, and with the conference often comes a lot of negative news that evokes climate anxiety and dread",
      "Every autumn, news feeds get flooded with stories about climate change. That's because around this time each year, global leaders gather to discuss collective efforts to limit our emissions of planet-warming gases, released primarily from oil, gas and coal.",
      "Some of the information coming out of the COP30 conference is bleak. But it's not just COP. Climate stories can be difficult to consume year-round, whether it's about natural disasters, victims of heat waves or sea level rise or new studies about global warming impacts.",
      "\u201cWhen you throw a ton of scary facts and information at people, their nervous system shuts down. It\u2019s a coping mechanism,\u201d said Sarah Newman, founder and executive director of the Climate Mental Health Network.",
      "That sense of dread, doom, fear or hopelessness gets lumped into a single term: climate anxiety. Surveys from the American Psychiatric Association have repeatedly shown that a significant amount of Americans experience climate anxiety.",
      "Dealing with it, just like dealing with climate change, is an ongoing process. Here's how to get started.",
      "Imagine you leave the house in the morning, and realize you left the stove on. There's a fire hazard at home, and you're feeling anxious about it. So you turn around and switch it off. The problem is solved, and so is your anxiety.",
      "Climate change doesn't work that way.",
      "It activates different parts of the brain, according to a study published by the National Institutes of Health. While Generalized Anxiety Disorder often involves the part of the brain that handles fear, threat and emotion, climate anxiety activates parts of the brain that help with high cognition, willpower and tenacity.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an ongoing larger problem that I need to attend to over time and that is largely out of my control,\u201d climate psychologist Thomas Doherty said. \u201dI can\u2019t just flip a switch around climate change.\u201d",
      "The anxiety is more complex than a stove left on, because climate change is a more complex problem. The threat is indefinite, it\u2019s largely out of each person\u2019s control and addressing it requires repeated and variable action.",
      "Doherty, who wrote a book about coping with climate anxiety, said that it isn't inherently negative. It's a natural reaction to a threat, and it's the first step in a cyclical relationship with climate change.",
      "\u201cThe rest of the cycle is ultimately taking some action to resolve the threat as best that we can,\u201d he said.",
      "Newman said that one of the most effective ways to combat climate anxiety is to find other people who are experiencing it too, and to talk about it.",
      "Every year, New York City hosts something called Climate Week. Folks from all over descend upon Manhattan for hundreds of events and panels on energy, the environment and climate change.",
      "Between 15 and 20 people showed up to one event about finding connection and hope in the face of climate change. It was intimate, but so is confiding feelings of dread and isolation with a room full of strangers.",
      "\u201cHow many of you wake up in the morning with feelings of despair or hopelessness?\u201d asked the leader at the front of the room.",
      "Just about every hand sheepishly went up.",

      "\u201cJust like working on any problem, any issue, once you have a team around you, then you feel better. You\u2019re not alone. You feel stronger,\u201d he said.",
      "Meetups such as Climate Cafes or groups like Climate Psychology Alliance have online and in-person events where people can share experiences and build resilience together.",
      "Much of Newman's work with the Climate Mental Health Network is about bringing people together to combat that feeling of isolation.",
      "\u201cWhen people start to recognize that, they\u2019re not alone with what they\u2019re feeling,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s an opportunity for people to move from that helpless state to one of empowerment.\u201d",
      "Many general anxiety treatments relate to calming the body and clearing the head, and Doherty said that all of those work with climate anxiety.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s our same body. Our same brain, our same heart rate, blood pressure, our same ways of thinking,\u201d he said.",
      "Immediate grounding exercises include the 3-3-3 technique, where you name three things you see, three you hear and three parts of your body that you can move. Another one is the 5-4-3-2-1 technique, where you identify five things you can see, four things you can touch, three things you can hear, two things you can smell and one thing you can taste.",
      "Doherty also recommends prioritizing rest and exercise, going outside in nature and focusing on the present moment. He calls all of those practices basic mental hygiene.",
      "Doherty recommended channeling climate concern into something controllable, such as the impacts of climate change in your neighborhood, or even in your home.",
      "\u201cTake care of my own garden so to speak, before I try to plant a garden somewhere else,\u201d he said.",
      "That starts with something Doherty calls ceremonial actions. They don't meaningfully change the world, but they're easy, they can be repeated, they align with a person's values and make them feel better, like picking up litter or bringing reusable bags to the grocery store.",
      "Then those ceremonial actions fuel the desire and resilience needed for something larger, like getting rid of the gas appliances in the house, which could take years to afford and invest in. The U.N. lists 10 actions to reduce a person's impact on the planet.",
      "Climate anxiety is cyclical, because the sources of anxiety keep coming, and so does the need for coping mechanisms and actions. Newman said that there isn't an easy switch between climate anxiety and climate optimism.",
      "\u201cI still carry those emotions and I still have the worry and I have the anger and I have the sadness, but I\u2019m able to live with them in a different way,\u201d she said.",

      "Police said she ran a pyramid scheme that lured more than 128,000 people to invest in her business between 2014 and 2017, including many who invested their life savings and pensions. Authorities said she stored the illegally obtained funds in Bitcoin assets.",

      "Depending on the results, the vaccine could be approved and ready for use in Africa by 2028, Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi said.",
      "The development of the vaccine has been praised as a significant milestone for vaccine access in the country and across the rest of the continent.",
      "Motsoaledi said that while South Africa experienced relatively low levels of cholera, many countries in Africa often hit hard by outbreaks would greatly benefit. He said the COVID-19 pandemic exposed how vulnerable African countries were to pandemics as they relied on imported vaccines.",
      "South Africa often experiences cholera outbreaks due to cross-border movements. Other causes includes a lack of clean water in communities such as Hammanskraal, in the capital Pretoria, where provision of clean water remains a major problem.",

      "\u201cWhen we can research, develop and manufacture vaccines locally, we reduce our vulnerability to supply chain disruptions, geopolitical pressures, international market competition and vaccine nationalism, which was apparent at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic,\u201d said Motsoaledi.",
      "The trials are being held in the provinces of Gauteng, Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal, where cholera cases have previously been reported.",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea proposed talks with North Korea to clarify the rivals' border line and ease military tensions, saying Monday that North Korean soldiers' repeated border intrusions have raised worries about an armed clash.",
      "South Korea's military says it has been firing warning shots to repel North Korean troops who violated the border's military demarcation line numerous times since they began engaging in work to boost front-line defenses last year. North Korea has denied that and threatened unspecified responses, saying its soldiers worked within the North's territory.",
      "Kim Hong-Cheol, South Korean deputy minister for national defense policy, said Monday that South Korea was offering military talks to prevent an accidental armed clash and lower tensions with North Korea.",
      "Kim said that the North's border intrusions were likely caused by the rivals' different views on the border line, because many of the military demarcation line posts established at the end of the 1950-53 Korean War have been lost.",

      "It's unclear if North Korea would accept South Korea's calls for talks, because it's been shunning all forms of dialogue with South Korea and the U.S. since its leader Kim Jong Un's high-stakes nuclear diplomacy with U.S. President Donald Trump fell apart in 2019. Some observers say South Korea's offer for talks was part of efforts by its liberal government led by President Lee Jae Myung to reopen communication channels with North Korea.",
      "Last year, Kim declared that North Korea was abandoning its long-standing goals of a peaceful unification between the Koreas and ordered the rewriting of the North\u2019s constitution to mark the South as a permanent enemy. South Korea's military said that it has since detected North Korea adding anti-tank barriers and planting more mines at border areas.",
      "The Koreas' 248-kilometer-long (155-mile-long), four-kilometer-wide (2\u00bd-mile-wide) border is one of the world\u2019s most heavily armed frontiers. An estimated 2 million mines are peppered inside and near the border, which is also guarded by barbed-wire fences, tank traps and combat troops on both sides. It\u2019s a legacy of the Korean War, which ended with an armistice, not a peace treaty.",

The plane was diverted to Portland, where it landed safely with more than 80 people on board.",

He has said he believed he was dreaming at the time and that he was trying to wake himself up by grabbing two red handles that would have activated the plane\u2019s fire suppression system and cut off fuel to its engines.",

He was released from custody pending trial in December 2023, with requirements that he undergo mental health services, stay off drugs and alcohol, and keep away from aircraft.",

Conditions began to improve throughout last week as more controllers returned to work amid news that Congress was close to a deal to end the shutdown. That progress also prompted the FAA to pause plans for further rate increases.",
      "The agency had initially aimed for a 10% reduction in flights.

      "Overall, U.S. campuses saw a 1% decrease in international enrollment this fall compared with last year, according to a survey from the Institute of International Education. But that figure is propped up by large numbers of students who stayed in the U.S. for temporary work after graduating. The number of new students entering the United States for the first time fell by 17%, the sharpest decrease since the COVID-19 pandemic.",

      "Overall, nearly 60% of colleges reported a decrease in new foreign students this fall, the survey found, while 30% saw increases and others held even. More than 800 schools responded to the survey, which offers an early look at trends before full data is released next year.",
      "The Trump administration has sought to reduce America\u2019s reliance on foreign students. The White House is pushing colleges to cap enrollment of foreign students and enroll more from the U.S. In June, the State Department began screening visa applications more closely after temporarily halting all interviews.",
      "Visa processing has continued to lag in some countries, including India, the largest source of America\u2019s foreign students.

      "Foreign students make up about 6% of America\u2019s college students but they play an outsize role in campus budgets. Most pay higher tuition rates and don't get financial aid, effectively subsidizing U.S. students. Their numbers are far higher at elite campuses, often making up a quarter or more of the student body.",
      "International students at the graduate level saw the biggest backslide this fall, with a 12% drop. That was mostly offset by rising numbers of students participating in Optional Practical Training, which allows students to stay in the U.S. for temporary work after graduating.

At the University of Michigan, foreign graduate enrollment fell by a similar share. Arizona State University, which has more foreign students than any other public campus, saw its overall numbers fall by 3%.",
      "Universities are offering wider flexibility to students who couldn't make it to campus this fall, according to the survey. Almost three-quarters are allowing foreign students to defer their enrollment to the spring term, and more than half are allowing deferrals until fall 2026.",

      "A top Border Patrol commander touted dozens of arrests in North Carolina\u2019s largest city on Sunday as Charlotte residents reported encounters with federal immigration agents near churches, apartment complexes and stores.",
      "The Trump administration has made the Democratic city of about 950,000 people its latest target for an immigration enforcement surge it says will combat crime, despite fierce objections from local leaders and downtrending crime rates.",
      "Gregory Bovino, who led hundreds of U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents in a similar effort in Chicago, took to X to document a few of the more than 80 arrests he said agents had made. He also posted a highly-edited video of uniformed CBP officers handcuffing people.",
      "\u201cFrom border towns to the Queen City, our agents go where the mission calls,\u201d he posted on X, referring to Charlotte.",
      "The effort was dubbed \u201cOperation Charlotte\u2019s Web\u201d as a play on the title of a famous children\u2019s book that isn\u2019t about North Carolina.",
      "Some welcomed the intervention, including Mecklenburg County Republican Party Chairman Kyle Kirby, who said in a post Saturday that the county GOP \u201cstands with the rule of law \u2014 and with every Charlottean\u2019s safety first.\u201d",
      "The flurry of activity prompted fear and questions, including where detainees would be held, how long the operation would last and what agents' tactics \u2014 criticized elsewhere as aggressive and racist \u2014 would look like in North Carolina. On Saturday, at least one U.S. citizen said he was thrown to the ground and briefly detained.",
      "At Camino, a nonprofit group that offers services to Latino communities, some said they were too afraid to leave their homes to attend school, medical appointments or work. A dental clinic the group runs had nine cancellations on Friday, spokesperson Paola Garcia said.",
      "\u201cLatinos love this country. They came here to escape socialism and communism, and they\u2019re hard workers and people of faith,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cThey love their family, and it\u2019s just so sad to see that this community now has this target on their back.\u201d",
      "Bovino's operations in Chicago and Los Angeles triggered lawsuits over the use of force, including widespread deployment of chemical agents. Democratic leaders in both cities accused agents of inflaming community tensions. Federal agents fatally shot one suburban Chicago man during a traffic stop.",
      "Bovino, head of a Border Patrol sector in El Centro, California, and other Trump administration officials have called their tactics appropriate for growing threats on agents.",
      "Bovino posted pictures Sunday of people the Trump administration commonly dubs \u201ccriminal illegal aliens,\u201d meaning people living in the U.S. without legal permission who allegedly have criminal records. That included one of a man with an alleged history of drunk driving convictions.",
      "\u201cWe arrested him, taking him off the streets of Charlotte so he can\u2019t continue to ignore our laws and drive intoxicated on the same roads you and your loved ones are on,\u201d Bovino said.",

President Trump\u2019s policies are popular, he drives turnout, and standing with him is the strongest path to victory.\u201d",

      "Since the election, the White House has quietly decided to shift its message to focus more on affordability.",
      "Much of the first year of Trump\u2019s second term has been dominated by his trade wars, his crackdown on illegal immigration, his decision to send National Guard troops into American cities and the longest government shutdown in U.S. history.",
      "Trump has talked more about affordability in the days since Election Day. On Friday, he slashed tariffs on beef and other commodities that consumers say cost too much. But Trump's primary message is that the economy is better and consumer prices lower than as reported by the media. It\u2019s much the same message that Democratic President Joe Biden and his allies spent years pushing, with little success.",
      "\u201cWe have a great economy and the prices are coming down,\u201d Trump told reporters Sunday night before boarding Air Force One on his way back to the White House from his Florida resort.",

      "As an unprecedented immigration crackdown enters a third month, a growing number of Chicago residents are fighting back against what they deem a racist and aggressive overreach of the federal government.

The response from Chicago is a bunch of obscenities and \u2018no,\u2019\u201d said Anna Zolkowski Sobor, whose North Side neighborhood saw agents throw tear gas and tackle an elderly man. \u201cWe are all Chicagoans who deserve to be here. Leave us alone.\u201d",
      "Perhaps the clearest indicator of Chicago\u2019s growing resistance is the sound of whistles.",
      "Enriquez is credited with being among the first to introduce the concept. For months Little Village residents have used them to broadcast the persistent presence of immigration agents.",
      "Furious blasts both warn and attract observers who record video or criticize agents. Arrests, often referred to as kidnappings because many agents cover their faces, draw increasingly agitated crowds. Immigration agents have responded aggressively.",
      "Officers fatally shot one man during a traffic stop, while other agents use tear gas, rubber bullets and physical force. In early November, Chicago police were called to investigate shots fired at agents. No one was injured.",

      "A program in New Mexico highlights the contributions of women through historical markers",
      "SANTA FE, N.M. -- On a recent field trip to view historical markers in New Mexico\u2019s capital city of Santa Fe, seventh grader Raffi Paglayan noted the range of careers and contributions made by the women featured on them.",
      "Paglayan\u2019s favorite was Katherine Stinson Otero, a skywriter who was one of the first women to obtain a pilot\u2019s license in the U.S. After Stinson Otero contracted tuberculosis while driving ambulances in World War I, she moved to New Mexico and started a second career as a renowned architect.",
      "\u201cShe seems pretty cool,\u201d Paglayan said with a smile.",
      "Introducing New Mexicans to women from the state's history is the goal of a decades-long program that has put up nearly 100 roadside markers featuring the significant contributions of women from or with ties to New Mexico. Now the New Mexico Historic Women Marker Program is branching out to create a curriculum for schools based on its research.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just so essential that all students, not just female students, but every student has the ability to recognize and see the significance of the people that have done so much work to create what we have,\u201d said Lisa Nordstrum, the education director and middle school teacher who took Paglayan and her classmates on the field trip.",
      "The road marker efforts started decades ago. Pat French, a founding member of the International Women's Forum - New Mexico, a leadership and networking group, noticed in the 1980s that there were hardly any women mentioned in any of the state's historic roadside markers. In 2006, the group secured state funding to work with the New Mexico Department of Transportation to change that.",
      "Over the years, the group visited individual counties and Native American communities, asking for stories about important women in their history. The research compiled biographies of dozens of women from precolonial times through the Spanish and Mexican territory periods, and into the time when New Mexico became a state.",
      "Now those women's stories are displayed on 6-foot signs across the state and in an online database. While some honor well-known historical figures such as American modernist painter Georgia O\u2019Keeffe and New Mexico's first female Secretary of State Soledad Ch\u00e1vez de Chac\u00f3n, many others feature local women whose stories have not been widely told.",
      "For example, Evelyn Vigil and Juanita Toledo are remembered for reviving the Pecos Pueblo style of pottery in the 1970s, after the indigenous Pecos Pueblo population was decimated by years of disease and war by the 1890s, and the pottery techniques were lost.",
      "\u201cThere is just a sense of justice about it,\u201d said program director Kris Pettersen. \u201cThese women put all this effort in and made all these contributions, and they were unrecognized, and that\u2019s just wrong.\u201d",
      "Other markers are dedicated to groups of women, such as healers and the state's female military veterans. The collection notes that the history of the state cannot be told without recognizing the conflict that came with colonialization and the wars fought over the territory.",
      "\u201cThey are not, however, the first women to take up arms and defend their homes and society in our region,\u201d the veterans' online blurb notes. \u201cNew Mexico is a state of culturally diverse people who have protected themselves over many centuries.\u201d",

These are the strictest abortion prohibitions and punishments in the nation being considered by South Carolina lawmakers, even as opponents of the procedure are divided over how far to go.",
      "The bill faces a long legislative path and uncertain prospects, even if it clears the state Senate subcommittee that's reviewing it.",
      "But the measure up for a second hearing Tuesday would go further than any considered since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, as abortion remains an unsettled issue in conservative states.",
      "The proposal would ban all abortions unless the woman's life is at risk and eliminates exceptions for rape and incest victims up to 12 weeks. Current law blocks abortions after cardiac activity is detected, which is typically six weeks into a pregnancy, before many women know they are pregnant.",
      "The proposal would also go further than any other U.S. state. Women who get an abortion and anyone who helps them could face up to 30 years in prison. It appears to ban any contraception that prevents a fertilized egg from implanting. That would ban IUDs and could strictly limit in-vitro fertilization.",

      "The charges became part of a legal debate over whether Trump's pardons for Jan. 6 rioters applied to other crimes discovered during the sprawling federal dragnet that began after the attack on the Capitol. The Trump-appointed federal judge who oversaw Wilson\u2019s case criticized the Justice Department earlier this year for arguing that the president\u2019s Jan. 6 pardons applied to Wilson\u2019s gun offense.",

      "The Georgia election interference case against Donald Trump and others is now in the hands of a new prosecutor",
      "ATLANTA -- The fate of the Georgia election interference case against President Donald Trump and others is now in the hands of a new prosecutor who has to decide how he is going to move forward with the sprawling indictment.",
      "After courts removed Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis over an \u201cappearance of impropriety\u201d created by a romantic relationship with the special prosecutor she had chosen to lead the case, it was up to the Prosecuting Attorneys' Council to someone to take over. Council Executive Director Pete Skandalakis said Friday that he would handle the case himself after he was unable to find anyone else willing to do it.",
      "The indictment against Trump and 18 others was returned by a grand jury in August 2023 and uses the state\u2019s anti-racketeering law to allege a wide-ranging conspiracy to illegally overturn Trump\u2019s narrow loss to Democrat Joe Biden in Georgia.",
      "Here are some things to know about Skandalakis and what might come next for this prosecution.",
      "When a prosecutor recuses or is removed from a case in Georgia, the executive director of the nonpartisan Prosecuting Attorneys' Council steps in to appoint a substitute prosecutor. Skandalakis, who has led the agency since January 2018, said in an e-mailed statement that he contacted several prosecutors about taking over the election interference case and they all declined.",
      "The judge overseeing the case had said that if a new prosecutor wasn't appointed by Friday, he would dismiss the case. Skandalakis said that while he could easily have let the judge's deadline pass without appointing anyone and allowed the case to be dismissed, he \u201cdid not believe that to be the right course of action.\u201d",
      "He acknowledged that he had not had a chance to fully review the case, having only recently received from Willis' office 101 boxes of documents and an eight-terabyte hard drive with the full investigative file. Appointing himself to the case, he said, \u201cwill allow me to complete a comprehensive review and make an informed decision regarding how best to proceed.\u201d",
      "Prior to his time at the council, Skandalakis spent about 25 years as the elected Republican district attorney for the Coweta Judicial Circuit, southwest of Atlanta. But former Gwinnett County District Attorney Danny Porter, who has known Skandalakis for more than 40 years, said they shared a philosophy that the district attorney's office should be nonpartisan.",
      "\u201cI wouldn\u2019t put too much weight on the fact that he ran as a Republican,\u201d Porter said. \u201cI feel certain that he\u2019s going to do what he said he\u2019s going to do and give it a fair and transparent review and come to conclusions based on the law and the facts.\u201d",
      "Skandalakis is no stranger to sensitive high-profile cases. He took on the investigation into the June 2020 shooting death of Rayshard Brooks, a Black man, by a white police officer after Willis recused her office from the case. He ultimately decided that the two officers involved had acted reasonably, and he declined to pursue charges.",
      "Skandalakis will continue to review the case file to decide how he wants to proceed. The judge has set a Dec. 1 status hearing and said the prosecution should be prepared to say at that time whether it intends to seek a new indictment in the case.",

      "Skandalakis has declined to comment beyond the statement he released Friday. But Porter, who has served as a substitute prosecutor, said the first step is generally to get the case filed, which Skandalakis has done. Then, Porter said, it is not improper to have a discussion with the removed prosecutor about their summary of the case, but that should be the last contact between the two prosecution teams about the case.",
      "Then the substitute prosecutor would start from scratch, figuring out how the case is organized, determining the budget and resources needed to handle it and figuring out how to handle it.",
      "The size of this case makes all that a \u201cnearly impossible task for one person to do,\u201d Porter said. While Skandalakis has a \u201cgreat staff\u201d with some really talented prosecutors, they all have other cases on their plates.",
      "The Prosecuting Attorneys' Council has a tight budget, and the state legislature is dominated by Republicans, many loyal to Trump, who are unlikely to grant any special appropriations for this prosecution. But Skandalakis could look for money elsewhere to hire contract attorneys and cover other expenses, Porter said.",
      "Then Skandalakis will have to decide whether he wants to continue on the course that Willis had charted, pursue only some of the charges or dismiss the case.",
      "\u201cI think the case as it's indicted is completely untryable,\u201d Porter said, adding that he would try to slim it down, either by seeking a new indictment or asking the judge to sever some counts to break it down into smaller cases, Porter said.",
      "The indictment includes charges related to a Jan. 2, 2021, phone call between Trump and Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger during which Trump urged the state\u2019s top elections official to help him \u201cfind\u201d the votes he needed to win. Other charges have to do with a getting a slate of Republican electors to falsely declare that Trump won the state, allegations of harassment of a Georgia election worker and a breach of election equipment in a rural south Georgia county.",
      "Four of the 19 people charged pleaded guilty after reaching deals with prosecutors in the months following their indictment. Trump and the other 14 people charged have all pleaded not guilty. It seems unlikely that any action against Trump could proceed while he is in office, but the others do not have that shield.",

      "\u201cTen \u2014 how do you say 10 in Yup'ik?\u201d the teacher asked.",
      "\u201cQula!\u201d the students answered in unison.",
      "Martin and her family were among hundreds of people airlifted to Anchorage, the state's largest city, after the remnants of Typhoon Halong inundated their small coastal villages along the Bering Sea last month, dislodging dozens of homes and floating them away \u2014 many with people inside. The floods left nearly 700 homes destroyed or heavily damaged. One person died, two remain missing.",
      "As the residents grapple with uprooted lives very different from the traditional ones they left, some of the children are finding a measure of familiarity in a school-based immersion program that focuses on their Yup\u2019ik language and culture \u2014 one of two such programs in the state.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m learning more Yup\u2019ik,\u201d said Martin, who added that she's using the language to communicate with her mother, teachers and classmates. \u201cI usually speak more Yup\u2019ik in villages, but mostly more English in cities.\u201d",
      "There are more than 100 languages spoken in the homes of Anchorage School District students. Yup\u2019ik, which is spoken by about 10,000 people in the state, is the fifth most common. The district adopted its first language immersion program \u2014 Japanese \u2014 in 1989, and subsequently added Spanish, Mandarin Chinese, German, French and Russian.",
      "After many requests from parents, the district obtained a federal grant and added a K-12 Yup'ik immersion program about nine years ago. The students in the first class are now eighth-graders. The program is based at College Gate Elementary and Wendler Middle School.",
      "The principal at College Gate Elementary, Darrell Berntsen, is himself Alaska Native \u2014 Sugpiaq, from Kodiak Island, south of Anchorage. His mother was 12 years old in 1964 when the magnitude-9.2 Great Alaska Earthquake and an ensuing tsunami devastated her village of Old Harbor. He recalls her stories of joining other villagers at high ground and watching as the surge of water carried homes out to sea.",
      "His mother and her family evacuated to a shelter in Anchorage, but returned to Kodiak Island when Old Harbor was rebuilt. Berntsen grew up living a subsistence life \u2014 \u201cthe greatest time of my life was being able to go out duck hunting, go out deer hunting,\" he said \u2014 and he understands what the evacuees from Kipnuk, Kwigillingok and other damaged villages have left behind.",
      "He has also long had an interest in preserving Alaska Native culture and languages. His ex-wife\u2019s grandmother, Marie Smith Jones, was the last fluent speaker of Eyak, an indigenous language from south-central Alaska, when she died in 2008. His uncles had their hands slapped when they spoke their indigenous Alutiiq language at school.",
      "As the evacuees arrived in Anchorage in the days after last month's flooding, Berntsen greeted them at an arena where the Red Cross had set up a shelter. He invited families to enroll their children in the Yup'ik immersion program. Many of the parents showed him photos of the duck, goose, moose, seal or other traditional foods they had saved for the winter \u2014 stockpiles that washed away or spoiled in the flood.",
      "\u201cListening is a big part of our culture \u2014 hearing their stories, letting them know that, \u2018Hey, I live here in Anchorage, I\u2019m running one of my schools, the Yup\u2019ik immersion program, you guys are welcome at our school,\u2019\u201d Berntsen said. \"Do everything we can to make them feel comfortable in the most uncomfortable situation that they\u2019ve ever been through.\u201d",

      "Among the program's new students is Ellyne Aliralria, a 10-year-old from Kipnuk. During the surge of floodwater the weekend of Oct. 11, she and her family were in a home that floated upriver. The high water also washed away her sister's grave, she said.",
      "Aliralria likes the immersion program and learning more phrases, even though the Yup\u2019ik dialect being spoken is a bit different from the one she knows.",

One example: the seal hop, in which participants assume a plank position and shuffle across the floor to emulate how hunters sneak up on seals napping on the ice.",
      "The Yup'ik immersion program is helping undo some of the damage Western culture did to Alaska Native language and traditions, he said. It's also bridging the gap of two lost generations: In some cases, the children's parents or grandparents never learned Yup'ik, but the students can now speak with their great-grandparents, Locke said.",
      "\u201cI took this as a great opportunity for us to give back some of what the trauma had taken from our Indigenous people,\u201d Berntsen said.",

He would have rights as well as responsibilities, like voting, that, as he was making a commitment to the country, the country was making one to him.",
      "\u201cWhen I raised my hand and took the oath of allegiance, I did believe that moment the promise that I belonged,\u201d said Sesay, 44, who first arrived in Louisiana more than 15 years ago and now works as an advocate for refugees and their integration into American society.",
      "But in recent months, as President Donald Trump reshapes immigration and the country's relationship with immigrants, that belief has been shaken for Sesay and other naturalized citizens. There's now fear that the push to drastically increase deportations and shift who can claim America as home, through things like trying to end birthright citizenship, is having a ripple effect.",
      "What they thought was the bedrock protection of naturalization now feels more like quicksand.",
      "Some are worried that if they leave the country, they will have difficulties when trying to return, fearful because of accounts of naturalized citizens being questioned or detained by U.S. border agents. They wonder: Do they need to lock down their phones to protect their privacy? Others are hesitant about moving around within the country, after stories like that of a U.S. citizen accused of being here illegally and detained even after his mother produced his birth certificate.",
      "Sesay said he doesn't travel domestically anymore without his passport, despite having a REAL ID with its federally mandated, stringent identity requirements.",
      "Immigration enforcement roundups, often conducted by masked, unidentifiable federal agents in places including Chicago and New York City, have at times included American citizens in their dragnets. One U.S. citizen who says he was detained by immigration agents twice has filed a federal lawsuit.",
      "Adding to the worries, the Justice Department issued a memo this summer saying it would ramp up efforts to denaturalize immigrants who\u2019ve committed crimes or are deemed to present a national security risk. At one point during the summer, Trump threatened the citizenship of Zohran Mamdani, the 34-year-old democratic socialist mayor-elect of New York City, who naturalized as a young adult.",
      "The atmosphere makes some worried to speak about it publicly, for fear of drawing negative attention to themselves. Requests for comment through several community organizations and other connections found no takers willing to go on the record other than Sesay.",
      "In New Mexico, state Sen. Cindy Nava says she's familiar with the fear, having grown up undocumented before getting DACA \u2014 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, the Obama-era program that protected people brought to the U.S. as children from being deported \u2014 and gaining citizenship through her marriage. But she hadn't expected to see so much fear among naturalized citizens.",

      "What citizenship has meant, and who was included, has expanded and contracted over the course of American history, said Stephen Kantrowitz, professor of history at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He said while the word \u201ccitizen\u201d is in the original Constitution, it is not defined.",
      "\u201cWhen the Constitution is written, nobody knows what citizenship means,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a term of art, it comes out of the French revolutionary tradition. It sort of suggests an equality of the members of a political community, and it has some implications for the right to be a member of that political community. But it is ... so undefined.\u201d",
      "The first naturalization law passed in 1790 by the new country\u2019s Congress said citizenship was for any \u201cfree white person\u201d of good character. Those of African descent or nativity were added as a specific category to federal immigration law after the ravages of the Civil War in the 19th century, which was also when the 14th Amendment was added to the Constitution to establish birthright citizenship.",
      "In the last years of the 19th century and into the 20th century, laws were put on the books limiting immigration and, by extension, naturalization. The Immigration Act of 1924 effectively barred people from Asia because they were ineligible for naturalization, being neither white nor Black. That didn't change until 1952, when an immigration law removed racial restrictions on who could be naturalized. The 1965 Immigration and Naturalization Act replaced the previous immigration system with one that portioned out visas equally among nations.",
      "American history also includes times when those who had citizenship had it taken away, like after the 1923 Supreme Court ruling in U.S. vs. Bhagat Singh Thind. That ruling said that Indians couldn't be naturalized because they did not qualify as white and led to several dozen denaturalizations. At other times, it was ignored, as in World War II, when Japanese Americans were forced into internment camps.",
      "\u201cPolitical power will sometimes simply decide that a group of people, or a person or a family isn\u2019t entitled to citizenship,\u201d Kantrowitz said.",
      "In this moment, Sesay says, it feels like betrayal.",
      "\u201cThe United States of America \u2014 that\u2019s what I took that oath of allegiance, that\u2019s what I make commitment to,\u201d Sesay said. \u201cNow, inside my home country, and I\u2019m seeing a shift. ... Honestly, that is not the America I believe in when I put my hand over my heart.\u201d",

      "In \"Defying Gravity: The Creative Career of Stephen Schwartz, from Godspell to Wicked\" (published by Applause Books), biographer Carol de Giere explores the life and work of the Grammy- and Oscar-winning composer of treasured Broadway and movie hits.",
      "Read an excerpt below, in which Schwartz finds the inspiration of what will become his most successful musical production to date, when he discovers Gregory Maguire's prequel to L. Frank Baum's \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\" \u2013 the genesis of the long-running Broadway musical \"Wicked.\"",

      "\"Defying Gravity\" by Carol de Giere",
      "Landing in Oz",
      "\"It's time to trust my instincts, close my eyes and leap!\" \u2014Wicked",
      "At the start of 1996, Stephen Schwartz never imagined he would end the year envisioning his next Broadway musical, Wicked. Movie songwriting seemed to be his future, especially after one eventful evening in March. He donned his newly-purchased black tuxedo and white silk dress shirt, strode across the red carpet, and met up with his Pocahontas writing partner Alan Menken at Los Angeles' Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. For forty-eight-year-old Schwartz, being nominated for an Academy Award was a welcome twist on his childhood dream of writing musicals for the stage. With his parents and wife in the audience, he waited for the announcement.",
      "\"And the Oscar for Best Original Musical or Comedy Score goes to\u2026\" An expectant silence settled in the hall while presenter Quincy Jones opened the envelope.",
      "\"Alan Menken, musical and orchestral score, and Stephen Schwartz, lyrics, for Pocahontas.\" Applause burst out while the pair made their way to the stage. As Menken thanked their Pocahontas music team, Schwartz clutched his golden statuette and smiled, looking down at Mel Gibson in the front row making funny faces at him and soaking in the acknowledgment from Hollywood. That evening he and Menken also stepped up to accept the award for Best Original Song, \"Colors of the Wind.\"",
      "Back home in Connecticut, he placed his gold-plated statuettes beside his Grammy gramophones in a trophy case converted from an aquarium that his kids no longer used.",
      "The rest of the year was a busy one, with the premiere of The Hunchback of Notre Dame and early work on The Prince of Egypt involving meetings with the DreamWorks team and the writing and demo-ing of songs. He was also working on an early production of a revue musical Snapshots in Seattle, confident that when finally finished, the show would go direct to stock and amateur licensing rather than to a commercial production. The one thing he was emphatically not doing was planning anything new for Broadway.",
      "Then towards the end of the year, a phone call came that would change everything. He was in Los Angeles finishing some work on The Prince of Egypt when his long-time buddy, songwriter John Bucchino, called him from the island of Maui in Hawaii. Singer-songwriter Holly Near had hired Bucchino as a piano accompanist for her performances at a conference at the tropical getaway. Once on Maui, Bucchino decided it was too good not to share. His room included an extra bed, and he had a car and free food. \"If you can cash in some frequent flyer miles and come for the weekend, you'll have a free vacation in Hawaii,\" Bucchino offered.",
      "\"Why not?\" thought Schwartz. He had the weekend free, and after all, it was Hawaii. \"I am so there,\" came Schwartz's answer from LA, and by December 16th, he was.",
      "When Bucchino and Near had a block of time away from the stage, they organized a snorkeling adventure with Schwartz and Near's friend, Pat Hunt. A small boat sped them over to Molikini, a mostly submerged volcanic crater popular for its rainbow spread of sea creatures that delight snorkelers.",
      "On the trip back, Holly casually mentioned to Stephen, \"I'm reading this really interesting book called Wicked, by Gregory Maguire.\"",
      "The novel's title sounded intriguing. \"I think I've heard of it. What's it about?\" he inquired.",
      "\"It's the Oz story from the Wicked Witch of the West's point of view.\"",
      "In an instant, Schwartz's imagination flashed through the implications of a backstory for The Wizard of Oz told from the perspective of the unpopular witch. His reaction was visceral: \"All the hairs on my arms stood on end,\" he recalls. \"I thought it was the best idea for a musical I had ever heard.\"",
      "As soon as he returned to his LA apartment, he called his attorney in New York, inquiring about Maguire's 1995 novel Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West. \"Okay, this book has been out for a while, so somebody has the rights. I need you to find out who has them. Meanwhile, I'm going to get the book and read it, because I think I have to do this.\"",
      "There was no way around it. This was a Broadway concept not suited to a small-budget theater company. And he knew it was a highly theatrical idea, not one meant for film or television. Although he had firmly decided, indeed pledged, never to work on Broadway again, his instincts didn't leave him a choice.",
      "But with such a popular novel, surely someone in Hollywood was converting it to the silver screen. Schwartz would have to stop them, and somehow inspire the rights holders to consider instead the risky, expensive, and time-consuming venture of producing a musical in New York City.",
      "While his attorney, Nancy Rose, followed clues on the rights trail, Wicked's prospective composer-lyricist read the novel and confirmed that his hunch had been right: musicalizing the Wicked Witch's story seemed \"quintessentially an idea for me,\" meaningful enough to be worth the potential struggle.",
      "For one thing, he loved looking at traditional stories from a new angle. When he was in college he saw Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead, Tom Stoppard's play in which two minor characters in Shakespeare's Hamlet are made the central characters. \"It was a revelation to me,\" he recalls. \"From that point on, the idea of looking at familiar material from an unfamiliar point of view became a goal for my own work.\" Godspell had approached the New Testament in a fresh way, Children of Eden reworked Genesis for a new take on family life, and The Prince of Egypt explored the Exodus story from the standpoint of the brother relationship between Moses and Ramses. But Gregory Maguire's twist on The Wizard of Oz was a chance to do something more directly like the Rosencrantz and Guildenstern concept. \"I recognized immediately that this was a genius idea and that it was an idea for me: the way it took a familiar subject and spun it,\" Schwartz recalls.",
      "Wicked also felt inherently musical to him. \"Elphaba is a very musical character with big emotions. She is fantastical. The world is fantastical. Glinda is very musical.\" To him it was clear that the world of musical theater was where the story belonged.",
      "And then there was the character Maguire's vision had moved to the center of the story: Elphaba, the quirky and misunderstood green girl who becomes the Wicked Witch of the West. Maguire named her after L. Frank Baum, who penned The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, when he pondered the sound of the author's initials \"eL\" \"Fa\" \"Ba.\" Elphaba's story seemed close to Schwartz's own emotional experience. He knew what it felt like to be \"green\" and what inner resources are needed to carry on with life. \"The idea of the story created a sympathetic resonance in me,\" Schwartz affirms, \"and I know that I'm not alone. Anyone who is an artist in our society is going to identify with Elphaba. Anyone who is of an ethnic minority, who is black or Jewish or gay, or a woman feeling she grew up in a man's world, or anyone who grew up feeling a dissonance between who they are inside and the world around them, will identify with Elphaba. Since that's so many of us, I think there will be a lot of people who will.\"",
      "\"There were things that I knew right away. I knew how it was going to begin, I knew how it was going to end, I knew who Elphaba was, and I knew why\u2014 on some strange level\u2014this was autobiographical even though it was about a green girl in Oz.\" \u2014Stephen Schwartz",
      "Schwartz bought a spiral notebook in which he would capture all his story and lyric ideas\u2014snatches of inspiration, research notes, lists of rhyming words, first drafts of lyric lines, and later drafts. On the black cover, the manufacturer's slogan, \"Five Star\u2014In a Class By Itself,\" hinted at what would become of the musical that began as penciled scrawls on the lined pages.",
      "Maguire had created, as the author himself described it, a dense, almost nineteenth-century-type novel that takes place over thirty-eight years and has thirty-eight speaking parts. Could any group of musical collaborators successfully distill these ingredients into a viable evening of theater?",

    "published": "Sun, 16 Nov 2025 10:15:24 -0500",
    "summary": "When the \"Star Trek\" actor and America's favorite astrophysicist share the stage, sparks can fly on an astronomical level. They talk about their bromance built on an appreciation of science and curiosity.",
    "story": [
      "Not long ago in Seattle, an astronomical event of sorts happened: Two superstars collided. William Shatner, of \"Star Trek\" fame, and Neil deGrasse Tyson, America's favorite astrophysicist, took to the stage to explore the nature of exploration. Think of it as sort of Martin & Lewis, but with more quantum mechanics.",
      "\"It's a bromance,\" said Tyson. \"I think what Bill Shatner and I have together should be the textbook definition of the bromance.\"",
      "\"If we have a bromance,\" said Shatner, \"I'd be very privileged.\"",
      "The two grew close last year on an upscale cruise to Antarctica, where they ended up being the after-dinner entertainment. \"The organizer said, 'Why don't we put the two of you on this mini-stage that they have on the ship, and we just chew the fat?'\" said Tyson. \"And then the organizer said, 'Why don't you guys take this on the road?'\"",
      "Their first port of call? Seattle, where they debuted a wide-ranging, sometimes meandering, but always intriguing stage show they're calling \"The Universe Is Absurd!\"",
      "When Shatner asked his partner for a sound bite, deGrasse Tyson solicited a suggestion from the audience: \"Pick anything out of the universe. Go. Anything. Doesn't matter.\"",
      "\"Pluto!\" yelled one enthusiastic audience member.",
      "DeGrasse Tyson obliged: \"More than half of Pluto is made of ice, so that, if it were where Earth is right now, heat from the Sun would evaporate that ice and it would grow a tail. And that is no kind of behavior for a planet!\" Mic drop. \"That's a sound bite!\"",
      "For deGrasse Tyson, director of New York City's Hayden Planetarium, and an authority on just about everything we know about the universe, it's a chance to get inside the insatiably curious mind of the 94-year-old Shatner. \"What kind of magic potion is he drinking?\" deGrasse Tyson laughed. \"By the way, you can do the math, he's been alive for three billion seconds, okay? I did the math, you don't have to. So when Bill Shatner speaks, it's coming from a place way deeper than any of the rest of us can possibly match.\"",
      "And for Shatner, who never formally studied astrophysics, it's a chance to make up for what he sees as lost time. \"I feel bad about it, because that knowledge of what constitutes the construction of nature, we know so little, but the little we know is so awesome, it's so spellbinding,\" he said. \"The fact that I wasn't conscious of how spellbinding it is as a youth, I could have been much more educated about it.\"",
      "Four years ago, Shatner became the oldest person ever to go into space, and he's been globetrotting ever since.",
      "Shatner asked deGrasse Tyson, \"Do you still scratch your head in awe?\"",
      "\"Every night I look up,\" he replied.",
      "So, is this the dynamic between the two \u2013 Shatner with questions, deGrasse Tyson with answers? \"Unfortunately, that's the way it is,\" Shatner replied.",
      "\"No, but he's got wisdom and life experience that I value, and I respect,\" deGrasse Tyson added. \"So, I'm here to grab some of that.\"",
      "As for Shatner's take on deGrasse Tyson, \"He has access, both because of his mentality, and the books and the studies, so he's into modern-day mysticism, which is the study of the stars and how it works and what goes on.\"",
      "\"You call that modern-day mysticism?\" deGrasse Tyson asked.",
      "\"Because you don't know for sure that what you're saying is absolutely truth until more experimentation.\"",
      "\"That's the frontier. We're scratching our heads.\"",
      "\"Exactly,\" said Shatner. \"So, he is an explorer. He is an explorer. He is on that verge. He teaches that. And it is mystical in every sense of the word.\"",
      "I asked, \"This is where I think you are politely and respectfully in disagreement, because Dr. deGrasse Tyson will say something like, 'We know what the speed of light is and what the fastest things can move is.' And you say, 'Well, we'll see about that!'\"",
      "\"Yeah, we've had that argument,\" said Shatner.",
      "DeGrasse Tyson seems just fine not knowing everything \u2013 for example, what was going on before the Big Bang, and the profound idea of somethingness coming from nothingness. \"We don't know. Next question!\" he said. \"No, as a scientist, you need to be comfortable in the presence of a question that does not yet have an answer.\"",
      "Of course, the ultimate question, the one we really don't know definitively, is where we go when we die, something that Shatner, as he loses friends and colleagues, finds himself considering more often. \"You know, I vary between the fear of death, my fear,\" he said. But, \"I have so much love around me. I have a wife, and children, and grandchildren. I even have two great-grandchildren. And I have two great dogs. I've had dogs all my life, all my adult life. And so, all my life is fertile, is vibrant. And I don't want to leave it. And that's the sadness. I don't want to go.\"",
      "\"Are you curious, though, about what you will find out?\" I asked.",
      "\"Not enough to die!\" he laughed.",
      "\"Even your curiosity has a limit?\"",
      "\"Right. It stops right there!\"",
      "So, William Shatner's famous curiosity bumps up against the edge of his universe. And as the show wrapped up in Seattle, Shatner closed things out with one of his unique spoken-word songs, accompanied by trumpeter Keyon Harrold.",
      "Do not grow oldno matter how long you live.Do not forget painbut somehow learn to forgive.",
      "The universe, it turns out, might be a bit absurd, but what an interesting ride!",

    "published": "Sun, 16 Nov 2025 09:42:46 -0500",
    "summary": "The composer and lyricist behind such hits as \"Godspell,\" \"Pippin\" and \"Wicked\" talks about the price of his early success, and why he almost left composing Broadway musicals for good.",
    "story": [
      "When songwriter Stephen Schwartz sits at the piano, he feels the music. \"When I was a kid and playing my Beethoven \u2026 I would play that bar over and over again, and cry. It's very embarrassing! Beethoven, living in a world that has nothing to do with ours, but he writes, and it speaks to us across the centuries.\"",
      "Schwartz knows a little something about speaking to audiences. He's the composer and lyricist of \"Wicked,\" the blockbuster stage musical-turned-two-part movie musical. Part two, \"Wicked: For Good,\" opens Nov. 21.",
      "The prequel to the classic \"Wizard of Oz,\" \"Wicked\" tells the story of Elphaba (played by Cynthia Erivo), who grows up to be the Wicked Witch of the West. The bubbly Glinda (played by Ariana Grande) becomes the Good Witch of the North.",
      "Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo perform \"Popular,\" from \"Wicked\":",
      "Schwartz has been telling stories through song for over five decades. \"My sort of glib joke where people say, like, how do you write a song? I just say, tell the truth and make it rhyme,\" he said. \"And if I can be honest enough, then that'll speak to other people.\"",
      "\"Wicked\" opened 22 years ago, making it the fourth-longest-running Broadway show in history.",
      "And where was Schwartz on the night of Oct. 30, 2003? \"Well, that was the opening night of 'Wicked' on Broadway, and therefore, I was not at the Gershwin Theatre, because I don't go to my own openings,\" he said. \"It's too nerve-wracking for me. I don't like the opening night parties where everybody is just waiting to hear what reviews come in.\"",
      "Kristin Chenoweth originated the role of Glinda on Broadway. She and Schwartz have reunited for the recently-opened new musical, \"The Queen of Versailles.\" \"I'm working with my Rodgers and Hammerstein; it's just packed into one person,\" she said of Schwartz. \"There's not five of him. There's one. He's original. He's singular. And there's nobody else like him.\"",
      "Schwartz grew up on New York's Long Island. A prodigy, he attended the prestigious Juilliard School as a high schooler. Just after college, he collaborated on the musical that became his first big hit, \"Godspell.\" The musical features a ragtag group who help Jesus tell various parables.",
      "I asked, \"It's a musical with Jesus as a central character. You're a Jewish guy. Did you think, well, alright, I'll give it a go?\"",
      "Schwartz replied, \"I think one of the things that made 'Godspell' work was the fact that I didn't know a lot of those stories. So, I think I came to it with a kind of fresh eye about not preaching to the converted, so to speak.\"",
      "In 1972, Schwartz brought that fresh eye to the story of \"Pippin,\" a young man searching for the meaning of life in the Middle Ages. Hit #3, 1974's \"The Magic Show,\" starred magician Doug Henning. Schwartz was 3-for-3, with all three playing simultaneously on Broadway when he was just 27 \u2013 a theatrical trifecta that Schwartz described as \"very dizzying.\"",
      "\"The truth is, when you are very young and unprepared for a success, it can be difficult to handle,\" he said. \"It was difficult for me to handle. I think I got very, quite full of myself. I got kind of difficult to deal with. I kept thinking, well, why isn't everybody just doing exactly what I say? I lost somewhat the ability to collaborate. You know, it took some failures to kind of learn how to deal with both success and failure.\"",
      "The failures came in short order, a \"four-fecta\" of flops\": \"Working\" (which closed after a month), and 'Rags\" (which closed after four performances), while \"The Baker's Wife\" and \"Children of Eden\" never made it to Broadway.",
      "I noted, \"You haven't always been critic's choice.\"",
      "\"I'm almost never a critic's choice,\" Schwartz said.",
      "Why? \"I have no idea,\" he said. \"I'll be frank about it, you know, I wish I got Steve Sondheim's reviews.\"",
      "\"But listen, as great as he was, his shows didn't run the way yours have.\"",
      "\"Yeah, the grass is always greener,\" Schwartz replied.",
      "In the early 1990s Schwartz stepped away from the piano. Had he quit Broadway? \"Absolutely, a hundred percent,\" he said.",
      "\"Did you worry that you were out of juice?\" I asked.",
      "\"Totally, yeah. And in the '90s, I actually went back to school. I was pursuing a degree in psychology. I was gonna become a therapist.\"",
      "Studying to become a therapist turned out to be quite therapeutic. \"I think that time away reminded me of how to behave myself and how to collaborate and how to deal with other people, and not just come in like a bull in a china shop,\" he said.",
      "When he returned to songwriting, it was not for Broadway, though, but for Hollywood, writing songs for \"Pocahontas,\" \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame,\" \"Enchanted,\" and music and lyrics for \"The Prince of Egypt.\" He picked up three Academy Awards along the way.",
      "\"The Colors of the Wind,\" from \"Pocahontas\":",
      "But Stephen Schwartz's home will always be the stage. \"I feel so blessed and so fortunate that work I've done has this ongoing life that I know is gonna keep going when I'm not here on this planet anymore,\" he said. \"Listen, I'm 77 years old, and they still let me do this!\"",

      "The Vatican shared the spotlight with Hollywood on Saturday as Pope Leo XIV hosted dozens of stars, including Cate Blanchett, Spike Lee and Monica Bellucci for a special audience celebrating the power of cinema.",
      "The event, organized by the Vatican's culture ministry, took place in a frescoed Vatican audience hall. Leo called on the attending artists to use their art to include marginalized voices and praised film to console and challenge audiences.",
      "\"It articulates the questions that dwell within us, and sometimes, even provokes tears that we did not know we needed to express,\" Leo said.",
      "The first U.S.-born pope also acknowledged the financial difficulties facing movie theaters. He said institutions should not give up, but \"cooperate in affirming the social and cultural value\" of theaters, drawing applause from the audience.",
      "\"His speech was beautiful and very inspiring, about hope and our work in cinema. We're glad we came,\" said Judd Apatow, who attended the audience with his wife and fellow Hollywood star Leslie Mann.",
      "\"It was so inspiring,\" Mann added.",
      "Leo spent nearly an hour greeting guests and making conversation with each attendee. Lee, a basketball lover, gifted the pontiff a New York Knicks jersey that featured the No. 14 and Leo's name on the back. Leo may be a known Chicago Bulls fan, but Lee said he told the pope that the Knicks' current roster includes three players from Villanova University, the Holy Father's alma mater. Lee said Leo's words about film were \"very, very moving.\"",
      "Pope Francis held similar audiences with artists and comedians. The audiences are part of the Vatican's efforts to reach out beyond the Catholic Church to engage with the secular world.",
      "A pope who \"grew up with cinema\"",
      "Leo is the first American-born Pope and grew up during Hollywood's heyday. Earlier this week, he listed his four favorite movies: \"It's a Wonderful Life,\" \"The Sound of Music,\" \"Ordinary People,\" and \"Life Is Beautiful,\" all classics that celebrate love and hope in the face of darkness. Leo will also be the subject of his own movie, a documentary from the Vatican that traces his life from Chicago to St. Peter's.",
      "\"He is a pope who grew up with television and grew up with cinema, and it's a natural (medium) to tell his story,\" said Monsignor Paul Tighe, the Vatican's culture secretary, in a conversation with CBS Saturday Morning.",
      "Tighe said the large group of filmmakers and actors was pulled together during the last three months. Vatican officials used contacts in Hollywood, including Martin Scorsese, to help craft the list of attendees. The hardest part, Tighe said, was convincing Hollywood agents that the invitation wasn't a hoax. Tighe told CBS Saturday Morning that he hopes the event shows that the Church embraces the arts, instead of just tolerating them.",
      "\"We have to trust that the artist, even when he or she is being provocative, is trying to wake us up, grab our attention, and make us think about things that are important,\" Tighe said.",

    "story": [
      "Singapore authorities charged an Australian man Friday for rushing film star Ariana Grande at the Asia premiere of \"Wicked: For Good.\"",
      "Grande and other stars were attending the opening night of the film at Universal Studios in Singapore when the man, identified by court papers as Johnson Wen, 26, jumped a barricade and rushed the actor.",
      "Wen was charged with \"being a public nuisance,\" Singapore court documents posted online showed. Wen represented himself and said he would plead guilty, according to the documents. He is to appear in court again on Monday.",
      "Viral video clips show the man wrapping around a shocked Grande before he jumps up and down and waves to the crowd. Grande's co-star Cynthia Erivo then rushes to her defense, jumping between Wen and Grande and shoving him away. He was then grabbed by security guards and put back over the barricade. Footage shows Erivo and others on the red carpet comforting Grande.",
      "After the incident, Wen shared video on Instagram and thanked Grande for \"letting (him) jump on the Yellow Carpet\" with her.",
      "If sentenced, Wen faces a $1,500 fine, three months in jail, or both.",
      "Singapore's public prosecutions office could not immediately be reached for comment.",
      "The movie launch went ahead on Thursday night. \"Wicked: For Good\" will be released in the United States on Nov. 21.",
      "Grande and Erivo have been inseparable during the movie musical's press tours. In December 2024, Erivo told \"CBS Mornings\" that the duo made a pact early in production to take care of and support each other.",
      "\"Before we started shooting both of us had a conversation about making sure that we would take care of each other and make the space that we needed for each other, and take, you know, give each other what we needed, be generous with each other in this thing, because we knew it was a big undertaking,\" Erivo said. \"We knew we had a big responsibility, but we knew neither of us could really do that alone.\"",
      "Grande, 32, began her career as a teen on Broadway before embarking on a hugely successful pop career. At perhaps the height of her meteoric pop fame in 2017, one of her concerts was bombed. The Manchester Arena attack killed 22 people, wounded more than 1,000 and left Grande with PTSD.",

    "story": [
      "It's become nearly impossible for people to tell the difference between music generated by artificial intelligence and that created by humans, according to a survey released Wednesday.",
      "The polling firm Ipsos asked 9,000 people to listen to two clips of AI-generated music and one of human-made music in a survey conducted for France-based streaming platform Deezer.",
      "\"Ninety-seven percent could not distinguish between music entirely generated by AI and human-created music,\" said Deezer in a statement.",
      "The survey was conducted between October 6 and 10 in eight countries: Brazil, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands and the United States.",
      "Deezer said more than half of the respondents felt uncomfortable at not being able to tell the difference.",
      "Pollsters also asked broader questions about the impact of AI, with 51 percent saying the technology would lead to more low-quality music on streaming platforms and almost two-thirds believing it will lead to a loss of creativity.",
      "\"The survey results clearly show that people care about music and want to know if they're listening to AI or human made tracks or not,\" Deezer CEO Alexis Lanternier said in a statement.",
      "Deezer said there's not only been a surge in AI-generated content being uploaded to its platform, but it's attracting listeners as well.",
      "In January, one in 10 of the tracks streamed each day were completely AI-generated. Ten months later, that percentage has climbed to over one in three, or nearly 40,000 per day.",
      "Eighty percent of survey respondents wanted fully AI-generated music clearly labelled for listeners.",
      "Deezer is the only major music-streaming platform that systematically labels completely AI-generated content for users.",

      "Cleto Escobedo III, longtime bandleader of the \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" show, has died, Jimmy Kimmel announced on Tuesday. He was 59 years old.",
      "The late-night talk show host\u00a0mourned the death of one of his oldest friends \u2014 whom he met when he was 9 years old \u2014 writing on Instagram that \"[t]o say that we are heartbroken is an understatement.\"",
      "\"The fact that we got to work together every day is a dream neither of us could ever have imagined would come true. Cherish your friends and please keep Cleto's wife, children and parents in your prayers,\" Kimmel wrote.",
      "Escobedo and Kimmel met as children in Las Vegas, where they grew up across the street from each other. Kimmel wrote on Tuesday that they were \"inseparable.\"",
      "\"We just met one day on the street, and there were a few kids on the street, and him and I just became really close friends, and we kind of had the same sense of humor. We just became pals, and we've been pals ever since,\" Escobedo said in a 2022 interview for Texas Tech University's Southwest Collection oral history archive, disclosing that he and Kimmel were huge fans of David Letterman as kids.",
      "Escobedo would grow up to become a professional musician, specializing in the saxophone, and touring with Earth, Wind and Fire's Phillip Bailey and Paula Abdul. He recorded with Marc Anthony, Tom Scott and Take Six. When Kimmel got his own ABC late-night talk show in 2003, he lobbied for Escobedo to lead the house band on \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\"",
      "\"Of course I wanted great musicians, but I wanted somebody I had chemistry with,\" Kimmel told WABC in 2015. \"And there's nobody in my life I have better chemistry with than him.\"",
      "In 2016, on Escobedo's 50th birthday, Kimmel dedicated a segment to his friend, recalling pranks with a BB gun or mooning people from the back of his mom's car.",
      "\"Cleto had a bicycle with a sidecar attached to it. We called it the side hack. I would get in the sidecar and then Cleto would drive me directly into garbage cans and bushes,\" Kimmel recalled.",
      "News of Escobedo's death comes after Thursday's episode of \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" was abruptly canceled. David Duchovny, Joe Keery and Madison Beer were set as the show's guests. The date and cause of Escobedo's death weren't immediately known.",
      "Escobedo's father is also a member of the Kimmel house band and plays tenor and alto saxophones. In January 2022, the father-son duo celebrated nearly two decades of performing on-screen together.",
      "\"Jimmy asked me, 'Who are we going to get in the band?' I said, 'Well, my normal guys,' and he knew my guys because he had been coming to see us and stuff before he was famous, just to come support me and whatever. I'd invite him to gigs, and if he didn't have anything to do he'd come check it out, so he knew my guys,\" Escobedo recounted in the 2022 interview. \"Then he just said, 'Hey, man, what about your dad? Wouldn't that be kind of cool?' I was like, 'That would be way cool.'\"",
      "In the 2022 interview, Escobedo said the bandleader job had one major benefit: family time.",
      "\"Touring and all that stuff is fun, but it's more of a young man's game. Touring, also, too, is not really conducive for family life. I've learned over the years, being on the road and watching how hard it is, leaving your kids for so long. Sometimes they're babies; you come back and then they're talking, it's like, 'What?'\" he said.",
      "Escobedo's survivors also include his wife Lori and their two children.",

      "Sally Kirkland, a onetime model who turned to acting and was best known for sharing the screen with Paul Newman and Robert Redford in \"The Sting\" and her Oscar-nominated title role in the 1987 movie \"Anna,\" has died, her representative confirmed to the Associated Press. She was 84.",
      "Her representative, Michael Greene, told the AP that Kirkland died Tuesday morning at a Palm Springs hospice.",
      "Friends established a\u00a0GoFundMe\u00a0account this fall for her medical care. They said she had fractured four bones in her neck, right wrist and left hip. While recovering, she also developed infections, requiring hospitalization and rehab.",
      "Kirkland acted in such films as \"The Way We Were\" with Barbra Streisand, \"Revenge\" with Kevin Costner, \"Cold Feet\" with Keith Carradine and Tom Waits, Ron Howard's \"EDtv,\" Oliver Stone's \"JFK,\" \"Heatwave\" with Cicely Tyson, \"High Stakes\" with Kathy Bates, \"Bruce Almighty\" with Jim Carrey and the 1991 TV movie \"The Haunted,\" about a family dealing with paranormal activity. She had a cameo in Mel Brooks' \"Blazing Saddles.\"",
      "Her biggest role was in 1987's \"Anna\" as a fading Czech movie star remaking her life in the United States and mentoring a younger actor, Paulina Porizkova. Kirkland won a Golden Globe and earned an Oscar nomination along with Cher in \"Moonstruck,\" Glenn Close in \"Fatal Attraction,\" Holly Hunter in \"Broadcast News\" and Meryl Streep in \"Ironweed.\" (The Oscar went to Cher.)",
      "\"Kirkland is one of those performers whose talent has been an open secret to her fellow actors but something of a mystery to the general public,\" a Los Angeles Times critic wrote in\u00a0her review for \"Anna.\" \"There should be no confusion about her identity after this blazing comet of a performance.\"",
      "Kirkland's small-screen acting credits include stints on \"Criminal Minds,\" \"Roseanne,\" \"Head Case\" and she was a series regular on the TV shows \"Valley of the Dolls\" and \"Charlie's Angels.\"",
      "Born in New York City, Kirkland's mother was a fashion editor at Vogue and Life magazine who encouraged her daughter to start modeling at age 5. Kirkland graduated from the American Academy of Dramatic Arts and studied with Philip Burton, Richard Burton's mentor, and Lee Strasberg, the master of the Method school of acting. An early breakout was appearing in Andy Warhol's \"13 Most Beautiful Women\" in 1964. She appeared naked as a kidnapped rape victim in Terrence McNally's off-Broadway \"Sweet Eros.\"",
      "Some of her early roles were Shakespeare, including the lovesick Helena in \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" for New York Shakespeare Festival producer Joseph Papp and Miranda in an off-Broadway production of \"The Tempest.\"",
      "\"I don't think any actor can really call him or herself an actor unless he or she puts in time with Shakespeare,\" she told\u00a0the Los Angeles Times in 1991. \"It shows up, it always shows up in the work, at some point, whether it's just not being able to have breath control, or not being able to appreciate language as poetry and music, or not having the power that Shakespeare automatically instills you with when you take on one of his characters.\"",
      "Kirkland was a member of several New Age groups, taught Insight Transformational Seminars and was a longtime member of the affiliated Church of the Movement of Spiritual Inner Awareness, whose followers believe in soul transcendence.",
      "She reached a career nadir while riding nude on a pig in the 1969 film \"Futz,\" which\u00a0a Guardian reviewer\u00a0dubbed the worst film he had ever seen. \"It was about a man who fell in love with a pig, and even by the dismal standards of the era, it was dismal,\" he wrote.",
      "Kirkland was also known for disrobing for so many other roles and social causes that Time magazine dubbed her\u00a0\"the latter-day Isadora Duncan of nudothespianism.\"",

Offensive words alone are protected, but when behavior disrupts a public event or risks violence, the Starkville Police Department will take steps to help maintain safety and security,\" the police said in a statement to CBS News, adding that the state could impose enhanced penalties if a violation meets the criteria for bias-motivated or discriminatory reason. The incident remains under investigation.",

    "story": [
      "Like many of her Democratic colleagues, GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia is urging Congress to act quickly to address the spiraling cost of health care for millions of Americans who could soon see huge spikes in their insurance premiums.",
      "\"Now that the [Affordable Care Act] tax credits are expiring, which the Democrats did put in place \u2014 and they set the expiration date for this year \u2014 I see a financial crisis for Americans,\" Greene told \"CBS Mornings\" in an exclusive interview Friday. \"And so on this issue, I don't see political party lines.\"",
      "About 22 million lower- and middle-income Americans rely on the tax credits to reduce their health insurance costs when they buy policies through the Affordable Care Act's marketplaces. During the longest government shutdown in history, Democrats pushed Republicans to extend the subsidies as a condition for reopening the government, but the shutdown ultimately ended Wednesday without a deal to extend the tax credits. Democrats were promised, however, that a vote on the tax credits will be held next month.",
      "But House Democrats took notice of Greene's views on health care. House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries, asked by \"CBS Evening News\" co-anchor John Dickerson if he had found any Republican allies during the 43-day impasse, replied,\"Three words \u2014 Marjorie Taylor Greene.\"",
      "\"She's been very clear that this health care crisis is not made up, it's real, Republicans have no health care plan, and that Democrats are correct in fighting to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits,\" Jeffries continued.",
      "And top Republicans noticed, too. Earlier this week, President Trump said of Greene after she criticized him for focusing on foreign policy, rather than high prices at home, \"I don't know what happened to Marjorie \u2014 nice woman, but I don't know what happened. She's lost her way, I think.\"",
      "\"I haven't lost my way \u2014 I'm for the American people only,\" Greene told \"CBS Mornings.\" \"I am America first and I make no apologies about that to anyone.\" But she added that the rapidly rising health insurance costs had affected her personally.",
      "\"As far as health insurance is concern it hurt my own family. Back in 2010, the Democrats passed Obamacare, and in 2014 when it went into effect my family's health insurance went from $800 to over $2,400 a month, and we've seen the health insurance industry prices just go up and up,\" Greene said.",

    "story": [
      "There is a new FDA-approved eye drop on the market called Vizz. This once-daily, prescription eye drop is said to help combat presbyopia, otherwise known as age-related blurry vision.",
      "Drugmaker LENZ Therapeutics touts that with just one drop in each eye, a person's vision will improve for up to 10 hours, so they won't have to wear reading glasses.",
      "Dr. Robert Johnson Jr. has been running Johnson Family Eyecare in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, for 46 years, and he explains that these eye drops basically act like a focus on a camera lens.",
      "\"Vizz and the drug that has come before it, Vuity, have both worked on the same structural function; they cause your iris, or the colored part of your eye, to get smaller and smaller,\" Dr. Johnson explained. \"As your pupil gets smaller, it becomes apparent that it is like looking through a pinhole, and your depth of focus therefore increases.\"",
      "Vizz is priced at $79 a month for 25 doses and $198 for three months, 75 doses, but prices may vary at different pharmacies. There are some side effects, including eye redness, headaches, and dimmed vision.",
      "Dr. Johnson cautions that while these new eye drops may help some, they are not a cure-all for presbyopia, but rather, they are just another good tool in the fight against age-related blurry vision.",
      "\"It will work much better for the younger, 40, 50, 55-year-old patients than it will for the 60, 65, 70-year-old patients,\" Dr. Johnson said. \"Because they have less of a need to focus. By the time you get to be my age, your natural ability to focus is all gone. Therefore, the pupil would have to be made obsessively smaller and smaller. And if that pupil becomes too small, we begin to lose the amount of light that gets into the eye, and now you are going to have a 70-year-old who can read, but who can't drive when the sun goes down.\"",
      "Dr. Johnson advises those interested to consult their eye care professional to determine if these eye drops may be right for you.",

    "story": [
      "New Delhi - Authorities in India's capital have urged elementary schools to hold classes online, banned construction and urged people to work from home as the annual plague of air pollution hit the \"severe\" category in a health warning system for the first time this season. For the first time, the toxic air has drawn protests against the government, and a warning for people with health issues to simply leave Delhi if they can.",
      "The severe designation indicates potentially serious health impacts for people with impaired immune systems, and negative affects even for healthy people, according to India's Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).",
      "The emergency measures were announced after Delhi's average Air Quality Index (AQI) sharply rose to 425. An AQI between 400 and 450 is categorized as \"severe\" and, as a norm, requires authorities to implement emergency measures under the government's graded pollution response plan.",
      "Air quality in India's capital deteriorates sharply every year around this time due to a number of factors, including farm waste being burned off and seasonal climatic conditions \u2013 but activists say authorities have not done enough to contain the air pollution.",
      "In a first, hundreds of people protested against the bad air quality at Delhi's India Gate over the weekend.",
      "Several protesters wore gas masks as a symbolic act of protest and held up banners, including one that read: \"I miss breathing.\"",
      "Earlier this month, one of the city's top pulmonologists, Dr. Gopi Chand Khilnani, urged people with health problems who can afford to temporarily leave Delhi to do so.",
      "\"Everybody cannot afford to leave Delhi, because it is not simple, Khilnani told The Indian Express. \"But those who have chronic lung disease or chronic heart disease, those who are on oxygen, and those who have the opportunity and ability to go abroad or to less polluted places, I very safely advise them to leave Delhi for 6-8 weeks from now, so as to protect themselves from the distress of breathlessness, the requirement of oxygen, and so on and so forth.\"",
      "The toxic air is affecting the health of people of the city regardless of underlying health problems, with many Delhi residents complaining of breathing problems and eye irritation this week.",
      "\"Every breath in Delhi NCR [National Capital Region] today comes with a major health cost \u2014 we're seeing more patients struggling with breathlessness, asthma, and heart problems, especially among children, the elderly, and those with chronic diseases,\" Dr. Harshal Ramesh Salve, at the Centre for Community Medicine at the prestigious All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), told a group of journalists on Monday.",
      "A recent report by the Lancet medical journal - Countdown on Health and Climate Change 2025 \u2013 carried a grim warning for India: The country recorded around 1.72 million deaths from outdoor air pollution in 2022, a staggering 38 percent rise since 2010.",

    "summary": "The Federal Aviation Administration says it is lifting all restrictions on commercial flights that were imposed during the government shutdown.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Aviation Administration said Sunday it was lifting all restrictions on commercial flights that were imposed at 40 major airports during the country's longest government shutdown.",
      "Airlines were given permission to resume their regular flight schedules beginning Monday at 6 a.m. EST, the agency said.",
      "The announcement was made in a joint statement by Transportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy and FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford.",
      "Citing safety concerns as staffing shortages grew at air traffic control facilities during the shutdown, the FAA issued an unprecedented order to limit traffic in the skies. It had been in place since Nov. 7, affecting thousands of flights across the country.",
      "Impacted airports included large hubs in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and Atlanta.",
      "The flight cuts started at 4% and later grew to 6% before the FAA on Friday rolled the restrictions back to 3%, citing continued improvements in air traffic controller staffing since the record 43-day shutdown ended on Nov. 12.",
      "The number of flights canceled this weekend was at its lowest point since the order took effect and was well below the 3% cuts FAA was requiring for Saturday and Sunday. Data from aviation analytics firm Cirium showed that less than 1% of all flights were canceled this weekend. The flight tracking website FlightAware said 149 flights were cut Sunday and 315 were canceled on Saturday.",
      "The FAA statement said an agency safety team recommended the order be rescinded after \"detailed reviews of safety trends and the steady decline of staffing-trigger events in air traffic control facilities.\"",
      "The statement said the FAA \"is aware of reports of non-compliance by carriers over the course of the emergency order. The agency is reviewing and assessing enforcement options.\" It did not elaborate.",
      "Cancellations hit their highest point Nov. 9, when airlines cut more than 2,900 flights because of the FAA order, ongoing controller shortages and severe weather in parts of the country. Conditions began to improve throughout last week as more controllers returned to work amid news that Congress was close to a deal to end the shutdown. That progress also prompted the FAA to pause plans for further rate increases.",
      "The agency had initially aimed for a 10% reduction in flights. Duffy had said worrisome safety data showed the move was necessary to ease pressure on the aviation system and help manage worsening staffing shortages at air traffic control facilities as the shutdown entered its second month and flight disruptions began to pile up.",
      "Air traffic controllers were among the federal employees who had to continue working without pay throughout the shutdown. They missed two paychecks during the impasse.",
      "Duffy hasn't shared the specific safety data that prompted the cuts, but he cited reports during the shutdown of planes getting too close in the air, more runway incursions and pilot concerns about controllers' responses.",
      "Airline leaders have expressed optimism that operations would rebound in time for the Thanksgiving travel period after the FAA lifted its order.",

    "published": "Sun, 16 Nov 2025 09:15:21 -0500",
    "summary": "Prediction markets, like Kalshi, which allow people to place wagers on everything from elections and sports to the anticipated bridesmaids at Taylor Swift's wedding, are booming. But this burgeoning business model is coming under scrutiny.",
    "story": [
      "Joel Holsinger just quit his day job to bet on the words that famous people, like White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, might say in public. \"I thought there was a very high likelihood she would bring up 'Thanksgiving' in relation to the shutdown,\" he said.",
      "From his computer, the 26-year-old makes about $3,000 a week trading on the prediction market Kalshi.",
      "\"She did not say Thanksgiving, so we were out $700 yesterday,\" Holsinger said.",
      "That hurts, right? \"Surprisingly for me, doesn't hurt really much,\" Holsinger replied. \"I have had times where I've lost, for example, like, $6,000 on a bad trade, but also the inverse of that; I've made $11,000 on a trade, and so, you know, it's just ups-and-downs.\"",
      "The live streaming influencer is one of millions of people flocking to prediction markets like Kalshi, PredictIt and Polymarket where you can wager on just about anything.",
      "Tarek Mansour and Luana Lopes Lara are former Wall Street traders-turned-co-founders of Kalshi. \"A prediction market is like the stock market, but instead of buying and selling companies, you're buying 'yes' and 'no' on whether something is going to happen or not,\" Mansour said. \"So, it could be whether Mamdani was going to win the last New York mayor's race, or there's going to be a hurricane in Florida next month.\"",
      "Lopes Lara said, \"People can make money on what they know, actually monetize their knowledge, monetize their hobby, because everyone is an expert on something.\"",
      "Kalshi made a name for itself in the 2024 election. The presidential race looked close, unless you were keeping an eye on Kalshi, which called the race well before the TV networks did. \"It was like Kalshi, then Fox, then CNN,\" said Mansour. \"It was crazy.\"",
      "Twelve months later, Kalshi was the talk of another election: The New York City mayor's race. As Democratic candidate Zohran Mamdani told the crowd on Oct. 26, \"You see the Kalshi odds that have our chances of victory in the 90s.\"",
      "Kalshi's numbers are not polling data; they represent what people think is going to happen. \"It's people putting money on what they think is going to happen, and then the wisdom of the crowds in the markets come up with the probabilities of who is going to win,\" said Lopes Lara.",
      "And you can bet on (or Kalshi says \"invest in\") more than 3,500 markets on the company's platform, like who will be a bridesmaid in Taylor Swift's wedding.",
      "I asked, \"How do I know that someone close to Taylor Swift, or Taylor Swift herself, isn't participating in a way that will make her outcome more favorable and let her, you know, take home a little extra cash?\"",
      "Lopes Lara replied, \"Kalshi is a federally-regulated, fully-compliant exchange, and we have systems in place to monitor for any suspicious or unusual activity. We also have a lot of trading prohibitions in place.\"",
      "According to Mansour, \"There really hasn't been any issues.\"",
      "Prediction markets are booming. The owner of the New York Stock Exchange is investing $2 billion in Polymarket, and the sports betting platform FanDuel will launch its own prediction market next month.",
      "In fact, when it's not an election, the majority of the money traded on Kalshi is not on politics or culture \u2013 it's on sports. Jonathan Cohen, author of \"Losing Big,\" has chronicled the rise of sports betting in the U.S. Regarding Kalshi, he said, \"You can bet on things that a traditional Sportsbook would offer you.\"",
      "\"Kalshi says this is an investment. You don't buy that?\"",
      "\"No,\" said Cohen. \"The New England Patriots are not more likely to win their game because I bought a contract for them to win the game. It is a speculative instrument purely for my own use and my own entertainment, which to me qualifies it as gambling rather than investing.\"",
      "But Kalshi is not regulated like gambling. Online sports betting is only legal in 31 states; Kalshi is available in all 50. \u00a0The Biden administration tried to prevent Kalshi from offering sports markets. Then, when President Trump returned to the White House, his administration vowed to break with \"past hostility\" \u2013 and earlier this year, the president's son, Donald Jr, became a strategic advisor to both Kalshi and its main rival, Polymarket.",
      "Asked why Kalshi made Donald Trump Jr. a strategic advisor, Mansour replied, \"We have a lot of advisors, um, and they span across the board, across different functions. But really, this is all about growing this industry, the prediction market industry, that a lot of people really believe in.\"",
      "I asked, \"What kind of advice does he give you?\"",
      "\"So, it really is, again, about growing prediction markets,\" Mansour said. \"You know, he believes in prediction markets. We believe in prediction markets. A lot of people believe in prediction markets, and it's really about go-to-market and expansion plans.\"",
      "\"Does he come to meetings? How much do you pay him? What's his role? I mean, this is the son of the president.\"",
      "\"We, again, I mean, we have a lot of advisors,\" Mansour replied. \"And whether it's our investors, whether it's, uh, people that we really trust and respect, whether \u2013 \"",
      "\"But he's not just any advisor; he has a direct line to the White House,\" I said.",
      "\"We have a lot of advisors,\" said Mansour.",
      "Kalshi is embroiled in legal battles with several states, like Massachusetts, that say Kalshi's sports markets amount to \"unlawful sports wagering.\"",
      "Are the states wrong? \"We are confident in what we're doing,\" said Mansour. \"We're confident in our position from the law, and we're also confident in the fact that, you know, customers are actually finding a lot of value in basically what we're offering. So, I would say yes.\"",
      "But for now, if you are over the age of 18, you can bet on just about anything, anywhere, any time.",
      "Cohen said, \"It's not enough to, like, like Taylor Swift anymore. You have to use your knowledge of Taylor Swift to, like, try to make money off of how many streams she's going to get in a month. Or it's not enough to, I don't know, even like politics anymore; you have to gamble on politics. You have to make money on politics.",
      "\"That, to me, it seems like sort of the canary in the coal mine of like a 'gamblification' of American culture that I think is sort of still on the rise,\" he said, \"and we might not like what that looks like when it fully arrives.\"",

    "story": [
      "Disney and YouTube TV reached a new deal to bring channels like ABC and ESPN back to the Google-owned live streaming platform Friday, ending a blackout for customers that dragged on for about two weeks.",
      "\"As part of the new deal, Disney's full suite of networks and stations \u2013 including ESPN and ABC \u2013 have already begun to be restored to YouTube TV subscribers,\" The Walt Disney Co. said in a statement. \"We are pleased that our networks have been restored in time for fans to enjoy the many great programming options this weekend, including college football.\"",
      "Disney content had gone dark on YouTube TV the night of Oct. 30, after the two sides failed to reach a new licensing deal. In the days that followed, YouTube TV subscribers were left without Disney channels on the platform \u2014 notably disrupting coverage of top U.S. college football matchups and professional sports games, among other news and entertainment offerings.",
      "Beyond ESPN and ABC, other Disney-owned content removed from YouTube TV during the impasse included channels like NatGeo, FX, Freeform, SEC Network, ACC Network and more.",
      "At the time the carriage dispute reached its boiling point, YouTube TV said that Disney was proposing terms that would be too costly, resulting in higher prices and fewer choices for its subscribers. And the platform accused Disney of using the blackout \"as a negotiating tactic\" \u2014 claiming that the move also benefited Disney's own streaming products like Hulu + Live TV and Fubo.",
      "Disney, meanwhile, said that YouTube TV had refused to pay fair rates for its channels. The California entertainment giant also accused Google of \"using its market dominance to eliminate competition.\" And executives blasted the platform for pulling content \"prior to the midnight expiration\" of their deal last month.",
      "On Nov. 3, Disney also asked YouTube TV to restore ABC programming for Election Day on Nov. 4 to put \"the public interest first.\" But YouTube TV said this temporary reprieve would confuse customers \u2014 and instead proposed that the entertainment giant agree to restore both its ABC and ESPN channels while the two sides continued negotiations.",
      "The blackout marked the latest in a growing list of licensing disputes in today's streaming world. And consumers often pay the price.",
      "From sports events to awards shows, live programming that was once reserved for broadcast has increasingly made its way into the streaming world over the years, as more and more consumers ditch traditional cable or satellite TV subscriptions for content they can get online. But amid growing competition, renewing carriage agreements can also mean tense contract negotiations \u2014 and at times service disruptions.",
      "YouTube TV and Disney have been down this road before. In 2021, YouTube TV subscribers also briefly lost access to all Disney content on the platform after a similar contract breakdown between the two companies. That outage lasted less than two days, with the companies eventually reaching an agreement.",
      "Meanwhile, YouTube TV has removed other networks from its platform after expired agreements. Spanish-language broadcaster Univision has been unavailable on YouTube TV since Sept. 30, for example. At the time, its parent company TelevisaUnivision decried Google's move \u2014 noting it would strip \"millions of Hispanic viewers of the Spanish-language news, sports, and entertainment they rely on every day\" and called on the platform to reverse course.",
      "YouTube TV's base subscription plan costs $82.99 per month \u2014 which, beyond Disney content, currently includes live TV offerings from networks like NBC, CBS, Fox, PBS and more. The platform previously said it would give subscribers a $20 credit if its dispute with Disney lasted \"an extended period of time\" \u2014 which it reportedly allowed customers to start claiming on Nov. 9.",
      "Disney also doles out live TV through both traditional broadcasting and its own lineup of streaming platforms. ESPN launched its own streamer earlier this year, starting at $29.99 a month.

    "story": [
      "President Trump exempted foods like beef, coffee and bananas from his sweeping country-by-country tariffs on Friday, as his administration grapples with cost-of-living frustrations and\u00a0quickly rising prices for some types of food.",
      "The new exemption covers a range of tropical products that are often imported to the United States, including coffee, tea, bananas, mangoes, avocados, coconuts, pineapples, cocoa and spices such as nutmeg, according to an executive order. It also covers beef, oranges and tomatoes.",
      "The White House said Mr. Trump decided to exempt the products on Friday because he's made \"substantial progress\" in negotiating trade deals with other countries. A day earlier, Mr. Trump announced trade frameworks with four Latin American countries \u2014 Argentina, Guatemala, El Salvador and Ecuador \u2014 that included relief for food that isn't widely produced in the U.S.",
      "The food products will no longer be covered by the \"reciprocal\" tariffs that Mr. Trump has imposed on most U.S. trading partners, which range from 10% to 40% or more. Some types of food could still be impacted by other forms of tariffs.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters Friday the tariff exemptions should cause prices to go down, and they mostly applied to food that is \"not competitive in this country,\" like bananas.",
      "\"We don't make them in this country, so there's no protection of our industries or our food products,\" he said aboard Air Force One.",
      "The moves come as polls show that voters remain nervous about inflation and wary of Mr. Trump's approach to the issue, which helped propel him back to the White House last year.",
      "Food prices rose 3.1% in the yearlong period ending in September, well below its peak of 11.4% in 2022, according to federal data. But certain types of food have surged: Beef prices were up 12.9% year-over-year in September, banana prices were up 6.9% and roasted coffee 18.9%.",
      "Mr. Trump has insisted\u00a0costs are actually down since he took over from former President Joe Biden, and has long denied that higher tariffs could push up consumer prices \u2014 a persistent fear raised by economists.",
      "But rising beef prices have alarmed Mr. Trump, who accused foreign-owned meat packing companies earlier this month of \"driving up the price of Beef through Illicit Collusion, Price Fixing, and Price Manipulation.\"",
      "Last month, Mr. Trump said he's considering importing more beef from Argentina to help get prices down. It's a delicate issue, though, because boosting beef imports could upset U.S.-based ranchers, who are typically supportive of the president. Trade groups like the National Cattlemen's Beef Association publicly criticized the idea.",
      "Mr. Trump responded on Truth Social that ranchers \"have to get their prices down.\"",
      "\"The Cattle Ranchers, who I love, don't understand that the only reason they are doing so well, for the first time in decades, is because I put Tariffs on cattle coming into the United States,\" he wrote. \"If it weren't for me, they would be doing just as they've done for the past 20 years \u2014 Terrible!\"",

      "The Trump administration is\u00a0scrapping a proposed Biden-era rule\u00a0that would have made airlines pay customers for long waits when their flights were delayed, according to a document from the U.S. Department of Transportation.",
      "The Transportation Department on Friday\u00a0published a notice that it is officially withdrawing the proposed rule, introduced in 2024 under President Biden and then-Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. The regulation would have required airlines to pay passengers $200 to $300 for domestic delays lasting at least three hours, and up to $775 for flight delays lasting at least nine hours.",
      "The agency, which announced in September that it planned to abandon the proposal, said the notice will be published in the Federal Register on Monday. The passenger protection measure would have created \"unnecessary regulatory burdens,\" the Transportation Department said Friday.",
      "In October, a group of Democratic senators defended the regulation in a letter to the Trump administration, calling it a \"common-sense proposal\" that would have held airlines accountable for their mistakes. They noted that delays can place a financial strain on families when they are forced to rebook flights or secure overnight accommodations.",
      "Customers in the U.S. are entitled to refunds for canceled flights, but no similar protections are in place for delays.",
      "The agency on Friday explained its rationale for ditching the measure, saying the move would \"allow airlines to compete on the services and compensation that they provide to passengers rather than imposing new minimum requirements for these services and compensation through regulation, which would impose significant costs on airlines.\"",
      "When reached for comment Friday, the Transportation Department told CBS News that the \"Biden-Buttigieg proposal was just that \u2014 a proposal.\"",
      "\"It was dropped after the election in the waning days of the administration. It was never enacted, and does not reflect the compensation consumers are currently entitled to with respect to delays and cancellations,\" an agency spokesperson said.",

      "He told \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" in an interview airing Sunday he's aiming to have a proposal ready for a vote that is set to take place in mid-December.",
      "Tax credits for about 22 million Americans who buy their health insurance through the Affordable Care Act's marketplace were at the center of the government shutdown that ended Wednesday. A Biden-era expansion of those subsidies is expiring at the end of the year, so unless they're extended, many consumers will likely face far higher insurance premiums.",
      "Democrats pushed Republicans to extend the subsidies as a condition for reopening the government, but they eventually settled for the promise of a vote next month on extending the enhanced tax credits.",
      "Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican, said of any plan to extend the subsidies, \"Let's recognize what you're doing just gives money to insurance companies.\"",
      "Instead, he's asking Republican and Democratic colleagues to collaborate on lowering health insurance premiums and directly giving Americans money to help them offset high deductibles that are often a feature of the lower-cost policies under the ACA.",
      "\"We can do it better with lower premiums and with money and accounts to pay deductibles,\" Cassidy told Brennan. He said he's telling Democrats, \"Let's not be Democrats and Republicans \u2014 let's be Americans, representing all of Americans.\"",
      "President Trump offered a similar idea last weekend, writing on Truth Social the money that's spent on health insurance subsidies should be \"SENT DIRECTLY TO THE PEOPLE SO THAT THEY CAN PURCHASE THEIR OWN, MUCH BETTER, HEALTHCARE.\"",
      "Brennan pressed Cassidy on extending the expanded tax credits, which were created in 2021 and are set to expire at the end of the year.",
      "Noting the approximately 293,000 Louisianans currently enrolled in Obamacare, Brennan asked, \"Are you telling those hundreds of thousands of Louisianans that that tax credit is going away no matter what, that they should make plans no for higher prices?\"",
      "Cassidy countered that the problem with the plans was that many of them have high deductibles, with some reaching $6,000 in out-of-pocket costs. The lower-premium \"bronze\" plans on the ACA's marketplaces often have high deductibles.",
      "\"Margaret, I'm a doctor,\" Cassidy said. \"I would talk to people when they'd come to see me, and they would tell me, 'I can't afford that. My deductible is too high.' That's reality, and that reality is being lost in this discussion.\"",

      "But a tinge of fear is starting to shadow that exuberance as investors worry the AI boom could go bust.",
      "The startling run-up in AI-related stocks is prompting comparisons to the dot-com era of the late 1990s, when many internet companies saw their stock prices skyrocket despite suffering vast financial losses. When that bubble burst in the early 2000s, it took down former high-fliers like Pets.com, torched investor portfolios and triggered a recession.",
      "Bubbles occur when stocks surge on inflated growth expectations that ultimately prove to be disconnected from a company's underlying fundamentals, a painful reality check that typically ends with overhyped shares falling back to Earth.",
      "Thursday's stock market tumble \u2014 when high-flying AI stocks such as Nvidia and CoreWeave led the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite to see its biggest drop in months \u2014 fueled further anxiety this week about another bubble.",
      "Beyond the stock market, economists are also questioning whether AI will turn out to be as transformative for businesses as proponents of the technology insist. Advocates say AI will spur a productivity boom, leading to stronger corporate growth and profitability.",
      "\"The stock market is a giant bet on AI right now. It's really 10 companies that are driving all of it,\" Rebecca Homkes, an economist and lecturer at the London Business School, told CBS News.",
      "In other words, this year's 15% gain in the S&P 500 \u00a0is largely due to a handful of tech giants that are heavily investing in AI. The combined market capitalization of the so-called \"Magnificent 7\" \u2014 Google-owner Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla \u2014 today represents a record 37% of the S&P 500's total value, according to Morningstar.",
      "Irrational exuberance?",
      "That may give pause to the millions of Americans who are saving for retirement in 401(k) and other plans. If the market's gains lean so heavily on a few dominant companies, as during the dot-com bubble, the fallout could be severe if investors suddenly sour on AI.",
      "\"No one wants to be caught dancing after the music has stopped,\" Aaron Schaechterle, portfolio manager at Janus Henderson, said in an email.",
      "Still, today's stock valuations aren't nearly as stretched as they were in the late 1990s, Goldman Sachs analysts note. The investment bank's analysis of the Magnificent 7's median price-to-earnings ratio \u2014 a measure of a company's share price compared to its profits \u2014 found it is \"roughly half\" that of the largest seven companies in the late 1990s.",
      "\"So it is true that valuations are high but, in our view, generally not at levels that are as high as are typically seen at the height of a financial bubble,\" they noted.",
      "Why this time may be different",
      "The question of whether AI is fueling a bubble akin to the late 1990s was even posed to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell at the central bank's Oct. 29 meeting.",
      "\"This is different in the sense that these companies \u2014 the companies that are so highly valued \u2014 actually have earnings and stuff like that,\" Powell said. \"So you go back to the '90s and the dot-com [period]... these were ideas rather than companies.\"",
      "Nvidia, for example, the AI boom's poster child, has seen its revenue more than double to $130 billion in its last fiscal year, while its profit surged 145%.",
      "Although the stock market may not be in imminent danger of a bubble-bursting crash, economists are increasingly questioning whether AI companies can live up to the hype, as well as justify the trillions in capital spending on the data centers and other infrastructure required to power the AI revolution.",
      "For these bets to pay off, AI will need to transform U.S. businesses by spurring a productivity boom that translates into stronger corporate growth and profitability, experts say.",
      "\"We want to understand whether this is storytelling or actual tangible gains,\" Homkes of the London Business School told CBS News.",
      "For tech evangelists like Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, the AI boom will lead to a \"4th industrial revolution\" that could supercharge economic growth. \"This is an AI Arms Race, and what is fueling this next chapter of growth is Big Tech spending and that is NOT slowing down into 2026,\" he wrote this week in a research note.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/black-friday-fewer-discounts-tariffs/",
    "published": "Fri, 14 Nov 2025 13:46:42 -0500",
    "summary": "Some businesses say steeper U.S. tariffs this year give them less financial room to offer holiday savings.",
    "story": [
      "Businesses face a tough decision this holiday season: Run a Black Friday promotion and see their profits drop, or charge full price and risk turning off buyers.",
      "Some business owners said sharply higher U.S. tariffs on imports are raising their costs, giving them less room to roll out aggressive holiday sales.",
      "Lisa Cheng Smith, founder of Yun Hai Taiwanese Pantry, a New York City-based retailer that imports products from businesses and farms in Taiwan, said her costs have jumped 20% to 50% this year from 2024 because of U.S. tariffs on imports from Taiwan and other Asian countries.",
      "In past years, Yun Hai has offered a 15% Black Friday discount as a way to drive holiday purchases, with Cheng Smith telling CBS News that the annual promotion \"is a really important thing for us.\" This year, however, she's unsure how much of a discount she can afford to offer, given her higher operational costs resulting from tariffs.",
      "\"It's complicated because of tariffs and how the retail math works,\" Cheng Smith said. \"Do we offer less of a discount and try to preserve margins, or do we use the same promotion language and structures that customers have come to expect?\"",
      "For small business owners, such calculations can make all the difference, she added. \"What we do from October through December is equal to the whole rest of the year in terms of sales, so every day is more high stakes,\" she noted.",
      "Retail experts said higher tariff costs for retailers and other businesses could mean fewer, and paltrier, Black Friday discounts this year.",
      "\"There will be discounts and deals \u2014 that's what Black Friday is about. Very few retailers will want to shun that completely, but I think they will be more surgical and selective in the discounting,\" Neil Saunders, managing director and retail analyst at GlobalData, told CBS News. \"They will perhaps discount fewer items, and some discounts will be less generous in terms of the amount of money off.\"",
      "Dan Peskorse, whose company, Upstream Brands, sells a range of merchandise under different labels on Amazon and other e-commerce sites, also said higher tariff costs are forcing him to rethink his Black Friday strategy this year.",
      "For previous Black Fridays, Peskorse said Upstream Brands typically offered discounts of up to 30% on products sold under the company's flagship brands, including ThinkFit, which makes meal-prep bags and containers, and Ash Harbor, a maker of small home goods.",
      "Not this year. \"This is the first year that we are not offering across-the-board discounts on products,\" he said, noting that the decision was \"100%\" related to tariffs.",
      "Peskorse has taken steps to mitigate the impact of tariffs, including raising prices and absorbing the extra costs that come with importing goods from China and India. The only tool he has left to control costs and preserve his business's profits is to scrap discounts, he said.",
      "The average U.S. tariff rate has increased sevenfold this year, to 16.6%, according to EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco. Those higher duties are pushing up the prices of imported goods as retailers pass on a portion of the\u00a0costs to shoppers, he noted.",
      "\"It's going to be a strange season\"",
      "Squeezed by tariff costs, many businesses are also grappling with a slowdown in holiday spending by lower-income consumers still feeling the\u00a0impact of persistent inflation.",
      "\"I think the rubber is going to hit the road when we get into Black Friday,\" said Sonia Lapinsky, a retail analyst at management consulting firm AlixPartners. \"Consumers are telling us they are pulling back on holiday spending this year, holding on to their dollars and putting their money in critical places, not in discretionary buckets.\"",
      "Discounts are a powerful tool for incentivizing consumers to spend money, she added.",
      "\"It's the only way retailers will get them in the door, because they can't stomach this,\" Lapinsky said. \"So it's going to be a strange season. If retailers get it wrong, they're risking the biggest selling season they have.\"",

      "Starting in December, stores will sell Simply NKD versions of the popular snacks that have no artificial flavors or dyes \u2014 meaning no bright orange color, PepsiCo announced Thursday.",
      "The move comes following a push by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to get rid of synthetic food dyes in the nation's food supply. The Food and Drug Administration asked the industry to stop using dyes in April, but stopped short of banning them.",
      "For Cheetos and Doritos, the original versions will still be available in addition to the new options.",
      "\"NKD is an additive option, not a replacement, introduced to meet consumer demand,\" CEO of PepsiCo Foods U.S. Rachel Ferdinando said in a statement.",

      "The NKD collection will launch with four flavors: Doritos Simply NKD Nacho Cheese, Doritos Simply NKD Cool Ranch, Cheetos Simply NKD Puffs and Cheetos Simply NKD Flamin' Hot. They will be available in stores starting Dec. 1, PepsiCo said.",
      "The original nacho cheese-flavored Doritos contain the artificial colors Yellow 6, Yellow 5 and Red 40. The Cool Ranch option has Blue 1, Red 40 and Yellow 5. Other varieties contain other artificial dyes, according to the Doritos website.",

    "summary": "State-sponsored cybercriminals used Anthropic's tech to target tech companies, financial institutions and other organizations, AI company alleges.",
    "story": [
      "Anthropic said Thursday that Chinese hackers used its artificial intelligence technology in what the company believes is the first cyberespionage operation largely carried out using AI.",
      "Anthropic said the cybercriminals used its popular chatbot, Claude, to target roughly 30 technology companies, financial institutions, chemical manufacturers and government agencies. The hackers used the AI platform to gather usernames and passwords from the companies' databases that they then exploited to steal private data, Anthropic said, while noting that only a \"small number\" of these attacks succeeded.",
      "\"We believe this is the first documented case of a large-scale cyberattack executed without substantial human intervention,\" Anthropic said in a statement.",
      "The San Francisco-based company shared its findings with CBS News but did not offer additional comment. The news was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.",
      "Anthropic said it began detecting suspicious activity in mid-September. A subsequent investigation by the company revealed that the activity stemmed from an espionage campaign that Anthropic said was likely carried out by a state-sponsored group based in China.",
      "According to the investigation, hackers allegedly duped Claude into thinking it was an employee of a legitimate cybersecurity firm and that it was being used for defensive testing. Anthropic also said the cybercriminals sought to hide their tracks by breaking down the attack into small tasks.",
      "Unlike conventional cyberattacks, the operation required minimal human intervention, according to the company. \"The AI made thousands of requests per second, an attack speed that would have been, for human hackers, simply impossible to match,\" Anthropic said.",
      "Anthropic said it expects AI cyberattacks to grow in scale and sophistication as so-called agents become more widely used for a range of services. AI agents are cheaper than professional hackers and can operate quickly at a larger scale, making them particularly attractive to cybercriminals, MIT Technology Review\u00a0has pointed out.",
      "Chris Krebs, the former head of the federal government's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, told CBS Mornings on Friday that this attack is a sign of what's to come.",
      "\"As security experts, we've been talking about events and attacks like this for close to a decade,\" he said. To see an AI cyberattack come to life like this is \"pretty chilling,\" he added.",

    "summary": "A growing number of Americans, squeezed by inflation and elevated interest rates, face the risk of losing their home in foreclosure.",
    "story": [
      "Kimberly Draxler was in shock when she called her mortgage lender in April and was told her four-bedroom home in Hillview, Kentucky, would be sold out from under her in a matter of days.",
      "Though she had been alerted that something might be wrong by a letter in the mail from an attorney offering assistance in warding off foreclosure, she said her lender never informed her that she was about to lose her home.",
      "\"They never called me and told me they were just going to rip my house right underneath me,\" Draxler told CBS News.",
      "Draxler's lender said it notifies all borrowers of a possible foreclosure by mail and by phone throughout the process, in compliance with federal debt collection rules.",
      "Before learning that her home was entering foreclosure, Draxler, who is 57 and on disability, said she stayed afloat financially by relying on her son, who contributed $600 a month to help take care of household expenses. But after he moved out in 2024, her bills began to pile up, she told CBS News. Draxler soon fell behind on her mortgage.",
      "The financial pressures bearing down on Draxler highlight the struggles of homeowners still grappling with the rising cost of everything from housing and\u00a0groceries to\u00a0energy bills\u00a0and insurance coverage. With many households stretched thin, unexpected events such as job loss, unplanned medical expense or even simple car problems can cause people to fall behind on their mortgages.",
      "\"I just couldn't do it anymore\"",
      "Although foreclosures \u2014 which include default notices, scheduled auctions or bank repossessions \u2014 remain well below their pre-pandemic levels, they are on the rise.",
      "As of August, foreclosure filings had risen six straights months year-over-year and were up 18% from the same period in 2024, according to property data firm ATTOM. Through June, roughly 188,000 properties had foreclosure filings, putting the U.S. on track to surpass the roughly 322,000 U.S. properties that went into foreclosure in 2024.",
      "\"Paying for the house, the car, the necessity bills \u2014 I just couldn't do it anymore,\" said Draxler, who had come close to losing her home in foreclosure on three previous occasions over the last decade.",
      "Roughly 94% of mortgage defaults occur after a homeowner loses income to extenuating circumstances,\u00a0according\u00a0to The Urban Institute, citing\u00a0data\u00a0from the National Bureau of Economic Research.",
      "Rising homeownership costs",
      "A key factor behind the rise in foreclosure rates is the growing cost home insurance, utilities, property taxes, repairs and other homeownership expenses. For example, single-family homeowners with a mortgage today pay an average of\u00a0$2,370 a year for property coverage\u00a0\u2014 up nearly 70% from five years ago, according to data from ICE Mortgage Technology.",
      "In addition to rising homeowners insurance costs, many households are also contending with exorbitant property taxes as well as elevated interest rates.",
      "\"All of these rising costs associated with holding a home, you have increasing pressure on existing homeowners to continue to be able to afford and pay for their mortgages,\" Geoff Smith, executive director of the Institute for Housing Studies at DePaul University, told CBS News.",
      "Todd Teta, chief product and technology officer at ATTOM, also cited the recent slowdown in hiring as a factor behind rising mortgage delinquencies, noting that job loss often drives foreclosures.",
      "A high interest rate environment can be particularly challenging for homeowners with variable-rate loans, which reset at certain intervals in part based on market conditions. That means a homeowner might see a major jump in their monthly mortgage payment if their reset occurs when interest rates are elevated.",
      "A narrow escape",
      "More such loans are now hitting their reset periods, Teta noted, a trend he expects to continue. \"While there has been a small dip in interest rates, they remain significantly higher than just a few years ago, so borrowers with upcoming resets are still likely to see sizable payment increases.\"",
      "As for Draxler, she managed to keep her home by filing for Chapter 13 bankruptcy, which allows debtors to hold onto their property and pay off debt over time, usually within three to five years. But coming so close to losing her home of more than 30 years continues to weigh on her.",
      "\"I did not want to lose my house,\" Draxler said. \"I wouldn't have no place to go.\"",

      "Walmart on Friday said CEO Doug McMillon, who started his career with the retailer as an hourly worker and who has led the company since 2014, will retire in January.",
      "McMillon, 59, will step down as CEO on Jan. 31 but remain on the retailer's board of directors until its annual shareholders' meeting. John Furner, who has served as president and CEO of Walmart U.S. since 2019, will take over as chief executive on Feb. 1.",
      "McMillon oversaw an expansion of tech-based initiatives at Walmart, such as investing in e-commerce and artificial intelligence, while also increasing wages and benefits for Walmart's 2.1 million workers. Under his tenure, Walmart's shares surged more than 300%, buoyed by rising sales and profitability.",
      "\"McMillon is very highly regarded by investors and helped the company navigate a volatile retail landscape over the last ~12 years as CEO,\" Adam Crisafulli, an analyst with Vital Knowledge, said in a research note, adding that his retirement is \"somewhat surprising.\"",
      "Since McMillon became CEO in February 2014, Walmart's annual revenue has grown from nearly $486 billion to $681 billion in its latest fiscal year.",
      "\"People thought he would stay on longer given how well the company is performing and his relatively young age,\" Crisafulli noted.",
      "McMillon had told the Wall Street Journal in March 2023 that he pledged to remain in his role for another three years as the company searched for a successor. McMillon has spent his entire career at Walmart, starting in 1984 as an associate who picked orders and unloaded trailers in a warehouse, according to his company bio.",
      "Furner, 51, has proved to be a \"strong leader\" as he managed Walmart's U.S. business, said GlobalData managing director Neil Saunders in a research note. But, he added, McMillon's retirement \"will send a small shockwave through Walmart, simply because he has been an excellent leader and steward of the company, he said.",
      "In a statement, McMillon said he's worked with Furner for more than 20 years. \"His love for our associates and this company runs deep. His curiosity and digital acumen combined with a deep commitment to our people and culture will enable him to take us to the next level,\" McMillon said in the statement.",

    "published": "Thu, 13 Nov 2025 19:59:00 -0500",
    "summary": "An extension of enhanced ACA tax credits appears unlikely, experts say, leaving millions of Americans facing potentially higher health plan costs in 2026.",
    "story": [
      "The cost of health care remains in limbo for roughly 22 million Americans after the U.S. government reopened late Wednesday without a deal to extend an expiring federal tax credit that offsets the cost of some Affordable Care Act plans.",
      "The fate of the enhanced premium tax credit had been at the center of the longest government shutdown in U.S. history as Democrats pushed Republicans to extend the subsidy in order to reopen the government.",
      "The Senate\u00a0voted late Sunday\u00a0on a deal to end the shutdown that did not resolve the future of the tax credit \u2014 a central demand of Democrats during the government funding fight. On Wednesday, the House approved the Senate-passed funding package to end the 43-day shutdown. President Trump signed the legislation shortly after.",
      "To secure the Democratic votes needed to reopen the government, Senate Republicans\u00a0agreed to hold a separate vote\u00a0on extending the ACA tax credits by mid-December. But a vote isn't guaranteed to succeed, and even if the legislation makes it out of the Senate, House GOP leaders have not committed to holding a vote in the lower chamber.",
      "Americans are now choosing their 2026 health plans on the ACA's online marketplaces, and without congressional action, the tax credits will expire Dec. 31.",
      "\"A lot of people are sort of in this limbo state where they have to buy their insurance for next year, but they really don't know how this is going to shake out at the federal level,\" Emma Wager, a senior policy analyst at nonprofit health policy site KFF, told CBS News.",
      "What happens without an extension?",
      "The subsidies were introduced in 2021 through the pandemic-era American Rescue Plan Act, and then extended for three more years in the Inflation Reduction Act. Without any action on Congress's part, the enhanced premium tax credits will disappear at the end of 2025.",
      "That means low- and middle-income households that previously qualified for the tax credits would likely see their ACA premiums more than double next year, rising from an average of $888 in 2025 to $1,904 in 2026, according to a KFF analysis.",
      "Faced with higher costs for ACA insurance, about 4 million people are likely to drop their health coverage, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated.",
      "\"Americans are really just seeing how expensive health care is in this country, and it's just completely unaffordable for a lot of people to pay their own entire health insurance premium,\" Wager said.",
      "Currently, the enhanced ACA premium tax credit is available for people who earn between 100% to 400% of the poverty level, which sets the upper threshold at $62,000 for an individual, according to KFF. However, some Americans who earn above that 400% benchmark can qualify for the tax credit if their insurance rates exceed 8.5% of their income.",
      "Three-quarters of Americans favor renewing the subsidies, according to recent KFF polling. That includes 94% of Democrats and about half of Republicans.",
      "If Congress renews the subsidies, federal and state marketplaces would need to retool the 2026 plans already available to consumers. It's possible a new plan could be made retroactive to January 2026, even if it's passed later in the year, Wager said.",
      "\"At that point, people are sort of locked in on whatever plan they chose, but they can retroactively receive the tax credit,\" she noted.",
      "Are there other options from Congress?",
      "Congress could pursue other ways to make health coverage more affordable. On Saturday, President Trump called for sending the money saved by not extending the tax subsidies \"directly to the people.\" On his Truth Social platform, he criticized the ACA and said Americans should be able to use the savings to purchase other kinds of insurance.",
      "\"In other words, take from the BIG, BAD Insurance Companies, give it to the people, and terminate, per Dollar spent, the worst Healthcare anywhere in the World, ObamaCare,\" he wrote.",
      "Wager said it remains to be seen if Mr. Trump's plan is feasible, saying \"we haven't seen a concrete enough proposal at this point.\"",
      "Some lawmakers have offered similar proposals, such as Senate Health Committee Chair Bill Cassidy, a Republican from Louisiana. In a floor speech last week, he said eligible Americans could be sent \"a pre-funded federal flexible spending account\" to use for health expenses, from dental care to prescription drugs and preventive services.",
      "In the meantime, as 2026 approaches and the future of the enhanced premium tax credit remains unclear, enrollees should consider speaking with a health insurance expert to get advice on their options, Wager advised.",
      "\"The most important thing that you can do is talk to somebody \u2014 an agent, broker or a navigator \u2014 who can help you make sure that you really understand what your options are and that you get the best plan for your financial situation and your health care situation,\" she said.",

    "summary": "One child was rushed to the hospital via air ambulance, her parents said.",
    "story": [
      "The parents of at least two babies sickened in an infantile botulism outbreak are suing the makers of the ByHeart baby formula at the heart of a nationwide recall.",
      "Stephen and Yurany Dexter, of Flagstaff, Arizona, said their 4-month-old daughter, Rose, had to be flown by air ambulance to a children's hospital two hours from home and treated for several weeks this summer.",
      "Michael and Hanna Everett, of Richmond, Kentucky, said their daughter, Piper, also 4 months, was rushed to a hospital Nov. 8 with worsening symptoms of the rare and potentially deadly disease.",
      "\"It was just absolutely terrifying,\" Hanna Everett told CBS News in an interview Thursday. \"You know, we just kind of felt like we failed as a parent in some ways.\"",
      "Everett said they were unaware of the recall prior to her daughter consuming the ByHeart formula.",
      "\"She had finished that entire can, literally, the day before the recall,\" Everett said.",
      "The lawsuits, filed in federal courts in two states, allege that the ByHeart formula the babies consumed was defective and that the company was negligent in selling it. They seek financial payment for medical bills, emotional distress and other harm.",
      "\"My hopes right now is that they're able to catch it before their children get too sick, before they have to be on ventilators,\" Everett said.",
      "Both families said they bought the organic formula to provide what they viewed as a natural, healthier alternative to traditional baby formulas, and that they were shocked and angered by the suffering their children endured.",
      "\"I wouldn't guess that a product designed for a helpless, developing human in the United States could cause something this severe,\" said Stephen Dexter, 44.",
      "\"She's so little and you're just helplessly watching this,\" Hanna previously told the Associated Press. \"It was awful.\"",
      "Rose Dexter and Piper Everett are among at least 15 infants in a dozen states who have been sickened in the outbreak that began in August, according to federal and state health officials. No deaths have been reported.",
      "Both received the sole treatment available for botulism in children less than a year old: an IV medication called BabyBIG, made from the blood plasma of people immunized against the neurotoxins that cause the illness.",
      "Investigations into more potential botulism cases are pending after ByHeart, the New York-based formula manufacturer, recalled all of its formula nationwide on Tuesday. At least 84 U.S. babies have been treated for infantile botulism since August, including those in the outbreak, California officials said.",
      "It can take up to 30 days for signs of infantile botulism infection to appear, medical experts said. The symptoms can include drooping eyelids, diminished suck and gag reflexes, and a weak and altered cry, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Children suspected of being sick with infant botulism should get medical attention as soon as possible, the CDC says.",
      "ByHeart sells about 200,000 cans of formula per month. FDA commissioner Marty Makary told CBS News that the company sells about 1% of the baby formula purchased in the U.S., and that there is no risk of a formula shortage due to the recall.",
      "California officials confirmed that a sample from an open can of ByHeart formula fed to an infant who fell ill contained the type of bacteria that can lead to illness.",
      "The lawsuits filed Wednesday could be the first of many legal actions against ByHeart, said Bill Marler, a Seattle food safety lawyer who represents Dexter.",
      "\"This company potentially faces an existential crisis,\" he said.",
      "ByHeart officials didn't respond to questions about the new lawsuits but said they would \"address any legal claims in due course.\"",
      "\"We remain focused on ensuring that families using ByHeart products are aware of the recall and have factual information about steps they should take,\" the company said in a statement.",
      "In a separate statement provided to CBS News Thursday, the company said, \"We express our deepest sympathy to the families currently impacted by the cases of infant botulism.\"",
      "In Rose Dexter's case, she received ByHeart formula within days of her birth in July after breast milk was insufficient, her father said. Stephen Dexter said he went to Whole Foods to find a \"natural option.\"",
      "\"I'm a little concerned with things that are in food that may cause problems,\" he said. \"We do our best to buy something that says it's organic.\"",
      "But Rose, who was healthy at birth, didn't thrive on the formula. She had trouble feeding and was fussy and fretful as she got sicker. On Aug. 31, when she was 8 weeks old, her parents couldn't wake her.",
      "Rose was flown by air ambulance to Phoenix Children's Hospital, where she stayed for nearly two weeks.",
      "Hanna Everett told the AP she used ByHeart to supplement breastfeeding starting when Piper was 6 weeks old.",
      "\"It's supposed to be similar to breast milk,\" she said.",
      "Last weekend, Piper started showing signs of illness. Everett said she became more worried when a friend told her ByHeart had recalled two lots of its Whole Nutrition Infant Formula. When a family member checked the empty cans, they matched the recalled lots.",
      "\"I was like, 'Oh my god, we need to go to the ER,\" Everett recalled to the AP.",
      "At Kentucky Children's Hospital, Piper's condition worsened rapidly. Her pupils stopped dilating correctly and she lost her gag reflex. Her head and arms became limp and floppy.",
      "Doctors immediately ordered doses of the BabyBIG medication, which had to be shipped from California, Hanna said. In the meantime, Piper had to have a feeding tube and IV lines inserted.",
      "In both cases, the babies improved after receiving treatment. Rose went home in September and she no longer requires a feeding tube. Piper went home this week.",
      "They appear to be doing well on different formulas, the families said.",

      "Roughly 14% of U.S. households reported food insecurity on average between January and October, up from 12.5% in 2024, according to the latest data from Purdue's Center for Food Demand Analysis and Sustainability.",
      "While the prevalence of food insecurity around the U.S. fluctuates month to month, the overall rate had been declining since 2022, when an average of 15.4% of households were food insecure as inflation hit 40-year highs following the pandemic.",
      "Although the pace of inflation has declined since 2022, food insecurity is likely rising because food prices remain far above pre-pandemic levels, according to Poonam Gupta, a research associate at the Urban Institute, a think tank in Washington, D.C.",
      "\"Even though inflation slowed a lot this year, we're nowhere near the amount that we were spending on food even just a couple of years ago,\" she said.",
      "Gupta also said more Americans could struggle to put food on the table in 2026, with an estimated 2.4 million SNAP recipients potentially losing benefits due to new work requirements in the Republican-backed \"big, beautiful\" tax and spending bill signed into law in July by President Trump.",
      "The Purdue researchers define food insecurity as some members of a household at times not being able to afford a balanced meal, as well as occasionally having to skip a meal or eating less for financial reasons.",

      "If you're among the tens of thousands of workers in tech and other fields whose jobs have been cut recently, don't fret. The job market is robust and companies are hiring. However, you'll have to stand out from your job-seeking peers, which these days requires more than simply polishing your resume and sharpening your LinkedIn profile.",
      "While maintaining a fine-tuned resume and an updated professional presence online is a necessity for job seekers, that alone won't guarantee you'll land a new position. After all, many openings are filled before job listings are even posted.",

      "\"A lot of times a company already has a person in mind before it's public information, or there's a lot of weight on the scales for a particular person. A lot of hiring, whether we like it or not, is done this way,\" career coach Cynthia Pong told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "This makes professional networking even more crucial.",
      "When applying for a job can be as easy as clicking a button, recruiters find themselves inundated with digital applications they have to weed through, according to Pong. She said a personal recommendation can be tremendously helpful in getting a hiring manager's attention.",
      "\"If we're smart about leveraging our network, it goes a long way in  cutting through the noise that is the pile of digital or paper resumes  on [the] other person's side,\" she said.",
      "How do you network?",
      "Pong says she often works with job seekers who don't trust that the people they know can be helpful in their job searches.",
      "\"A lot of people say they have no network, their community doesn't know anyone. I am used to hearing that preliminary objection. I press people and say, you do know people, and those people also know people \u2014 and that's a network,\" she said.",
      "She encourages job seekers to spend 70% to 80% of their time networking, versus blasting out resumes and cold applying to posted openings.",
      "Start by making a list of people you know in broad categories, such as through family, high school, college and graduate school, and from past jobs and internships. One way to identify contacts from your past is to go through your own resume or LinkedIn profile.",
      "\"You may think they don't know folks in the area you want to be in, but you might be surprised,\" Pong said.",
      "Next, organize your contacts into a list or spreadsheet and set performance goals for yourself.",
      "\"Each week say, 'I'm going to reach out to x number of people on this list. In a couple weeks, you'll have made progress,\" Pong said.",
      "Once you connect, end every conversation by asking your contact who else they recommend you reach out to in order to grow your network.",
      "When you apply to a job at the recommendation of a contact, it boosts your chances of getting noticed and also eases hiring managers' workloads.",
      "\"You're doing them a favor by becoming visible to them and differentiating yourself from everybody else in this day and age of easy-apply, one-click applications,\" Pong said.",
      "Optimize your online presence",
      "It's easy for recruiters to search for a candidate online and access reams of personal and professional information about them.",
      "This is why one's online presence is increasingly important.",
      "\"Think about what someone who Googles your name sees,\" Pong said. \"Do they even see me if I have a common name? If they do see me, is something coming up that is not just my LinkedIn profile? What's better is if it's that plus other things that demonstrate in the first couple of hits what you stand for, what your value add is and what are you passionate about.\"",
      "That can be achieved by building a personal website highlighting past work, for example.",
      "Indeed, recruiters comb platforms like LinkedIn for candidates whose experience and professional goals align with their own staffing needs.",

      "He entered terms including \"chief of staff,\" \"sales development representative\" and \"associate product manager\" into LinkedIn's advanced search function and ultimately made two hires who met the company's criteria.",
      "\"I made a mass list of people whose profiles matched the keywords I was looking for and messaged all of them. I set up interviews with the ones who got back to me,\" Auerbach said. For every 100 messages he sent, he identified about one good candidate. \"Which is ironic, given how many people are getting fired right now,\" he added.",
      "Face-to-face connections",
      "While the world is increasingly digital, there's still an important place for face-to-face interactions, especially when it comes to making a good impression on someone.",
      "Seek out industry affinity group meetups and set up coffee chats, or consider volunteering in an unpaid capacity.",
      "\"Meeting people in real life is huge, because there really is no substitute for the face-to-face connection,\" Pong said.",

      "Although most apps operate on a so-called \"freemium\" model, upgrades and premium features that dating services claim will your boost success rate can greatly increase expenses. Popular dating apps such as Tinder, Bumble, Hinge, The League and others still offer free versions, but charge users for additional features the companies promise will deliver better experiences \u2014 and more desirable romantic prospects \u2014 as the services look to monetize their platforms.",

      "On Match Group-owned Hinge, for example, upgrading to Hinge+ costs $100 for six months, or $17 a month.

      "\"People understand the value of upgrading \u2014 it has infiltrated all areas of life. I am not surprised dating apps have done same thing,\" Juarez said.",
      "Relationship coach Amie Leadingham also acknowledged the paradigm shift that has made more people feel comfortable paying up to make a love connection.",

      "New York-based entrepreneur Bretton Auerbach, a Harvard University graduate and founder of real estate marketplace Triple.com, has been paying for dating apps for years. When he first started using dating apps, including Tinder, roughly a decade ago, he quickly encountered two challenges: First, it was taking up a lot of his time and second, he was bumping up against limits on how many peoples' profiles he could like.",
      "To save time and meet more people, Auerbach signed up for paid versions of a handful of dating apps and found himself spending around $1,000 per month on paid features. That allowed him to view roughly 100 profiles, which he'd whittle down to a date or two.",
      "\"If you're not paying, you're not getting dates,\" Auerbach said. He compared these features such as \"boosts\" that raise your profile's visibility to \"going into a casino where you buy a bunch of chips, throw them in a slot machine where the wheels spin, and you hope you see someone attractive.",
      "Notably, he also conceded that he's spent \"a lot of money\" on dating apps, and ultimately hasn't found them that useful.",
      "\"The best dating experiences I've had have mostly been through meeting people through my social network,\" Auerbach said.",

    "story": [
      "Walt Disney Co. executives on Thursday warned that the company's dispute with YouTube could drag on, leaving subscribers to the Google-owned video platform without access to ABC, ESPN, FX and other programming from the entertainment giant.",
      "Disney channels went dark on YouTube TV on Oct. 30 amid a so-called carriage dispute between the two companies. YouTube\u00a0said in a blog post\u00a0last month that Disney had followed through on a threat to pull its networks \"as a negotiating tactic to force deal terms that would raise prices on our customers.\"",
      "Asked in a Thursday investor call about the ongoing negotiations, Disney Chief Financial Officer Hugh Johnston said that \"these discussions could go for a little while,\" without providing a timeframe or additional details.",
      "\"[W]e care deeply about our consumer,\" Disney CEO Robert Iger said in the call. \"And our priority has always been to remain on their service without interruption to close a deal on a timely basis so that interruption does not occur. The deal that we have proposed is equal to or better than what other large distributors have already agreed to.\"",
      "What are carriage fees?",
      "Providers of pay-TV services like YouTube TV pay carriage fees to network owners, including Disney, for the right to broadcast their channels. Disputes over the fees are common, with content providers often at loggerheads with TV networks over commercial terms when their deals expire.",
      "The conflicts sometimes result in viewers losing access to a company's channels or content if the negotiations extend beyond the end of a contract.",
      "Disney claimed last month that YouTube TV is refusing to pay fair rates for its channels and has chosen to \"deny their subscribers the content they value most,\" pointing to its ESPN sports broadcasts and ABC shows such as \"High Potential.\"",
      "YouTube has countered that Disney \"is proposing costly economic terms that would raise prices on YouTube TV customers and give our customers fewer choices,\" according to an Oct. 23 blog post.",
      "YouTube, the largest internet TV provider in the U.S. with more than 9 million subscribers, said last month that it would offer a $20 credit if Disney's content remains unavailable on YouTube TV for \"an extended period of time.\" The streaming platform costs $82.99 per month.",
      "Google didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about Johnston's comment or whether YouTube is currently offering the $20 credit to customers.",
      "Disney on Thursday also reported mixed fourth-quarter results, with weaker growth from cable and the box office somewhat offset by strength in its streaming business and theme parks.",
      "Although the company's profit topped analyst estimates, Disney's $22.4 billion in revenue for the quarter fell short of Wall Street forecasts of $22.8 billion. Sales at its Disney Entertainment unit, which includes the company's movie studios and streaming service, dropped 6%, while revenue for its parks division climbed 6%.",
      "Shares of Disney tumbled $10.83, or 9.3%, to $105.84 in Thursday afternoon trading.",

      "Washington \u2014 The more than 1.4 million federal employees who have gone without pay during the 43-day government shutdown could begin getting paychecks as soon as this Sunday, while others will have to wait until next Wednesday, Nov. 19.",
      "The pay schedule was laid out in an agency-by-agency projection by the White House's Office of Management and Budget. The memo was first reported by Semafor, and an OMB official confirmed its contents to CBS News.",
      "Hundreds of thousands of essential employees continued working during the shutdown without pay, while nonessential employees were furloughed. Both groups are entitled to back pay for the paychecks they missed while the government was closed.",
      "The administration has a goal of completing its list of backlogged payments by Nov. 19.",
      "Differing dates among agencies are due to different pay schedules and payroll providers, an OMB official said. The official added that the original projected pay dates were supposed to be later, but the White House urged agencies to get checks out \"expeditiously and accurately to not leave anyone waiting longer than necessary.\"",
      "Most of the first post-shutdown paychecks to employees will only include pay from Oct. 1 to Nov. 1. They will be limited to base pay, meaning no bonuses, overtime or benefits. Pay for days after Nov. 1, as well as for overtime or bonuses, will be issued in the next pay period.",
      "Up first are Army and non-Army civilian employees at the Defense Department, as well as staffers at the Departments of Veterans Affairs, Energy and Health and Human Services. Their paychecks are projected to be processed on Sunday, Nov. 16. The checks will include base pay and payments for overtime and hazard pay.",
      "More than 150,000 employees at the Environmental Protection Agency, NASA, National Science Foundation, Social Security Administration, Nuclear Regulatory Commission and Departments of Education, State, Interior and Transportation are expected to get their paychecks on Monday, Nov. 17. This only includes base pay, with corrections set to be made in the next pay cycle.",
      "Employees at the General Services Administration and Office of Personnel Management are set to receive their paycheck on Saturday, Nov. 15. These checks will only include base pay.",
      "Small Business Administration employees as well as those at the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, Justice, Labor and Treasury are expected to receive their back pay payments on Wednesday, Nov. 19. These checks cover the entire period of the shutdown, including from Nov. 1 to Nov. 13.",
      "Federal employees going without pay became a major pain point during the Senate's fight over funding the government, and was one of several factors that ultimately pushed eight Senate Democrats to join Republicans to end the stalemate. The package cleared the House on Wednesday evening, and President Trump quickly signed it into law, ending the shutdown.",
      "The legislation extended most government funding until Jan. 30, raising the prospect of another shutdown fight in the new year. Other parts of the government are funded through September 2026.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. National Archives has published a batch of newly declassified government records on Amelia Earhart, the American aviator who vanished over the Pacific in 1937, officials said.",
      "Earhart went missing while on a pioneering round-the-world flight with navigator Fred Noonan, and her disappearance is one of the most tantalizing mysteries in aviation lore.",
      "President Donald Trump ordered the declassification and release in September of all U.S. government records related to Earhart's ill-fated final flight.",
      "Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said the documents released on Friday included \"newly declassified files from the National Security Agency, information on Earhart's last known communications, weather and plane conditions at the time, and potential search locations, as well as subsequent inquiries and theories regarding her disappearance.\"",
      "Further documents would be publicly released on the National Archives website on a \"rolling basis\" as they are declassified, Gabbard said in a statement.",
      "The documents include a July 1937 radio log from Itasca, a U.S. Coast Guard cutter that was deployed to support Earhart's flight around the world. Itasca was the last ship to have radio contact with Earhart and Noonan before their aircraft disappeared. The phrase \"Earhart Unheard\" appears numerous times in the log.\u00a0 According to the National Archives, the last communication from Earhart's plane came at about 8:43 a.m. on Jul 2, 1937: \"We are on the line 157 337 wl rept msg we wl rept\u2026\"",
      "The documents also include military reports about the search as well as memos, telegrams and newspaper clippings.",
      "Among them is the July 16, 1960 front page of the San Mateo Times with the headline: \"Ex-Serviceman Claims He Saw Earhart Grave.\" Former Army Sergeant Thomas Devine told the newspaper that while serving in Saipan, a native on the island showed him an unmarked grave of two white people \"who came from the sky.\" Devine said he believed it to be the grave of Earhart and Noonan.",
      "In a separate newspaper article, dated Nov. 18, 1970, a researcher claimed that a former Pan American Airways employee had records indicating Earhart survived the crash and sent a distress call that was received by the airline.",
      "Many of the thousands of documents published online on Friday have been released previously by the National Archives or made available to researchers, and aviation experts consider it unlikely that the latest material will shed any new light on Earhart's disappearance.",
      "Earhart's final flight has fascinated historians for decades and spawned books, movies and theories galore.",
      "The prevailing belief is that Earhart, 39, and Noonan, 44, ran out of fuel and ditched their twin-engine Lockheed Electra in the Pacific near Howland Island while on one of the final legs of their epic journey.",
      "Earhart, who won fame in 1932 as the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic, took off on May 20, 1937 from Oakland, California, hoping to become the first woman to fly around the world.",
      "She and Noonan vanished on July 2, 1937 after taking off from Lae, Papua New Guinea, on a challenging 2,500-mile flight to refuel on Howland Island, a speck of a U.S. territory between Australia and Hawaii.",
      "They never made it.",
      "Efforts to find the aircraft have continued to this day.\u00a0 Last month, an\u00a0expedition\u00a0to try to locate Earhart's plane on a remote island in the Pacific was delayed until next year.",
      "A team of researchers was planning to travel to Nikumaroro Island in early November to determine whether something known as the Taraia Object \u2014 a visual anomaly seen in satellite and other imagery \u2014 is Earhart's aircraft. They are now awaiting additional clearances from local authorities as they work through the permit approvals, and cannot go later this year due to the start of cyclone season.",
      "The underwater object has been visible in photos dating back to 1938, the year after Earhart and Noonan disappeared.",
      "Researchers previously said there is\u00a0\"very strong\" evidence\u00a0that the object, which is in a lagoon on Nikumaroro, a small island in Kiribati about halfway between Australia and Hawaii, is the iconic aviator's plane. Some, however, have expressed skepticism. \"We've looked there in that spot, and there's nothing there,\" Ric Gillespie, executive director of the International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery, told NBC News in July.",
      "A team of researchers from Purdue and the Archaeological Legacy Institute plan to take photos and videos of the site, then use magnetometers and sonar devices to scan the area. The item will then be dredged and lifted from the water so researchers can attempt to identify it.",
      "Last year, an expedition team\u00a0captured a sonar image\u00a0in the Pacific Ocean that appeared to resemble Earhart's plane resting at the bottom of the sea. It\u00a0turned out to be\u00a0a rock formation.",

      "In Miami-Dade County Public Schools, about 2,550 students have entered the district from another country so far this school year - down from nearly 14,000 last year, and more than 20,000 the year before that. School board member Luisa Santos, who attended district schools herself as a young immigrant, said the trend is \"a sad reality.\"",
      "\"I was one of those arrivals when I was 8 years old,\" Santos said. \"And this country and our public schools - I'll never get tired of saying it - gave me everything.\"",

      "The drops in immigrant students add to strains on enrollment at many traditional public schools, which have seen overall numbers dip due to demographic changes and students opting for alternatives like private schools and homeschooling.

      "Reeves' district is home to one of Alabama's largest Hispanic student populations, with about 60% identifying as Hispanic. But Reeves said the district's newcomer academy at a local high school hasn't been enrolling any new students.",
      "\"That's just not happening this year with the closure of the border,\" said Reeves, who expects the hit to his budget from enrollment declines will cost him about 12 teacher positions.",
      "One Sunday morning in August, Edna, a 63-year-old immigrant from El Salvador, got the call she had been dreading. Her friend, a mother from Guatemala with seven young children, had been detained in Lake Worth, Florida, on immigration charges while she was out grabbing a treat for her kids' breakfast.",
      "The family had prepared for this moment. There were legal documents in place granting temporary custody of the children to Edna, who asked to be identified only by her first name because she fears immigration enforcement.",
      "\"I'll be here, and we'll be OK,\" she recalled telling the oldest child, a 12-year-old boy.",
      "In the weeks that followed, Edna stayed home with two younger kids and got their five older siblings on the bus each day to attend Palm Beach County public schools, where enrollment has fallen by more than 6,000 students this year. One day in September, all seven children boarded a plane to Guatemala to be reunited with their mom, leaving behind neighborhood friends, band practices, and the only life they had ever known.",
      "\"My house feels like a garden without flowers,\" Edna said. \"They're all gone.\"",
      "The family is now living in a rural part of Guatemala, out of reach of phone service. School there had already started for the year and the mother, who did not attend school herself as a child, was keeping them home and weighing whether to enroll them next year, Edna said.",
      "The declines in the numbers of immigrants coming to the U.S. were already becoming evident in school registration numbers this summer.",
      "Effects showing in Denver, Chicago, Houston, Boston areas",
      "Denver Public Schools enrolled 400 new-to-country students this summer, compared to 1,500 during the previous summer. Outside Chicago, Waukegan Community Unified School District 60 signed up 100 fewer new immigrant students. And administrators in the Houston Independent School District shuttered the Las Americas Newcomer School, a program dedicated to children who are new to the U.S., after its enrollment fell to just 21 students from 111 last year.",
      "The shift is visible in places like Chelsea, Massachusetts, a city outside Boston that has long been a destination for new immigrants. The 6,000-student Chelsea Public Schools system has attracted Central Americans looking for affordable housing and, more recently, the state housed newly-arrived Haitians in shelters there. This year, the usual influx of newcomers didn't materialize.",
      "\"This year has been different. Much more quiet,\" said Daniel Mojica, director of Chelsea's parent information center.",
      "Over the summer, 152 newcomers signed up for Chelsea Public Schools, compared to 592 new-to-country students the previous summer.",
      "Some are also picking up and leaving. Since January, 844 students have withdrawn from the district, compared to 805 during the same period last year. Mojica said a greater share of students leaving - roughly a quarter - are returning to their native countries.",
      "He attributes that partly to the presence of masked Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers walking the city's streets.",

      "San Diego principal says academics not only aspects of kids' lives hit",
      "In San Diego, Principal Fernando Hernandez has enrolled dozens of newcomer students from across Latin America over the past couple of years. Many made the treacherous journey through the jungles of the Darien Gap before setting up camp in a park near Perkins K-8 school.",
      "About a third of students at the school are homeless. Staff members have become experts on supporting kids who are facing adversity. As more newcomers arrived, Hernandez watched as Mexican American students switched up their playground slang to be better understood by their new classmates from Venezuela, Colombia and Peru.",
      "But so far this school year, he hasn't enrolled a single newcomer student. Other families did not return when the new school year began.",
      "Hernandez fears the toll of the disruption will extend far beyond students' academic progress. He worries students are missing out on chances to learn how to show empathy, to share, to disagree, to understand each other.",

The bill would compel the release of flight logs, travel records, names of individuals and entities referenced in any Epstein case and internal Justice Department communications within 30 days of the legislation's passage.

    "summary": "The Federal Aviation Administration says it is lifting all restrictions on commercial flights that were imposed during the government shutdown.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Aviation Administration said Sunday it was lifting all restrictions on commercial flights that were imposed at 40 major airports during the country's longest government shutdown.",
      "Airlines were given permission to resume their regular flight schedules beginning Monday at 6 a.m. EST, the agency said.",
      "The announcement was made in a joint statement by Transportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy and FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford.",
      "Citing safety concerns as staffing shortages grew at air traffic control facilities during the shutdown, the FAA issued an unprecedented order to limit traffic in the skies. It had been in place since Nov. 7, affecting thousands of flights across the country.",
      "Impacted airports included large hubs in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and Atlanta.",
      "The flight cuts started at 4% and later grew to 6% before the FAA on Friday rolled the restrictions back to 3%, citing continued improvements in air traffic controller staffing since the record 43-day shutdown ended on Nov. 12.",
      "The number of flights canceled this weekend was at its lowest point since the order took effect and was well below the 3% cuts FAA was requiring for Saturday and Sunday. Data from aviation analytics firm Cirium showed that less than 1% of all flights were canceled this weekend. The flight tracking website FlightAware said 149 flights were cut Sunday and 315 were canceled on Saturday.",
      "The FAA statement said an agency safety team recommended the order be rescinded after \"detailed reviews of safety trends and the steady decline of staffing-trigger events in air traffic control facilities.\"",
      "The statement said the FAA \"is aware of reports of non-compliance by carriers over the course of the emergency order. The agency is reviewing and assessing enforcement options.\" It did not elaborate.",
      "Cancellations hit their highest point Nov. 9, when airlines cut more than 2,900 flights because of the FAA order, ongoing controller shortages and severe weather in parts of the country. Conditions began to improve throughout last week as more controllers returned to work amid news that Congress was close to a deal to end the shutdown. That progress also prompted the FAA to pause plans for further rate increases.",
      "The agency had initially aimed for a 10% reduction in flights. Duffy had said worrisome safety data showed the move was necessary to ease pressure on the aviation system and help manage worsening staffing shortages at air traffic control facilities as the shutdown entered its second month and flight disruptions began to pile up.",
      "Air traffic controllers were among the federal employees who had to continue working without pay throughout the shutdown. They missed two paychecks during the impasse.",
      "Duffy hasn't shared the specific safety data that prompted the cuts, but he cited reports during the shutdown of planes getting too close in the air, more runway incursions and pilot concerns about controllers' responses.",
      "Airline leaders have expressed optimism that operations would rebound in time for the Thanksgiving travel period after the FAA lifted its order.",

In a campaign video, Evans pledged to challenge Mr. Trump: \"With your vote, I'll take on Trump and demand the community safety we deserve.\"",
      "Speaking to CBS News after her victory, Evans discussed a series of plans. She said she will make it a first priority to expedite the processing of DUI and domestic violence cases \"to make sure we're being good stewards of public safety.\"",
      "Evans said she will also monitor for \u2013 and take legal action against \u2013 any \"federal overreach\" into the city by the Trump administration, which has already triggered legal battles with other U.S. cities this year, from Washington, D.C. to Portland to Los Angeles.",
      "Evans is one of more than 5,000 Justice Department employees to quit, retire or face termination since January, according to a review by the Justice Connection group, which is a support organization for ousted and former Justice Department workers.",
      "Stacey Young, the Justice Connection founder and executive director, told CBS News that \"federal prosecutors are deeply committed to public service, and more are pursuing that mission through elected office when staying at the Justice Department becomes infeasible.

      "Rubio's announcement and the arrival of the USS Gerald R. Ford mark a major moment in what the Trump administration says is a counterdrug operation but has been seen as an escalating pressure tactic against Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "Cartel de los Soles' designation as a foreign terrorist organization is set to go into effect on Nov. 24, Rubio said in a statement. He alleged the cartel is headed by Maduro and \"other high-ranking individuals of the illegitimate Maduro regime who have corrupted Venezuela's military, intelligence, legislature, and judiciary.\"",
      "\"Neither Maduro nor his cronies represent Venezuela's legitimate government,\" Rubio added. \"Cartel de los Soles by and with other designated FTOs including Tren de Aragua and the Sinaloa Cartel are responsible for terrorist violence throughout our hemisphere as well as for trafficking drugs into the United States and Europe.\"",
      "Speaking to reporters Sunday night after the announcement was made, President Trump said, \"We may be having some discussions with Maduro, and we'll see how that turns out. They would like to talk.\"",
      "The U.S. has asserted that Maduro is complicit with armed criminal gangs that smuggle drugs into the U.S., allegations that Maduro has rejected. And over the last two months, the U.S. military has\u00a0conducted strikes against at least 22 vessels it alleges were ferrying drugs from South America to the U.S., killing at least 83 people.",
      "\"Through unwavering commitment and the precise use of our forces, we stand ready to combat the transnational threats that seek to destabilize our region,\" Adm. Alvin Holsey, commander of U.S. Southern Command, said Sunday in a statement announcing the USS Ford's arrival in the Caribbean Sea.",
      "\"The USS Gerald R. Ford Carrier Strike Group's deployment represents a critical step in reinforcing our resolve to protect the security of the Western Hemisphere and the safety of the American Homeland,\" he added. Southern Command is the primary combatant unit for operations in the Caribbean and South America.",
      "The Ford rounds off the largest buildup of U.S. firepower in the region in generations, in what Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has dubbed Operation Southern Spear. The Ford's carrier strike group, which includes squadrons of fighter jets and guided-missile destroyers, transited the Anegada Passage near the British Virgin Islands on Sunday morning, the Navy said.",
      "Rear Adm. Paul Lanzilotta, who commands the Ford's carrier strike group, said it will bolster an already large force of American warships to \"protect our nation's security and prosperity against narco-terrorism in the Western Hemisphere.\"",
      "The administration has insisted that the buildup of warships is focused on stopping the flow of drugs into the U.S., but it has released no evidence to support its assertions that those killed in the boats were \"narco-terrorists.\"",
      "President Trump said Friday that he's \"sort of\" decided how to proceed on Venezuela, as\u00a0top officials\u00a0weigh potential military operations in the Latin American country. \"I sort of have made up my mind\" about the administration's next steps in Venezuela, he told CBS News aboard Air Force One, but \"I can't tell you what it would be.\"",
      "Top Trump administration officials, military and senior staff gathered at the White House for at least the third day in a row on Friday to discuss possible military operations in Venezuela, according to sources familiar with the matter. Vice President JD Vance, Hegseth, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Dan Caine and Secretary of State Marco Rubio were among those who spoke with Mr. Trump at the White House on Friday, the sources said.",
      "Venezuela was also discussed as part of the president's daily intelligence briefing on Wednesday. CBS News has\u00a0previously reported\u00a0that Hegseth, Caine and other military officials presented Mr. Trump on Wednesday with options for potential operations in\u00a0Venezuela\u00a0in the coming days, including possible strikes on land.",
      "Meanwhile, Venezuela announced Tuesday that it was\u00a0launching a massive military exercise\u00a0across the country, reportedly involving some 200,000 forces.",
      "Many people both inside Venezuela, including Maduro himself, and observers outside the country believe the increased U.S. military pressure is\u00a0aimed at forcing Maduro out of office.",
      "When asked\u00a0in a recent interview with \"60 Minutes\" if Maduro's \"days were numbered,\" Mr. Trump responded, \"I would say yeah. I think so, yeah.\" Mr. Trump\u00a0last month also confirmed\u00a0that he had authorized covert CIA operations in Venezuela.",
      "The president has justified the attacks on drug boats by saying the U.S. is in \"armed conflict\" with drug cartels while claiming the boats are operated by foreign terror organizations. He has faced pushback from leaders in the region, the U.N. human rights chief and lawmakers, including some Republicans, who have pressed for more information on who is being targeted and the legal justification for the boat strikes.",
      "Senate Republicans\u00a0recently voted to reject legislation that would have put a check on Mr. Trump's ability to launch an attack against Venezuela without congressional authorization. Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska were the only Republicans to support the resolution, which failed in a 49-51 vote.",
      "Experts disagree on whether or not American warplanes may be used to strike land targets inside Venezuela. Either way, the 100,000-ton warship is sending a message, one expert said.",
      "\"This is the anchor of what it means to have U.S. military power once again in Latin America,\" Elizabeth Dickinson, the International Crisis Group's senior analyst for the Andes region, told The Associated Press. \"And it has raised a lot of anxieties in Venezuela but also throughout the region.

    "story": [
      "Federal immigration agents on Saturday began operations in Charlotte, North Carolina, the latest target of President Trump's widening crackdown on illegal immigration, the Department of Homeland Security announced.",
      "DHS said it officially launched an operation dubbed \"Charlotte's Web\" to target immigrants living in the Charlotte area illegally. CBS News first reported last week that the Trump administration was preparing to deploy teams of Border Patrol agents to Charlotte, including outspoken Commander Gregory Bovino, who had led a weekslong, controversial crackdown in the Chicago area.",
      "\"We are surging DHS law enforcement to Charlotte to ensure Americans are safe and public safety threats are removed,\" DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement. \"There have been too many victims of criminal illegal aliens.\"",
      "Videos posted on social media on Saturday appeared to depict green-uniformed Border Patrol agents carrying out arrests in the Charlotte region. A Homeland Security official told CBS News that federal immigration agents carried out nearly 100 arrests in the Charlotte area on Saturday. That number includes immigration arrests by both Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement.",
      "Scores of Border Patrol agents are expected to participate in the Charlotte operation, which could involve armored vehicles and special operations teams, according to internal government documents obtained by CBS News.",
      "The Trump administration's effort has already garnered strong criticism from Democratic officials in North Carolina, including Charlotte Mayor Vi Lyles, who said in a statement alongside other local leaders that the operation was \"causing unnecessary fear and uncertainty.\"",
      "After the operation in Charlotte, Border Patrol's focus is expected to shift to New Orleans, where officials are planning to send as many as 200 agents to launch an operation dubbed the \"Catahoula Crunch,\" CBS News reported Friday.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm Margaret Brennan in Washington.",
      "And this week on Face the Nation: The shutdown is over, but the problems that led to the crisis persist, and politicians are scrambling to make prices affordable for Americans.",
      "Affordability is the new buzzword in Washington, and President Trump is testing ideas to help consumers, including potential tariff dividends and 50-year mortgages. Those may be a tough sell, but Mr. Trump did move to help consumers by rolling back tariffs on some food imports, like bananas, beef and tomatoes.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "DONALD TRUMP (President of the United States): There's been a little bit of a rollback with some foods, like coffee as an example, where the prices of coffee were a little bit high. Now they will be on the low side in a very short period of time.",
      "In terms of affordability, it's not a good word for the Democrats. It's a good word for us, because our prices are much lower and will soon be much, much lower.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: One price spike that can't be fixed by easing tariffs, health care premiums, especially for those covered under Obamacare.",
      "We will look for solutions for that fix and more with two members of the House Problem Solvers Caucus, New York Democrat Tom Suozzi and Nebraska Republican Don Bacon, along with Dr. and Louisiana Republican Senator Bill Cassidy and New Hampshire Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen.",
      "And as we move into a new era of warfare, what does our military need for readiness? We will talk with the secretary of the army, Dan Driscoll.",
      "It's all just ahead on Face the Nation.",
      "Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation.",
      "Although we're all trying to put the pain of the shutdown behind us, the 43-day standoff on Capitol Hill exposed and amplified the need to address the rising cost of health care premiums. And our CBS News polling out today shows that two-thirds of Americans think their premiums will increase in the coming months.",
      "We begin today with two members of the so-called House Problem Solvers Caucus, New York Democrat Tom Suozzi and Nebraska Republican Don Bacon.",
      "Good morning. Good to have you here in a bipartisan conversation. You both recognize there's a problem here.",
      "Congressman Bacon, let me start with you.",
      "One out of every five dollars in this country that is spent goes to health care. We know these COVID era tax credit subsidies for Obamacare will go away at the end of the month. That's going to hit about 22 of the 24 million Americans who use that program. What can you do in the next six weeks to make costs go down in January?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DON BACON (R-Nebraska): Well, we need a temporary extension of these tax credits to keep these prices down.",
      "Republicans nor Democrats want to see premiums skyrocket. And they will if these expire with nothing in its place. That's why I worked with Tom Suozzi and other Democrats and Republicans to find a compromise. We just don't want to do a clean extension. Most Republicans don't anyway.",
      "So we think there needs to be some caps on income, and we want to assure all these credits go directly to lowering people's premiums. And, right now, about a third of the money doesn't make it to the premiums.",
      "So those are some reforms that we would like to see. And if we can get those accomplished, then we can extend these tax credits and keep these \u2013 the prices lower. But we do need a longer-term fix. The Affordable Care Act is unaffordable. And I think we need to have this extension to give us time to work on something bigger and deeper and that will help lower costs overall.",
      "But I'm proud to work with Tom Suozzi on this. And I appreciate his partnership.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman Suozzi, I understand this is a two-year proposed extension of those enhanced premium tax credits and an income cap that phases out for those making between $200,000 to $400,000.",
      "But when you look at the breakdown, though, that's a pretty small portion of the overall recipients of the tax credits. It's like less than 10 percent. So what does this accomplish? How does this make it more affordable and fair?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI (D-New York): Well, it helps everybody else who makes under $200,000 dramatically.",
      "And the number one concern people have in America is affordability. And health care affordability is right at the top of the list.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How much more affordable?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: So we need to do something to extend these premium tax credits.",
      "It'll save people thousands and thousands of dollars, literally $1,000 a month for some people. So it'll be dramatically more affordable. The people who make above $400,000 are the teeny little percentage of people that are not \u2013 a very small group of people that would benefit from the existing tax credits.",
      "Most of the people are below $200,000. That $200,000 to $400,000 is a way to taper it off, so there's not a cliff.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And how much Democratic support do you have for this at this point?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: I think that Democrats are going to strongly back the idea of extending premium tax credits, so that we can keep people's insurance affordable.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Even with these caps?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: So, we have got to come up with this compromise and \u2013 even with the caps, yes..",
      "People \u2013 Democrats have always said that they want to direct the policy towards lower- and middle-income folks. People making under $400,000 a year is our \u2013 our bread-and-butter issues, that we want to try and make things affordable for those folks.",
      "So \u2013 and that will be like literally 95 percent, 99 percent of the people that are affected right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman Bacon, sorry. Go ahead.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DON BACON: I was going to say, and Republicans, we pushed back on the thought of someone earning $600,000 getting all these tax credits.",
      "So when I listened to the Speaker \u2013 or Leader Thune, that was one of his big concerns on these. So that's why I wanted to ensure that we had this in our framework.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But a tweak with a not permanent, just a two-year extension. Republicans haven't really been proposing a lot of alternative Obamacare options here.",
      "Do you think the entire system needs to be rebooted? And when will we see that plan?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DON BACON: Well, I do think Republicans and Democrats are going to have to sit down at the table and figure out, what can we really do besides just throw more money at this?",
      "Right now, the premiums are just going up so much faster than inflation. It's unsustainable. And \u2013 but we can't do a Republican-only fix. It's not going to work. You're not going to get 60 votes in the Senate to do it.",
      "And I know some folks propose that back in Congress: Let's go up with our plan. Well, it can't just be a Republican plan if we want to pass something. So we got to sit down with Democrats and figure out, what can we do? And there's some good ideas out there.",
      "So, for example, I have heard, if we can directly subsidize high-risk people and put them in a separate pool and just lower their premiums through subsidies, and then the \u2013 let's call it the healthier folks, their premiums are going to go down significantly if we do that.",
      "So there's different concepts that we can do to \u2013 that can have an impact. But it's going to have to be a bipartisan way forward. It's not going to be a Republican-only bill, because you will never get it passed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "Congressman Suozzi, I mean, Aetna pulled out\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 of the Obamacare marketplace this year after CVS said they expected to lose as much as $400 million. Other big insurance companies have been pulling out.",
      "If insurance companies themselves are having problems with Obamacare, do Democrats need to be more open to broader reforms of the Affordable Care Act?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: Yes, we absolutely should be looking at any kind of reform. I want to mend it, not end it.",
      "You know that over the past decade that there have been over 70 attempts, mainly by the Republicans, not guys like Don Bacon, who's a very reasonable guy, to try and get rid of Obamacare altogether. We think that's a terrible idea.",
      "But if people want to try and make it a better system to make health care more affordable in America and to get health care to more people, we should be doing that. That's what the people want. That's what reasonable people in Congress want. We should be working together to try and expand health care coverage, lower prices for everybody, and make health care more effective and less expensive for people.",
      "Now, that's not going to happen with everybody yelling and screaming at each other. Everybody who says \"Why don't you just?\" doesn't know what the hell they're talking about. You cannot solve complicated problems in an environment of fear and anger. You need reasonable people to sit down and talk to each other and say, I think this, well, I think that\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: \u2026 and then work your way towards finding compromise. Very hard to do in this toxic environment.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: People like Don Bacon and other members of the Problem Solvers Caucus want to do that type of thing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. Well, but private health care costs are also going up.",
      "But on this topic of toxic environments here, Congressman Suozzi, Democrats, who won elections just a few days ago, credited their wins to this affordability issue and the message focused on that. Can you explain the focus this past week in the House by Democrats on the Jeffrey Epstein files?",
      "Is this a tactic to distract from the failure to extract health care changes or is there something else going on here? I mean, does the speaker putting it to a vote end this issue?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: I think it's a combination of factors, of people shining their lights on the most \u2013 the hot topic at the time.",
      "Jeffrey Epstein, of course, is an important topic. I'm sure I will vote to release his files, but that's not my priority.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: My priority is to focus on the things that the American people care about, affordability, immigration, taxes, crime, and health care. That's what people are fighting about. That's what they're concerned about. That's what we should be focused on in Congress.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Congressman Bacon, does the speaker putting this to a vote end the Epstein issue and get you back onto health care? I mean, the speaker said this is all a political exercise. Certainly, the families of the victims don't think it is.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DON BACON: I think the speaker realizes the train has left the station on this. Let's rip the Band-Aid off and get it done.",
      "And I wish the president realized that. The more the White House pushes back on this, it's \u2013 it just looks bad, right? I mean, it was \u2013 the attorney general came out and said, all these white binders, we're going to release all this information, and then a month later said, oh, no, we're not.",
      "So it's been a P.R. blunder from the beginning. And I think the speaker is right. This is going to happen, so let's get it done and vote on it. And we got to realize it still has to go to the Senate. Then it has to go to the president for signature.",
      "Meanwhile, our Oversight Committee is releasing thousands and thousands of pages of evidence concerning Epstein. So, for example, like 3,000 pages was released late last week. So the Oversight Committee, Republicans and Democrats, are putting out the data. They're putting out subpoenas.",
      "I think it's already working, but, like Tom, when this comes on the floor, I'm going to vote yes on it. I want transparency.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DON BACON: We want to protect the victims.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DON BACON: But everything else should just be \u2013 should be open.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You also, Congressman Bacon, run the Cyber Subcommittee. I want to ask you about something significant this past week, that A.I. firm Anthropic said that Chinese state-sponsored hackers used their technology to automate break-ins and carry out the first cyber espionage operation largely using A.I.",
      "It hit like 30 different companies. What can you tell us about the scope and the targets of this attack?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DON BACON: I can't say much more than what was just released, other than I can say this.",
      "China has replaced Russia as most formidable cyber threat. They have much higher technology. They are using A.I., which gives you a lot more capability in finding weaknesses in your adversaries' cyber defenses.",
      "What concerns me more than anything, while China is attacking us every single day and Russia, we have had no commander in charge of Cyber Command for over eight months. The White House or the president fired the Cyber Command commander over eight months ago and has not replaced him.",
      "Also, the top two positions at the National Security Agency, the top two are vacant for over eight months. And we have been cutting CISA, which is the agency that protects our private sector, our businesses, our infrastructure, and we have cut it by about a third.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DON BACON: And so our cyber capabilities are going backwards. We don't \u2013 we're rudderless in a time where China is attacking us every day. And that's something that really concerns me.",
      "And I have been pushing the White House to deal with this and to confront the cyber threat.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. Well, we will continue following that important story.",
      "Congressmen, thank you for trying to be problem solvers with us today.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DON BACON: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Face the Nation will be back in a minute. Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We want to turn now to some of the challenges faced by the U.S. military.",
      "And we're joined by the Secretary of the Army, Dan Driscoll.",
      "Good morning. Thank you for being here.",
      "DANIEL DRISCOLL (U.S. Secretary of the Army): Thank you so much for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: A lot to get to with you.",
      "Just quickly on news of day, the president did say he sort of made up his mind on Venezuela. I know this is the Marines, this is the Navy that are deployed. But does the Venezuelan army pose any kind of threat to the U.S. if action is taken?",
      "SECRETARY DANIEL DRISCOLL: I think that the president and secretary of war have spent a lot of time thinking about, what is the best thing they can do for the American people?",
      "And I can speak from the Army's perspective, which is, we have a lot of training in that part of the world. We're reactivating our jungle school in Panama. We would be ready to act on whatever the president and secwar needed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But no orders beyond these exercises at this point?",
      "SECRETARY DANIEL DRISCOLL: I \u2013 we don't talk about those kinds of things, but we would be ready if asked.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. OK.",
      "I do want to ask you about what has been happening with this shutdown. The government's now funded through January 30. You did get from Congress full- year funding for Veterans Affairs and military construction, a few other measures in this short-term bill.",
      "But in \u2013 we have seen the shutdown hit military bases and hit military families, costly, $400 million or more in emergency loans from USAA. How do you insulate the force so that the next shutdown doesn't hit these families the way it did this time?",
      "SECRETARY DANIEL DRISCOLL: I think the shutdown is indicative of one of the bigger problems that we have a nation have had.",
      "And so if you look back for the last 30 or 40 years, one of the reasons we've had such bad outcomes, when we spend the American taxpayers' hard- earned dollars, and we go buy things that our soldiers will need to fight, when we build things where our soldiers and their families will live, we are such a bad customer, because when you're on the other side of the deal with us and you have to deal with shutdowns \u2013 I mean, this shutdown will take months and months for us to get back and going on these projects.",
      "And this is part of the calcification of our system that, under President Trump, we are uniquely able to try to go after a lot of these things and actually get our Army and their families living in better areas, and get our soldiers ready for the modern fight. And the shutdown does not help.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you about the modern fight.",
      "Tom Cotton, who is the chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, told our Olivia Gazis here at CBS that the threat to military sites and large civilian gatherings is severe and growing. He cited gaps in law enforcement authorities. Some of them lapsed during the shutdown, I understand.",
      "And he's talking about trying to close enforcement gaps when it comes to drones. What authorizations do you need?",
      "SECRETARY DANIEL DRISCOLL: So, under Secretary of War Hegseth, the United States Army has been put in charge of the counterdrone threat for the Pentagon.",
      "And then we are working hand in fist \u2013 or hand in glove with the broader law enforcement agencies. We just last week had a meeting right outside the White House, where what we are trying to do, because this problem is different from nearly anything we've faced in a long time. It is a flying IED.",
      "And so this IED\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: IED, the explosive.",
      "SECRETARY DANIEL DRISCOLL: IED, improvised explosive device. They're cheap. You can 3-D print them at home, and they cross borders incredibly quickly.",
      "And so what you basically need is a digital layer to exchange information and exchange sensing and allow the closest person on the ground or the closest effector on the ground to be able to take out a drone. And Senator Cotton is right. I mean, this is the threat of humanity's lifetime.",
      "What's occurring in Ukraine, what's happening in Russia, if you look at the speed and scale of the devastation that can come from drones, we as a federal government have got to lead on it. But I'm really optimistic. This is actually something we are doing right. We are partnering with both federal law enforcement.",
      "In a couple of weeks, we're having the Sheriff's Association come. We were just at the NYPD. We're including all of the different law enforcement agencies, thinking about the borders and the ports and the upcoming NFL games and Olympics and World Cup.",
      "Like, this is something we as a nation can lead on. And so, under President Trump's leadership, we are moving fast at this problem.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And this is about radar jamming of drones to take them out, not exploding them?",
      "SECRETARY DANIEL DRISCOLL: So you \u2013 the problem with the drone fight is, you need all sorts of layered defense. One solution does not work. If you just try to jam them, if you look at what's happening in Ukraine, people have started to hardwire drones.",
      "And so you can't do R.F. jamming on a hardwired drone. And so there are things like net guns that are coming back. We're using all sorts of solutions and tools, and it makes it even more complicated when you're by an airport and you're doing it in your own homeland. You just have different authorities.",
      "And so a lot of this is a human problem of communication, command and control and having a layered set of solutions that you can use for any given problem.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you're talking about here at the homeland, things like the U.S. hosting the Olympics, the World Cup, even just the Super Bowl games that are coming up.",
      "SECRETARY DANIEL DRISCOLL: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Should there be restrictions in this country on who is able to own and operate drones?",
      "SECRETARY DANIEL DRISCOLL: I'm pretty optimistic that we will be able to figure out a solution where we will know what is in the sky at every moment across our country all at once.",
      "And so if you think of the president's\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But we're not there yet.",
      "SECRETARY DANIEL DRISCOLL: We're not there yet.",
      "But under the president's Golden Dome, I would think about this like a golden mini dome, where, if you took one of the sites for the World Cup, we are heavily focused on being able to see everything in the area, have all of the interceptors we will need, have all of the training for all of the different forces that will have to be able to act.",
      "And so to your specific question, I think we are trying to design a system so that Americans are able to fly drones, so that commercial companies like Amazon \u2013 like, the future of delivery, in a lot of ways, is commercial drones. And so we will just have to deconflict the skies, working with the FAA.",
      "But this is a big topic. I check in with Secretary of War Hegseth on this almost weekly.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So when we last saw the president of Ukraine, Zelenskyy, at the White House, he brought up to President Trump, on camera, we've got great drones we want to sell to the United States or provide to the United States.",
      "You referred to Ukraine as the only Silicon Valley of warfare right now. What do you mean by that? Are they really ahead of the United States on innovation?",
      "SECRETARY DANIEL DRISCOLL: I think, if you look at what's happening, Operation Spider's Web in Russia, the Ukrainians used probably a couple hundred thousand dollars worth of drones and took out almost $10 billion worth of equipment in Russia.",
      "And Russia's in that fight. And so I think what is amazing about our country is, we are able to recognize where we need to innovate quickly. And what we're doing for drones, completely differently, I think, than we have done as an army in probably 50 or 60 years, is, we are welcoming in American industry.",
      "So we just did an A.I. war game where we invited 15 of the top CEOs in the nation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY DANIEL DRISCOLL: They were worth probably $18 trillion in enterprise value. And we said, how do you \u2013 can you please help us? What do you have in your tech innovation pipeline to help us with data in contested environments? How do we do logistics 6,000 miles away if we're facing an enemy who's trying to contest us?",
      "And we are working with them, no joke, daily to basically take their innovation and apply it to this problem.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But what I heard you saying there is, you look at the battlefield in Ukraine as kind of like a test lab for where warfare is going.",
      "SECRETARY DANIEL DRISCOLL: Yes. Yes. Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Can you convince some of your fellow Republicans that there is value in that fight, in terms of, you know, those who are so isolationist they don't want to be involved in Ukraine, even financially?",
      "SECRETARY DANIEL DRISCOLL: Well, I don't think I have talked to a single person who has said we shouldn't be learning from what's occurring in Ukraine. All of our equipment, all of the exquisite features we will need are definitionally going to come \u2013 the data set that the Ukrainians are getting for their generative A.I. models of when they have drones and they're flying and they're learning and they're doing counterdrone, and they're taking all of this information from their sensors and trying to figure out what's going on.",
      "There's not a single person I know that doesn't think that is an incredible treasure trove of information for future warfare. I think a lot of the questions are, how do we actually execute on the president's agenda of peace in that part of the world?",
      "Where \u2013 I have not been to the White House where it has not come up that we just want peace, so that the American industrial base can thrive everywhere.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SECRETARY DANIEL DRISCOLL: And we have to focus on that part of the world unnecessarily right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you're at the Department of War.",
      "SECRETARY DANIEL DRISCOLL: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you announced that the Army wants to buy a million drones over the next two to three years. Navy, Marines, Air Force, they will obviously be very involved in any war in the Pacific, but you've got to defend those American bases.",
      "SECRETARY DANIEL DRISCOLL: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So how do you think of the threat from China there? Because I have read that you think they're ahead of America.",
      "SECRETARY DANIEL DRISCOLL: So we're working on something with Congress called SkyFoundry.",
      "And basically the idea is to, again, do it right from the beginning. What the Army has historically gotten wrong in the last couple of decades is, we're either all in or all out, meaning we either use our organic industrial base and we make the drones ourselves, or we say, this is too complicated for us, we're going to have private industry do it.",
      "We are not doing that with drones, because, if you look at \u2013 Ukraine is manufacturing four million a year. China, I think, is at 12 to 14 million drones a year.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Wow.",
      "SECRETARY DANIEL DRISCOLL: And we as a nation will have to have our private sector able to help us.",
      "And so what we are going to do is, we are going to invest in things like sensors and brushless motors and circuit boards and a lot of the components that are really hard for the private sector to get right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY DANIEL DRISCOLL: The United States Army is going to build those on our bases and empower the private sector to purchase from us. And so we will make drones, our private partners will make drones, and we will catch up and surpass the Chinese incredibly quickly.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Secretary, thank you for your time.",
      "And I do want to make the point that you are taking questions. And that is unusual these days, since the Pentagon has restricted access to reporters. And we think it's important here that the American people hear about their own security as well as the military's three million or more employees. So thank you.",
      "We'll be right back.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Trump administration has launched another immigration enforcement operation, this time in Charlotte, North Carolina, a blue city with one of the fastest growing immigrant populations in the country.",
      "The operation, called Charlotte's Web by the Department of Homeland Security, started Saturday. Federal agents from the CBP, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, have been seen making arrests, questioning gardeners, patrolling a Home Depot parking lot, and smashing windows.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to \"FACE THE NATION.\"",
      "On Friday, we spoke with the chairman of one of the Senate committees responsible for crafting health care legislation. Louisiana's Bill Cassidy, who is also a doctor.",
      "We began by showing him what the president is thinking of for a health care fix.",
      "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
      "DONALD TRUMP (President Of The United States): I'm calling today for insurance companies not to be paid, but for the money, this massive amount of money, to be paid directly to the people of our country, so that they can buy their own health care, which will be far better and far less expensive than the disaster known as Obamacare.",
      "(END VIDEO CLIP)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So are you, Senator, coordinating with the White House on this proposal?",
      "SENATOR BILL CASSIDY (R-LA): So, we're absolutely in communication with the White House and with the administration, because there's a lot of stuff that you have to work out to do that.",
      "But let me give a little meat on the bones of what the president's speaking about. If you look at an Obamacare policy now, there's a $6,000 deductible. Democrats are fighting to lower the premiums. You lower a premium on something which has a $6,000 deductible, it's basically a catastrophic policy.",
      "Now, I like to speak to the cost of being insured, not just the cost of the health insurance. The president is proposing that we take the $26 billion that would be going to insurance companies if we just do a straight out extension. And, by the way, 20 percent of that $26 billion, 20 percent will go for profit and administration overhead. Give it directly to the American people in an account in which 100 percent of the money is used for them to purchase health care on their own terms.",
      "Now \u2013 now, that makes them an informed consumer. It also helps address the need to have coverage for that deductible. And if they get that policy with a higher deductible, they can actually lower their premium. It's a sweet spot. Lower premiums help with the deductible, making the patience the informed consumer. The president and I are united. We should all be united about that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the president' economic adviser, Kevin Hassett, was on this program last Sunday. He said the president was just brainstorming, things aren't formally put together among Republica senators yet.",
      "But I just want to clarify what you are coordinating with the president on here because, is it to buy your own insurance policy which is kind of complicated, or is it, to use this flexible spending account you've talked about for related health care needs, like a \u2013 are there restrictions on how you can use that money?",
      "SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: So, first, there's two types of premium tax credits. There's the baseline premium tax credit, which was part of Obamacare. That would stay in effect and people would still buy a policy, for example, they get in a car wreck, something disastrous, they need somebody negotiating on their behalf with all the providers. That stays the same.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: What we're talking about, and the shutdown was over, the enhanced premium tax credits. Policies have become so expensive under Obamacare that under Joe Biden Democrats passed another subsidy on top of the first subsidy. That's what we're fighting about. And what Republicans are saying, and I'd like to hope Democrats will too.",
      "Hey, wait a second, if we can have lower premiums and help people with their deductible, by giving the money directly to the patient, by the way, 20 percent doesn't go for insurance company profit and overhead, 100 percent goes for health care, why don't we unite Republicans and Democrats in doing that? That's where the president is. You've got to figure some things out, but we're a lot farther along than you might imagine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, do you want it fix Obamacare, or do you want to eliminate Obamacare?",
      "SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: First, you have to, like, we're going into 2026. That's like a month and a half from now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: And so you've got to work with what you have.",
      "But on the other hand, Obamacare was a top-heavy \u2013 administratively heavy type system in which a lot of money is \u2013 a lot of money and responsibility is taken from individuals and given to insurance companies as one example.",
      "I'm a doctor. I worked for 20 years in a hospital for the uninsured. I found that if you give the patient the power, good things happen. That's supported, by the way, by the medical literature. If the patient is engaged in her health care and the health care of her family, she's going to be a wise shopper, wise for her health and wise for her pocketbook. We need to have a new model. And that model is to engage the patient in her own health care. Doing so is good for her and good for us all.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK, but you said we \u2013 we need to work with what we have. That is, as you just said, you have a short amount of time before the \u2013 the end of the year. Do you think you need to extend the health care tax subsidies that are currently in place until you figure out all the rest of this complicated policy making?",
      "SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: Let me back you up a little bit, Margaret, to say, everybody assumes it's easy just to extend the premium tax credits. The enhanced premium tax credits. It's not that easy. Fifty percent of the states did not plan on them being extended, and they don't have rates as if they were to be extended. So, that means if we pass this mid-December, they've got to recalculate rates in time for, wait a second, by that time we're already into 2026. It's not an easy matter.",
      "And, by the way, did I mention, the policies that people want to lower their premiums for have $6,000 deductibles? It is basically something for insurance companies to make money off of, and for the individual to wade through $6,000 of debt before they can finally access it.",
      "Now, the kind of proposal I am proposing, Republicans are, and I hope Democrats will join, is let's take that money, and we have a mechanism to do so.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: We giving it to the patient. By giving her that money, she can choose a bronze level plan, with is to say lower premiums. So, now her premiums are down, but she has money in an account to help with the deductible. And I think we can figure that out about as easily we can figure out what we would do if we just did a straight out extension.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you want to do all this, though, by the second week of December, when the Democrats have been promised they'll have a vote on an ACA bill of their choice?",
      "SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: Yes. And I tell my Democratic colleagues, first, let's not be Democrats and Republicans. Let's be Americans representing all of Americans. Let's recognize what you're doing just gives money to insurance companies. But we can do it better with lower premiums and with money in accounts to pay deductibles. And then why don't we come together?",
      "There's going to be a Democratic bill and a Republican bill and both fail. Let's do an American bill where the American people benefit.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: And let's work together, collaborate, to lower those premiums and to help them with that first dollar coverage and the \u2013 and the deductible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, we looked and there are about 293,000 Louisianans, your state, enrolled in Obamacare currently. Six weeks from now, those expanded tax credits that you've been talking about will go away for individuals making $62,000 or above. Individuals making less than that amount will see their tax credits shrink.",
      "So, are you telling those hundreds of thousands in Louisiana that that tax credit is going away no matter what? That they should make plans for higher prices?",
      "SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: No. I'm telling them that we are working to make it work better for them. And they would tell you, by the way, wait a second, I got a $6,000 deductible. That does not work for me.",
      "Margaret, I'm a doctor. I would talk to people when they'd come to see me, and they would tell me, I can't afford that, my deductible is too high. That's reality. And that reality is being lost in this discussion.",
      "We've got to do something about sky-high deductible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: Maybe you can afford the premium. You can't afford the policy. Let's lower the cost of having health insurance, focusing by not just on the premium, but the deductible, and I think we can do both.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, even in the private market, health care costs have gone up about six to nine percent when you look at the projections.",
      "SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: Oh, yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But I want to ask you about your oversight rule. Secretary Kennedy has this hand-picked panel of vaccine advisers, you know them at ACIP, they're going to meet in a few days and potentially vote on changing the hepatitis b vaccine schedule for infants. That same vaccine advisory group is also considering the safety of vaccine ingredients, like aluminum, which would impact a number of childhood shots. This should matter for American parents.",
      "Are you comfortable with what they are about to put to a vote?",
      "SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: I'm very concerned about this. As it turns out, my medical practice focused on hepatitis b. And so, we know that because of a recommended dose at birth of hepatitis b vaccine, recommended not mandated, the number of children born contracting hepatitis b at birth or shortly thereafter has decreased from about 20,000 20 years ago to like 200 now. That's 20 \u2013 effectively a clerical error. We have decreased the incidents of chronic hepatitis b by 20,000 people over the last two decades with this kind of recommendation.",
      "And by the way, if you're infected at birth, you're more likely \u2013 you're 95 percent likely to become a chronic carrier. The vaccine is safe. It has been established. And these ingredients they're speaking of have been shown to be safe. This is policy by people who don't understand the epidemiology of hepatitis b or who've grown comfortable with the fact that we've been so successful with our recommendation that now the incident of hepatitis b is so low, they feel like we can rest on our laurels.",
      "I'm a doctor. I have seen people die from vaccine-preventable disease. I want people to be healthy. I want to make America healthy. And you don't start by stopping recommendations that have made us substantially healthier.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the president of the United States also told American women not to take Tylenol or give it to their kids. This is based on a theory that it causes autism somehow. And he also, in a social media post, the same one, called for the measles, mumps, and rubella shot to be broken up into three different shots. That was then endorsed by the acting CDC director.",
      "Are you concerned by this kind of suggestive linkage at the top of the CDC and from the White House?",
      "SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: Again, I'm a doctor, and so I'm going to go where the evidence takes me. And the best evidence is a study out of Sweden with two million children that found no \u2013 no causality, no association, if you will, between taking Tylenol in pregnancy and getting autism. And, of course, that concerns me, because there's going to be a mama out there, again, I'm a doctor, I talk to \u2013 I talk to patients in a \u2013 in a room. And her child has autism. She took Tylenol for a high fever during pregnancy and now blames herself. That's just the way mamas think. And that's wrong. We don't want her to think that.",
      "The best evidence, that there is no relationship. By the way, if you have a high fever during pregnancy, that may be a risk for autism. Now, of course, if you're pregnant, talk to your physician before you take anything. But point being, the best evidence is that there's no relationship between the two. And I don't want women putting themselves on a guilt trip when the best evidence shows not.",
      "By the way, the president has spoken out strongly in favor of immunizations in other cases. And I noted when he got his physical, he got the flu and covid shots. So, the president has demonstrated that he believes in immunization.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But that's why clarifying these statements, I think, is important, since you interpret them differently.",
      "I wonder, do you regret your confirmation vote for Secretary Kennedy?",
      "SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: I smile because every reporter asks me that. You live life forward.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, because these questions run right into a pledge that you extracted from him not to tinker with some of the structures that were set in place to have oversight of these vaccines and this process.",
      "SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: Yes, so you live life forward. Again, you just do. Let the day's own troubles be sufficient for the day. And I'll credit the secretary. He's brought attention to things like ultra processed food that has frankly never received this sort of attention before. And people praise him for that. So, he and I have publicly disagreed on some matters, but I strongly agree with him on others. And so \u2013 so, that's how I'll answer your question.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That sounds like yes.",
      "Is \u2013 if this is your final year in office, sir, will you make overhauling health care your top priority?",
      "SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: Well, I sure hope it's not my final year in office. But I have been thinking about health care for 30 years, because when I worked in a public hospital for the uninsured, I saw the burden it could be on middle income families who have middle income but couldn't afford the insurance or couldn't afford the health care. And so, it's been my priority for 30 years. And I will continue to do that.",
      "And if there is a silver lining \u2013 if there's a silver lining in the shutdown we just had, the silver lining is now we are focused on, how do we make health care more affordable for the American people? That should be our goal, not to be partisan one way or the other. How do we make it more affordable for fellow Americans? If we can accomplish that, I will feel like I have done my job.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, thank you for your time.",
      "And we'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to New Hampshire Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen.",
      "Good morning to you, Senator.",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN (D-NH): Good morning. Nice to be with you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you have spent a good part of the past year trying to get legislation through to extend those Obamacare tax credit subsidies. Last Sunday you crossed the aisle. You agreed to reopen the government, end the shutdown without a guaranteed extension, but with a promise to have some kind of vote on an ACA bill of Democrats own choosing.",
      "Do you have consensus among Democrats that this needs to be a vote simply to extend the tax credits as they stand now, or are you open to a broader reform of Obamacare?",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: From the beginning this shutdown, I have had two goals, one is to get the government up and running again to end the suffering that too many Americans were experiencing because they lost food assistance or they weren't getting paid, federal employees, and the second was to address the high cost of premium \u2013 health insurance that people are looking at because insurance companies are setting rates based on the fact that those premium tax credits are not \u2013 are supposed to go away at the end of this year.",
      "I think people are now very aware of the fact that they are going to see huge rate increases, double for so many people, and an unaffordable cost of health insurance if those premium tax credits go away. And what I think we need to do, and these are conversations that we need to have, is we need to work with our Republican colleagues to try and get a bill that can be supported, that can get through both houses of Congress where we've been talking to our Republicans, Senator Cassidy, throughout the shutdown about what we might be able to agree to. We've been talking to House members on both sides of the aisle. And so now we need to work together.",
      "I agree with Senator Cassidy, this should be a bill that is not partisan, but it should be a bill to extend those premium tax credits because, as everybody has talked about, there is real urgency to get this done. And if we don't address it, then people are going to see huge rate increases.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: So, we can work together. We can extend the credits, but we probably can't implement significant reforms that Senator Cassidy was talking about in the time frame that we've got. So, we need to look, both in the short-term and in the long-term for how we address the cost of health care.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK, so that's an important point there. So, the $26 billion or so that he talks about as the cost for extension of these that he wants to redirect into these cash accounts, these flexible accounts, you're saying, you can't get that done in six weeks' time?",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: No, you can't.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: And, again, there's real urgency to do this. There's some good, bipartisan legislation that has come out of committee in the Senate that I think we should take up, things that would expedite approval of generic drugs and biosimilars, that would address PBM reform, which is a huge cost increase for health care. But that's a longer term issue. Right now we need to address what people are facing in terms of those high rate increases because of the threats that these premium tax credits are going to end.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Just to put a fine point on it. When we heard the congressmen at the top of the program talking about, you know, caps on income and restrictions on who can benefit from those tax credits, can you get your fellow Democrats, who, by the way, are pretty angry at each other, angry at you as well, about this decision to reopen the government, can you get everyone on board, or can you at least get to 60 votes to be able to extend those subsidies with tweaks?",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: Well, first of all, we need to put the shutdown behind us, end the circular firing squad, and remember why we're in this situation. We're in this situation because Donald Trump and Speaker Johnson and the Republican majorities in the House and Senate have refused to address the cost of health care and are trying to throw people off their health care. Can we get to consensus? Well, we need to if we're going to get a bipartisan bill out of the Congress.",
      "I think we've seen and heard from health insurance companies that implementing significant changes in the first year is going to be really difficult to do, almost impossible. But we ought to be able to agree on some changes, like capping the income of people who receive those premium tax credits. Right now 94 percent of people who get the credits earn under $200,000 a year. And the average income for a single recipient is about a little over $30,000 a year. So, most people who are getting these tax credits are not in that high income level.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: And so we should be able to agree on that. We should be able to agree that we don't want any fraud and abuse in the program.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: That's something Republicans and Democrats believe in. So, let's focus on what we can agree to. Let's look at what we can get done in the time frame we have, and recognize there is real urgency to get these premium tax credits extended.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you're going to have this vote around the second week of December, but premiums are already notified out.",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They are already sort of baked in here for \u2013 certainly for Americans who buy government health care. Is it too late to extend open enrollment? I mean Senator Cassidy was saying, like, ship has sailed here.",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: No, we could actually decide that we were willing, as part of this legislation, to extend open enrollment. Obviously, we need support from the administration. But insurance companies, in meeting with the insurance industry, they've indicated that while it would be difficult, they could address some of the challenges around not getting agreement until December. Again, that's why there's urgency to get this done.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about another matter. Survivors of convicted child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, as well as some of the families of those survivors, wrote a letter to lawmakers supporting the release of Justice Department internal communications in regard to his case. In that letter they said, \"there was no middle ground here. There was no hiding behind party affiliation. We will remember your decision at the ballot box.\"",
      "You know this House vote is set to come up this week. Should there be a vote in the Senate? And would you support it to see the release of these documents?",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: Absolutely. We need to release the documents. The American people need to see what's in them. And if President Trump says there's nothing there that he's concerned about, then why doesn't he support release of the documents?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we will see if the Republican leader in the Senate takes up your proposal there. There has not been a commitment to have that kind of vote.",
      "But on Venezuela, since you are ranking member on Senator Foreign Relations, I want to make sure I ask you, the president has said he has sort of made up his mind on what to do about Venezuela. You were one of the very few senators who have received briefings within the past few weeks from Secretaries Rubio and Hegseth regarding the strikes that are being carried out on these small, fast-moving boats. Is there a clear end game here? And is your understanding that ousting Nicolas Maduro from power is part of the administration's plan?",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: I don't think it's clear what the end game is for this administration with respect to Venezuela. They are relying on a legal opinion \u2013 excuse me, in terms of the boat strikes that they have not released. They have finally made it available to members of Congress, but they haven't released it to the public. They are escalating in a way that - - talking about a land strike through special operations that puts at risk our men and women in the military. We have so much fire power now in the Caribbean, the Gerald R. Ford has been taken from the Red Sea so that now we don't have any fire power really in the Middle East as we look at the threats there. We don't have what we need, I think, in the Indo-Pacific, or in Europe. And so, what the president has done here is to put at risk other parts of the world and Americans in other parts of the world for this fascination on trying to get rid of Nicolas Maduro in Venezuela, who clearly is a bad character.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: He's been involved in drug \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Sen. Bill Cassidy, Republican of Louisiana, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Nov. 16, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face the Nation. \u00a0On Friday, we spoke with the Chairman of one of the Senate committees responsible for crafting health care legislation, Louisiana's Bill Cassidy, who is also a doctor. We began by showing him what the President is thinking of for a healthcare fix.",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I'm calling today for insurance companies not to be paid, but for the money, this massive amount of money to be paid directly to the people of our country so that they can buy their own health care, which will be far better and far less expensive than the disaster known as Obamacare.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So are you, Senator, coordinating with the White House on this proposal?",
      "SEN. BILL CASSIDY: So we're absolutely in communication with the White House and with the administration, because there's a lot of stuff that you have to work out to do that. But let me give a little meat on the bones of what the President's speaking about. If you look at an Obamacare policy now, there's a $6,000 deductible. Democrats are fighting to lower the premiums. You lower a premium on something which has $6,000 deductible, it's basically a catastrophic policy. Now, I like to speak of the cost of being insured, not just the cost of the health insurance. The President is proposing that we take the $26 billion that would be going to insurance companies if we just do a straight out extension, and by the way, 20 percent of that $26 billion, 20 percent will go for profit and administrative overhead, give it directly to the American people in an account in which 100 percent of the money is used for them to purchase health care on their own terms. Now- now, that makes them an informed consumer. It also helps address the need to have coverage for that deductible, and if they get that policy with a higher deductible, they can actually lower their premium. It's a sweet spot, lower premiums, help with the deductible, making the patient the informed consumer, the President and I are united. We should all be united about that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the President's economic adviser, Kevin Hassett, was on this program last Sunday. He said the president was just brainstorming, things aren't formally put together among Republican senators yet, but I just want to clarify what you are coordinating with the President on here, because, is it to buy your own insurance policy, which is kind of complicated, or is it to use this flexible spending account you've talked about for related health care needs? Like, are there restrictions on how you can use that money?",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: So first, there's two types of premium tax credits. There's the baseline premium tax credit, which was part of Obamacare, that would stay in effect, and people would still buy a policy. For example, they get in a car wreck, something disastrous. They need somebody negotiating on their behalf with all the providers. That stays the same. What we're talking about the shutdown was over the enhanced premium tax credits. Policies have become so expensive under Obamacare that under Joe Biden, Democrats passed another subsidy on top of the first subsidy. That's what we're fighting about and what Republicans are saying, and I like to hope Democrats will too. Hey, wait a second, if we can have lower premiums and help people with their deductible by giving the money directly to the patient. By the way, 20 percent doesn't go for insurance company profit and overhead. 100percent goes for health care. Why don't we unite Republican and Democrats in doing that? That's where the President is. You got to figure some things out. But we're a lot further along than you might imagine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So do you want to fix Obamacare, or do you want to eliminate Obamacare?",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: First, you have to, like, we're going into 2026. That's like a month and a half from now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: And so you've got to work with what you have. But on the other hand, Obamacare was a top heavy, administratively heavy type system in which a lot of money is a lot of money, and responsibility is taken from individuals and given to insurance companies. As one example, I'm a doctor. I work for 20 years in a hospital for the uninsured. I found that if you give the patient the power, good things happen that's supported, by the way, by the medical literature, if the patient is engaged in her health care and the health care of her family. She's going to be a wise shopper, wise for her health and wise for her pocketbook. We need to have a new model, and that model is to engage the patient in her own health care. Doing so is good for her, good for us all.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, but you said we need to work with what we have. That is, as you just said, you have a short amount of time before the end of the year. Do you think you need to extend the health care tax subsidies that are currently in place until you figure out all the rest of this complicated policy making?",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: Let me back you up just a little bit, Margaret. I'll just say, everybody assumes it's easy just to extend the premium tax credits, the enhanced premium tax credits. It's not that easy. 50 percent of the states did not plan on them being extended, and they don't have rates as if they were to be extended. So that means if we pass this mid December, they've got to recalculate rates in time for, wait a second, by that time, we're already into 2026 it's not an easy matter. And by the way, did I mention the policies that people want to lower the premiums for have $6,000 deductibles. It is basically something for insurance companies to make money off of and for the individual to wade through $6,000 of debt before they can finally access it. Now, the kind of proposal I am proposing Republicans are, and I hope Democrats will join, is, let's take that money, and we have a mechanism to do so. We give it to the patient. By giving her that money, she could choose a bronze level plan, which is to say lower premiums. So now her premiums are down, but she has money in an account to help with the deductible, and I think we can figure that out about as easily as we can figure out what we would do if we just did a straight out extension.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you want to do all this, though, by the second week of December, when the Democrats have been promised they'll have a vote on an ACA bill of their choice.",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: Yes, and I tell my Democratic colleagues first, let's not be Democrats and Republicans. Let's be Americans, representing all of Americans. Let's recognize what you're doing just gives money to insurance companies, but we can do it better with lower premiums and with money and accounts to pay deductibles. And then why don't we come together? There can be a Democratic bill and a Republican bill, and both fail. Let's do an American bill where the American people benefit and this work together, collaborate to lower those premiums and help them with that first dollar coverage in the- in the deductible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So we looked and there are about 293,000 Louisianans, your state, enrolled in Obamacare currently, six weeks from now, those extent expanded tax credits that you've been talking about will go away for individuals making $62,000 or above. Individuals making less than that amount will see their tax credit shrink. So are you telling those hundreds of thousands of Louisianans that that tax credit is going away no matter what, that- that they should make plans\u2013",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: No.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013 for higher prices?",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: I'm telling them that we're I'm telling them that we are working to make it work better for them. And they would tell you, by the way, wait a second, I got a $6,000 deductible that does not work for me. Margaret, I'm a doctor. I would talk to people when they'd come to see me, and they would tell me, I can't afford that. My deductible is too high. That's reality, and that reality is being lost in this discussion. We've got to do something about sky high deductibles. Maybe you can afford the premium. You can't afford the policy. Let's lower the cost of having health insurance, focusing by not just on the premium, but the deductible. And I think we can do both.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, even in the private market, health care costs have gone up up six to 9 percent when you look at the projections. But I want to ask you about your oversight role. Secretary Kennedy has this hand picked panel of vaccine advisors. You know them at ACIP. They're going to meet in a few days and potentially vote on changing the hepatitis B vaccine schedule for infants. That same vaccine advisory group is also considering the safety of vaccine ingredients like aluminum, which would impact a number of childhood shots. This should matter for American parents. Are you comfortable with what they are about to put to a vote?",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: I'm very concerned about this. As it turns out, my medical practice focused on hepatitis B, and so we know that because of a recommended dose at birth of hepatitis B vaccine, recommended, not mandated, the number of children born contracting hepatitis B at birth, or shortly thereafter, has decreased from about 20,000, 20 years ago to like 200 now. That's 20- effectively a clerical error. We have decreased incidence of chronic hepatitis B by 20,000 people over the last two decades with this kind of recommendation. And by the way, if you're infected at birth, you're more likely- you're 95 percent likely to become a chronic carrier. The vaccine is safe. It has been established, and these ingredients they're speaking of have been shown to be safe. This is policy by people who don't understand the epidemiology of hepatitis B, or who have grown comfortable with the fact that we've been so successful with our recommendation that now the incidence of hepatitis B is so low, they feel like we can rest on our laurels. I'm a doctor. I have seen people die from vaccine-preventable disease. I want people to be healthy. I want to make America healthy, and you don't start by stopping recommendations that have made us substantially healthier.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the president of the United States also told American women not to take Tylenol. Or give it to their kids. This is based on a theory that it causes autism somehow. And he also in a social media post, the same one, called for the measles, mumps and rubella shot to be broken up into three different shots. That was then endorsed by the acting CDC director. Are you concerned by this kind of suggestive linkage at the top of the CDC and from the White House?",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: Again, I'm a doctor, and so I'm going to go where the evidence takes me. And the best evidence is a study out of Sweden with 2 million children that found no- no causality, no association, if you will, between taking Tylenol in pregnancy and getting autism. And of course, that concerns me, because there's going to be a mom out there \u2014again, I'm a doctor, I talk to I talk to patients\u2014 in a room, and her child has autism. She took Tylenol for a high fever during pregnancy and now she blames herself. That's just the way mamas think, and that's wrong. We don't want her to think that. The best evidence is that there is no relationship, by the way, if you have a high fever during pregnancy, that may be a risk for autism. Now, of course, if you're pregnant, talk to your physician before you take anything, but point being, the best evidence is that there is no relationship between the two. And I don't want women putting themselves on a guilt trip when the best evidence shows not. By the way, the President has spoken out strongly in favor of immunizations in other cases, and I noted, when he got his physical, he got the flu and COVID shots. So the President has demonstrated that he believes in immunization.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But that's why clarifying the statements, I think, is important, since you interpret them differently. I wonder, do you regret your confirmation vote for Secretary Kennedy?",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: I smile because every reporter asks me that--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, because these questions run right into a pledge that you extracted from him not to tinker with some of the structures that were set in place to have oversight of these vaccines and this process.",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: So you live life forward, again, you just do, let the day's own troubles be sufficient for the day. And I'll credit the secretary. He's brought attention to things like ultra-processed food that has, frankly, never received this sort of attention before, and people praise him for that. So he and I have publicly disagreed on some matters, but I strongly agree with him on others, and so, so that's how I'll answer your question.",
      "if this is your final year in office, sir, will you make overhauling health care your top priority?",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: Well, I sure hope it's not my final year in office, but, but I've been thinking about healthcare for 30 years, because when I worked in a public hospital for the uninsured, I saw the burden it could be on middle-income families who had middle income but couldn't afford the insurance or couldn't assure afford the healthcare. And so it's been my priority for 30 years, and I will continue to do that. And if there is a silver lining, if there is a silver lining in the shutdown, we just had, the silver lining is now we are focused on how do we make health care more affordable for the American people. That should be our goal, not to be partisan one way or the other. How do we make it more affordable for fellow Americans? If we can accomplish that, I will feel like I've done my job.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, thank you for your time.",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: Thank you Margaret.",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, Democrat of New Hampshire, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Nov. 16, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to New Hampshire Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen. Good morning to you, Senator.",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: Good morning. Nice to be with you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well you have spent a good part of the past year trying to get legislation through to extend those Obamacare tax credit subsidies. Last Sunday, you crossed the aisle. You agreed to reopen the government, end the shutdown without a guaranteed extension, but with a promise to have some kind of vote on an ACA bill of Democrats' own choosing. Do you have consensus among Democrats that this needs to be a vote simply to extend the tax credits as they stand now or are you open to a broader reform of Obamacare?",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: Well from the beginning of this shutdown I've had two goals. One is to get government up and running again to end the suffering that too many Americans were experiencing because they lost food assistance or they weren't getting paid federal employees, and the second was to address the high cost of premium- health insurance that people are looking at because insurance companies are setting rates based on the fact that those premium tax credits are not- are supposed to go away at the end of this year. I think people are now very aware of the fact that they are going to see huge rate increases double for so many people, and an unaffordable cost of health insurance if those premium tax credits go away. And what I think we need to do, and these are conversations that we need to have, is we need to work with our Republican colleagues to try and get a bill that can be supported. That can get through both houses of Congress where we've been talking to our Republicans, Senator Cassidy, throughout the shutdown, about what we might be able to agree to. We've been talking to House members on both sides of the aisle, and so now we need to work together. I agree with Senator Cassidy. This should be a bill that is not partisan, but it should be a bill to extend those premium tax credits, because, as everybody has talked about, there is real urgency to get this done. And if we don't address it, then people are going to see huge rate increases. --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Yeah. --",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: -- So we can work together, we can extend the credits, but we probably can't implement significant reforms that Senator Cassidy was talking about in the time frame that we've got. So we need to look both in the short term and in the long term for how we address the cost of health care.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, so that's an important point. So the 26 billion or so that he talks about as the cost for extension of these that he wants to redirect into these cash accounts, these flexible accounts. You're saying you can't get that done in six weeks time.",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: No, you can't. --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Okay. --",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: -- And again, there's real urgency to do this. There's some good, bipartisan legislation that has come out of committee in the Senate that I think we should take up. Things that would expedite approval of generic drugs and biosimilars, that would address PBM reform, which is a huge cost increase for health care, but that's a longer term issue. Right now, we need to address what people are facing in terms of those high rate increases because of the threat that these premium tax credits are going to end.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Just to put a fine point on it, when we heard the Congressman at the top of the program talk about, you know, caps on income and restrictions on who can benefit from those tax credits. Can you get your fellow Democrats, who, by the way, are pretty angry at each other, angry at you as well, about this decision to reopen the government? Can you get everyone on board? Or can you at least get to 60 votes to be able to extend those subsidies with tweaks?",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: Well, first of all, we need to put the shutdown behind us in the circular firing squad and remember why we're in this situation. We're in this situation because Donald Trump and Speaker Johnson and the Republican majorities in the House and Senate have refused to address cost, the cost of health care, and are trying to throw people off their health care. Can we get to consensus? Well, we need to, if we're going to get a bipartisan bill out of the Congress. I think we've seen and heard from health insurance companies that implementing significant changes in the first year is going to be really difficult to do, almost impossible. But we ought to be able to agree on some changes like capping the income of people who receive those premium tax credits. Right now, 94% of people who get the credits earn under $200,000 a year, and the average income for a single recipient is about a little over $30,000 a year. So most people who are getting these tax credits are not in that high income level --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Yeah. --",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: -- And so we should be able to agree on that. We should be able to agree that we don't want any fraud and abuse in the program. --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Right. --",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: -- That's something Republicans and Democrats believe in. So let's focus on what we can agree to. Let's look at what we can get done in the time frame we have, and recognize there is real urgency to get these premium tax credits extended.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you're going to have this vote around the second week of December, but premiums are already notified out. They are already --",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: -- Right. --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- sort of baked in here for- certainly for Americans who buy government health care. Is it too late to extend open enrollment? I mean, Senator Cassidy was saying like ship has sailed here.",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: No, we could actually decide that we were willing as part of this legislation to extend open enrollment. Obviously, we need support from the administration, but insurance companies, in meeting with the insurance industry, they've indicated that while it would be difficult, they could address some of the challenges around not getting agreement until December. Again, that's why there's urgency to get this done.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about another matter. Survivors of convicted child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, as well as some of the families of those survivors, wrote a letter to lawmakers supporting the release of Justice Department internal communications in regard to his case. In that letter, they said there was no middle ground here. There was no hiding behind party affiliation. We will remember your decision at the ballot box. You know, this House vote is set to come up this week. Should there be a vote in the Senate? And would you support it, to see the release of these documents?",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: Absolutely. We need to release the documents. The American people need to see what's in them. And if President Trump says there's nothing there that he's concerned about, then why doesn't he support release of the documents?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we will see if the Republican leader in the Senate takes up your proposal there. There has not been a commitment to have that kind of vote. But on Venezuela, since you are ranking member on Senate Foreign Relations, I want to make sure I ask you, the President said he has sort of made up his mind on what to do about Venezuela. You were one of the very few senators who have received briefings within the past few weeks from Secretaries Rubio and Hegseth regarding the strikes that are being carried out on these small, fast moving boats. Is there a clear end game here and is your understanding that ousting Nicolas Maduro from power is part of the administration's plan?",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: I don't think it's clear what the end game is for this administration with respect to Venezuela. They're relying on a legal opinion, excuse me, in terms of the boat strikes that they have not released. They have finally made it available to members of Congress, but they haven't released it to the public. They are escalating in a way that talking about a land strike through special operations that puts at risk our men and women in the military. We have so much firepower now in the Caribbean, the Gerald R. Ford has been taken from the Red Sea, so that now we don't have any firepower, really, in the Middle East as we look at the threats there. We don't have what we need, I think, in the Indo-Pacific or in Europe. And so what the President has done here is to put at risk other parts of the world and Americans in other parts of the world for this fascination on trying to get rid of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in Venezuela, who clearly is --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Yeah. --",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: -- a bad character. He's been involved in drug --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Yeah. --",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: -- illegal drugs. But he is not a threat to the United States of America. --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Okay. --",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: -- And what the President is doing is raising real questions.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Shaheen, thank you for your time this morning. We'll be back in a moment.",

It has been established,\" Cassidy said. \"This is policy by people who don't understand the epidemiology of hepatitis B, or who have grown comfortable with the fact that we've been so successful with our recommendation that now the incidence of hepatitis B is so low, they feel like we can rest on our laurels.\"",
      "The Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices, a panel of experts who advise and vote on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's vaccine recommendations, is set to meet next month. The draft agenda for the Dec. 4-5 meeting includes discussions of the hepatitis B vaccine, and the meeting could entail votes on recommendations. In September, the panel voted to table a vote on whether to change the pediatric vaccine schedule for hepatitis B to a later date.",
      "Cassidy has previously weighed in on the panel. In June, the Louisiana Republican called for a postponement of the vaccine meeting after Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said he was \"retiring\" all 17 members of the panel, before replacing the committee members with his own picks. And in August, Cassidy likewise called for the panel to postpone its September vaccine advisory committee meeting amid a slew of departures from the CDC.",
      "The moves represented breaks with Kennedy, who was confirmed as the nation's top health official only after winning support from Cassidy.",
      "In February, Cassidy delivered the key vote to advance the nomination out of committee after he had expressed misgivings over Kennedy's nomination because of the doubts he had raised about vaccines. But Cassidy ultimately supported Kennedy's nomination, citing \"serious commitments\" he said he'd received from the administration.",
      "Asked by Brennan whether he regrets his vote to confirm Kennedy, Cassidy said \"every reporter asks me that.\"",
      "\"You live life forward,\" Cassidy added. \"Let the day's own troubles be sufficient for the day. And I'll credit the secretary. He's brought attention to things like ultra-processed food that has, frankly, never received this sort of attention before, and people praise him for that. So he and I have publicly disagreed on some matters, but I strongly agree with him on others, and so, so that's how I'll answer your question.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Army Secretary Dan Driscoll said Sunday that drones pose \"the threat of humanity's lifetime,\" as officials have warned of escalating aerial security risks. But he said he's hopeful about the U.S.' approach.",
      "\"If you look at the speed and scale of the devastation that can come from drones, we as a federal government have got to lead on it,\" Driscoll said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" \"But I'm really optimistic. This is actually something we are doing right.\"",
      "Driscoll outlined that the U.S. Army has been put in charge of the counter-drone threat for the Pentagon, and is working \"hand in glove with the law enforcement agencies.\"",
      "\"What we are trying to do \u2014 because this problem is different from nearly anything faced in a long time \u2014 is a flying IED,\" Driscoll said, referring to Improvised Explosive Devices. \"They're cheap, you can 3D-print them at home, and they cross borders incredibly quickly.\"",
      "The comments come after Sen. Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican who leads the Senate Intelligence Committee, told CBS News last week that the threat to military sites and large civilian gatherings \"is severe and growing,\" citing evidence of persistent drone incursions and gaps in law enforcement authorities.",
      "Last year, there were more than 350 unauthorized drone flights over about 100 military installations, according to the Defense Department, along with more than 27,000 drones detected within 500 meters of the U.S. southern border in the last half of 2024. Meanwhile, the number of unauthorized flights during sporting events went down slightly last year, although the overall trend is continuing to move upward, according to NFL data.",
      "Driscoll said the Army is working with law enforcement agencies at borders and ports, and at major events like upcoming NFL games, the Olympics and the World Cup.",
      "\"This is something we as a nation can lead on,\" Driscoll said. \"And so under President Trump's leadership, we are moving fast at this problem.\"",
      "Driscoll said \"the problem with the drone fight is you need all sorts of layered defense,\" and he outlined that there are different authorities \"when you're doing it in your own homeland.\"",
      "\"A lot of this is a human problem of communication, command and control, and having a layered set of solutions that you can use for any given problem,\" he added.",
      "When it comes to regulating drones, Driscoll said he's \"pretty optimistic that we will be able to figure out a solution where we will know what is in the sky at every moment across our country, all at once.\"",
      "Driscoll said \"we are trying to design a system so that Americans are able to fly drones,\" along with commercial companies like Amazon. Citing the future of delivery in commercial drones, Driscoll said, \"we will just have to deconflict the skies, working with the FAA.\"",
      "\"What is amazing about our country is we are able to recognize where we need to innovate quickly,\" Driscoll said. \"What we're doing for drones, completely differently, I think than we have done as an arm in probably 50 or 60 years, is we're welcoming in American industry.\"",
      "On competition with China, which currently dominates commercial drone production, Driscoll said he expects to catch up.",
      "\"What we are going to do is we are going to invest in things like sensors and brushless motors and circuit boards and a lot of the components that are really hard for the private sector to get right now, the United States Army is going to build those on our bases and empower the private sector to purchase from us,\" he said. \"And so we will make drones. Our private partners will make drones, and we will catch up and surpass the Chinese incredibly quickly.\"",
      "After the 43-day government shutdown that resulted in $400 million in loans from USAA, Driscoll said it will take \"months and months\" for the military to get back to work on projects.",
      "\"This is part of the calcification of our system, that under President Trump, we are uniquely able to try to go after a lot of these things and actually get our army and their families living in better areas, and get our soldiers ready for the modern fight,\" he said. \"And the shutdown does not help.\"",

    "story": [
      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Army Secretary Dan Driscoll that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Nov. 16, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We want to turn now to some of the challenges faced by the U.S. military, and we're joined by the Secretary of the Army, Dan Driscoll. Good morning, thank you for being here.",
      "SECRETARY OF THE UNITED STATES ARMY DAN DRISCOLL: Thank you so much for having me.",
      "MARGERET BRENNAN: A lot to get to with you. Just quickly on news of day, the president did say he \"sort of\" made up his mind on Venezuela. I know this is the Marines, this is the Navy that are deployed. But does the Venezuelan army pose any kind of threat to the U.S. if action is taken?",
      "SEC. DRISCOLL: I think that the President and Secretary of War have spent a lot of time thinking about what is the best thing they can do for the American people, and I can speak from the Army's perspective, which is, we have a lot of training in that part of the world. We're reactivating our jungle school in Panama, we would be ready to act on whatever the president and Sec. War needed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But no orders beyond these exercises at this point?",
      "SEC. DRISCOLL: I- we don't talk about those kinds of things, but we would be ready if asked.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I do want to ask you about what has been happening with this shutdown. The government's now funded through January 30, you did get from Congress full year funding for veterans affairs and military construction, a few other measures in this short term bill. But we have seen the shutdown hit military bases and hit military families. Costly. $400 million or more in emergency loans from USAA. How do you insulate the force so that the next shutdown doesn't hit these families the way it did this time.",
      "SEC. DRISCOLL: I think the shutdown is indicative of one of the bigger problems that we have a nation have had. And so if you look back for the last 30 or 40 years, one of the reasons we've had such bad outcomes, when we spend the American taxpayers hard earned dollars, and we go buy things that our soldiers will need to fight, when we build things where our soldiers and their families will live, we are such a bad customer, because when you're on the other side of the deal with us and you have to deal with shutdowns. I mean, this shutdown will take months and months for us to get back and going on these projects. And this is part of the calcification of our system that under President Trump, we are uniquely able to try to go after a lot of these things and actually get our army and their families living in better areas, and get our soldiers ready for the modern fight. And the shutdown does not help.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you about the modern fight. Tom Cotton, who is the chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, told our Olivia Gazis here at CBS that the threat to military sites and large civilian gatherings \"is severe and growing.\" He cited gaps in law enforcement authorities, some of them lapsed during the shutdown, I understand, and he's talking about trying to close enforcement gaps when it comes to drones. What authorizations do you need?",
      "SEC. DRISCOLL: So under Secretary of War Hegseth, the United States Army has been put in charge of the counter drone threat for the Pentagon, and then we are working hand in fist- or hand in glove with the broader law enforcement agencies. We just last week had a meeting right outside the White House where what we are trying to do, because this problem is different from nearly anything we've faced in a long time. It is a flying IED. And so this IED--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: IED, the explosive--",
      "SEC. DRISCOLL: IED, improvised explosive device. They're cheap. You can 3D print them at home, and they cross borders incredibly quickly. And so what you basically need is a digital layer to exchange information and exchange sensing and allow the closest person on the ground, or the closest effector on the ground, to be able to take out a drone. And Senator Cotton is right. I mean, this is the threat of humanity's lifetime. What's occurring in Ukraine, what's happening in Russia, if you look at the speed and scale of the devastation that can come from drones, we as a federal government have got to lead on it. But I'm really optimistic. This is actually something we are doing right. We are partnering with both federal law enforcement, in a couple of weeks, we're having the Sheriff's Association come. We were just at the NYPD. We're including all of the different law enforcement agencies, thinking about the borders and the ports and the upcoming NFL games and Olympics and World Cup. Like this is something we as a nation can lead on. And so under President Trump's leadership, we are moving fast at this problem.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And this is about radar jamming of drones to take them out, not exploding them.",
      "SEC. DRISCOLL: So the problem with the drone fight is you need all sorts of layered defense. One solution does not work. If you just try to jam them- if you look at what's happening in Ukraine, people have started to hard wire drones, and so you can't do RF jamming on a hard wire drone. And so there are things like net guns that are coming back, we're using all sorts of solutions and tools, and it makes it even more complicated. When you're by an airport and you're doing it in your own homeland, you just have different authorities. And so a lot of this is a human problem of communication, command and control and having a layered set of solutions that you can use for any given problem.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you're talking about here at the homeland, things like the U.S. hosting the Olympics, the World Cup, even just the Super Bowl, games that are coming up. Should there be restrictions in this country on who is able to own and operate drones?",
      "SEC. DRISCOLL: I'm pretty optimistic that we will be able to figure out a solution where we will know what is in the sky at every moment across our country, all at once. And so if you think of the President's--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're not there yet.",
      "SEC. DRISCOLL: We're not there yet, but under the President's Golden Dome, I would think about this like a golden mini dome, where, if you took one of the sites for the World Cup, we are heavily focused on being able to see everything in the area, have all of the interceptors we will need, have all of the training for all of the different forces that will have to be able to act. And so to your specific question, I think we are trying to design a system so that Americans are able to fly drones, so that commercial companies, like Amazon- like the future of delivery, in a lot of ways, is commercial drones. And so we will just have to de-conflict the skies, working with the FAA. But this is a big topic. I check in with Secretary of War Hegseth on this almost weekly.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So when we last saw the President of Ukraine, Zelenskyy, at the White House, he brought up to President Trump, on camera, we've got great drones we want to sell to the United States or provide to the United States. You referred to Ukraine as the \"only Silicon Valley of warfare\" right now. What do you mean by that? Are they really ahead of the United States on innovation?",
      "SEC. DRISCOLL: I think if you look at what's happening, Operation Spider's Web in Russia, the Ukrainians used probably a couple hundred thousand dollars worth of drones and took out almost $10 billion worth of equipment in Russia. And Russia's in that fight. And so I think what is amazing about our country is we are able to recognize where we need to innovate quickly. And what we're doing for drones, completely differently, I think, than we have done as an army in probably 50 or 60 years, is we are welcoming in American industry. So we just did an AI war game where we invited 15 of the top CEOs in the nation. They were worth probably $18 trillion in enterprise value. And we said, howdy, can you please help us? What do you have in your tech innovation pipeline to help us with data in contested environments? How do we do logistics 6,000 miles away if we're facing an enemy who's trying to contest us? And we are working with them, no joke, daily, to basically take their innovation and apply it to this problem.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But what I heard you saying there is, you look at the battlefield in Ukraine as kind of like a test lab for where warfare is going. Can you convince some of your fellow Republicans that there is value in that fight, in terms of, you know, those who are so isolationist they don't want to be involved in Ukraine, even financially?",
      "SEC. DRISCOLL: Well, I don't think I've talked to a single person who has said we shouldn't be learning from what's occurring in Ukraine. All of our equipment, all of the exquisite features we will need, are definitionally going to come- the data set that the Ukrainians are getting for their generative AI models of when they have drones and they're flying and they're learning and they're doing counter drone and they're taking all of this information from their sensors and trying to figure out what's going on. There's not a single person I know that doesn't think that is an incredible treasure trove of information for future warfare. I think a lot of the questions are, how do we actually execute on the President's agenda of peace in that part of the world. Where- I have not been to the White House, where it has not come up that we just want peace so that the American industrial base can thrive everywhere, and we have to focus on that part of the world unnecessarily right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you're at the Department of War.",
      "SEC. DRISCOLL: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you announced that the army wants to buy a million drones over the next two to three years. Navy, Marines, Air Force, they will obviously be very involved in any war in the Pacific, but you've got to defend those American bases.",
      "SEC. DRISCOLL: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So how do you think of the threat from China there? Because I've read that you think they're ahead of America.",
      "SEC. DRISCOLL: So we're working on something with Congress called SkyFoundry. And basically the idea is to, again, do it right from the beginning. What the army has historically gotten wrong in the last couple of decades is, we're either all in or all out, meaning we either use our organic industrial base and we make the drones ourselves, or we say, this is too complicated for us, we're going to have private industry do it. We are not doing that with drones. Because if you look at- Ukraine is manufacturing four million a year, China, I think, is at 12 to 14 million drones a year.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Wow.",
      "SEC. DRISCOLL: And we as a nation will have to have our private sector able to help us. And so what we are going to do is, we are going to invest in things like sensors and brushless motors and circuit boards and a lot of the components that are really hard for the private sector to get right now. The United States Army is going to build those on our bases and empower the private sector to purchase from us. And so we will make drones, our private partners will make drones, and we will catch up and surpass the Chinese incredibly quickly.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Secretary, thank you for your time. And I do want to make the point that you are taking questions, and that is unusual these days, since the Pentagon has restricted access to reporters. And we think it's important here that the American people hear about their own security as well as the military's three million or more employees. So thank you. We'll be right back.",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Reps. Tom Suozzi, Democrat of New York, and Don Bacon, Republican of Nebraska, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Nov. 16, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We begin today with two members of the so-called House Problem Solvers Caucus, New York Democrat Tom Suozzi and Nebraska Republican Don Bacon. Good morning. Good to have you here in a bipartisan conversation. You both recognize there's a problem here. Congressman Bacon, let me start with you. One out of every five dollars in this country that is spent goes to health care. We know these Covid-era tax credit subsidies for Obamacare will go away at the end of the month.* That's going to hit about 22 of the 24 million Americans who use that program. What can you do in the next six weeks to make costs go down in January?",
      "REP. DON BACON: Well, we need a temporary extension of these tax credits to keep these prices down. Republicans nor Democrats want to see premiums skyrocket, and they will if these expire with nothing in its place. That's why I worked with Tom Suozzi and other Democrats and Republicans to find a compromise. We just want to do a clean extension. Most Republicans don't anyway, so we think there needs to be some caps on income, and we want to ensure all these credits go directly to lowering people's premiums. And right now, about a third of the money doesn't make it to the premiums. So those are some reforms that we would like to see. And if we can get those accomplished, then we can extend these tax credits and keep these- the prices lower, but we do need a longer term fix. The Affordable Care Act is unaffordable, and I think we need to have this extension to give us time to work on something bigger and deeper, and that will help lower costs overall. But I'm proud to work with Tom Suozzi on this, and I appreciate his partnership.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman Suozzi, I understand this is a two-year proposed extension of those enhanced premium tax credits and an income cap that phases out for those making between $200,000 to $400,000. When you look at the breakdown, though, that's a pretty small portion of the overall recipients of the tax credits, it's like less than 10%. So what does this accomplish? How does this make it more affordable and fair?",
      "REP. TOM SUOZZI: Well, it helps everybody else who makes under $200,000 dramatically. And the number one concern people have in America is affordability and health care affordability is right at the top of the list. So we need to do something to extend these premium tax credit--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:-- How much more affordable?--",
      "REP. SUOZZI: -- It'll save people thousands and thousands of dollars, literally $1,000 a month for some people. So it'll be dramatically more affordable. The people who make above $400,000 are the teeny little percentage of people that are not a very small group of people that would benefit from the existing tax credits. Most of the people are below- below $200,000. That $200,000 to $400,000 is a way to taper it off so there's not a cliff.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And how much Democratic support do you have for this at this point?",
      "REP. SUOZZI: I think the Democrats are going to strongly back the idea of extending premium tax credits so that we can keep people's insurance affordable. So, we've got to come up with this compromise--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Even with these caps?--",
      "REP. SUOZZI: -- Even with the caps. Yeah, people- Democrats have always said that they want to direct the policy towards lower and middle income folks, people making under $400,000 a year- is- are bread and butter issues that we want to try and make things affordable for those folks. So- and that will be like literally 95%- 99% of the people that are affected right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman Bacon- sorry, go ahead.",
      "REP. BACON: I would just say, as Republicans, we push back on the thought of someone earning $600,000 getting all these tax credits. So when I listened to Speaker- or Leader Thune, that was one of his big concerns on these so that's why I wanted to ensure that we had this in our framework.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But a tweak with a not permanent, just a two-year extension. Republicans haven't really been proposing a lot of alternative Obamacare options here. Do you think the entire system needs to be rebooted, and when will we see that plan?",
      "REP. BACON: Well, I do I think Republicans and Democrats have to sit down at the table and figure out, what can we really do besides just throw more money at this. Right now, the- you know, the premiums are just going up so much faster than inflation. It's unsustainable and- but we can't do a Republican only fix it. It's not going to work. You're not gonna get 60 votes in the Senate to do it. And I know certainly some folks proposed that back in Congress. Let's go up with our plan. Well, it can't just be a Republican plan if we want to pass something. So we got to sit down with Democrats and figure out what can we do. And there's some good ideas out there. So for example, you know, I've heard, you know, if we can directly subsidize high risk people and put them in a separate pool and just lower their premiums through subsidies, and then the we can call it, the healthier folks, their premiums go- are going to go down significantly if we do that. So there's different concepts that we can do to that can have an impact, but it's going to- to be a bipartisan way forward. It's not going to be a Republican only bill, because you'll never get it passed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman Suozzi, I mean, Aetna pulled out of the Obamacare marketplace this year after CVS said they expected to lose as much as $400 million. Other big insurance companies have been pulling out. If insurance companies themselves are having problems with Obamacare, do Democrats need to be more open to broader reforms of the Affordable Care Act?",
      "REP. SUOZZI: Yeah, we absolutely should be looking at any kind of reform. I want to mend it, not end it. You know that over the past decade that there have been over 70 attempts, mainly by the Republicans, not guys like Don Bacon, who is a very reasonable guy, to try and get rid of Obamacare altogether. We think that's a terrible idea. But if people want to try and make it a better system, to make a- health care more affordable in America and to get health care to more people, we should be doing that. That's what the people want. That's what reasonable people in Congress want. We should be working together to try and expand health care coverage, lower prices for everybody, and make health care more effective and less expensive for people. Now that's not going to happen with everybody yelling and screaming at each other. Everybody says, why don't you just- doesn't know what the hell they're talking about. You cannot solve complicated problems in an environment of fear and anger, you need reasonable people to sit down and talk to each other and say, I think this. Well, I think that, and then work your way towards finding compromise, very hard to do in this toxic environment. People like Don Bacon and other members of the Problem Solvers Caucus want to do that type of thing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Yeah well, but private health care costs are also going up. But on this topic of toxic environments here Congressman Suozzi, Democrats who won elections just a few days ago credited their wins to this affordability issue and the message focused on that. Can you explain the focus this past week in the House by Democrats on the Jeffrey Epstein files? Is this a tactic to distract from the failure to extract health care changes, or is there something else going on here? I mean, does the Speaker putting it to a vote end this issue?",
      "REP. SUOZZI: I think it's a combination of factors, of people shining their lights on the most hot topic at the time. You know, Jeffrey Epstein, of course, is an important topic. I'm sure I'll vote to release his files, but that's not my priority. My priority is to focus on the things that the American people care about: affordability, immigration, taxes, crime and health care. That's what people are fighting about, that's what they're concerned about, that's what we should be focused on in Congress.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman Bacon, does the Speaker putting this to a vote end the Epstein issue and get you back on to health care? I mean, the Speaker said this is all a political exercise. Certainly the families of the victims don't think it is.",
      "REP. BACON: I think the Speaker realizes the train has left the station on this. Let's rip the Band-Aid off and get it done. I wish the president realized that. The more the White House pushes back on this. It's, you know, it just looks bad, right? I mean, it was- the attorney general came out and said, all these white binders, we're gonna release all this information and then, a month later, said, Oh, no, we're not. So it's been a PR blunder from the beginning. And I think the Speaker is right, this is gonna happen, so let's get it done and vote on it. Now, we got to realize it still has to go to the Senate. Then it has to go to the president for a signature. Meanwhile, our Oversight Committee is releasing thousands and thousands of pages of evidence concerning Epstein. So for example, like 3,000 pages was released late last week. So the Oversight Committee, Republicans and Democrats are putting out the data. They're putting out subpoenas. I think it's already working, but like Tom when this comes on the floor, I'm going to vote yes on it. I want transparency. We must- we want to protect the victims, but everything else should just be- should be open.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You also. Congressman Bacon, run the Cyber Subcommittee. I want to ask you about something significant this past week that AI firm Anthropic said that Chinese state sponsored hackers used their technology to automate break-ins and carry out the first cyber espionage operation, largely using AI. It hit like 30 different companies. What can you tell us about the scope and the targets of this attack?",
      "REP. BACON: I can't say much more than what was just released. Other than I can say this, China has replaced Russia as the most formidable cyber threat. They have much higher technology. They are using AI, which gives you a lot more capability in finding weaknesses in your adversaries' cyber defenses. What concerns me more than anything, while China is attacking us every single day, and Russia, we've had no commander in charge of cyber command for over eight months. You know, the White House or the president, fired the Cyber Command commander over eight months ago and has not replaced him. Also, the top two positions at the National Security Agency, the top two are vacant for over eight months, and we've been cutting CISA, which is the- the agency that protects our private sector, our businesses, our infrastructure, and we've cut it by about a third. And so our cyber capabilities are going backwards. We don't- we're rudderless in a time where China is attacking us every day, and that's something that really concerns me, and I've been pushing the White House to- to deal with this and to confront the cyber threat.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we will continue following that important story. Congressmen, thank you for trying to be problem solvers with us today. Face the Nation will be back in a minute. Stay with us.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, a New Hampshire Democrat who helped facilitate the deal to end the shutdown last week, said Sunday that lawmakers need to put the shutdown behind them as they look for consensus to address health care costs.",
      "\"We need to put the shutdown behind us, end the circular firing squad, and remember why we're in this situation,\" Shaheen said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Shaheen said \"we're in this situation because Donald Trump and Speaker Johnson and the Republican majorities in the House and Senate refused to address the cost of health care,\" adding that lawmakers need to reach consensus to get a bipartisan bill to address health care costs out of Congress.",
      "Democrats had sought an agreement to extend expiring Affordable Care Act tax credits in return for their votes to reopen the government. But on the 40th day of the shutdown, eight Senate Democrats, including Shaheen, broke ranks to reach a deal with Republicans to end the funding lapse, securing a promise to hold a vote next month on the tax credits, which help millions of Americans pay for health insurance premiums for plans purchased on state exchanges.",
      "Now, Democrats have an opportunity, and a short timeline, to move forward with the legislation of their choice to address the expiring tax credits. Exactly what that looks like, and whether it could find enough support to pass, remains to be seen.",
      "Shaheen said with the legislation, \"we ought to be able to agree on some changes, like capping the income of people who receive those premium tax credits,\" along with seeking to root out fraud and abuse within the program.",
      "\"So let's focus on what we can agree to,\" she said. \"Let's look at what we can get done in the timeframe we have, and recognize there is real urgency to get these premium tax credits extended.\"",
      "The New Hampshire Democrat, who worked with Republicans to come to the deal to end the shutdown, said Democrats need to work with their Republican colleagues to come up with a bill that can find support in both chambers. She said \"we've been talking to our Republicans, Sen. Cassidy, throughout the shutdown about what we might be able to agree to,\" along with House members on both sides of the aisle.",
      "Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican who also appeared on \"Face the Nation,\" said he's been in communication with the White House about a plan to bring down the cost of health care for Americans. But the plan takes a different approach, giving Americans money to help them offset high deductibles that are often a feature of the lower-cost policies under the ACA. The president has floated a similar idea.",
      "But Shaheen cast doubt on the plan, expressing urgency to address the health care costs in the short-term.",
      "\"We can work together, we can extend the credits, but we probably can't implement significant reforms that Sen. Cassidy was talking about in the time frame that we've got,\" Shaheen said. \"So we need to look both in the short term and in the long term for how we address the cost of health care.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump has issued a second pardon to a January 6 defendant who remained imprisoned on separate gun offenses, leading to his release on Friday.",
      "Dan Wilson was one of the supporters of Mr. Trump who breached the Capitol on January 6, 2021. The Justice Department said in a 2024 news release that Wilson was a militia member who entered the building in a gas mask.",
      "He pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiracy to impede or injure a federal officer in May 2024 and was sentenced to five years in prison.",
      "He was pardoned on that charge in January 2025 when Mr. Trump granted clemency for about 1,500 January 6 defendants.",
      "Despite the pardon, Wilson remained incarcerated. Authorities had searched his home in June 2022 as part of their investigation into his presence at the Capitol.",
      "They recovered \"numerous firearms and ammunition,\" the Justice Department said, which he was forbidden from possessing because of previous felony convictions.",
      "Wilson pled guilty to a charge of possession of a firearm by a prohibited person and a charge of possession of an unregistered firearm, and was set to remain in prison until 2028.",
      "A White House official told CBS News that Mr. Trump was pardoning Wilson because the home search that led to the discovery of the firearms was part of the investigation into Wilson's January 6 charges.",
      "Wilson's pardon, reviewed by CBS News, was dated to Friday. He was released from prison on Friday evening, his lawyer George Pallas told the Associated Press.",
      "\"For too long, my client has been held as a political prisoner by a government that criminalized dissent,\" Pallas said in a statement to CBS News. \"President Trump's pardon rights this wrong and sends a clear message that peaceful Americans will not be persecuted for their beliefs. Mr. Wilson is innocent, he has always been innocent, and this pardon proves it.\"",
      "A sprawling legal battle",
      "Wilson's case became part of a legal debate over whether Mr. Trump's pardon of January 6-related crimes applied to other offenses discovered in investigations related to those charges. Mr. Trump has downplayed the events of the attack and referred to those jailed in connection with it as \"hostages.\"",
      "Wilson planned to participate in the riot at the Capitol for weeks, according to the Justice Department's 2024 news release, and occasionally discussed bringing firearms. He ultimately arrived unarmed.",
      "Throughout the day, he provided information in messaging channels about where people needed support as they worked to enter the Capitol, the Justice Department said. He also spoke to other members of far-right groups, including the Oath Keepers.",
      "The Justice Department initially argued that Trump's pardons did not extend to Wilson's gun charges, but later changed its position, saying that it had received \"further clarity on the intent of the Presidential Pardon.\"",
      "U.S. District Judge Dabney Friedrich, who oversaw Wilson's case and was nominated by Mr. Trump during his first term, criticized the move and called efforts to extend the pardon to cover offenses discovered in the course of the investigations \"extraordinary,\" according to the Associated Press.",
      "Mr. Trump also pardoned Suzanne Kaye, a Florida woman who was sentenced to 18 months in prison for threatening to shoot FBI agents. Kaye was questioned by FBI agents after saying online that she had been at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, according to CBS Miami. When contacted by agents, Kaye denied she had been there, but still agreed to speak with them, CBS Miami reported.",

      "In both cases, the White House had argued that the troops were being sent to \"protect federal assets and personnel,\" with the president invoking Title 10 of the federal code, which allows for its use if the president deems that \"there is a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the government of the United States.\"",
      "Federal judges, however \u2014 in response to lawsuits brought by city and state officials \u2014 had\u00a0so far blocked\u00a0federalized National Guard soldiers from actually being deployed on the streets of Portland and Chicago, keeping them in a kind of holding pattern while they awaited the legal wrangling of their cases to play out.",

      "The defense official also told CBS News that the number of federalized Oregon National Guard members will be reduced from 200 to 100. The approximately 300 Illinois National Guard members that were previously federalized as part of the operation will remain under federal control, the official added.",

      "Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia on Saturday said she is receiving threats, one day after President Trump announced he is ending his support for his former longtime ally.",
      "Greene has been one of Mr. Trump's most ardent supporters going back to his first term, but seemingly broke with the president on several key issues over the past few weeks, including the political divide over health care funding, which lead to the longest government shutdown in U.S. history, and the controversy over the release of files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "\"Aggressive rhetoric attacking me has historically led to death threats and multiple convictions of men who were radicalized by the same type rhetoric being directed at me right now,\" Greene wrote in a lengthy social media post. \"This time by the President of the United States. As a woman I take threats from men seriously. I now have a small understanding of the fear and pressure the women, who are victims of Jeffrey Epstein and his cabal, must feel.\"",
      "She did not detail the exact nature of the threats. Greene's home has been the target of multiple swatting calls in the past.",
      "A group of more than two dozen people that identify as Epstein survivors, or family members of survivors, released a joint statement Saturday in support of Greene.",
      "\"Thank you for standing up against the intimidation, silencing, and abuse that Epstein survivors have endured for decades,\" the statement read. \"...You have our full support.\"",
      "In an email to CBS News, a spokesperson for the group added that many of them have gotten death threats, adding it's \"part of the price of speaking out.\"",
      "In a bombshell Friday night, Mr. Trump took to Truth Social to write that he was \"withdrawing\" his \"support and Endorsement\" of Greene, indicating that he might even back an effort to primary her. He also accused her of going \"far Left.\"",
      "\"She has told many people that she is upset that I don't return her phone calls anymore, but with 219 Congressmen/women, 53 U.S. Senators, 24 Cabinet Members, almost 200 Countries, and an otherwise normal life to lead, I can't take a ranting Lunatic's call every day,\" the president wrote.",
      "Greene responded on social media by saying \"President Trump just attacked me and lied about me. I haven't called him at all, but I did send these text messages today. Apparently this is what sent him over the edge.\"",
      "The two continue to exchange barbs on Saturday, with the president doubling-down, writing that \"Marjorie 'Traitor' Green is a disgrace to our GREAT REPUBLICAN PARTY!\"",
      "Greene was among one of just four House Republicans that joined all Democrats last week in signing a discharge petition to force a House vote that, if also approved by the Senate, would require the Justice Department to release all materials related to Epstein.",
      "\"It really makes you wonder what is in those files and who and what country is putting so much pressure on him?\" Green\u00a0wrote\u00a0Saturday of the president.",
      "The House Oversight Committee\u00a0on Wednesday released\u00a0more than 20,000 pages of documents related to Epstein, and some House Democrats said the contents raise questions about what Mr. Trump knew of Epstein's activities.",
      "In an exclusive interview with \"CBS Mornings\" Friday, Greene called Mr. Trump's opposition to the release of the Epstein files a \"huge miscalculation,\" arguing that the president has not been accused of misconduct in relation to Epstein.",
      "\"I truly just stand with the women, and I think they deserve to be the ones that we're fighting for,\" she said.",
      "Greene has also appeared to side with Democratic lawmakers who are calling on Congress to extend the expiring Affordable Care Act tax credits. The standoff over those credits sparked the 43-day government shutdown, which finally ended this week when eight Democratic senators crossed the aisle and reached a deal with their Republican counterparts.",
      "\"Now that the [Affordable Care Act] tax credits are expiring, which the Democrats did put in place \u2014 and they set the expiration date for this year \u2014 I see a financial crisis for Americans,\" Greene told \"CBS Morning.\" \"And so on this issue, I don't see political party lines.\"",

      "The East Wing was first built in 1902 and renovated in 1942. Its sudden demolition has drawn controversy, with critics arguing it was done without enough public input and questioning the design plans for the $300 million, donor-funded ballroom. Mr. Trump had initially said the ballroom project \"won't interfere with the current building.\"",

    "story": [
      "Not long ago in Seattle, an astronomical event of sorts happened: Two superstars collided. William Shatner, of \"Star Trek\" fame, and Neil deGrasse Tyson, America's favorite astrophysicist, took to the stage to explore the nature of exploration. Think of it as sort of Martin & Lewis, but with more quantum mechanics.",
      "\"It's a bromance,\" said Tyson. \"I think what Bill Shatner and I have together should be the textbook definition of the bromance.\"",
      "\"If we have a bromance,\" said Shatner, \"I'd be very privileged.\"",
      "The two grew close last year on an upscale cruise to Antarctica, where they ended up being the after-dinner entertainment. \"The organizer said, 'Why don't we put the two of you on this mini-stage that they have on the ship, and we just chew the fat?'\" said Tyson. \"And then the organizer said, 'Why don't you guys take this on the road?'\"",
      "Their first port of call? Seattle, where they debuted a wide-ranging, sometimes meandering, but always intriguing stage show they're calling \"The Universe Is Absurd!\"",
      "When Shatner asked his partner for a sound bite, deGrasse Tyson solicited a suggestion from the audience: \"Pick anything out of the universe. Go. Anything. Doesn't matter.\"",
      "\"Pluto!\" yelled one enthusiastic audience member.",
      "DeGrasse Tyson obliged: \"More than half of Pluto is made of ice, so that, if it were where Earth is right now, heat from the Sun would evaporate that ice and it would grow a tail. And that is no kind of behavior for a planet!\" Mic drop. \"That's a sound bite!\"",
      "For deGrasse Tyson, director of New York City's Hayden Planetarium, and an authority on just about everything we know about the universe, it's a chance to get inside the insatiably curious mind of the 94-year-old Shatner. \"What kind of magic potion is he drinking?\" deGrasse Tyson laughed. \"By the way, you can do the math, he's been alive for three billion seconds, okay? I did the math, you don't have to. So when Bill Shatner speaks, it's coming from a place way deeper than any of the rest of us can possibly match.\"",
      "And for Shatner, who never formally studied astrophysics, it's a chance to make up for what he sees as lost time. \"I feel bad about it, because that knowledge of what constitutes the construction of nature, we know so little, but the little we know is so awesome, it's so spellbinding,\" he said. \"The fact that I wasn't conscious of how spellbinding it is as a youth, I could have been much more educated about it.\"",
      "Four years ago, Shatner became the oldest person ever to go into space, and he's been globetrotting ever since.",
      "Shatner asked deGrasse Tyson, \"Do you still scratch your head in awe?\"",
      "\"Every night I look up,\" he replied.",
      "So, is this the dynamic between the two \u2013 Shatner with questions, deGrasse Tyson with answers? \"Unfortunately, that's the way it is,\" Shatner replied.",
      "\"No, but he's got wisdom and life experience that I value, and I respect,\" deGrasse Tyson added. \"So, I'm here to grab some of that.\"",
      "As for Shatner's take on deGrasse Tyson, \"He has access, both because of his mentality, and the books and the studies, so he's into modern-day mysticism, which is the study of the stars and how it works and what goes on.\"",
      "\"You call that modern-day mysticism?\" deGrasse Tyson asked.",
      "\"Because you don't know for sure that what you're saying is absolutely truth until more experimentation.\"",
      "\"That's the frontier. We're scratching our heads.\"",
      "\"Exactly,\" said Shatner. \"So, he is an explorer. He is an explorer. He is on that verge. He teaches that. And it is mystical in every sense of the word.\"",
      "I asked, \"This is where I think you are politely and respectfully in disagreement, because Dr. deGrasse Tyson will say something like, 'We know what the speed of light is and what the fastest things can move is.' And you say, 'Well, we'll see about that!'\"",
      "\"Yeah, we've had that argument,\" said Shatner.",
      "DeGrasse Tyson seems just fine not knowing everything \u2013 for example, what was going on before the Big Bang, and the profound idea of somethingness coming from nothingness. \"We don't know. Next question!\" he said. \"No, as a scientist, you need to be comfortable in the presence of a question that does not yet have an answer.\"",
      "Of course, the ultimate question, the one we really don't know definitively, is where we go when we die, something that Shatner, as he loses friends and colleagues, finds himself considering more often. \"You know, I vary between the fear of death, my fear,\" he said. But, \"I have so much love around me. I have a wife, and children, and grandchildren. I even have two great-grandchildren. And I have two great dogs. I've had dogs all my life, all my adult life. And so, all my life is fertile, is vibrant. And I don't want to leave it. And that's the sadness. I don't want to go.\"",
      "\"Are you curious, though, about what you will find out?\" I asked.",
      "\"Not enough to die!\" he laughed.",
      "\"Even your curiosity has a limit?\"",
      "\"Right. It stops right there!\"",
      "So, William Shatner's famous curiosity bumps up against the edge of his universe. And as the show wrapped up in Seattle, Shatner closed things out with one of his unique spoken-word songs, accompanied by trumpeter Keyon Harrold.",
      "Do not grow oldno matter how long you live.Do not forget painbut somehow learn to forgive.",

      "It was published online Oct. 30 in JAMA Oncology.",
      "Doctors say these study results won't change how they advise patients and that women should not stop using their birth control.",
      "Still, TikTok is flooded with factually incomplete warnings that contraceptives cause cancer and are as dangerous as smoking. Reproductive health advocates warn that studies like this can easily be taken out of context online and be reduced to a single alarming number.",
      "Case in point: The study reported that women who had used hormonal birth control had about a 24% higher rate of breast cancer than women who hadn't. But because breast cancer is still uncommon in younger women, that works out to an increase from roughly 54 to 67 breast cancer cases per 100,000 women per year \u2014 about 13 extra cases per 100,000 women, or about one extra case per 7,800 users of hormonal contraceptives per year.",
      "Co-authors \u00c5sa Johansson and Dr. Fatemeh Hadizadeh, epidemiologists at Uppsala University, said the rise is modest and short-term, with risk highest during current use and fading within five to 10 years after stopping.",
      "Rachel Fey \u2014 interim co-CEO of Power to Decide, a group whose mission is to provide accurate information on sexual health and contraceptive methods \u2014 said that kind of nuance is exactly what tends to disappear on social media. \"I get really angry at this because it's designed to scare people like me away from birth control, which has made my life so much better in so many ways,\" she said. \"It's really frustrating \u2026 especially when it's given without context. And then in this era of social media, it can just take off without anybody who knows what they're talking about providing that context.\"",
      "The researchers also found the risk was slightly higher with certain progestins such as desogestrel \u2014 found in combined oral contraceptives like Cyred EQ, Reclipsen, Azurette, and Pimtrea \u2014 but did not increase with others, such as medroxyprogesterone acetate injections, sold under the brand name Depo\u2011Provera.",
      "How to interpret the findings",
      "Some experts say the results should be viewed with care because the study counted both invasive breast cancers and early, noninvasive lesions known as in situ tumors, growths that may never become life-threatening. Including these precancerous cases could make the overall risk of clinically significant disease appear higher than it is.",
      "\"A substantial proportion of the 'cases' would never have progressed to invasive breast cancer,\" said Lina S. M\u00f8rch, a senior researcher and team leader at the Danish Cancer Institute. M\u00f8rch was not associated with the Swedish study. She added that experts should wait for more data separating early-stage and advanced cancers before making new rules or warnings about specific hormones.",
      "The doctor-patient conversation",
      "Even as scientists debate how to interpret the finer points of the data, physicians emphasize that for most patients, the study reinforces what they already discuss in the exam room: that hormonal birth control is broadly safe, and decisions should be tailored to each woman's needs and values.",
      "Dr. Katharine White, chief of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Boston Medical Center, said this study won't change how she talks to her patients.",
      "\"When counseling patients about their contraceptive options, I focus on their past experiences with birth control, their medical history, and what's important to them about their birth control method and pregnancy planning (if applicable),\" White wrote in an email. \"Side effects and risks of methods are already a key part of my counseling about both hormonal and non-hormonal methods.\"",
      "Other doctors noted there are other contraceptive options.",
      "Dr. Eleanor Bimla Schwarz, chief of General Internal Medicine at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, said, \"For those who prefer hormone-free contraception, the copper IUD offers safe, convenient, highly effective contraception for over a decade after placement, and is rapidly reversible when pregnancy is desired,\" referring to a type of long-acting intrauterine device.",
      "Dr. Mary Rosser, director of Integrated Women's Health at Columbia University Irving Medical Center, said this was a large, high-quality study that looked at many types of hormones over many years. But she added that doctors shouldn't change their advice yet.",
      "Johansson and Hadizadeh stressed that the results should guide shared decision-making, not cause alarm. \"It may be reasonable to consider formulations associated with lower observed risk in our data,\" they said. They noted that products containing medroxyprogesterone acetate, drospirenone, or levonorgestrel were linked to lower risk, while long-term use of desogestrel-only contraceptives might be best avoided when other options fit.",
      "Keeping the risk in perspective",
      "Hormonal birth control provides many health benefits beyond pregnancy prevention. It can lighten heavy periods, ease pain from endometriosis, and lower the risk of ovarian and uterine cancers for years after stopping. M\u00f8rch noted that even small risks are worth discussing but said decisions should be guided by women's \"values and preferences.\"",
      "White said it's important to see the big picture. \"The risk of an unintended pregnancy is 85% for people who do not use contraception\u2014so any risks of birth control need to be weighed against the risk of an unexpected pregnancy,\" she wrote.",
      "KFF Health News is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at KFF \u2014 the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/largest-spider-web-discovered-cave-greece-albania-border/",
    "published": "Fri, 14 Nov 2025 14:12:09 -0500",
    "summary": "The behavior, which had never been observed before, stunned scientists as, typically, the larger house spider would prey on its smaller neighbor.",
    "story": [
      "What is thought to be the world's largest-known spider's web, housing tens of thousands of arachnids, has been discovered in a cave on the Albanian-Greek border.",
      "After researchers published their findings of two different spider species peacefully cohabiting in a giant colony nestled in a pitch-black, sulfur-rich cave, evolutionary biologist Lena Grinsted likened the \"extremely rare\" occurrence to humans living in an apartment block.",
      "\"When I saw this study, I was very excited because \u2026 group living is really rare in spiders,\" Grinsted, a senior lecturer at the U.K.'s University of Portsmouth, told The Associated Press. \"The fact that there was this massive colony of spiders living in a place that nobody had really noticed before \u2014 I find extremely exciting.\"",
      "The results of the study, published last month in the journal Subterranean Biology, spread rapidly online due to the striking images of the giant 1,140-square-foot spider's web, a carpet-thick sprawl stretching along a narrow passage wall inside Sulfur Cave, which extends into Albania from its entrance in Greece.",
      "This arachnophobe's worst nightmare was quickly labelled the \"world's largest spiderweb.\"",
      "But the most surprising thing about the spider colony \u2014 which boasts an estimated 110,000 spiders \u2014 had less to do with its size and more to do with what scientists found inside the huge mass of funnel-shaped webs.",
      "Two different spider species \u2014 about 69,000 Tegenaria domestica, or common house spider, and 42,000 Prinerigone vagans \u2014 were living side by side and thriving. The behavior, which had never been observed before, stunned scientists as, typically, the larger house spider would prey on its smaller neighbor.",
      "\"So often if you have spiders in close vicinity, they will fight and end up eating each other,\" said Grinsted, who was not part of the cave study but has extensively researched spiders. \"We can sometimes see that if there's an abundance of food that they sort of become a bit less aggressive.\"",
      "In addition to spiders, the terrestrial fauna in the cave include centipedes, terrestrial isopods, scorpions and beetles, the researchers said.",
      "\"In the stream passage located close to the cave entrance, a dense swarm of adult chironomid flies fills the air in the immediate vicinity of the sulfidic stream, and a large portion of the cave wall is covered by a massive colonial spider web,\" the study's authors write.",
      "Abundant food source",
      "Scientists are keen to understand how and why the two species came to coexist peacefully in a \"permanently dark zone\" about 160 feet from the entrance of the cave, carved out by the waters of the Sarandaporo River to form the Vromoner Canyon. (The study's authors note that Vromoner means \"smelly water\" in Greek.)",
      "Part of the answer, the research suggests, may lie in the combination of the estimated 2.4 million midge flies that buzz around the spider colony \u2014 an \"unusually dense swarm\" that provides a constant food source in an otherwise predator-scarce environment. The scientists also speculate that the friendly living arrangement could be a result of darkness impairing the spiders' vision.",
      "However, Grinsted says it is more likely that the larger spiders evolved or simply grew accustomed to responding to vibratory cues when the small flies land on their silken web \u2014 and maybe don't attack otherwise.",
      "\"Spiders, in general, are not particularly good at seeing stuff ... and that includes these two species,\" she said. She added that the two species might cooperate \"to some extent in building the web \u2026 but I think it's highly unlikely that they cooperate in anything else like prey capture, in brood care, or looking after each other's babies.\"",
      "Grinsted draws parallels between the cohabiting spiders and how humans tend to coexist in apartment blocks.",
      "\"You're very happy to share the stairs, the lift,\" she said. \"But if anybody comes into your living room and you haven't invited them, you'll be aggressive towards them.\"",
      "She added that while many spiders are \"typically solitary, very aggressive\" toward other critters, the cohabitation of two species is \"relatively common\" once spiders have evolved the ability to live in groups.",
      "\"But again, because these two species have never been found to live together and never been found to live in groups, it makes it particularly exciting,\" she said.",
      "\"The web is dense \u2014 like a blanket\"",
      "Blerina Vrenozi, a biologist and zoologist at the University of Tirana, in Albania, who co-authored the research paper, told the AP that the expeditions this year helped understand \"how this mystery existed in there.\"",
      "\"The DNA is interesting because they revealed that the species which live inside the cave is different from the one which lives outside the cave,\" she said. \"So it's the same species, but different DNA.\"",
      "The cave colony's giant web was first observed in 2021 by a team of Czech speleologists led by Marek Audy. A year later, the Czech team expanded to include scientists from multiple universities, which led to the recently published scientific paper.",
      "\"The web is dense; it's more like a blanket, and when there's danger, the female crawls back and hides, and no creature of a higher order can dig her out of there,\" Audy said. \"Spiders in the cave lay about a third of the eggs compared to spiders that live outdoors. Because it's certain that they will raise their offspring there \u2026 so they can afford to lay fewer eggs.\"",
      "Audy added that the cave, which is also home to large bat colonies, also thrive on the abundance of midges inside the humid, dark space. \"They are constantly having a party there, both the spiders and the bats,\" he said.",
      "Seemingly ideal environment",
      "The study noted that the methodology used might \"slightly overestimate\" the total population count of spiders in the colony, as some funnel webs may be abandoned or unoccupied. However, other experts agree that the team's exciting new research could offer broader evolutionary clues and deserves deeper study.",
      "Sara Goodacre, professor of evolutionary biology and genetics at the School of Life Sciences, at the U.K.'s University of Nottingham, says these kinds of research projects help pave the way for more studies that could prove \"fundamental to our understanding of what forces shape the world around us \u2014 spidery or not.\"",
      "\"Natural selection will favor the 'best' strategies \u2026 the 'winning strategy,' whatever this is,\" she said. \"My guess is that the benefits of being part of this community far outweigh the costs.\"",
      "She added that if the dynamics in the seemingly ideal environment of abundant food and relative safety were to change, \"then 'freeloading' will emerge and it will all break down.\"",
      "The politics of coexistence will hopefully not prove trickier above ground. Audy said that Albania has already asked which side the newly famous spiders lie.",
      "\"From a conservation point of view, we did something interesting there and marked out a border,\" he said. \"I just looked into it \u2014 and the spider web is on the Greek side.\"",
      "The discovery of the massive web comes just months after Australian scientists discovered a new species of the deadly funnel-web spider that is bigger and more venomous than its relatives, nicknaming it \"Big Boy.\"",

    "summary": "The Sentinel-6B is the second of two satellites in a $1 billion program to monitor sea levels over a full decade.",
    "story": [
      "SpaceX launched a joint NASA-European environmental research satellite early Monday, the second in an ongoing billion-dollar project to measure long-term changes in sea level, a key indicator of climate change.",
      "The first satellite, known as Sentinel-6 and named in honor of NASA climate researcher Michael Freilich, was launched in November 2020. The latest spacecraft, Sentinel-6B, was launched from California atop a Falcon 9 rocket at 12:21 a.m. EST.",
      "Both satellites are equipped with a sophisticated cloud-penetrating radar. By timing how long it takes beams to bounce back from the ocean 830 miles below, the Sentinel-6 satellites can track sea levels to an accuracy of about one inch while also measuring wave height and wind speeds.",
      "The project builds on earlier missions dating back to the early 1990s that have provided an uninterrupted stream of sea level data.",
      "That data indicates sea levels are slowly but surely rising, widely interpreted as evidence of global warming caused in large part by human industrial activity.",
      "But in keeping with recent Trump administration policies aimed at scaling back climate research and the interpretation of such data, NASA did not directly refer to \"climate change\" or \"global warming\" in a Sentinel-6B pre-launch briefing Saturday.",
      "In the press kit released by NASA for the first Sentinel 6 mission in 2020, the first item in a \"need to know list\" said the satellite would \"provide information that will help researchers understand how climate change is reshaping Earth's coastlines \u2014 and how fast this is happening.\"",
      "In the press kit for the Sentinel 6B mission launched Monday, NASA's first \"need to know\" item said simply that \"Sentinel-6B will contribute to a multi-decade dataset that is ... key to helping improve public safety, city planning and protecting commercial and defense interests.\"",
      "Karen St. Germain, director of NASA's Earth Science Division, did not directly mention climate change in the Saturday briefing, focusing instead on the practical importance of monitoring sea levels.",
      "\"Sentinel 6B is the latest in a line of missions stretching over three decades, keeping an uninterrupted watch over our planet's sea surface height, finding patterns and advancing our understanding of planet Earth,\" she said.",
      "She said the data provided by the Sentinel-6 satellites \"underpins navigation, search and rescue and industries like commercial fishing and shipping. These measurements form the basis for U.S. flood predictions for coastal infrastructure, real estate, energy storage sites and other assets along our shoreline.\"",
      "The data, she continued, will help scientists \"understand and predict coastal erosion and salt water encroachment into inland supplies of water that are used for agriculture, irrigation as well as municipal drinking water.\"",
      "Regardless of interpretation, the launch of Sentinel-6B went off without a hitch.",
      "After blasting off from launch complex 4E at the Vandenberg Space Force Base, the Falcon 9 rocket's first stage powered the vehicle out of the dense lower atmosphere, separated and flew itself back to a landing pad at the California launch site.",
      "The upper stage then carried out two firings of its single engine before releasing the 2,600-pound Sentinel-6B into an 830-mile-high orbit tilted 66 degrees to the equator, the same orbit used by Sentinel-6A and earlier sea level-monitoring spacecraft.",
      "Taking 112 minutes to complete one orbit, the solar-powered satellite will fly over locations between 66 degrees north and south latitude, covering 90 percent of the world's oceans.",
      "Along with measuring sea levels, the new satellite will monitor temperature and humidity in the lower atmosphere as well as the higher-altitude stratosphere using an instrument that measures atmospheric effects on signals broadcast by navigation satellites.",
      "But the primary mission is monitoring Earth's changing sea levels.",
      "\"The dynamic balance that persisted before the industrial revolution has been upset by the almost instantaneous combustion of huge reserves of carbon as our society has developed,\" Craig Donlon, a European Space Agency project scientist, said before the first Sentinel-6 launch in 2020.",
      "\"We see evidence of this dramatic change in many different measurements ... but they all point the same direction: the Earth is warming. And the greatest indicator of this Earth system imbalance is sea level rise.\"",
      "The Sentinel-6 satellites are the result of a collaboration between NASA, the European Space Agency, the European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).",
      "St. Germain said NASA's share of the cost for both Sentinel-6 satellites came to about $500 million. The Europeans contributed a similar amount.",

      "The centerpiece of Amazon and Blue Origin founder Jeff Bezos' space ambitions, the towering 321-foot-tall New Glenn rocket's seven methane-burning main engines ignited at 3:55 p.m. ET, majestically pushing the booster skyward atop 3.8 million pounds of thrust.",
      "The launch came three days late due to stormy weather on Earth and in space, where a powerful solar storm buffeted Earth's atmosphere with a torrent of high-energy radiation that could have caused electrical problems with the rocket or its payloads.",
      "The storm had abated by launch time Wednesday, and Blue Origin employees, looking on from viewing sites several miles from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station launch pad, cheered and applauded as the booster climbed skyward, followed moments later by the booming roar of its engines sweeping across the Space Coast.",
      "The New Glenn's maiden flight last January successfully boosted a  Blue Origin payload into orbit, but the reusable first stage failed in  its attempt to reach an offshore landing ship, named after Bezos'  mother, Jacklyn.",
      "The 188-foot-tall first stage launched Wednesday,  nicknamed \"Never Tell Me The Odds,\" featured a variety of upgrades to  improve performance. This time around, the big rocket flew itself to an  on-target touchdown, prompting more cheers and applause from Blue Origin  workers.",
      "Much like returning SpaceX Falcon 9 rockets, the larger New Glenn booster will be hauled back to Port Canaveral and, depending on its condition, be refurbished and readied for use on an upcoming New Glenn flight.",
      "The second stage, meanwhile, pressed ahead, carrying out two firings of its twin engines to reach the planned Earth-escape trajectory. Thirty-three minutes after liftoff, the ESCAPADE satellites were released to fly on their own.",
      "The NASA-sponsored payload, managed by the University of California, Berkeley Space Sciences Laboratory, is made up of two small, low-budget satellites known as Blue and Gold that make up the heart of the ESCAPADE mission. The acronym stands for Escape, Plasma Acceleration and Dynamics Explorers.",
      "The probes were built for UC Berkeley by Rocketlab under a NASA program intended to develop lower-cost, fast-track planetary missions.",
      "ESCAPADE cost $107.4 million, a bargain compared to the cost of more traditional, more sophisticated planetary spacecraft that can cost hundreds of millions to well over a billion dollars each.",
      "The ESCAPADE probes were originally expected to hitch a ride to Mars a few years ago with NASA's Psyche asteroid probe. But for a variety of reasons, the Mars satellites mission ultimately ended up on New Glenn's second flight.",
      "Mars launch windows typically open every two years when Earth and the red planet reach favorable positions in their orbits to permit direct flights using current rockets. The next such window opens in 2026.",
      "To make Wednesday's New Glenn launch work in 2025, mission planners with Advanced Space LLC came up with an innovative flight plan, one that will take Blue and Gold longer to reach Mars but will enable more flexible trajectories for future missions.",
      "The probes were deployed on a trajectory that will carry them a million miles out, well past the moon's orbit, where they will loiter for the next 11 months before heading back toward Earth.",
      "Passing within 600 miles of Earth in November 2027, the ESCAPADE probes will make velocity-boosting gravity assist flybys, augmented by onboard propulsion, to finally head for Mars.",
      "In all, the twin spacecraft will spend a full year in that initial kidney bean-shaped orbit out past the moon and back, and another 10 months in transit to Mars. The probes won't reach the red planet until September 2027.",
      "\"We are using a very flexible ... approach where we go into a loiter orbit around Earth in order to sort of wait until Earth and Mars are lined up correctly in November of next year to go to Mars,\" said Robert Lillis, the principal investigator.",
      "\"This is an exciting, flexible way to get to Mars because in the future ... we could potentially queue up spacecraft using the approach that ESCAPADE is pioneering\" without having to wait for a planetary launch window to open, Lillis said.",
      "While the ESCAPADE mission is modest compared to Mars rovers and more sophisticated orbiters, the probes are designed to answer key questions about the evolution of the Martian atmosphere.",
      "Mars once had a global magnetic field like Earth, but its molten core, which powered that field, mostly froze in place long ago, leaving only patchy, isolated remnants of that once-protective field in magnetized deposits.",
      "Without a protective global field like Earth's, the Martian atmosphere faces a constant barrage of high-speed electrons and protons blown away from the sun and from dense clouds of charged particles erupting from powerful solar storms.",
      "Working in tandem, first in the same orbit at different distances from each other and then from different altitudes, Blue and Gold will measure how the solar wind and energetic electrons and protons from solar storms interact with the Martian atmosphere.",
      "Data from earlier Mars satellites showed the planet's atmosphere is constantly being stripped by those interactions, but exactly how that happens over time is not fully understood.",
      "\"We really, really want to understand the interaction of the solar wind with Mars better than we do now,\" Lillis said. \"We know that atmospheric escape from Mars is a major driver for the evolution of the Martian climate. We know that Mars at least was episodically warm and wet for a couple billion years, but hasn't been so for about 2 billion years or so. And we think atmospheric escape is a major reason for that.\"",
      "Blue and Gold will provide what amounts to a stereo view of those processes.",
      "\"If you only have one spacecraft, you can either measure what the sun is throwing at Mars, the so-called space weather environment upstream of Mars, or you can measure the conditions close to Mars in its upper atmosphere, where the atmosphere is escaping,\" Lillis said.",
      "\"You can't be in two places at once. But we can, because we have two spacecraft to do this. So we can really get that cause-and-effect at the same time. We've never had that before, and that's really exciting,\" Lillis said.",

    "story": [
      "A severe geomagnetic storm is forecast to hit Earth's magnetic field on Wednesday, which could cause widespread disruption to infrastructure technology and make northern lights visible for much of the northern half of the U.S.",
      "The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration on Tuesday issued a G4, or severe, geomagnetic storm watch in response to recent coronal mass ejections, or CMEs, from the sun. CMEs are huge bubbles of coronal plasma that the sun occasionally ejects, NASA says. The highest geomagnetic storm level is G5, which is considered extreme.",
      "The latest CME was the \"most energetic and fastest of the CMEs\" that erupted in the past few days, NOAA said. It was also associated with one of the strongest solar flares of the current solar cycle. The flare\u00a0peaked around 5 a.m. ET Tuesday and was classified as an R3 or \"strong\" flare, meaning it has the potential to cause major disruptions to high-frequency radio on the sunlit side of Earth and cause low-frequency navigation signal issues.",
      "The severe storm is expected to impact Earth around midday Wednesday, the Space Weather Prediction Center said, although it noted the forecast is \"tough\" and it only had a \"moderate level of certainty\" on the timing.",
      "Another G3, or strong, geomagnetic storm was expected to affect Earth on Thursday, NOAA said.",
      "Northern lights forecast",
      "While the potential geomagnetic storms can cause disruptions to critical communication infrastructure, they could also make the aurora visible as far south as Alabama and in Northern California beginning Tuesday night, NOAA said.",
      "The University of Alaska and Space Weather Prediction Center forecasts say the best chance of seeing the northern lights starts as early as 10 p.m. ET Tuesday and will last until around 1 a.m. Wednesday.",
      "During that time, \"highly active auroral displays\" might be visible in places like Portland, Oregon; Cheyenne, Wyoming, and New York City, the University of Alaska said. The northern lights might also be visible close to the horizon as far south as Oklahoma City and Raleigh, North Carolina, the university said.",
      "In May 2024, a\u00a0powerful coronal mass ejection\u00a0brought the strongest\u00a0geomagnetic storm\u00a0in more than 20 years to Earth. During the CME, multiple X-class solar flares\u00a0were recorded. That storm caused some radio blackouts.",
      "Another strong geomagnetic storm in October 2024\u00a0led to the northern lights\u00a0being visible as far south as Florida and over bright areas like New York City and Chicago.",

    "published": "Fri, 14 Nov 2025 16:31:18 -0500",
    "summary": "The stock market has stumbled on concerns that the surge in artificial intelligence stocks could echo the dot-com bubble.",
    "story": [
      "Artificial intelligence has fired the stock market to record highs this year, with companies eager to tout their AI prowess and investor darlings like AI chipmaker Nvidia soaring\u00a0on expectations of runaway growth.",
      "But a tinge of fear is starting to shadow that exuberance as investors worry the AI boom could go bust.",
      "The startling run-up in AI-related stocks is prompting comparisons to the dot-com era of the late 1990s, when many internet companies saw their stock prices skyrocket despite suffering vast financial losses. When that bubble burst in the early 2000s, it took down former high-fliers like Pets.com, torched investor portfolios and triggered a recession.",
      "Bubbles occur when stocks surge on inflated growth expectations that ultimately prove to be disconnected from a company's underlying fundamentals, a painful reality check that typically ends with overhyped shares falling back to Earth.",
      "Thursday's stock market tumble \u2014 when high-flying AI stocks such as Nvidia and CoreWeave led the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite to see its biggest drop in months \u2014 fueled further anxiety this week about another bubble.",
      "Beyond the stock market, economists are also questioning whether AI will turn out to be as transformative for businesses as proponents of the technology insist. Advocates say AI will spur a productivity boom, leading to stronger corporate growth and profitability.",
      "\"The stock market is a giant bet on AI right now. It's really 10 companies that are driving all of it,\" Rebecca Homkes, an economist and lecturer at the London Business School, told CBS News.",
      "In other words, this year's 15% gain in the S&P 500 \u00a0is largely due to a handful of tech giants that are heavily investing in AI. The combined market capitalization of the so-called \"Magnificent 7\" \u2014 Google-owner Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla \u2014 today represents a record 37% of the S&P 500's total value, according to Morningstar.",
      "Irrational exuberance?",
      "That may give pause to the millions of Americans who are saving for retirement in 401(k) and other plans. If the market's gains lean so heavily on a few dominant companies, as during the dot-com bubble, the fallout could be severe if investors suddenly sour on AI.",
      "\"No one wants to be caught dancing after the music has stopped,\" Aaron Schaechterle, portfolio manager at Janus Henderson, said in an email.",
      "Still, today's stock valuations aren't nearly as stretched as they were in the late 1990s, Goldman Sachs analysts note. The investment bank's analysis of the Magnificent 7's median price-to-earnings ratio \u2014 a measure of a company's share price compared to its profits \u2014 found it is \"roughly half\" that of the largest seven companies in the late 1990s.",
      "\"So it is true that valuations are high but, in our view, generally not at levels that are as high as are typically seen at the height of a financial bubble,\" they noted.",
      "Why this time may be different",
      "The question of whether AI is fueling a bubble akin to the late 1990s was even posed to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell at the central bank's Oct. 29 meeting.",
      "\"This is different in the sense that these companies \u2014 the companies that are so highly valued \u2014 actually have earnings and stuff like that,\" Powell said. \"So you go back to the '90s and the dot-com [period]... these were ideas rather than companies.\"",
      "Nvidia, for example, the AI boom's poster child, has seen its revenue more than double to $130 billion in its last fiscal year, while its profit surged 145%.",
      "Although the stock market may not be in imminent danger of a bubble-bursting crash, economists are increasingly questioning whether AI companies can live up to the hype, as well as justify the trillions in capital spending on the data centers and other infrastructure required to power the AI revolution.",
      "For these bets to pay off, AI will need to transform U.S. businesses by spurring a productivity boom that translates into stronger corporate growth and profitability, experts say.",
      "\"We want to understand whether this is storytelling or actual tangible gains,\" Homkes of the London Business School told CBS News.",
      "For tech evangelists like Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, the AI boom will lead to a \"4th industrial revolution\" that could supercharge economic growth. \"This is an AI Arms Race, and what is fueling this next chapter of growth is Big Tech spending and that is NOT slowing down into 2026,\" he wrote this week in a research note.",
      "\"The doubters need to come on board and recognize this is a transformational technology,\" Homkes agreed, while noting that such a shift is likely to take much longer than some AI boosters currently envision.",

      "Anthropic said Thursday that Chinese hackers used its artificial intelligence technology in what the company believes is the first cyberespionage operation largely carried out using AI.",
      "Anthropic said the cybercriminals used its popular chatbot, Claude, to target roughly 30 technology companies, financial institutions, chemical manufacturers and government agencies. The hackers used the AI platform to gather usernames and passwords from the companies' databases that they then exploited to steal private data, Anthropic said, while noting that only a \"small number\" of these attacks succeeded.",
      "\"We believe this is the first documented case of a large-scale cyberattack executed without substantial human intervention,\" Anthropic said in a statement.",
      "The San Francisco-based company shared its findings with CBS News but did not offer additional comment. The news was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.",
      "Anthropic said it began detecting suspicious activity in mid-September. A subsequent investigation by the company revealed that the activity stemmed from an espionage campaign that Anthropic said was likely carried out by a state-sponsored group based in China.",
      "According to the investigation, hackers allegedly duped Claude into thinking it was an employee of a legitimate cybersecurity firm and that it was being used for defensive testing. Anthropic also said the cybercriminals sought to hide their tracks by breaking down the attack into small tasks.",
      "Unlike conventional cyberattacks, the operation required minimal human intervention, according to the company. \"The AI made thousands of requests per second, an attack speed that would have been, for human hackers, simply impossible to match,\" Anthropic said.",
      "Anthropic said it expects AI cyberattacks to grow in scale and sophistication as so-called agents become more widely used for a range of services. AI agents are cheaper than professional hackers and can operate quickly at a larger scale, making them particularly attractive to cybercriminals, MIT Technology Review\u00a0has pointed out.",

      "\"Ninety-seven percent could not distinguish between music entirely generated by AI and human-created music,\" said Deezer in a statement.",

      "Deezer said more than half of the respondents felt uncomfortable at not being able to tell the difference.",
      "Pollsters also asked broader questions about the impact of AI, with 51 percent saying the technology would lead to more low-quality music on streaming platforms and almost two-thirds believing it will lead to a loss of creativity.",
      "\"The survey results clearly show that people care about music and want to know if they're listening to AI or human made tracks or not,\" Deezer CEO Alexis Lanternier said in a statement.",
      "Deezer said there's not only been a surge in AI-generated content being uploaded to its platform, but it's attracting listeners as well.",
      "In January, one in 10 of the tracks streamed each day were completely AI-generated. Ten months later, that percentage has climbed to over one in three, or nearly 40,000 per day.",
      "Eighty percent of survey respondents wanted fully AI-generated music clearly labelled for listeners.",
      "Deezer is the only major music-streaming platform that systematically labels completely AI-generated content for users.",

    "summary": "Google said the fake messages are part of a massive criminal network called \"Lighthouse\" that has stolen information through phishing and smishing scams.",
    "story": [
      "Google is filing a federal lawsuit against a network of foreign cybercriminals based in China that is accused of launching massive text-message phishing attacks, the tech giant told CBS News in an exclusive interview.",
      "Google said the messages are part of a criminal network called \"Lighthouse.\" The texts look legitimate, often warning recipients of a \"stuck package\" or an \"unpaid toll,\" but they're actually phishing or what's called smishing \u2014 a type of phishing scam that uses text messages to try to trick recipients into revealing personal and sensitive information, such as passwords and credit card numbers, which are then stolen.",
      "\"These scammers ended up compromising anywhere from 15 [million] to 100 million potential credit cards within the U.S. and impacted, at our current estimates, over a million victims,\" Google's general counsel,   Halimah DeLaine Prado, told CBS News.",
      "DeLaine Prado said Google has filed what it calls a first-of-its-kind lawsuit under the RICO Act, which is typically used to take down organized crime rings.",
      "The case targets unknown operators \u2014 listed as John Does 1 through 25 \u2014 who allegedly built a \"phishing-as-a-service\" platform to power mass text attacks.",
      "DeLaine Prado said the lawsuit is not meant specifically to help victims recover any losses, but rather to serve as a \"deterrent for future criminals to create similar enterprises.\"",
      "Google said it found more than 100 fake sites using its logo to trick people into handing over passwords or credit card numbers. According to its complaint, it estimates the group has stolen sensitive information linked to tens of millions of credit cards in the U.S. alone.",
      "Kevin Gosschalk, the CEO of cybersecurity firm Arkose Labs, said that while recovering lost money is a challenge, lawsuits like Google's could help disrupt scammers' operations.",
      "\"It has an impact on the ecosystem,\" Gosschalk told CBS News. He said that if there are three major players and you go after the big one and take it down, \"then the other two start second-guessing, 'Hey, should we be in this business, or should we get out of this business?'\"",
      "Google's move appears aimed as much at setting a legal precedent as at seeking punishment \u2014 testing whether a 1970s racketeering law can be applied to a 21st-century digital crime.",
      "Gosschalk said it will be very hard for Google to go after cybercriminals overseas since a lot of them also operate in countries like Cambodia, where there are limited extradition laws.",
      "\"But it does mean the individuals behind those things will not be able to travel to the U.S. in the future, so it does add extra risk,\" Gosschalk said.",
      "Users can avoid text scams by not clicking links or replying to unknown messages. On an iPhone, users can turn on \"Filter Unknown Senders\" and \"Filter Junk.\" On Android, enable Spam Protection and forward scam texts to 7726 (SPAM).",
      "Note that those filters can also catch legitimate messages from numbers that are not in the phone's contact list, so be sure to check the unknown senders or spam folder once in a while.",

    "summary": "The documents include military reports about the search as well as memos, telegrams and newspaper clippings.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. National Archives has published a batch of newly declassified government records on Amelia Earhart, the American aviator who vanished over the Pacific in 1937, officials said.",
      "Earhart went missing while on a pioneering round-the-world flight with navigator Fred Noonan, and her disappearance is one of the most tantalizing mysteries in aviation lore.",
      "President Donald Trump ordered the declassification and release in September of all U.S. government records related to Earhart's ill-fated final flight.",
      "Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said the documents released on Friday included \"newly declassified files from the National Security Agency, information on Earhart's last known communications, weather and plane conditions at the time, and potential search locations, as well as subsequent inquiries and theories regarding her disappearance.\"",
      "Further documents would be publicly released on the National Archives website on a \"rolling basis\" as they are declassified, Gabbard said in a statement.",
      "The documents include a July 1937 radio log from Itasca, a U.S. Coast Guard cutter that was deployed to support Earhart's flight around the world. Itasca was the last ship to have radio contact with Earhart and Noonan before their aircraft disappeared. The phrase \"Earhart Unheard\" appears numerous times in the log.\u00a0 According to the National Archives, the last communication from Earhart's plane came at about 8:43 a.m. on Jul 2, 1937: \"We are on the line 157 337 wl rept msg we wl rept\u2026\"",
      "The documents also include military reports about the search as well as memos, telegrams and newspaper clippings.",
      "Among them is the July 16, 1960 front page of the San Mateo Times with the headline: \"Ex-Serviceman Claims He Saw Earhart Grave.\" Former Army Sergeant Thomas Devine told the newspaper that while serving in Saipan, a native on the island showed him an unmarked grave of two white people \"who came from the sky.\" Devine said he believed it to be the grave of Earhart and Noonan.",
      "In a separate newspaper article, dated Nov. 18, 1970, a researcher claimed that a former Pan American Airways employee had records indicating Earhart survived the crash and sent a distress call that was received by the airline.",
      "Many of the thousands of documents published online on Friday have been released previously by the National Archives or made available to researchers, and aviation experts consider it unlikely that the latest material will shed any new light on Earhart's disappearance.",
      "Earhart's final flight has fascinated historians for decades and spawned books, movies and theories galore.",
      "The prevailing belief is that Earhart, 39, and Noonan, 44, ran out of fuel and ditched their twin-engine Lockheed Electra in the Pacific near Howland Island while on one of the final legs of their epic journey.",
      "Earhart, who won fame in 1932 as the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic, took off on May 20, 1937 from Oakland, California, hoping to become the first woman to fly around the world.",
      "She and Noonan vanished on July 2, 1937 after taking off from Lae, Papua New Guinea, on a challenging 2,500-mile flight to refuel on Howland Island, a speck of a U.S. territory between Australia and Hawaii.",
      "They never made it.",
      "Efforts to find the aircraft have continued to this day.\u00a0 Last month, an\u00a0expedition\u00a0to try to locate Earhart's plane on a remote island in the Pacific was delayed until next year.",
      "A team of researchers was planning to travel to Nikumaroro Island in early November to determine whether something known as the Taraia Object \u2014 a visual anomaly seen in satellite and other imagery \u2014 is Earhart's aircraft. They are now awaiting additional clearances from local authorities as they work through the permit approvals, and cannot go later this year due to the start of cyclone season.",
      "The underwater object has been visible in photos dating back to 1938, the year after Earhart and Noonan disappeared.",
      "Researchers previously said there is\u00a0\"very strong\" evidence\u00a0that the object, which is in a lagoon on Nikumaroro, a small island in Kiribati about halfway between Australia and Hawaii, is the iconic aviator's plane. Some, however, have expressed skepticism. \"We've looked there in that spot, and there's nothing there,\" Ric Gillespie, executive director of the International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery, told NBC News in July.",
      "A team of researchers from Purdue and the Archaeological Legacy Institute plan to take photos and videos of the site, then use magnetometers and sonar devices to scan the area. The item will then be dredged and lifted from the water so researchers can attempt to identify it.",
      "Last year, an expedition team\u00a0captured a sonar image\u00a0in the Pacific Ocean that appeared to resemble Earhart's plane resting at the bottom of the sea. It\u00a0turned out to be\u00a0a rock formation.",

    "story": [
      "The Federal Aviation Administration said Sunday it was lifting all restrictions on commercial flights that were imposed at 40 major airports during the country's longest government shutdown.",
      "Airlines were given permission to resume their regular flight schedules beginning Monday at 6 a.m. EST, the agency said.",
      "The announcement was made in a joint statement by Transportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy and FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford.",
      "Citing safety concerns as staffing shortages grew at air traffic control facilities during the shutdown, the FAA issued an unprecedented order to limit traffic in the skies. It had been in place since Nov. 7, affecting thousands of flights across the country.",
      "Impacted airports included large hubs in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and Atlanta.",
      "The flight cuts started at 4% and later grew to 6% before the FAA on Friday rolled the restrictions back to 3%, citing continued improvements in air traffic controller staffing since the record 43-day shutdown ended on Nov. 12.",
      "The number of flights canceled this weekend was at its lowest point since the order took effect and was well below the 3% cuts FAA was requiring for Saturday and Sunday. Data from aviation analytics firm Cirium showed that less than 1% of all flights were canceled this weekend. The flight tracking website FlightAware said 149 flights were cut Sunday and 315 were canceled on Saturday.",
      "The FAA statement said an agency safety team recommended the order be rescinded after \"detailed reviews of safety trends and the steady decline of staffing-trigger events in air traffic control facilities.\"",
      "The statement said the FAA \"is aware of reports of non-compliance by carriers over the course of the emergency order. The agency is reviewing and assessing enforcement options.\" It did not elaborate.",
      "Cancellations hit their highest point Nov. 9, when airlines cut more than 2,900 flights because of the FAA order, ongoing controller shortages and severe weather in parts of the country. Conditions began to improve throughout last week as more controllers returned to work amid news that Congress was close to a deal to end the shutdown. That progress also prompted the FAA to pause plans for further rate increases.",
      "The agency had initially aimed for a 10% reduction in flights. Duffy had said worrisome safety data showed the move was necessary to ease pressure on the aviation system and help manage worsening staffing shortages at air traffic control facilities as the shutdown entered its second month and flight disruptions began to pile up.",
      "Air traffic controllers were among the federal employees who had to continue working without pay throughout the shutdown. They missed two paychecks during the impasse.",
      "Duffy hasn't shared the specific safety data that prompted the cuts, but he cited reports during the shutdown of planes getting too close in the air, more runway incursions and pilot concerns about controllers' responses.",

      "Officers continued, warning Doherty that failure to comply would result in his arrest. Still, the influencer continued to refuse commands and told them, \"Once I'm done with this bet,\" the arrest documents said. At this moment, Miami Beach Police safely apprehended Doherty in the middle of the road due to his \"deliberate refusal to follow lawful orders and continued to obstruct traffic.\"",
      "According to arrest documents, while officers searched Doherty's person, they found \"half of an orange oval-shaped pill with 3 imprinted on it, consistent with a Schedule II amphetamine, as well as a black plastic container holding three hand-rolled suspected cannabis cigarettes weighing approximately 4.0 grams combined.\"",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm Margaret Brennan in Washington.",
      "And this week on Face the Nation: The shutdown is over, but the problems that led to the crisis persist, and politicians are scrambling to make prices affordable for Americans.",
      "Affordability is the new buzzword in Washington, and President Trump is testing ideas to help consumers, including potential tariff dividends and 50-year mortgages. Those may be a tough sell, but Mr. Trump did move to help consumers by rolling back tariffs on some food imports, like bananas, beef and tomatoes.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "DONALD TRUMP (President of the United States): There's been a little bit of a rollback with some foods, like coffee as an example, where the prices of coffee were a little bit high. Now they will be on the low side in a very short period of time.",
      "In terms of affordability, it's not a good word for the Democrats. It's a good word for us, because our prices are much lower and will soon be much, much lower.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: One price spike that can't be fixed by easing tariffs, health care premiums, especially for those covered under Obamacare.",
      "We will look for solutions for that fix and more with two members of the House Problem Solvers Caucus, New York Democrat Tom Suozzi and Nebraska Republican Don Bacon, along with Dr. and Louisiana Republican Senator Bill Cassidy and New Hampshire Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen.",
      "And as we move into a new era of warfare, what does our military need for readiness? We will talk with the secretary of the army, Dan Driscoll.",
      "It's all just ahead on Face the Nation.",
      "Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation.",
      "Although we're all trying to put the pain of the shutdown behind us, the 43-day standoff on Capitol Hill exposed and amplified the need to address the rising cost of health care premiums. And our CBS News polling out today shows that two-thirds of Americans think their premiums will increase in the coming months.",
      "We begin today with two members of the so-called House Problem Solvers Caucus, New York Democrat Tom Suozzi and Nebraska Republican Don Bacon.",
      "Good morning. Good to have you here in a bipartisan conversation. You both recognize there's a problem here.",
      "Congressman Bacon, let me start with you.",
      "One out of every five dollars in this country that is spent goes to health care. We know these COVID era tax credit subsidies for Obamacare will go away at the end of the month. That's going to hit about 22 of the 24 million Americans who use that program. What can you do in the next six weeks to make costs go down in January?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DON BACON (R-Nebraska): Well, we need a temporary extension of these tax credits to keep these prices down.",
      "Republicans nor Democrats want to see premiums skyrocket. And they will if these expire with nothing in its place. That's why I worked with Tom Suozzi and other Democrats and Republicans to find a compromise. We just don't want to do a clean extension. Most Republicans don't anyway.",
      "So we think there needs to be some caps on income, and we want to assure all these credits go directly to lowering people's premiums. And, right now, about a third of the money doesn't make it to the premiums.",
      "So those are some reforms that we would like to see. And if we can get those accomplished, then we can extend these tax credits and keep these \u2013 the prices lower. But we do need a longer-term fix. The Affordable Care Act is unaffordable. And I think we need to have this extension to give us time to work on something bigger and deeper and that will help lower costs overall.",
      "But I'm proud to work with Tom Suozzi on this. And I appreciate his partnership.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman Suozzi, I understand this is a two-year proposed extension of those enhanced premium tax credits and an income cap that phases out for those making between $200,000 to $400,000.",
      "But when you look at the breakdown, though, that's a pretty small portion of the overall recipients of the tax credits. It's like less than 10 percent. So what does this accomplish? How does this make it more affordable and fair?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI (D-New York): Well, it helps everybody else who makes under $200,000 dramatically.",
      "And the number one concern people have in America is affordability. And health care affordability is right at the top of the list.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How much more affordable?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: So we need to do something to extend these premium tax credits.",
      "It'll save people thousands and thousands of dollars, literally $1,000 a month for some people. So it'll be dramatically more affordable. The people who make above $400,000 are the teeny little percentage of people that are not \u2013 a very small group of people that would benefit from the existing tax credits.",
      "Most of the people are below $200,000. That $200,000 to $400,000 is a way to taper it off, so there's not a cliff.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And how much Democratic support do you have for this at this point?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: I think that Democrats are going to strongly back the idea of extending premium tax credits, so that we can keep people's insurance affordable.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Even with these caps?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: So, we have got to come up with this compromise and \u2013 even with the caps, yes..",
      "People \u2013 Democrats have always said that they want to direct the policy towards lower- and middle-income folks. People making under $400,000 a year is our \u2013 our bread-and-butter issues, that we want to try and make things affordable for those folks.",
      "So \u2013 and that will be like literally 95 percent, 99 percent of the people that are affected right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman Bacon, sorry. Go ahead.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DON BACON: I was going to say, and Republicans, we pushed back on the thought of someone earning $600,000 getting all these tax credits.",
      "So when I listened to the Speaker \u2013 or Leader Thune, that was one of his big concerns on these. So that's why I wanted to ensure that we had this in our framework.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But a tweak with a not permanent, just a two-year extension. Republicans haven't really been proposing a lot of alternative Obamacare options here.",
      "Do you think the entire system needs to be rebooted? And when will we see that plan?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DON BACON: Well, I do think Republicans and Democrats are going to have to sit down at the table and figure out, what can we really do besides just throw more money at this?",
      "Right now, the premiums are just going up so much faster than inflation. It's unsustainable. And \u2013 but we can't do a Republican-only fix. It's not going to work. You're not going to get 60 votes in the Senate to do it.",
      "And I know some folks propose that back in Congress: Let's go up with our plan. Well, it can't just be a Republican plan if we want to pass something. So we got to sit down with Democrats and figure out, what can we do? And there's some good ideas out there.",
      "So, for example, I have heard, if we can directly subsidize high-risk people and put them in a separate pool and just lower their premiums through subsidies, and then the \u2013 let's call it the healthier folks, their premiums are going to go down significantly if we do that.",
      "So there's different concepts that we can do to \u2013 that can have an impact. But it's going to have to be a bipartisan way forward. It's not going to be a Republican-only bill, because you will never get it passed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "Congressman Suozzi, I mean, Aetna pulled out\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 of the Obamacare marketplace this year after CVS said they expected to lose as much as $400 million. Other big insurance companies have been pulling out.",
      "If insurance companies themselves are having problems with Obamacare, do Democrats need to be more open to broader reforms of the Affordable Care Act?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: Yes, we absolutely should be looking at any kind of reform. I want to mend it, not end it.",
      "You know that over the past decade that there have been over 70 attempts, mainly by the Republicans, not guys like Don Bacon, who's a very reasonable guy, to try and get rid of Obamacare altogether. We think that's a terrible idea.",
      "But if people want to try and make it a better system to make health care more affordable in America and to get health care to more people, we should be doing that. That's what the people want. That's what reasonable people in Congress want. We should be working together to try and expand health care coverage, lower prices for everybody, and make health care more effective and less expensive for people.",
      "Now, that's not going to happen with everybody yelling and screaming at each other. Everybody who says \"Why don't you just?\" doesn't know what the hell they're talking about. You cannot solve complicated problems in an environment of fear and anger. You need reasonable people to sit down and talk to each other and say, I think this, well, I think that\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: \u2026 and then work your way towards finding compromise. Very hard to do in this toxic environment.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: People like Don Bacon and other members of the Problem Solvers Caucus want to do that type of thing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. Well, but private health care costs are also going up.",
      "But on this topic of toxic environments here, Congressman Suozzi, Democrats, who won elections just a few days ago, credited their wins to this affordability issue and the message focused on that. Can you explain the focus this past week in the House by Democrats on the Jeffrey Epstein files?",
      "Is this a tactic to distract from the failure to extract health care changes or is there something else going on here? I mean, does the speaker putting it to a vote end this issue?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: I think it's a combination of factors, of people shining their lights on the most \u2013 the hot topic at the time.",
      "Jeffrey Epstein, of course, is an important topic. I'm sure I will vote to release his files, but that's not my priority.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: My priority is to focus on the things that the American people care about, affordability, immigration, taxes, crime, and health care. That's what people are fighting about. That's what they're concerned about. That's what we should be focused on in Congress.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Congressman Bacon, does the speaker putting this to a vote end the Epstein issue and get you back onto health care? I mean, the speaker said this is all a political exercise. Certainly, the families of the victims don't think it is.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DON BACON: I think the speaker realizes the train has left the station on this. Let's rip the Band-Aid off and get it done.",
      "And I wish the president realized that. The more the White House pushes back on this, it's \u2013 it just looks bad, right? I mean, it was \u2013 the attorney general came out and said, all these white binders, we're going to release all this information, and then a month later said, oh, no, we're not.",
      "So it's been a P.R. blunder from the beginning. And I think the speaker is right. This is going to happen, so let's get it done and vote on it. And we got to realize it still has to go to the Senate. Then it has to go to the president for signature.",
      "Meanwhile, our Oversight Committee is releasing thousands and thousands of pages of evidence concerning Epstein. So, for example, like 3,000 pages was released late last week. So the Oversight Committee, Republicans and Democrats, are putting out the data. They're putting out subpoenas.",
      "I think it's already working, but, like Tom, when this comes on the floor, I'm going to vote yes on it. I want transparency.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DON BACON: We want to protect the victims.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DON BACON: But everything else should just be \u2013 should be open.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You also, Congressman Bacon, run the Cyber Subcommittee. I want to ask you about something significant this past week, that A.I. firm Anthropic said that Chinese state-sponsored hackers used their technology to automate break-ins and carry out the first cyber espionage operation largely using A.I.",
      "It hit like 30 different companies. What can you tell us about the scope and the targets of this attack?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DON BACON: I can't say much more than what was just released, other than I can say this.",
      "China has replaced Russia as most formidable cyber threat. They have much higher technology. They are using A.I., which gives you a lot more capability in finding weaknesses in your adversaries' cyber defenses.",
      "What concerns me more than anything, while China is attacking us every single day and Russia, we have had no commander in charge of Cyber Command for over eight months. The White House or the president fired the Cyber Command commander over eight months ago and has not replaced him.",
      "Also, the top two positions at the National Security Agency, the top two are vacant for over eight months. And we have been cutting CISA, which is the agency that protects our private sector, our businesses, our infrastructure, and we have cut it by about a third.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DON BACON: And so our cyber capabilities are going backwards. We don't \u2013 we're rudderless in a time where China is attacking us every day. And that's something that really concerns me.",
      "And I have been pushing the White House to deal with this and to confront the cyber threat.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. Well, we will continue following that important story.",
      "Congressmen, thank you for trying to be problem solvers with us today.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DON BACON: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Face the Nation will be back in a minute. Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We want to turn now to some of the challenges faced by the U.S. military.",
      "And we're joined by the Secretary of the Army, Dan Driscoll.",
      "Good morning. Thank you for being here.",
      "DANIEL DRISCOLL (U.S. Secretary of the Army): Thank you so much for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: A lot to get to with you.",
      "Just quickly on news of day, the president did say he sort of made up his mind on Venezuela. I know this is the Marines, this is the Navy that are deployed. But does the Venezuelan army pose any kind of threat to the U.S. if action is taken?",
      "SECRETARY DANIEL DRISCOLL: I think that the president and secretary of war have spent a lot of time thinking about, what is the best thing they can do for the American people?",
      "And I can speak from the Army's perspective, which is, we have a lot of training in that part of the world. We're reactivating our jungle school in Panama. We would be ready to act on whatever the president and secwar needed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But no orders beyond these exercises at this point?",
      "SECRETARY DANIEL DRISCOLL: I \u2013 we don't talk about those kinds of things, but we would be ready if asked.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. OK.",
      "I do want to ask you about what has been happening with this shutdown. The government's now funded through January 30. You did get from Congress full- year funding for Veterans Affairs and military construction, a few other measures in this short-term bill.",
      "But in \u2013 we have seen the shutdown hit military bases and hit military families, costly, $400 million or more in emergency loans from USAA. How do you insulate the force so that the next shutdown doesn't hit these families the way it did this time?",
      "SECRETARY DANIEL DRISCOLL: I think the shutdown is indicative of one of the bigger problems that we have a nation have had.",
      "And so if you look back for the last 30 or 40 years, one of the reasons we've had such bad outcomes, when we spend the American taxpayers' hard- earned dollars, and we go buy things that our soldiers will need to fight, when we build things where our soldiers and their families will live, we are such a bad customer, because when you're on the other side of the deal with us and you have to deal with shutdowns \u2013 I mean, this shutdown will take months and months for us to get back and going on these projects.",
      "And this is part of the calcification of our system that, under President Trump, we are uniquely able to try to go after a lot of these things and actually get our Army and their families living in better areas, and get our soldiers ready for the modern fight. And the shutdown does not help.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you about the modern fight.",
      "Tom Cotton, who is the chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, told our Olivia Gazis here at CBS that the threat to military sites and large civilian gatherings is severe and growing. He cited gaps in law enforcement authorities. Some of them lapsed during the shutdown, I understand.",
      "And he's talking about trying to close enforcement gaps when it comes to drones. What authorizations do you need?",
      "SECRETARY DANIEL DRISCOLL: So, under Secretary of War Hegseth, the United States Army has been put in charge of the counterdrone threat for the Pentagon.",
      "And then we are working hand in fist \u2013 or hand in glove with the broader law enforcement agencies. We just last week had a meeting right outside the White House, where what we are trying to do, because this problem is different from nearly anything we've faced in a long time. It is a flying IED.",
      "And so this IED\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: IED, the explosive.",
      "SECRETARY DANIEL DRISCOLL: IED, improvised explosive device. They're cheap. You can 3-D print them at home, and they cross borders incredibly quickly.",
      "And so what you basically need is a digital layer to exchange information and exchange sensing and allow the closest person on the ground or the closest effector on the ground to be able to take out a drone. And Senator Cotton is right. I mean, this is the threat of humanity's lifetime.",
      "What's occurring in Ukraine, what's happening in Russia, if you look at the speed and scale of the devastation that can come from drones, we as a federal government have got to lead on it. But I'm really optimistic. This is actually something we are doing right. We are partnering with both federal law enforcement.",
      "In a couple of weeks, we're having the Sheriff's Association come. We were just at the NYPD. We're including all of the different law enforcement agencies, thinking about the borders and the ports and the upcoming NFL games and Olympics and World Cup.",
      "Like, this is something we as a nation can lead on. And so, under President Trump's leadership, we are moving fast at this problem.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And this is about radar jamming of drones to take them out, not exploding them?",
      "SECRETARY DANIEL DRISCOLL: So you \u2013 the problem with the drone fight is, you need all sorts of layered defense. One solution does not work. If you just try to jam them, if you look at what's happening in Ukraine, people have started to hardwire drones.",
      "And so you can't do R.F. jamming on a hardwired drone. And so there are things like net guns that are coming back. We're using all sorts of solutions and tools, and it makes it even more complicated when you're by an airport and you're doing it in your own homeland. You just have different authorities.",
      "And so a lot of this is a human problem of communication, command and control and having a layered set of solutions that you can use for any given problem.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you're talking about here at the homeland, things like the U.S. hosting the Olympics, the World Cup, even just the Super Bowl games that are coming up.",
      "SECRETARY DANIEL DRISCOLL: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Should there be restrictions in this country on who is able to own and operate drones?",
      "SECRETARY DANIEL DRISCOLL: I'm pretty optimistic that we will be able to figure out a solution where we will know what is in the sky at every moment across our country all at once.",
      "And so if you think of the president's\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But we're not there yet.",
      "SECRETARY DANIEL DRISCOLL: We're not there yet.",
      "But under the president's Golden Dome, I would think about this like a golden mini dome, where, if you took one of the sites for the World Cup, we are heavily focused on being able to see everything in the area, have all of the interceptors we will need, have all of the training for all of the different forces that will have to be able to act.",
      "And so to your specific question, I think we are trying to design a system so that Americans are able to fly drones, so that commercial companies like Amazon \u2013 like, the future of delivery, in a lot of ways, is commercial drones. And so we will just have to deconflict the skies, working with the FAA.",
      "But this is a big topic. I check in with Secretary of War Hegseth on this almost weekly.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So when we last saw the president of Ukraine, Zelenskyy, at the White House, he brought up to President Trump, on camera, we've got great drones we want to sell to the United States or provide to the United States.",
      "You referred to Ukraine as the only Silicon Valley of warfare right now. What do you mean by that? Are they really ahead of the United States on innovation?",
      "SECRETARY DANIEL DRISCOLL: I think, if you look at what's happening, Operation Spider's Web in Russia, the Ukrainians used probably a couple hundred thousand dollars worth of drones and took out almost $10 billion worth of equipment in Russia.",
      "And Russia's in that fight. And so I think what is amazing about our country is, we are able to recognize where we need to innovate quickly. And what we're doing for drones, completely differently, I think, than we have done as an army in probably 50 or 60 years, is, we are welcoming in American industry.",
      "So we just did an A.I. war game where we invited 15 of the top CEOs in the nation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY DANIEL DRISCOLL: They were worth probably $18 trillion in enterprise value. And we said, how do you \u2013 can you please help us? What do you have in your tech innovation pipeline to help us with data in contested environments? How do we do logistics 6,000 miles away if we're facing an enemy who's trying to contest us?",
      "And we are working with them, no joke, daily to basically take their innovation and apply it to this problem.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But what I heard you saying there is, you look at the battlefield in Ukraine as kind of like a test lab for where warfare is going.",
      "SECRETARY DANIEL DRISCOLL: Yes. Yes. Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Can you convince some of your fellow Republicans that there is value in that fight, in terms of, you know, those who are so isolationist they don't want to be involved in Ukraine, even financially?",
      "SECRETARY DANIEL DRISCOLL: Well, I don't think I have talked to a single person who has said we shouldn't be learning from what's occurring in Ukraine. All of our equipment, all of the exquisite features we will need are definitionally going to come \u2013 the data set that the Ukrainians are getting for their generative A.I. models of when they have drones and they're flying and they're learning and they're doing counterdrone, and they're taking all of this information from their sensors and trying to figure out what's going on.",
      "There's not a single person I know that doesn't think that is an incredible treasure trove of information for future warfare. I think a lot of the questions are, how do we actually execute on the president's agenda of peace in that part of the world?",
      "Where \u2013 I have not been to the White House where it has not come up that we just want peace, so that the American industrial base can thrive everywhere.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SECRETARY DANIEL DRISCOLL: And we have to focus on that part of the world unnecessarily right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you're at the Department of War.",
      "SECRETARY DANIEL DRISCOLL: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you announced that the Army wants to buy a million drones over the next two to three years. Navy, Marines, Air Force, they will obviously be very involved in any war in the Pacific, but you've got to defend those American bases.",
      "SECRETARY DANIEL DRISCOLL: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So how do you think of the threat from China there? Because I have read that you think they're ahead of America.",
      "SECRETARY DANIEL DRISCOLL: So we're working on something with Congress called SkyFoundry.",
      "And basically the idea is to, again, do it right from the beginning. What the Army has historically gotten wrong in the last couple of decades is, we're either all in or all out, meaning we either use our organic industrial base and we make the drones ourselves, or we say, this is too complicated for us, we're going to have private industry do it.",
      "We are not doing that with drones, because, if you look at \u2013 Ukraine is manufacturing four million a year. China, I think, is at 12 to 14 million drones a year.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Wow.",
      "SECRETARY DANIEL DRISCOLL: And we as a nation will have to have our private sector able to help us.",
      "And so what we are going to do is, we are going to invest in things like sensors and brushless motors and circuit boards and a lot of the components that are really hard for the private sector to get right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY DANIEL DRISCOLL: The United States Army is going to build those on our bases and empower the private sector to purchase from us. And so we will make drones, our private partners will make drones, and we will catch up and surpass the Chinese incredibly quickly.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Secretary, thank you for your time.",
      "And I do want to make the point that you are taking questions. And that is unusual these days, since the Pentagon has restricted access to reporters. And we think it's important here that the American people hear about their own security as well as the military's three million or more employees. So thank you.",
      "We'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Trump administration has launched another immigration enforcement operation, this time in Charlotte, North Carolina, a blue city with one of the fastest growing immigrant populations in the country.",
      "The operation, called Charlotte's Web by the Department of Homeland Security, started Saturday. Federal agents from the CBP, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, have been seen making arrests, questioning gardeners, patrolling a Home Depot parking lot, and smashing windows.",
      "Trump administration officials tell our immigration reporter Camilo Montoya-Galvez that New Orleans is the next Border Patrol operation planned for this month.",

      "On Friday, we spoke with the chairman of one of the Senate committees responsible for crafting health care legislation. Louisiana's Bill Cassidy, who is also a doctor.",
      "We began by showing him what the president is thinking of for a health care fix.",
      "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
      "DONALD TRUMP (President Of The United States): I'm calling today for insurance companies not to be paid, but for the money, this massive amount of money, to be paid directly to the people of our country, so that they can buy their own health care, which will be far better and far less expensive than the disaster known as Obamacare.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So are you, Senator, coordinating with the White House on this proposal?",
      "SENATOR BILL CASSIDY (R-LA): So, we're absolutely in communication with the White House and with the administration, because there's a lot of stuff that you have to work out to do that.",
      "But let me give a little meat on the bones of what the president's speaking about. If you look at an Obamacare policy now, there's a $6,000 deductible. Democrats are fighting to lower the premiums. You lower a premium on something which has a $6,000 deductible, it's basically a catastrophic policy.",
      "Now, I like to speak to the cost of being insured, not just the cost of the health insurance. The president is proposing that we take the $26 billion that would be going to insurance companies if we just do a straight out extension. And, by the way, 20 percent of that $26 billion, 20 percent will go for profit and administration overhead. Give it directly to the American people in an account in which 100 percent of the money is used for them to purchase health care on their own terms.",
      "Now \u2013 now, that makes them an informed consumer. It also helps address the need to have coverage for that deductible. And if they get that policy with a higher deductible, they can actually lower their premium. It's a sweet spot. Lower premiums help with the deductible, making the patience the informed consumer. The president and I are united. We should all be united about that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the president' economic adviser, Kevin Hassett, was on this program last Sunday. He said the president was just brainstorming, things aren't formally put together among Republica senators yet.",
      "But I just want to clarify what you are coordinating with the president on here because, is it to buy your own insurance policy which is kind of complicated, or is it, to use this flexible spending account you've talked about for related health care needs, like a \u2013 are there restrictions on how you can use that money?",
      "SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: So, first, there's two types of premium tax credits. There's the baseline premium tax credit, which was part of Obamacare. That would stay in effect and people would still buy a policy, for example, they get in a car wreck, something disastrous, they need somebody negotiating on their behalf with all the providers. That stays the same.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: What we're talking about, and the shutdown was over, the enhanced premium tax credits. Policies have become so expensive under Obamacare that under Joe Biden Democrats passed another subsidy on top of the first subsidy. That's what we're fighting about. And what Republicans are saying, and I'd like to hope Democrats will too.",
      "Hey, wait a second, if we can have lower premiums and help people with their deductible, by giving the money directly to the patient, by the way, 20 percent doesn't go for insurance company profit and overhead, 100 percent goes for health care, why don't we unite Republicans and Democrats in doing that? That's where the president is. You've got to figure some things out, but we're a lot farther along than you might imagine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, do you want it fix Obamacare, or do you want to eliminate Obamacare?",
      "SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: First, you have to, like, we're going into 2026. That's like a month and a half from now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: And so you've got to work with what you have.",
      "But on the other hand, Obamacare was a top-heavy \u2013 administratively heavy type system in which a lot of money is \u2013 a lot of money and responsibility is taken from individuals and given to insurance companies as one example.",
      "I'm a doctor. I worked for 20 years in a hospital for the uninsured. I found that if you give the patient the power, good things happen. That's supported, by the way, by the medical literature. If the patient is engaged in her health care and the health care of her family, she's going to be a wise shopper, wise for her health and wise for her pocketbook. We need to have a new model. And that model is to engage the patient in her own health care. Doing so is good for her and good for us all.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK, but you said we \u2013 we need to work with what we have. That is, as you just said, you have a short amount of time before the \u2013 the end of the year. Do you think you need to extend the health care tax subsidies that are currently in place until you figure out all the rest of this complicated policy making?",
      "SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: Let me back you up a little bit, Margaret, to say, everybody assumes it's easy just to extend the premium tax credits. The enhanced premium tax credits. It's not that easy. Fifty percent of the states did not plan on them being extended, and they don't have rates as if they were to be extended. So, that means if we pass this mid-December, they've got to recalculate rates in time for, wait a second, by that time we're already into 2026. It's not an easy matter.",
      "And, by the way, did I mention, the policies that people want to lower their premiums for have $6,000 deductibles? It is basically something for insurance companies to make money off of, and for the individual to wade through $6,000 of debt before they can finally access it.",
      "Now, the kind of proposal I am proposing, Republicans are, and I hope Democrats will join, is let's take that money, and we have a mechanism to do so.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: We giving it to the patient. By giving her that money, she can choose a bronze level plan, with is to say lower premiums. So, now her premiums are down, but she has money in an account to help with the deductible. And I think we can figure that out about as easily we can figure out what we would do if we just did a straight out extension.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you want to do all this, though, by the second week of December, when the Democrats have been promised they'll have a vote on an ACA bill of their choice?",
      "SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: Yes. And I tell my Democratic colleagues, first, let's not be Democrats and Republicans. Let's be Americans representing all of Americans. Let's recognize what you're doing just gives money to insurance companies. But we can do it better with lower premiums and with money in accounts to pay deductibles. And then why don't we come together?",
      "There's going to be a Democratic bill and a Republican bill and both fail. Let's do an American bill where the American people benefit.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: And let's work together, collaborate, to lower those premiums and to help them with that first dollar coverage and the \u2013 and the deductible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, we looked and there are about 293,000 Louisianans, your state, enrolled in Obamacare currently. Six weeks from now, those expanded tax credits that you've been talking about will go away for individuals making $62,000 or above. Individuals making less than that amount will see their tax credits shrink.",
      "So, are you telling those hundreds of thousands in Louisiana that that tax credit is going away no matter what? That they should make plans for higher prices?",
      "SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: No. I'm telling them that we are working to make it work better for them. And they would tell you, by the way, wait a second, I got a $6,000 deductible. That does not work for me.",
      "Margaret, I'm a doctor. I would talk to people when they'd come to see me, and they would tell me, I can't afford that, my deductible is too high. That's reality. And that reality is being lost in this discussion.",
      "We've got to do something about sky-high deductible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: Maybe you can afford the premium. You can't afford the policy. Let's lower the cost of having health insurance, focusing by not just on the premium, but the deductible, and I think we can do both.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, even in the private market, health care costs have gone up about six to nine percent when you look at the projections.",
      "SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: Oh, yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But I want to ask you about your oversight rule. Secretary Kennedy has this hand-picked panel of vaccine advisers, you know them at ACIP, they're going to meet in a few days and potentially vote on changing the hepatitis b vaccine schedule for infants. That same vaccine advisory group is also considering the safety of vaccine ingredients, like aluminum, which would impact a number of childhood shots. This should matter for American parents.",
      "Are you comfortable with what they are about to put to a vote?",
      "SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: I'm very concerned about this. As it turns out, my medical practice focused on hepatitis b. And so, we know that because of a recommended dose at birth of hepatitis b vaccine, recommended not mandated, the number of children born contracting hepatitis b at birth or shortly thereafter has decreased from about 20,000 20 years ago to like 200 now. That's 20 \u2013 effectively a clerical error. We have decreased the incidents of chronic hepatitis b by 20,000 people over the last two decades with this kind of recommendation.",
      "And by the way, if you're infected at birth, you're more likely \u2013 you're 95 percent likely to become a chronic carrier. The vaccine is safe. It has been established. And these ingredients they're speaking of have been shown to be safe. This is policy by people who don't understand the epidemiology of hepatitis b or who've grown comfortable with the fact that we've been so successful with our recommendation that now the incident of hepatitis b is so low, they feel like we can rest on our laurels.",
      "I'm a doctor. I have seen people die from vaccine-preventable disease. I want people to be healthy. I want to make America healthy. And you don't start by stopping recommendations that have made us substantially healthier.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the president of the United States also told American women not to take Tylenol or give it to their kids. This is based on a theory that it causes autism somehow. And he also, in a social media post, the same one, called for the measles, mumps, and rubella shot to be broken up into three different shots. That was then endorsed by the acting CDC director.",
      "Are you concerned by this kind of suggestive linkage at the top of the CDC and from the White House?",
      "SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: Again, I'm a doctor, and so I'm going to go where the evidence takes me. And the best evidence is a study out of Sweden with two million children that found no \u2013 no causality, no association, if you will, between taking Tylenol in pregnancy and getting autism. And, of course, that concerns me, because there's going to be a mama out there, again, I'm a doctor, I talk to \u2013 I talk to patients in a \u2013 in a room. And her child has autism. She took Tylenol for a high fever during pregnancy and now blames herself. That's just the way mamas think. And that's wrong. We don't want her to think that.",
      "The best evidence, that there is no relationship. By the way, if you have a high fever during pregnancy, that may be a risk for autism. Now, of course, if you're pregnant, talk to your physician before you take anything. But point being, the best evidence is that there's no relationship between the two. And I don't want women putting themselves on a guilt trip when the best evidence shows not.",
      "By the way, the president has spoken out strongly in favor of immunizations in other cases. And I noted when he got his physical, he got the flu and covid shots. So, the president has demonstrated that he believes in immunization.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But that's why clarifying these statements, I think, is important, since you interpret them differently.",
      "I wonder, do you regret your confirmation vote for Secretary Kennedy?",
      "SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: I smile because every reporter asks me that. You live life forward.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, because these questions run right into a pledge that you extracted from him not to tinker with some of the structures that were set in place to have oversight of these vaccines and this process.",
      "SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: Yes, so you live life forward. Again, you just do. Let the day's own troubles be sufficient for the day. And I'll credit the secretary. He's brought attention to things like ultra processed food that has frankly never received this sort of attention before. And people praise him for that. So, he and I have publicly disagreed on some matters, but I strongly agree with him on others. And so \u2013 so, that's how I'll answer your question.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That sounds like yes.",
      "Is \u2013 if this is your final year in office, sir, will you make overhauling health care your top priority?",
      "SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: Well, I sure hope it's not my final year in office. But I have been thinking about health care for 30 years, because when I worked in a public hospital for the uninsured, I saw the burden it could be on middle income families who have middle income but couldn't afford the insurance or couldn't afford the health care. And so, it's been my priority for 30 years. And I will continue to do that.",
      "And if there is a silver lining \u2013 if there's a silver lining in the shutdown we just had, the silver lining is now we are focused on, how do we make health care more affordable for the American people? That should be our goal, not to be partisan one way or the other. How do we make it more affordable for fellow Americans? If we can accomplish that, I will feel like I have done my job.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, thank you for your time.",
      "And we'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to New Hampshire Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen.",
      "Good morning to you, Senator.",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN (D-NH): Good morning. Nice to be with you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you have spent a good part of the past year trying to get legislation through to extend those Obamacare tax credit subsidies. Last Sunday you crossed the aisle. You agreed to reopen the government, end the shutdown without a guaranteed extension, but with a promise to have some kind of vote on an ACA bill of Democrats own choosing.",
      "Do you have consensus among Democrats that this needs to be a vote simply to extend the tax credits as they stand now, or are you open to a broader reform of Obamacare?",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: From the beginning this shutdown, I have had two goals, one is to get the government up and running again to end the suffering that too many Americans were experiencing because they lost food assistance or they weren't getting paid, federal employees, and the second was to address the high cost of premium \u2013 health insurance that people are looking at because insurance companies are setting rates based on the fact that those premium tax credits are not \u2013 are supposed to go away at the end of this year.",
      "I think people are now very aware of the fact that they are going to see huge rate increases, double for so many people, and an unaffordable cost of health insurance if those premium tax credits go away. And what I think we need to do, and these are conversations that we need to have, is we need to work with our Republican colleagues to try and get a bill that can be supported, that can get through both houses of Congress where we've been talking to our Republicans, Senator Cassidy, throughout the shutdown about what we might be able to agree to. We've been talking to House members on both sides of the aisle. And so now we need to work together.",
      "I agree with Senator Cassidy, this should be a bill that is not partisan, but it should be a bill to extend those premium tax credits because, as everybody has talked about, there is real urgency to get this done. And if we don't address it, then people are going to see huge rate increases.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: So, we can work together. We can extend the credits, but we probably can't implement significant reforms that Senator Cassidy was talking about in the time frame that we've got. So, we need to look, both in the short-term and in the long-term for how we address the cost of health care.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK, so that's an important point there. So, the $26 billion or so that he talks about as the cost for extension of these that he wants to redirect into these cash accounts, these flexible accounts, you're saying, you can't get that done in six weeks' time?",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: No, you can't.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: And, again, there's real urgency to do this. There's some good, bipartisan legislation that has come out of committee in the Senate that I think we should take up, things that would expedite approval of generic drugs and biosimilars, that would address PBM reform, which is a huge cost increase for health care. But that's a longer term issue. Right now we need to address what people are facing in terms of those high rate increases because of the threats that these premium tax credits are going to end.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Just to put a fine point on it. When we heard the congressmen at the top of the program talking about, you know, caps on income and restrictions on who can benefit from those tax credits, can you get your fellow Democrats, who, by the way, are pretty angry at each other, angry at you as well, about this decision to reopen the government, can you get everyone on board, or can you at least get to 60 votes to be able to extend those subsidies with tweaks?",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: Well, first of all, we need to put the shutdown behind us, end the circular firing squad, and remember why we're in this situation. We're in this situation because Donald Trump and Speaker Johnson and the Republican majorities in the House and Senate have refused to address the cost of health care and are trying to throw people off their health care. Can we get to consensus? Well, we need to if we're going to get a bipartisan bill out of the Congress.",
      "I think we've seen and heard from health insurance companies that implementing significant changes in the first year is going to be really difficult to do, almost impossible. But we ought to be able to agree on some changes, like capping the income of people who receive those premium tax credits. Right now 94 percent of people who get the credits earn under $200,000 a year. And the average income for a single recipient is about a little over $30,000 a year. So, most people who are getting these tax credits are not in that high income level.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: And so we should be able to agree on that. We should be able to agree that we don't want any fraud and abuse in the program.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: That's something Republicans and Democrats believe in. So, let's focus on what we can agree to. Let's look at what we can get done in the time frame we have, and recognize there is real urgency to get these premium tax credits extended.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you're going to have this vote around the second week of December, but premiums are already notified out.",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They are already sort of baked in here for \u2013 certainly for Americans who buy government health care. Is it too late to extend open enrollment? I mean Senator Cassidy was saying, like, ship has sailed here.",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: No, we could actually decide that we were willing, as part of this legislation, to extend open enrollment. Obviously, we need support from the administration. But insurance companies, in meeting with the insurance industry, they've indicated that while it would be difficult, they could address some of the challenges around not getting agreement until December. Again, that's why there's urgency to get this done.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about another matter. Survivors of convicted child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, as well as some of the families of those survivors, wrote a letter to lawmakers supporting the release of Justice Department internal communications in regard to his case. In that letter they said, \"there was no middle ground here. There was no hiding behind party affiliation. We will remember your decision at the ballot box.\"",
      "You know this House vote is set to come up this week. Should there be a vote in the Senate? And would you support it to see the release of these documents?",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: Absolutely. We need to release the documents. The American people need to see what's in them. And if President Trump says there's nothing there that he's concerned about, then why doesn't he support release of the documents?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we will see if the Republican leader in the Senate takes up your proposal there. There has not been a commitment to have that kind of vote.",
      "But on Venezuela, since you are ranking member on Senator Foreign Relations, I want to make sure I ask you, the president has said he has sort of made up his mind on what to do about Venezuela. You were one of the very few senators who have received briefings within the past few weeks from Secretaries Rubio and Hegseth regarding the strikes that are being carried out on these small, fast-moving boats. Is there a clear end game here? And is your understanding that ousting Nicolas Maduro from power is part of the administration's plan?",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: I don't think it's clear what the end game is for this administration with respect to Venezuela. They are relying on a legal opinion \u2013 excuse me, in terms of the boat strikes that they have not released. They have finally made it available to members of Congress, but they haven't released it to the public. They are escalating in a way that - - talking about a land strike through special operations that puts at risk our men and women in the military. We have so much fire power now in the Caribbean, the Gerald R. Ford has been taken from the Red Sea so that now we don't have any fire power really in the Middle East as we look at the threats there. We don't have what we need, I think, in the Indo-Pacific, or in Europe. And so, what the president has done here is to put at risk other parts of the world and Americans in other parts of the world for this fascination on trying to get rid of Nicolas Maduro in Venezuela, who clearly is a bad character.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: He's been involved in drug \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: Illegal drugs. But he is not a threat to the United States of America.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: And what the president is doing is raising real questions.",

    "summary": "Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, a physician whose medical practice focused on hepatitis B, said he's \"very concerned\" about a potential change to the hepatitis B vaccine schedule for infants.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican who chairs the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, said he's \"very concerned\" about a potential change to the hepatitis B vaccine schedule for infants, with a key advisory panel set to meet in the coming weeks.",
      "\"I'm a doctor. I have seen people die from vaccine-preventable disease,\" Cassidy told \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" \"I want to make America healthy, and you don't start by stopping recommendations that have made us substantially healthier.\"",
      "Cassidy, a physician whose medical practice focused on hepatitis B, noted that because of the recommended hepatitis B vaccine dose at birth, \"we have decreased incidence of chronic hepatitis B by 20,000 people over the last two decades.\"",
      "\"The vaccine is safe. It has been established,\" Cassidy said. \"This is policy by people who don't understand the epidemiology of hepatitis B, or who have grown comfortable with the fact that we've been so successful with our recommendation that now the incidence of hepatitis B is so low, they feel like we can rest on our laurels.\"",
      "The Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices, a panel of experts who advise and vote on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's vaccine recommendations, is set to meet next month. The draft agenda for the Dec. 4-5 meeting includes discussions of the hepatitis B vaccine, and the meeting could entail votes on recommendations. In September, the panel voted to table a vote on whether to change the pediatric vaccine schedule for hepatitis B to a later date.",
      "Cassidy has previously weighed in on the panel. In June, the Louisiana Republican called for a postponement of the vaccine meeting after Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said he was \"retiring\" all 17 members of the panel, before replacing the committee members with his own picks. And in August, Cassidy likewise called for the panel to postpone its September vaccine advisory committee meeting amid a slew of departures from the CDC.",
      "The moves represented breaks with Kennedy, who was confirmed as the nation's top health official only after winning support from Cassidy.",
      "In February, Cassidy delivered the key vote to advance the nomination out of committee after he had expressed misgivings over Kennedy's nomination because of the doubts he had raised about vaccines. But Cassidy ultimately supported Kennedy's nomination, citing \"serious commitments\" he said he'd received from the administration.",
      "Asked by Brennan whether he regrets his vote to confirm Kennedy, Cassidy said \"every reporter asks me that.\"",
      "\"You live life forward,\" Cassidy added. \"Let the day's own troubles be sufficient for the day. And I'll credit the secretary. He's brought attention to things like ultra-processed food that has, frankly, never received this sort of attention before, and people praise him for that. So he and I have publicly disagreed on some matters, but I strongly agree with him on others, and so, so that's how I'll answer your question.\"",

    "summary": "Army Secretary Dan Driscoll said drones pose \"the threat of humanity's lifetime,\" but said he's \"really optimistic\" the government can find a solution.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Army Secretary Dan Driscoll said Sunday that drones pose \"the threat of humanity's lifetime,\" as officials have warned of escalating aerial security risks. But he said he's hopeful about the U.S.' approach.",
      "\"If you look at the speed and scale of the devastation that can come from drones, we as a federal government have got to lead on it,\" Driscoll said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" \"But I'm really optimistic. This is actually something we are doing right.\"",
      "Driscoll outlined that the U.S. Army has been put in charge of the counter-drone threat for the Pentagon, and is working \"hand in glove with the law enforcement agencies.\"",
      "\"What we are trying to do \u2014 because this problem is different from nearly anything faced in a long time \u2014 is a flying IED,\" Driscoll said, referring to Improvised Explosive Devices. \"They're cheap, you can 3D-print them at home, and they cross borders incredibly quickly.\"",
      "The comments come after Sen. Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican who leads the Senate Intelligence Committee, told CBS News last week that the threat to military sites and large civilian gatherings \"is severe and growing,\" citing evidence of persistent drone incursions and gaps in law enforcement authorities.",
      "Last year, there were more than 350 unauthorized drone flights over about 100 military installations, according to the Defense Department, along with more than 27,000 drones detected within 500 meters of the U.S. southern border in the last half of 2024. Meanwhile, the number of unauthorized flights during sporting events went down slightly last year, although the overall trend is continuing to move upward, according to NFL data.",
      "Driscoll said the Army is working with law enforcement agencies at borders and ports, and at major events like upcoming NFL games, the Olympics and the World Cup.",
      "\"This is something we as a nation can lead on,\" Driscoll said. \"And so under President Trump's leadership, we are moving fast at this problem.\"",
      "Driscoll said \"the problem with the drone fight is you need all sorts of layered defense,\" and he outlined that there are different authorities \"when you're doing it in your own homeland.\"",
      "\"A lot of this is a human problem of communication, command and control, and having a layered set of solutions that you can use for any given problem,\" he added.",
      "When it comes to regulating drones, Driscoll said he's \"pretty optimistic that we will be able to figure out a solution where we will know what is in the sky at every moment across our country, all at once.\"",
      "Driscoll said \"we are trying to design a system so that Americans are able to fly drones,\" along with commercial companies like Amazon. Citing the future of delivery in commercial drones, Driscoll said, \"we will just have to deconflict the skies, working with the FAA.\"",
      "\"What is amazing about our country is we are able to recognize where we need to innovate quickly,\" Driscoll said. \"What we're doing for drones, completely differently, I think than we have done as an arm in probably 50 or 60 years, is we're welcoming in American industry.\"",
      "On competition with China, which currently dominates commercial drone production, Driscoll said he expects to catch up.",
      "\"What we are going to do is we are going to invest in things like sensors and brushless motors and circuit boards and a lot of the components that are really hard for the private sector to get right now, the United States Army is going to build those on our bases and empower the private sector to purchase from us,\" he said. \"And so we will make drones. Our private partners will make drones, and we will catch up and surpass the Chinese incredibly quickly.\"",
      "After the 43-day government shutdown that resulted in $400 million in loans from USAA, Driscoll said it will take \"months and months\" for the military to get back to work on projects.",
      "\"This is part of the calcification of our system, that under President Trump, we are uniquely able to try to go after a lot of these things and actually get our army and their families living in better areas, and get our soldiers ready for the modern fight,\" he said. \"And the shutdown does not help.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, a New Hampshire Democrat who helped facilitate the deal to end the shutdown last week, said Sunday that lawmakers need to put the shutdown behind them as they look for consensus to address health care costs.",
      "\"We need to put the shutdown behind us, end the circular firing squad, and remember why we're in this situation,\" Shaheen said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Shaheen said \"we're in this situation because Donald Trump and Speaker Johnson and the Republican majorities in the House and Senate refused to address the cost of health care,\" adding that lawmakers need to reach consensus to get a bipartisan bill to address health care costs out of Congress.",
      "Democrats had sought an agreement to extend expiring Affordable Care Act tax credits in return for their votes to reopen the government. But on the 40th day of the shutdown, eight Senate Democrats, including Shaheen, broke ranks to reach a deal with Republicans to end the funding lapse, securing a promise to hold a vote next month on the tax credits, which help millions of Americans pay for health insurance premiums for plans purchased on state exchanges.",
      "Now, Democrats have an opportunity, and a short timeline, to move forward with the legislation of their choice to address the expiring tax credits. Exactly what that looks like, and whether it could find enough support to pass, remains to be seen.",
      "Shaheen said with the legislation, \"we ought to be able to agree on some changes, like capping the income of people who receive those premium tax credits,\" along with seeking to root out fraud and abuse within the program.",
      "\"So let's focus on what we can agree to,\" she said. \"Let's look at what we can get done in the timeframe we have, and recognize there is real urgency to get these premium tax credits extended.\"",
      "The New Hampshire Democrat, who worked with Republicans to come to the deal to end the shutdown, said Democrats need to work with their Republican colleagues to come up with a bill that can find support in both chambers. She said \"we've been talking to our Republicans, Sen. Cassidy, throughout the shutdown about what we might be able to agree to,\" along with House members on both sides of the aisle.",
      "Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican who also appeared on \"Face the Nation,\" said he's been in communication with the White House about a plan to bring down the cost of health care for Americans. But the plan takes a different approach, giving Americans money to help them offset high deductibles that are often a feature of the lower-cost policies under the ACA. The president has floated a similar idea.",
      "But Shaheen cast doubt on the plan, expressing urgency to address the health care costs in the short-term.",
      "\"We can work together, we can extend the credits, but we probably can't implement significant reforms that Sen. Cassidy was talking about in the time frame that we've got,\" Shaheen said. \"So we need to look both in the short term and in the long term for how we address the cost of health care.\"",

    "summary": "Dave Portnoy talks about his digital empire catering to a young, mostly-male audience that he calls \"normal guys,\" and about blowback from some of his site's \"locker-room\"-style content.",
    "story": [
      "Welcome to Barstool Sports, a digital-age company that is a force in American culture. The headquarters resembles a frat house, and the boss' office is a mess. \"The worst,\" said Barstool's president Dave Portnoy, a reigning king of content and controversy.",
      "Portnoy says he doesn't like a fight, and won't \"go out of my way\" for one, \"but if you are going to pick a fight with me, I will do anything I can to ruin you.\"",
      "What was once a free weekly newspaper of gambling tips founded out of his mom's basement in 2003 is now an online empire worth hundreds of millions of dollars.",
      "Asked to explain what Barstool is, Portnoy said, \"You're sitting at a bar, watching a game with your buddies. Anything you would talk about, that's what we're recording, how people interact with each other normally.\"",
      "And that's really what it is, podcasts and streaming shows of exactly that \u2013 people talking about pretty much anything: football, trivia, movies, and food, like Portnoy's own \"One Bite Pizza Reviews.\"",
      "Dave Portnoy's top pizza scores:",
      "\"We have a bunch of (hopefully) creative, funny, talented people, and we let 'em just run wild,\" Portnoy said. His job is \"managing that ship.\"",
      "As for managing himself, well, he doesn't hold back. \"I feel like I have a good moral compass,\" he said. \"So, I don't care what people say. I never have.\"",
      "Over the years, that's led to outrage and accusations that Portnoy is just another online troll \u2013 sexist, racist, and, as alleged by a 2021 article about his sex life, \"rough and demeaning\" in bed, allegations he flat out denies, and which have never led to charges.",
      "He objects to media outlets, like The New York Times, framing him as \"Dave Portnoy, who has a history of racist and sexist remarks\u2026\" \"I object strenuously to that,\" he said. \"And I hate them. They're the ones who have said it, or people who don't like me. I feel like virtually every single criticism (and some of 'em are brutal) have context around them that a fair-minded person, if they looked at the evidence, would be like, 'What they're saying about him's just not true.' But once it's said, it will never go away.\"",
      "\"People are coming up with real hate\"",
      "Raised in a liberal Jewish home outside of Boston, Portnoy now represents a movement in conservative politics \u2013 a young, mostly-male fan base who turned away from Democrats and voted for Donald Trump.",
      "I asked Portnoy, \"What happened to the Democrats? Why did they lose so many young men?\"",
      "\"People often think I have the answer,\" he replied. \"My nutshell is generally they were very anti-normal guys.\"",
      "\"What do you mean, 'normal guys'? Are you saying there's only one way to be a guy?\"",
      "\"It's okay to be like, if that girl's hot, 'Hey, that girl's hot. I want to drink, I want to party, I like frat parties\u2026' That was all bad,\" Portnoy said. \"And to be honest, the White guy ... was the bad guy, became the bad guy. And there's a lot of, you know, White dudes who are like, 'Well, I'm not the bad guy. Like, what are you getting mad at me for? I wasn't here for colonialism or any of the stuff that you guys are complaining about 200 years ago. Like, what did I do?'",
      "\"And even with the Trump stuff, he won the election,\" he said. \"You had a candidate basically calling you a deplorable or, you know, you're a Nazi if you vote for Trump. I don't know if they used that exact word, but it felt like that.\"",
      "Lately, though, Portnoy has been in the headlines, not for crossing a line, but for his efforts to draw one on antisemitism. He said, \"I've seen in my own experience, just being at Barstool, the difference between how much hate I get \u2013 I never, I mean, occasionally you get, 'Hey, kike' or 'Jew' or whatever. It's every day now. Like, there's a definitive shift in what's going on. So yeah, now, for me being a Jewish person, you have to step up. You're kind of someone people look up to in the Jewish community. You have to go, 'All right, this is not normal, ha-ha with the guys. People are coming up with real hate.'\"",
      "I asked, \"How do you explain that line to people?\"",
      "\"It's a tough one,\" Portnoy replied, \"and sometimes they don't get it.\"",
      "Just last week, a man was arrested for shouting antisemitic abuse at Portnoy while he was taping a video in Mississippi.",
      "I asked, \"The success of Barstool and yourself is based on not being afraid to offend, right? Speech is speech; a joke is a joke. Do you see a connection between what you unleashed and what you now have to deal with?\"",
      "\"No,\" Portnoy said. \"Because I think Barstool, and myself, has always had a pretty good moral compass. So, we've never stood for hate or anything of that ilk. I mean, do I think that feminists should complain about a Diet Coke can being skinny, and that somehow is, like, leading to an eating disorder by Diet Coke having a skinny can? That I think's crazy. And there are things that I think people get far too worked up [about], like he/she, verbs \u2013 like, crazy to me. Making jokes that you are trying to hurt people's feelings and are based in hate? That's never flown with us.\"",
      "He's voted for Trump three times. Still, Portnoy, who supports abortion rights, says these days he's disgusted by politics. \"I mean, who the heck would want to get into politics anyways?\" he said. \"People always ask me that. It's like, what are you, crazy? You can get more done as a private citizen. Everyone just hates your guts. And I don't know why half these people \u2013 I feel like it gets the worst candidates, period. Ninety-nine percent of politicians are scumbags. But, you know, look at what happened to Charlie Kirk. Serious stuff. Like, I don't want that in my life.\"",
      "Referring to acts of political violence that have been inflicted upon Kirk, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, President Trump, and Nancy Pelosi's husband, Portnoy said, \"I mean, I like my life.\"",
      "Portnoy is legally separated and has no plans for kids. He does give back, boosting small businesses all over the country with his pizza reviews, and with the tens of millions of dollars he raised for them during the pandemic. But at 48, he doesn't trust much of anything, including the media.",
      "Which made me wonder: Why did he say yes to an interview like this?",
      "\"It was primarily because I love the show,\" Portnoy replied. \"And even on the way over here I'm like, you know, if this turns into a hit piece on me (which happens a lot with reporters and it's like, 'Oh, that stunk'), I think it would still be worth it to be on 'CBS Sunday Morning.\" It's just part of, I mean, if you love a show, you wanna be part of it. Now, if it turns ugly, I'll probably hate the show after! But at least I'll be on it!",

      "Journalist Brian Goldstone, who has written for The New York Times, Harper's Magazine, The New Republic and others, spent about six years examining why so many people who work full-time jobs with low wages are homeless. His new book, \"There is No Place for Us\" (Crown), explores the challenges faced by millions of the working poor.",
      "In the excerpt below, Celeste (a pseudonym given by Goldstone) describes the bureaucracy she must endure when trying to obtain housing in Atlanta.",

      "When Celeste parked her vehicle down the street from Gateway at 6:00 a.m., a long line was snaking down the sidewalk outside of the building. She'd been told that since homeless assessments were conducted on a first-come, first-served basis, people often began lining up in the middle of the night. Still, she was surprised to find such a large crowd already gathered. The doors wouldn't be opening for another two hours. Celeste joined the queue, stepping gingerly around handcarts and baby strollers and small clusters of men and women wrapped in blankets, their belongings stacked beside them on the concrete. Having forced herself to eat a lukewarm Cup Noodles for breakfast, she felt woozy \u2014 and a little frightened too. A noticeably unwell man was cursing loudly and harassing another person nearby. She considered leaving but decided to stick it out, clutching a manila folder filled with documents while trying to avoid making eye contact with those around her. Six weeks earlier, when Celeste started her cancer treatment, any notion of securing long-term housing on her own had quickly vanished \u2014 and with it her resistance to seeking outside assistance. A fear of getting trapped indefinitely at Efficiency now outweighed the embarrassment of pleading for help; pride and dignity were luxuries she could no longer afford. And so, one morning during a work break, she'd gone out to her Durango and fished out the Homeless Resource List given to her by the social worker at Micah's school. Some phone numbers on the list were disconnected; others prompted her to leave a voicemail. But she was able to get through to a few service providers, and each of them, after Celeste described what she was looking for \u2014 help finding a landlord who would rent to her despite the eviction, and maybe some financial support to cover a security deposit \u2014 told her the same thing: To receive such aid, she'd first need to undergo an assessment through Gateway's \"coordinated entry\" system. And it had to be done in person.",
      "Celeste told Mason's mom, Christina, her neighbor a couple of doors down, that she was planning on going to Gateway soon. \"Good luck with that,\" the mother of six scoffed. Her own trek out to Gateway had been fruitless. Celeste thought: Yeah, well, you're not me. If anyone could navigate this system, it was her. She wasn't going to be undone by a little paperwork.",
      "It was almost nine-thirty when she finally entered the building. The interior was spacious and clean, if not quite welcoming. An airport-style metal detector opened onto an intake counter, a security guard station, and a few dozen chairs, occupied by people dozing or staring ahead or attempting to console their crying baby while waiting for their name to be called. In a corner of the lobby, alongside a clinic operated by Mercy Care, a community health center, a hallway led to public showers and a clothing bank; in the opposite corner, there was a large room that, on the coldest nights of winter, was used as a warming center for kids and their mothers. (Since 2013, Gateway's overnight facilities had been designated exclusively for men, but women with children were permitted to sleep in this glass-enclosed space \u2014 with no furnishings, no privacy \u2014 whenever outside temperatures fell below freezing.) Celeste checked in at the counter, located an unoccupied chair, and waited another hour and a half to be seen.",
      "A petite caseworker conducted Celeste's assessment in a bare, windowless office. As the woman settled in behind a computer, Celeste placed a stack of documents on her desk \u2014 hotel receipts, a police report from the arson, paystubs \u2014 and then launched into the story of how she and her kids had ended up without a home, which she'd been rehearsing in her head all morning. Adept at code-switching, she spoke in a clipped, professional manner \u2014 what she thought of as her \"talking to white people voice.\" The caseworker politely stopped her. In order to determine how best to assist her, she said, it was important that she first ask Celeste a series of questions. \"Oh, of course. No problem,\" Celeste replied.",
      "After a scripted preamble in which the woman explained that only \"yes,\" \"no,\" or one-word answers were acceptable and that any question could be skipped or refused, the assessment began. How many months had it been since Celeste had lived in permanent stable housing? Had she ever been diagnosed with a behavioral health disorder? What about HIV or AIDS? Since becoming homeless, had she been arrested? Or tried to harm herself in any way? Or been beaten up? How often did she drink or use drugs? Did she ever exchange sex for money? Or share needles with others?",
      "Celeste was perplexed. She wondered how all this was relevant to her situation. At one point, she gravely mentioned the cancer diagnosis; at another, she interjected to insist that she wasn't lazy, that she had been working nonstop since she was a teenager. The caseworker tapped away at her keyboard. And where was she living now? the woman asked. Celeste told her about the extended-stay.",
      "The assessment was over in a matter of minutes. The caseworker looked up and sighed. The purpose of these questions, she said, was to figure out who most urgently needed help. Based on the answers Celeste provided, it was clear that her vulnerability score, as the woman called it, would be very low \u2014 too low to qualify for housing assistance. The score had been calculated using the Vulnerability Index \u2014 Service Prioritization Decision Assistance Tool, or the VI-SPDAT. Created in 2013 by OrgCode Consulting, the VI-SPDAT was quickly adopted nationwide, as local communities sought to meet a new federal regulation that made funding for homeless services contingent on the implementation of a standardized intake and assessment process. The stated objective of the VI-SPDAT was to identify homeless individuals who were most at risk of dying or being sent to a jail or hospital, and to parcel out limited resources accordingly. In cities and counties across the United States, this technical-sounding survey had become a key instrument in efforts to address homelessness: a mechanism for determining who would \u2014 and would not \u2014 be eligible for support.",
      "\"But what about the cancer?\" Celeste asked, her tone changing. It felt demeaning to have to ask such a question. She had begun to realize that all the things she had been so proud of, such as her work ethic, were making it more, not less, likely that she would leave Gateway empty-handed. \"Doesn't that count for anything?\"",
      "\"Yes,\" the caseworker said, seeming to choose her words carefully. The illness did make Celeste more at risk. The real obstacle, however, was that she and her children did not fit the criteria for \"literal homelessness\" as set out by HUD. \"In order to get housing aid,\" she continued, \"you have to be considered literally homeless, which means you're in a shelter or on the street. Unfortunately, other circumstances don't qualify.\"",
      "Celeste's predicament was increasingly common. The existing support system ignored scores of homeless families who did not fit the government's definition of \"homeless.\" Advocacy groups had been fighting to expand the definition, refuting the myth that families with children living in extended-stays and doubled-up arrangements were somehow less vulnerable than other homeless populations; they argued that these conditions could be just as detrimental to a child's education, mental and physical health, and long-term development. Indeed, the U.S. Department of Education counted as homeless anyone who lacked \"a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence\" \u2014 which explicitly included those in hotels, motels, and living temporarily with others. That year, 2019, the Department of Education reported 35,538 homeless children and youth enrolled in Georgia public schools, an increase of 34 percent from a decade earlier. But the state's HUD-administered total \u2014 not only for children and youth but Georgia's entire homeless population \u2014 was 10,433. Politicians cited the smaller number when discussing homelessness in the state, claiming it was on the decline. This figure also helped determine the amount of money allocated to homeless services the following year. Meanwhile, the parents of those 35,538 students were caught between two parallel definitions. At their child's school, they were considered homeless. At places like Gateway, they were not.",
      "\"So let me get this straight,\" Celeste said. \"If I want y'all's help getting a home for me and my kids, I need to be considered \u2014 what did you call it \u2014 literally homeless?\"",
      "\"Yes, that's correct.\"",
      "\"And to be considered literally homeless, we've gotta be in a shelter?\"",
      "\"That's right. Or somewhere not meant for human habitation.\"",
      "\"All right then,\" Celeste said. \"So how do we get into a shelter?\"",
      "The caseworker took a deep breath. \"You said your son recently turned fifteen?\"",
      "\"Yes.\"",
      "\"I hate to say it, but I don't know of any family shelters that allow boys over the age of thirteen. Usually older boys have to go to a men's shelter.\"",
      "\"No way,\" Celeste said. \"Absolutely not. I'm not going to let my family be separated.\"",
      "\"I wish I had more to offer,\" the woman said. \"I'm sorry.\"",
      "When Celeste left the building, the line outside Gateway was just as long as it had been that morning.",

    "published": "Sun, 16 Nov 2025 10:36:36 -0500",
    "summary": "Despite working full-time, many families are locked out of the rental housing market, due to low wages, soaring rents and poor credit, and have been pushed into homelessness.",
    "story": [
      "In Atlanta, journalist Brian Goldstone introduces us to the intersection of Memorial Drive and Candler Road \u2013 the threshold of two neighborhoods. On one side: a liberal arts college and caf\u00e9s. \"And you cross over, and it's dialysis centers, it's liquor stores, it's payday lenders,\" he said. \"Other areas of Atlanta are booming, but this area sort of stayed stuck in this period of decline. \u2026 The poor are out here on these peripheral areas.\"",
      "Goldstone has devoted his book, \"There Is No Place for Us: Working and Homeless in America,\" to describing the challenges faced by literally millions of the working poor looking for a place to live. He has spent the better part of six years trying to understand why so many people who work full-time jobs with low wages are homeless.",
      "\"The story we as a nation have told ourselves, that hard work is the key to success, that work is an exit from poverty, not having a home, being homeless \u2013 what these people show us is that there's something profoundly not true about that story anymore,\" he said.",
      "In the course of his reporting, Goldstone met Celeste (he changed her name for her privacy). Celeste has been known to work two and three jobs at a time to support her eight children. (All but one are now adults.) She's inspected boxes at a warehouse, worked at a fast-food restaurant, even sold plates of food from her room. She's resourceful. \"I was working in a corner store from the time I was ten years old,\" she said. \"It always gave me, like, a sense of pride to do a good job at whatever I'm doing.\"",
      "If she doesn't have a car, she'll walk to work. Sometimes that boils down to cleaning and tidying up a convenience shop.",
      "Just surviving is a constant struggle. For one month, she slept in her car with the kids.",
      "What Celeste does not have is a passing credit score. \"I could have the most money, but if my credit score isn't a 700, then you don't want me in your property,\" she said.",
      "What totally destroyed her credit score was when an ex-boyfriend set fire to the home that she and her children were renting. \"Walking into that house was like walking into a black hole,\" Celeste said. \"We had nothing.\"",
      "Goldstone said, \"What pushed her and her children into homelessness was the fact that this home was owned by a private equity firm who demanded that she pay rent for the current month's rent and an additional month as well, and she wouldn't get her security deposit back. This was to break the lease on this home that had burned down.\"",
      "The sheriff put an eviction notice in the mailbox of the uninhabitable house. By the time Celeste found the notice, the judge had handed down a default judgment. \"And by that point her credit score had been destroyed,\" Goldstone said.",
      "\"Come for a night, stay for a while\"",
      "Which is what brought Celeste \u2013 what brings so many desperate people \u2013 to what's called an \"extended-stay hotel.\" Celeste lived there with two of her youngest children for about three months. To stay there, she had to pay $520 a week, about $75 a day. \"And that's only if you book online now,\" she said. \"If you don't book online and you have to pay them cash at the window, then you're paying the $80 a day.\"",
      "Over the years, Celeste has lived in about half a dozen extended-stays. \"That's how they advertise it, too,\" Celeste said. \"It actually says, 'Come for a night, stay for a while.'\"",
      "But the slogan, she says, is a trap: \"A lot of these places are substandard. One of the places where I stayed, there was, you know you put the mats down in the bathtub to cover supposedly slipping or falling or anything? Well, I pulled my mat up and there was a big hole in the tub. A lot of places have mold or mildew; they cause health problems. If you don't have them already, you will develop them.\"",
      "Celeste was still living in an extended-stay when things went from bad to a whole lot worse. She found out she had breast and ovarian cancer.",
      "I asked, \"Why didn't you go to the doctor?\"",
      "\"Life was lifing,\" she replied. \"People who are the primary breadwinners in a low-income family, you can't take the time off to go to the doctor. Because me missing a ten-hour shift at work, that's the difference of me paying for my room that day. So, of course, I want to keep a roof over my head. So, sick and all, I'm still going to go to work.\"",
      "\"What struck me over and over again is just how incredibly resilient you were, even after the cancer,\" I said. \"How? Why?\"",
      "\"Because that's the face you have to show the world,\" Celeste said. \"There were many nights that I just was on my hands and knees, praying and believing that God made me a promise, and I was going to do my part, because I knew He was going to do His.\"",
      "Taking advantage of desperation",
      "Many of these stories are variations on a similar theme, and disproportionately, they seem to impact people of color.",
      "Rhea, for example, has four children. In the last two years, she has lived with her kids in friends' apartments, in her car and, most recently, in extended-stay hotel rooms.",
      "The room she shares with her children has no closets, and a single small bathroom. Three of the kids sleep in bed with her; the oldest sleeps on an air mattress. \"I try to get one of them to sleep with him, but they don't want to. They all want to be piled in the bed with mama,\" she laughed.",
      "Rhea has been on her own with the kids since she left a domestic violence situation with the father of her children. Rhea says he never abused the kids, but \"he put his hands on me a couple of times,\" she said.",
      "Rhea eventually got a temporary protective order. No more abuse, but also no more child support. \"He's not allowed to be around me or the kids for two years,\" she said. \"So, I can't talk to him, his family, no one. So, everything is basically on me.\"",
      "Rhea's 20-year-old son helps where he can working some overnight shifts at Amazon, but she also has a seven-year-old son with major medical issues. \"He was born with congestive heart failure and he has severe asthma,\" she said. \"I've been in and out of hospital with him three or four times a month. I'm in and out of ICU with him.\"",
      "And that makes it all but impossible to keep a full-time job. Rhea struggles to pay $375 a week just for that extended-stay room working a patchwork of part-time jobs, including driving for Uber.",
      "Goldstone said, \"I think what was so shocking is that this kind of living situation is not cheaper than an apartment. It is often double, or even triple, what an apartment down the street would cost.\"",
      "What explains that? \"When people are desperate, and those who own these properties know that they are people who are desperate, they will take advantage of that desperation,\" Goldstone said.",
      "The big business of homelessness",
      "Extended-stay hotels are often the last resort for low-income families with poor credit who have become homeless \u2013 and, Goldstone said, homelessness has become big business. \"These hotels, they don't look like much, but there is a lot of money being made off of them,\" he said.",
      "It's happening in a lot of our cities, but especially here in Atlanta: Urban renewal, the renovation and improvement of mostly low-income neighborhoods, restoration, gentrification \u2013 it's all good, unless you're one of the families being squeezed out.",
      "\"It's the same Wall Street investors who are leading families and individuals to become homeless to begin with, because they buy up the rental housing and then, if you're even one day late on your rent, you have an eviction automatically filed against you,\" Goldstone said. \"Before you know it, you're out, and you don't have a home anymore.\"",
      "These days, things are much better for Maurice and Natalia (not their real names). They have an apartment; life is manageable. But only five years ago, they were on the brink of disaster.",
      "Maurice worked for a rental car agency, and Natalia for an insurance company. But when Natalia gave birth to their third child, her salary stopped.",
      "\"That threw everything off,\" Natalia said. \"I didn't get income for, like, a point in time. And then next thing you know, you're out in the street with a baby.\"",
      "Because? \"We were late,\" she said. \"I remember I begged her. She was like, 'Do you have it now? Can you get it now?' And all we needed was to get to Payday. It was crazy because, like, my mindset was, like, it was raining. The sheriff let me sit in his car.\"",
      "\"That still gives me anxiety,\" Maurice said. \"Just getting the call from work, and having to leave work in a hurry, and you come home and you see that, kind of does something to you as a man. \u2026 It transforms you. It breaks you. And it will continue to break you if you'll allow it.\"",
      "Natalia said, \"When we get to storage, there's another family there, too, and it's like, we don't say anything to each other, but we know that look, and all you know is, just nod. It's gonna be okay. Put your stuff in there, let's try to figure out somewhere to go.\"",
      "\"When you see a family at a bus stop with, you know, luggage, you know they're not going to the airport,\" Maurice said.",
      "Natalia said what haunts her most is the black trash bags: \"When you get evicted, all your stuff \u2026 well, it was black, but now it's clear bags.\"",
      "I asked, \"When did you first realize that you really were homeless?\"",
      "\"I was, like, filling out that paperwork and you would hesitate,\" Natalia said. \"They'll ask you where you are living specifically \u2013 are you renting? Are you a homeowner? Or are you homeless? You sit there and you struggle for a minute. You're like, 'Well, I have a roof over my head, but it's not mine, and it's temporary, and I could actually literally be booted out tomorrow.' So, you check the box homeless. That's what we are.\"",
      "\"An expensive prison\"",
      "It was 2020, during the pandemic, and the family of five was living in an extended-stay hotel room. Natalia was working remotely answering customer service calls. \"I got flagged because of the noise,\" she said. \"And they were asking me if I could go to a quieter spot. So, I sent them a picture of where I'm at, because I'm telling them I'm in a hotel, and they were like, 'Oh, we travel to hotels all the time. You could just go over to this \u2026' 'Ma'am, my bed is right here! The kitchen is right here! And that's where I'm working from. Please help me find this quiet space. I'm trying my best, you know?\"",
      "Maurice said, \"I remember just realizing this is like an expensive prison. I was just looking at the bill. My kids can't go outside, there's no playground. We've got to keep the curtain closed because people walk through the hotel, they're going to look into your room, so there is no privacy.\"",
      "In eight months, they spent $17,000 on the extended-stay room, nearly twice as much as they had paid on their old apartment.",
      "Goldstone said, \"I think it's really important that we not talk about all of these families and individuals as if they're falling into homelessness; they are being pushed. This is an engineered neglect, and at every turn there are entire business models that are set up to capitalize on their predicament.\"",
      "Asked if she was embarrassed about what happened, Natalia replied, \"If I could be honest, yes, 'cause remember, it's not supposed to happen to people like us. We do everything that we were supposed to be doing. We tried our best. But you know, you still end up in a hole, in a hell hole.\"",
      "\"Why isn't it supposed to happen to people like you?\" I asked. \"You're educated?\"",
      "\"Yes,\" she said.",
      "\"You're hard working?\"",
      "\"Yes. And we tried our best. You follow all the rules of life.\"",
      "As does Rhea, the single mother of four who pays $375 a week for that small extended-stay room.",
      "A car is her livelihood right now, but she no longer has one of her own. The car she's renting costs her $60 a day; she'll have to drive for Uber two or three hours after work just to pay the car off.",
      "The car already has 187,000 miles on it, and the tires, she says, are \"horrible.\"",
      "I asked, \"When you lie awake at night, what are you thinking about?\"",
      "\"Sometimes I want to give up,\" Rhea said.",
      "\"I can understand that. But you've got children, so you can't, right?\"",
      "\"Yeah, my kids keep me going,\" she said. \"It's so hard right now, I don't even know.\"",
      "Sometimes when things are at their darkest, help comes in the person of someone who's known hard times herself, someone like Sherri McCoy, who has a nonprofit for the homeless called Blessing Bags of Warmth. Rhea calls Sherri \"her angel.\"",
      "\"I wake up every day with a goal to help at least one person,\" said McCoy. \"We are a mutual aid organization, so I reach out to our generous community, and oftentimes people donate. Sometimes they don't, and that's when we dip into the reserves of good old credit cards, my own personal ones.\"",
      "To keep her family going \u2013 between the room, the car, and other expenses \u2013 Rhea has to make $1,200 a week. \"I'm constantly driving from 2:00 in the morning, and sometimes I won't sit down 'til 8:00 at night,\" she said.",
      "I asked, \"Could you work any harder?\"",
      "\"If I could, I would,\" Rhea smiled.",

    "summary": "January 6 defendant Dan Wilson was pardoned by President Trump for a second time on unrelated gun charges.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump has issued a second pardon to a January 6 defendant who remained imprisoned on separate gun offenses, leading to his release on Friday.",
      "Dan Wilson was one of the supporters of Mr. Trump who breached the Capitol on January 6, 2021. The Justice Department said in a 2024 news release that Wilson was a militia member who entered the building in a gas mask.",
      "He pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiracy to impede or injure a federal officer in May 2024 and was sentenced to five years in prison.",
      "He was pardoned on that charge in January 2025 when Mr. Trump granted clemency for about 1,500 January 6 defendants.",
      "Despite the pardon, Wilson remained incarcerated. Authorities had searched his home in June 2022 as part of their investigation into his presence at the Capitol.",
      "They recovered \"numerous firearms and ammunition,\" the Justice Department said, which he was forbidden from possessing because of previous felony convictions.",
      "Wilson pled guilty to a charge of possession of a firearm by a prohibited person and a charge of possession of an unregistered firearm, and was set to remain in prison until 2028.",
      "A White House official told CBS News that Mr. Trump was pardoning Wilson because the home search that led to the discovery of the firearms was part of the investigation into Wilson's January 6 charges.",
      "Wilson's pardon, reviewed by CBS News, was dated to Friday. He was released from prison on Friday evening, his lawyer George Pallas told the Associated Press.",
      "\"For too long, my client has been held as a political prisoner by a government that criminalized dissent,\" Pallas said in a statement to CBS News. \"President Trump's pardon rights this wrong and sends a clear message that peaceful Americans will not be persecuted for their beliefs. Mr. Wilson is innocent, he has always been innocent, and this pardon proves it.\"",
      "A sprawling legal battle",
      "Wilson's case became part of a legal debate over whether Mr. Trump's pardon of January 6-related crimes applied to other offenses discovered in investigations related to those charges. Mr. Trump has downplayed the events of the attack and referred to those jailed in connection with it as \"hostages.\"",
      "Wilson planned to participate in the riot at the Capitol for weeks, according to the Justice Department's 2024 news release, and occasionally discussed bringing firearms. He ultimately arrived unarmed.",
      "Throughout the day, he provided information in messaging channels about where people needed support as they worked to enter the Capitol, the Justice Department said. He also spoke to other members of far-right groups, including the Oath Keepers.",
      "The Justice Department initially argued that Trump's pardons did not extend to Wilson's gun charges, but later changed its position, saying that it had received \"further clarity on the intent of the Presidential Pardon.\"",
      "U.S. District Judge Dabney Friedrich, who oversaw Wilson's case and was nominated by Mr. Trump during his first term, criticized the move and called efforts to extend the pardon to cover offenses discovered in the course of the investigations \"extraordinary,\" according to the Associated Press.",
      "Mr. Trump also pardoned Suzanne Kaye, a Florida woman who was sentenced to 18 months in prison for threatening to shoot FBI agents. Kaye was questioned by FBI agents after saying online that she had been at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, according to CBS Miami. When contacted by agents, Kaye denied she had been there, but still agreed to speak with them, CBS Miami reported.",
      "In her video, posted to multiple platforms after that conversation but before her interview, Kaye said she would not talk to the FBI without a lawyer and that she would \"my second amendment right to shoot your f------ ass if you come here,\" according to CBIS Miami. A White House official described Kaye's comments as \"voicing her displeasure with the FBI using curt language,\" and said that it was \"clearly a case of disfavored First Amendment political speech being prosecuted and an excessive sentence.\"",

    "story": [
      "Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia on Saturday said she is receiving threats, one day after President Trump announced he is ending his support for his former longtime ally.",
      "Greene has been one of Mr. Trump's most ardent supporters going back to his first term, but seemingly broke with the president on several key issues over the past few weeks, including the political divide over health care funding, which lead to the longest government shutdown in U.S. history, and the controversy over the release of files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "\"Aggressive rhetoric attacking me has historically led to death threats and multiple convictions of men who were radicalized by the same type rhetoric being directed at me right now,\" Greene wrote in a lengthy social media post. \"This time by the President of the United States. As a woman I take threats from men seriously. I now have a small understanding of the fear and pressure the women, who are victims of Jeffrey Epstein and his cabal, must feel.\"",
      "She did not detail the exact nature of the threats. Greene's home has been the target of multiple swatting calls in the past.",
      "A group of more than two dozen people that identify as Epstein survivors, or family members of survivors, released a joint statement Saturday in support of Greene.",
      "\"Thank you for standing up against the intimidation, silencing, and abuse that Epstein survivors have endured for decades,\" the statement read. \"...You have our full support.\"",
      "In an email to CBS News, a spokesperson for the group added that many of them have gotten death threats, adding it's \"part of the price of speaking out.\"",
      "In a bombshell Friday night, Mr. Trump took to Truth Social to write that he was \"withdrawing\" his \"support and Endorsement\" of Greene, indicating that he might even back an effort to primary her. He also accused her of going \"far Left.\"",
      "\"She has told many people that she is upset that I don't return her phone calls anymore, but with 219 Congressmen/women, 53 U.S. Senators, 24 Cabinet Members, almost 200 Countries, and an otherwise normal life to lead, I can't take a ranting Lunatic's call every day,\" the president wrote.",
      "Greene responded on social media by saying \"President Trump just attacked me and lied about me. I haven't called him at all, but I did send these text messages today. Apparently this is what sent him over the edge.\"",
      "The two continue to exchange barbs on Saturday, with the president doubling-down, writing that \"Marjorie 'Traitor' Green is a disgrace to our GREAT REPUBLICAN PARTY!\"",
      "Greene was among one of just four House Republicans that joined all Democrats last week in signing a discharge petition to force a House vote that, if also approved by the Senate, would require the Justice Department to release all materials related to Epstein.",
      "\"It really makes you wonder what is in those files and who and what country is putting so much pressure on him?\" Green\u00a0wrote\u00a0Saturday of the president.",
      "The House Oversight Committee\u00a0on Wednesday released\u00a0more than 20,000 pages of documents related to Epstein, and some House Democrats said the contents raise questions about what Mr. Trump knew of Epstein's activities.",
      "In an exclusive interview with \"CBS Mornings\" Friday, Greene called Mr. Trump's opposition to the release of the Epstein files a \"huge miscalculation,\" arguing that the president has not been accused of misconduct in relation to Epstein.",
      "\"I truly just stand with the women, and I think they deserve to be the ones that we're fighting for,\" she said.",
      "Greene has also appeared to side with Democratic lawmakers who are calling on Congress to extend the expiring Affordable Care Act tax credits. The standoff over those credits sparked the 43-day government shutdown, which finally ended this week when eight Democratic senators crossed the aisle and reached a deal with their Republican counterparts.",
      "\"Now that the [Affordable Care Act] tax credits are expiring, which the Democrats did put in place \u2014 and they set the expiration date for this year \u2014 I see a financial crisis for Americans,\" Greene told \"CBS Morning.\" \"And so on this issue, I don't see political party lines.\"",

    "story": [
      "Highlands, North Carolina\u00a0\u2014 In the North Carolina town of Highlands, about 20 feet below ground in a goldmine from the 1800s, there is a race against time to save a bat population whose numbers are being decimated by a disease known as white-nose syndrome.",
      "North Carolina's tricolored bats are unstable, among several species of bats quickly dying off in the dark. The bats eat the same bugs that kill crops, meaning they play a critical role in the ecosystem.",
      "\"As bat populations are declining, we see that there's a greater need for use of pesticides,\" said Rada Petrick, a bat expert and research assistant professor of biology at the University of North Carolina who also serves as director of the UNC Institute for the Environment Highlands Field Site.\u00a0\u00a0These flying creatures may look scary, but the real monster in this cold and damp deathtrap is a highly infectious, bat flesh-decomposing fungus that will gnaw their wings right down to the bone.",
      "Lindsey Zarecky, vice president of conservation of research at the Greensboro Science Center, and Olivia Munzer, conservation coordinator for the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission, are among the biologists working to save the bats.",
      "\"Today we're just getting a count to see what is here, and how many of them are there,\" Zarecky said inside the old goldmine.\u00a0And there's only a handful of bats left in the cave. But it's not the fungus that is killing them. During winter hibernation, their white noses start to itch, waking them up and sending them looking for food that isn't there.",
      "They end up wasting precious calories looking for bugs that aren't in season, and they starve.",
      "So, biologists have turned to a new method that seeks to increase the fat stores of bats before they enter hibernation. It involves placing a bright bug-attracting light about a tennis court away from bat caves.\u00a0\u00a0\"How about if we fatten the bats enough, right before they go into hibernation, that it increases the likelihood of them surviving the winter,\" Petrick explains.\u00a0Adds Munzer, \"There's a bit of patience, and definitely a glimmer of hope to watch these animals learn how to survive through this fungus in the winters.\"",
      "According to\u00a0the National Park Service, white-nose syndrome was first detected in North America in the early 2000s. Through 2018, it has caused the populations of three species \u2014 little brown bats, northern long-eared bats and tricolored bats \u2014 to decline by more than 90% in North America,\u00a0according to a 2021 study.",

    "published": "Fri, 14 Nov 2025 13:46:42 -0500",
    "summary": "Some businesses say steeper U.S. tariffs this year give them less financial room to offer holiday savings.",
    "story": [
      "Businesses face a tough decision this holiday season: Run a Black Friday promotion and see their profits drop, or charge full price and risk turning off buyers.",
      "Some business owners said sharply higher U.S. tariffs on imports are raising their costs, giving them less room to roll out aggressive holiday sales.",
      "Lisa Cheng Smith, founder of Yun Hai Taiwanese Pantry, a New York City-based retailer that imports products from businesses and farms in Taiwan, said her costs have jumped 20% to 50% this year from 2024 because of U.S. tariffs on imports from Taiwan and other Asian countries.",
      "In past years, Yun Hai has offered a 15% Black Friday discount as a way to drive holiday purchases, with Cheng Smith telling CBS News that the annual promotion \"is a really important thing for us.\" This year, however, she's unsure how much of a discount she can afford to offer, given her higher operational costs resulting from tariffs.",
      "\"It's complicated because of tariffs and how the retail math works,\" Cheng Smith said. \"Do we offer less of a discount and try to preserve margins, or do we use the same promotion language and structures that customers have come to expect?\"",
      "For small business owners, such calculations can make all the difference, she added. \"What we do from October through December is equal to the whole rest of the year in terms of sales, so every day is more high stakes,\" she noted.",
      "Retail experts said higher tariff costs for retailers and other businesses could mean fewer, and paltrier, Black Friday discounts this year.",
      "\"There will be discounts and deals \u2014 that's what Black Friday is about. Very few retailers will want to shun that completely, but I think they will be more surgical and selective in the discounting,\" Neil Saunders, managing director and retail analyst at GlobalData, told CBS News. \"They will perhaps discount fewer items, and some discounts will be less generous in terms of the amount of money off.\"",
      "Dan Peskorse, whose company, Upstream Brands, sells a range of merchandise under different labels on Amazon and other e-commerce sites, also said higher tariff costs are forcing him to rethink his Black Friday strategy this year.",
      "For previous Black Fridays, Peskorse said Upstream Brands typically offered discounts of up to 30% on products sold under the company's flagship brands, including ThinkFit, which makes meal-prep bags and containers, and Ash Harbor, a maker of small home goods.",
      "Not this year. \"This is the first year that we are not offering across-the-board discounts on products,\" he said, noting that the decision was \"100%\" related to tariffs.",
      "Peskorse has taken steps to mitigate the impact of tariffs, including raising prices and absorbing the extra costs that come with importing goods from China and India. The only tool he has left to control costs and preserve his business's profits is to scrap discounts, he said.",
      "The average U.S. tariff rate has increased sevenfold this year, to 16.6%, according to EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco. Those higher duties are pushing up the prices of imported goods as retailers pass on a portion of the\u00a0costs to shoppers, he noted.",
      "\"It's going to be a strange season\"",
      "Squeezed by tariff costs, many businesses are also grappling with a slowdown in holiday spending by lower-income consumers still feeling the\u00a0impact of persistent inflation.",
      "\"I think the rubber is going to hit the road when we get into Black Friday,\" said Sonia Lapinsky, a retail analyst at management consulting firm AlixPartners. \"Consumers are telling us they are pulling back on holiday spending this year, holding on to their dollars and putting their money in critical places, not in discretionary buckets.\"",
      "Discounts are a powerful tool for incentivizing consumers to spend money, she added.",
      "\"It's the only way retailers will get them in the door, because they can't stomach this,\" Lapinsky said. \"So it's going to be a strange season. If retailers get it wrong, they're risking the biggest selling season they have.\"",

      "Eating ultra-processed foods could lead to an increased risk of being diagnosed with precancerous colorectal growths for women under 50, according to new research.",
      "A\u00a0study, published Thursday in JAMA Oncology, looked at health outcomes for 29,105 nurses under 50 who underwent at least one colonoscopy. Participants were followed from June 1991 until June 2015 and filled out questionnaires about their eating habits every four years. The researchers looked at two forms of precancerous polyps: adenomas and serrated lesions.",
      "Women who had an average of three ultra-processed food servings per day had a 3% risk of a precancerous polyp, while women who had an average of 10 or more ultra-processed food servings per day had a 5% risk, according to the study.",
      "Only about 5% of adenomas are cancerous, according to the Cleveland Clinic, but about 75% of colorectal cancers start as these growths. The study did not find any links between ultra-processed foods and serrated lesions.",
      "\"You do see an increase in risk with more servings of ultra-processed food products,\" said CBS News medical contributor Dr. C\u00e9line   Gounder, the editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News.",
      "Ultra-processed foods account for more than half of the average American's diet, according to a report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, even though most dietary guidelines recommend restricting them. Ultra-processed foods have also been linked to dozens of other health issues, including diabetes, sleep issues, heart trouble and early death.",
      "Study participants who ate more ultra-processed foods also had a higher body mass index, and were more likely to have a history of smoking, according to the research. They also tended to have lower levels of physical activity and consume fewer nutrients like fiber and Vitamin D.",
      "\"I don't know if there are any good ultra-processed foods,\" Gounder said. \"Clearly the more you're eating, the worse for your health, the higher the risk for various complications.\"",
      "Ultra-processed foods don't have a set definition, but they often include packaged foods and beverages, items made without many whole ingredients, and less obvious products like condiments and sauces. Study participants who had diets higher in sugars and artificial sweeteners, as well as packaged savory snacks, had higher rates of adenoma development.",
      "The federal government has said it is planning to define ultra-processed foods, Gounder said. In the meantime, a \"good rule of thumb is: if you can't pronounce an ingredient on the package, it is probably an ultra-processed food,\" she said.",
      "Researchers are still working to determine exactly how ultra-processed foods affect the body.",
      "\"We think that the ultra-processed foods are changing your microbiome, so those are the bacteria in your gut. So that causes increased inflammation, it can cause increased permeability of the gut wall,\" Gounder said. \"And then secondly, we know ultra-processed foods are associated with an increased risk of obesity and diabetes which we also know increase the risk of various cancers, including perhaps colon cancer.\"",

The United Nations in a February report said up to 1,400 may have been killed in the violence, while the country's health adviser under the interim government said more than 800 people were killed and about 14,000 were injured.",
      "The deliberation of the verdict from the tribunal in the capital, Dhaka, was broadcast live on Monday.",
      "The interim government beefed up security ahead of the verdict, with paramilitary border guards and police deployed in Dhaka and many other parts of the country.

      "Before the tribunal's ruling Monday, the former ruling party called for the shutdown again, with Hasina in an audio message urging her supporters not to be \"nervous\" about the verdict.",
      "The verdict came after local media reported new explosions of crude bombs in Dhaka, including one in front of the house of an adviser, equivalent to a Cabinet minister, on Sunday.",
      "Meanwhile, Dhaka's police chief Sheikh Mohammad Sazzat Ali issued a \"shoot-on-sight\" order if anyone attempts to torch vehicles or hurl crude bombs. The directive came as nearly 50 arson attacks, mostly targeting vehicles, and dozens of explosions of crude bombs have been reported nationwide over the past week. Two people were killed in the arson attacks, local media reported.",
      "Authorities at the Supreme Court, in a letter to army headquarters on Sunday, requested the deployment of soldiers around the tribunal premises ahead of the verdict.",

    "published": "Sun, 16 Nov 2025 20:16:23 -0500",
    "summary": "The most advanced U.S. aircraft carrier has arrived in the Caribbean Sea in a display of American military power.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. is set to designate Cartel de los Soles \u2014 a group that the Trump administration has claimed is headed by Venezuela's president \u2014 as a foreign terrorist organization, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced Sunday night, hours after the most advanced aircraft carrier in the nation crossed into the Caribbean Sea, the U.S. Navy said.",
      "Rubio's announcement and the arrival of the USS Gerald R. Ford mark a major moment in what the Trump administration says is a counterdrug operation but has been seen as an escalating pressure tactic against Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "Cartel de los Soles' designation as a foreign terrorist organization is set to go into effect on Nov. 24, Rubio said in a statement. He alleged the cartel is headed by Maduro and \"other high-ranking individuals of the illegitimate Maduro regime who have corrupted Venezuela's military, intelligence, legislature, and judiciary.\"",
      "\"Neither Maduro nor his cronies represent Venezuela's legitimate government,\" Rubio added. \"Cartel de los Soles by and with other designated FTOs including Tren de Aragua and the Sinaloa Cartel are responsible for terrorist violence throughout our hemisphere as well as for trafficking drugs into the United States and Europe.\"",
      "Speaking to reporters Sunday night after the announcement was made, President Trump said, \"We may be having some discussions with Maduro, and we'll see how that turns out. They would like to talk.\"",
      "The U.S. has asserted that Maduro is complicit with armed criminal gangs that smuggle drugs into the U.S., allegations that Maduro has rejected. And over the last two months, the U.S. military has\u00a0conducted strikes against at least 22 vessels it alleges were ferrying drugs from South America to the U.S., killing at least 83 people.",
      "\"Through unwavering commitment and the precise use of our forces, we stand ready to combat the transnational threats that seek to destabilize our region,\" Adm. Alvin Holsey, commander of U.S. Southern Command, said Sunday in a statement announcing the USS Ford's arrival in the Caribbean Sea.",
      "\"The USS Gerald R. Ford Carrier Strike Group's deployment represents a critical step in reinforcing our resolve to protect the security of the Western Hemisphere and the safety of the American Homeland,\" he added. Southern Command is the primary combatant unit for operations in the Caribbean and South America.",
      "The Ford rounds off the largest buildup of U.S. firepower in the region in generations, in what Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has dubbed Operation Southern Spear. The Ford's carrier strike group, which includes squadrons of fighter jets and guided-missile destroyers, transited the Anegada Passage near the British Virgin Islands on Sunday morning, the Navy said.",
      "Rear Adm. Paul Lanzilotta, who commands the Ford's carrier strike group, said it will bolster an already large force of American warships to \"protect our nation's security and prosperity against narco-terrorism in the Western Hemisphere.\"",
      "The administration has insisted that the buildup of warships is focused on stopping the flow of drugs into the U.S., but it has released no evidence to support its assertions that those killed in the boats were \"narco-terrorists.\"",
      "President Trump said Friday that he's \"sort of\" decided how to proceed on Venezuela, as\u00a0top officials\u00a0weigh potential military operations in the Latin American country. \"I sort of have made up my mind\" about the administration's next steps in Venezuela, he told CBS News aboard Air Force One, but \"I can't tell you what it would be.\"",
      "Top Trump administration officials, military and senior staff gathered at the White House for at least the third day in a row on Friday to discuss possible military operations in Venezuela, according to sources familiar with the matter. Vice President JD Vance, Hegseth, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Dan Caine and Secretary of State Marco Rubio were among those who spoke with Mr. Trump at the White House on Friday, the sources said.",
      "Venezuela was also discussed as part of the president's daily intelligence briefing on Wednesday. CBS News has\u00a0previously reported\u00a0that Hegseth, Caine and other military officials presented Mr. Trump on Wednesday with options for potential operations in\u00a0Venezuela\u00a0in the coming days, including possible strikes on land.",
      "Meanwhile, Venezuela announced Tuesday that it was\u00a0launching a massive military exercise\u00a0across the country, reportedly involving some 200,000 forces.",
      "Many people both inside Venezuela, including Maduro himself, and observers outside the country believe the increased U.S. military pressure is\u00a0aimed at forcing Maduro out of office.",
      "When asked\u00a0in a recent interview with \"60 Minutes\" if Maduro's \"days were numbered,\" Mr. Trump responded, \"I would say yeah. I think so, yeah.\" Mr. Trump\u00a0last month also confirmed\u00a0that he had authorized covert CIA operations in Venezuela.",
      "The president has justified the attacks on drug boats by saying the U.S. is in \"armed conflict\" with drug cartels while claiming the boats are operated by foreign terror organizations. He has faced pushback from leaders in the region, the U.N. human rights chief and lawmakers, including some Republicans, who have pressed for more information on who is being targeted and the legal justification for the boat strikes.",
      "Senate Republicans\u00a0recently voted to reject legislation that would have put a check on Mr. Trump's ability to launch an attack against Venezuela without congressional authorization. Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska were the only Republicans to support the resolution, which failed in a 49-51 vote.",
      "Experts disagree on whether or not American warplanes may be used to strike land targets inside Venezuela. Either way, the 100,000-ton warship is sending a message, one expert said.",
      "\"This is the anchor of what it means to have U.S. military power once again in Latin America,\" Elizabeth Dickinson, the International Crisis Group's senior analyst for the Andes region, told The Associated Press. \"And it has raised a lot of anxieties in Venezuela but also throughout the region. I think everyone is watching this with sort of bated breath to see just how willing the U.S. is to really use military force.\"",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Sen. Bill Cassidy, Republican of Louisiana, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Nov. 16, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face the Nation. \u00a0On Friday, we spoke with the Chairman of one of the Senate committees responsible for crafting health care legislation, Louisiana's Bill Cassidy, who is also a doctor. We began by showing him what the President is thinking of for a healthcare fix.",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I'm calling today for insurance companies not to be paid, but for the money, this massive amount of money to be paid directly to the people of our country so that they can buy their own health care, which will be far better and far less expensive than the disaster known as Obamacare.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So are you, Senator, coordinating with the White House on this proposal?",
      "SEN. BILL CASSIDY: So we're absolutely in communication with the White House and with the administration, because there's a lot of stuff that you have to work out to do that. But let me give a little meat on the bones of what the President's speaking about. If you look at an Obamacare policy now, there's a $6,000 deductible. Democrats are fighting to lower the premiums. You lower a premium on something which has $6,000 deductible, it's basically a catastrophic policy. Now, I like to speak of the cost of being insured, not just the cost of the health insurance. The President is proposing that we take the $26 billion that would be going to insurance companies if we just do a straight out extension, and by the way, 20 percent of that $26 billion, 20 percent will go for profit and administrative overhead, give it directly to the American people in an account in which 100 percent of the money is used for them to purchase health care on their own terms. Now- now, that makes them an informed consumer. It also helps address the need to have coverage for that deductible, and if they get that policy with a higher deductible, they can actually lower their premium. It's a sweet spot, lower premiums, help with the deductible, making the patient the informed consumer, the President and I are united. We should all be united about that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the President's economic adviser, Kevin Hassett, was on this program last Sunday. He said the president was just brainstorming, things aren't formally put together among Republican senators yet, but I just want to clarify what you are coordinating with the President on here, because, is it to buy your own insurance policy, which is kind of complicated, or is it to use this flexible spending account you've talked about for related health care needs? Like, are there restrictions on how you can use that money?",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: So first, there's two types of premium tax credits. There's the baseline premium tax credit, which was part of Obamacare, that would stay in effect, and people would still buy a policy. For example, they get in a car wreck, something disastrous. They need somebody negotiating on their behalf with all the providers. That stays the same. What we're talking about the shutdown was over the enhanced premium tax credits. Policies have become so expensive under Obamacare that under Joe Biden, Democrats passed another subsidy on top of the first subsidy. That's what we're fighting about and what Republicans are saying, and I like to hope Democrats will too. Hey, wait a second, if we can have lower premiums and help people with their deductible by giving the money directly to the patient. By the way, 20 percent doesn't go for insurance company profit and overhead. 100percent goes for health care. Why don't we unite Republican and Democrats in doing that? That's where the President is. You got to figure some things out. But we're a lot further along than you might imagine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So do you want to fix Obamacare, or do you want to eliminate Obamacare?",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: First, you have to, like, we're going into 2026. That's like a month and a half from now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: And so you've got to work with what you have. But on the other hand, Obamacare was a top heavy, administratively heavy type system in which a lot of money is a lot of money, and responsibility is taken from individuals and given to insurance companies. As one example, I'm a doctor. I work for 20 years in a hospital for the uninsured. I found that if you give the patient the power, good things happen that's supported, by the way, by the medical literature, if the patient is engaged in her health care and the health care of her family. She's going to be a wise shopper, wise for her health and wise for her pocketbook. We need to have a new model, and that model is to engage the patient in her own health care. Doing so is good for her, good for us all.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, but you said we need to work with what we have. That is, as you just said, you have a short amount of time before the end of the year. Do you think you need to extend the health care tax subsidies that are currently in place until you figure out all the rest of this complicated policy making?",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: Let me back you up just a little bit, Margaret. I'll just say, everybody assumes it's easy just to extend the premium tax credits, the enhanced premium tax credits. It's not that easy. 50 percent of the states did not plan on them being extended, and they don't have rates as if they were to be extended. So that means if we pass this mid December, they've got to recalculate rates in time for, wait a second, by that time, we're already into 2026 it's not an easy matter. And by the way, did I mention the policies that people want to lower the premiums for have $6,000 deductibles. It is basically something for insurance companies to make money off of and for the individual to wade through $6,000 of debt before they can finally access it. Now, the kind of proposal I am proposing Republicans are, and I hope Democrats will join, is, let's take that money, and we have a mechanism to do so. We give it to the patient. By giving her that money, she could choose a bronze level plan, which is to say lower premiums. So now her premiums are down, but she has money in an account to help with the deductible, and I think we can figure that out about as easily as we can figure out what we would do if we just did a straight out extension.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you want to do all this, though, by the second week of December, when the Democrats have been promised they'll have a vote on an ACA bill of their choice.",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: Yes, and I tell my Democratic colleagues first, let's not be Democrats and Republicans. Let's be Americans, representing all of Americans. Let's recognize what you're doing just gives money to insurance companies, but we can do it better with lower premiums and with money and accounts to pay deductibles. And then why don't we come together? There can be a Democratic bill and a Republican bill, and both fail. Let's do an American bill where the American people benefit and this work together, collaborate to lower those premiums and help them with that first dollar coverage in the- in the deductible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So we looked and there are about 293,000 Louisianans, your state, enrolled in Obamacare currently, six weeks from now, those extent expanded tax credits that you've been talking about will go away for individuals making $62,000 or above. Individuals making less than that amount will see their tax credit shrink. So are you telling those hundreds of thousands of Louisianans that that tax credit is going away no matter what, that- that they should make plans\u2013",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: No.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013 for higher prices?",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: I'm telling them that we're I'm telling them that we are working to make it work better for them. And they would tell you, by the way, wait a second, I got a $6,000 deductible that does not work for me. Margaret, I'm a doctor. I would talk to people when they'd come to see me, and they would tell me, I can't afford that. My deductible is too high. That's reality, and that reality is being lost in this discussion. We've got to do something about sky high deductibles. Maybe you can afford the premium. You can't afford the policy. Let's lower the cost of having health insurance, focusing by not just on the premium, but the deductible. And I think we can do both.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, even in the private market, health care costs have gone up up six to 9 percent when you look at the projections. But I want to ask you about your oversight role. Secretary Kennedy has this hand picked panel of vaccine advisors. You know them at ACIP. They're going to meet in a few days and potentially vote on changing the hepatitis B vaccine schedule for infants. That same vaccine advisory group is also considering the safety of vaccine ingredients like aluminum, which would impact a number of childhood shots. This should matter for American parents. Are you comfortable with what they are about to put to a vote?",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: I'm very concerned about this. As it turns out, my medical practice focused on hepatitis B, and so we know that because of a recommended dose at birth of hepatitis B vaccine, recommended, not mandated, the number of children born contracting hepatitis B at birth, or shortly thereafter, has decreased from about 20,000, 20 years ago to like 200 now. That's 20- effectively a clerical error. We have decreased incidence of chronic hepatitis B by 20,000 people over the last two decades with this kind of recommendation. And by the way, if you're infected at birth, you're more likely- you're 95 percent likely to become a chronic carrier. The vaccine is safe. It has been established, and these ingredients they're speaking of have been shown to be safe. This is policy by people who don't understand the epidemiology of hepatitis B, or who have grown comfortable with the fact that we've been so successful with our recommendation that now the incidence of hepatitis B is so low, they feel like we can rest on our laurels. I'm a doctor. I have seen people die from vaccine-preventable disease. I want people to be healthy. I want to make America healthy, and you don't start by stopping recommendations that have made us substantially healthier.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the president of the United States also told American women not to take Tylenol. Or give it to their kids. This is based on a theory that it causes autism somehow. And he also in a social media post, the same one, called for the measles, mumps and rubella shot to be broken up into three different shots. That was then endorsed by the acting CDC director. Are you concerned by this kind of suggestive linkage at the top of the CDC and from the White House?",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: Again, I'm a doctor, and so I'm going to go where the evidence takes me. And the best evidence is a study out of Sweden with 2 million children that found no- no causality, no association, if you will, between taking Tylenol in pregnancy and getting autism. And of course, that concerns me, because there's going to be a mom out there \u2014again, I'm a doctor, I talk to I talk to patients\u2014 in a room, and her child has autism. She took Tylenol for a high fever during pregnancy and now she blames herself. That's just the way mamas think, and that's wrong. We don't want her to think that. The best evidence is that there is no relationship, by the way, if you have a high fever during pregnancy, that may be a risk for autism. Now, of course, if you're pregnant, talk to your physician before you take anything, but point being, the best evidence is that there is no relationship between the two. And I don't want women putting themselves on a guilt trip when the best evidence shows not. By the way, the President has spoken out strongly in favor of immunizations in other cases, and I noted, when he got his physical, he got the flu and COVID shots. So the President has demonstrated that he believes in immunization.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But that's why clarifying the statements, I think, is important, since you interpret them differently. I wonder, do you regret your confirmation vote for Secretary Kennedy?",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: I smile because every reporter asks me that--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, because these questions run right into a pledge that you extracted from him not to tinker with some of the structures that were set in place to have oversight of these vaccines and this process.",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: So you live life forward, again, you just do, let the day's own troubles be sufficient for the day. And I'll credit the secretary. He's brought attention to things like ultra-processed food that has, frankly, never received this sort of attention before, and people praise him for that. So he and I have publicly disagreed on some matters, but I strongly agree with him on others, and so, so that's how I'll answer your question.",
      "if this is your final year in office, sir, will you make overhauling health care your top priority?",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: Well, I sure hope it's not my final year in office, but, but I've been thinking about healthcare for 30 years, because when I worked in a public hospital for the uninsured, I saw the burden it could be on middle-income families who had middle income but couldn't afford the insurance or couldn't assure afford the healthcare. And so it's been my priority for 30 years, and I will continue to do that. And if there is a silver lining, if there is a silver lining in the shutdown, we just had, the silver lining is now we are focused on how do we make health care more affordable for the American people. That should be our goal, not to be partisan one way or the other. How do we make it more affordable for fellow Americans? If we can accomplish that, I will feel like I've done my job.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, thank you for your time.",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: Thank you Margaret.",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, Democrat of New Hampshire, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Nov. 16, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to New Hampshire Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen. Good morning to you, Senator.",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: Good morning. Nice to be with you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well you have spent a good part of the past year trying to get legislation through to extend those Obamacare tax credit subsidies. Last Sunday, you crossed the aisle. You agreed to reopen the government, end the shutdown without a guaranteed extension, but with a promise to have some kind of vote on an ACA bill of Democrats' own choosing. Do you have consensus among Democrats that this needs to be a vote simply to extend the tax credits as they stand now or are you open to a broader reform of Obamacare?",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: Well from the beginning of this shutdown I've had two goals. One is to get government up and running again to end the suffering that too many Americans were experiencing because they lost food assistance or they weren't getting paid federal employees, and the second was to address the high cost of premium- health insurance that people are looking at because insurance companies are setting rates based on the fact that those premium tax credits are not- are supposed to go away at the end of this year. I think people are now very aware of the fact that they are going to see huge rate increases double for so many people, and an unaffordable cost of health insurance if those premium tax credits go away. And what I think we need to do, and these are conversations that we need to have, is we need to work with our Republican colleagues to try and get a bill that can be supported. That can get through both houses of Congress where we've been talking to our Republicans, Senator Cassidy, throughout the shutdown, about what we might be able to agree to. We've been talking to House members on both sides of the aisle, and so now we need to work together. I agree with Senator Cassidy. This should be a bill that is not partisan, but it should be a bill to extend those premium tax credits, because, as everybody has talked about, there is real urgency to get this done. And if we don't address it, then people are going to see huge rate increases. --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Yeah. --",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: -- So we can work together, we can extend the credits, but we probably can't implement significant reforms that Senator Cassidy was talking about in the time frame that we've got. So we need to look both in the short term and in the long term for how we address the cost of health care.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, so that's an important point. So the 26 billion or so that he talks about as the cost for extension of these that he wants to redirect into these cash accounts, these flexible accounts. You're saying you can't get that done in six weeks time.",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: No, you can't. --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Okay. --",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: -- And again, there's real urgency to do this. There's some good, bipartisan legislation that has come out of committee in the Senate that I think we should take up. Things that would expedite approval of generic drugs and biosimilars, that would address PBM reform, which is a huge cost increase for health care, but that's a longer term issue. Right now, we need to address what people are facing in terms of those high rate increases because of the threat that these premium tax credits are going to end.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Just to put a fine point on it, when we heard the Congressman at the top of the program talk about, you know, caps on income and restrictions on who can benefit from those tax credits. Can you get your fellow Democrats, who, by the way, are pretty angry at each other, angry at you as well, about this decision to reopen the government? Can you get everyone on board? Or can you at least get to 60 votes to be able to extend those subsidies with tweaks?",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: Well, first of all, we need to put the shutdown behind us in the circular firing squad and remember why we're in this situation. We're in this situation because Donald Trump and Speaker Johnson and the Republican majorities in the House and Senate have refused to address cost, the cost of health care, and are trying to throw people off their health care. Can we get to consensus? Well, we need to, if we're going to get a bipartisan bill out of the Congress. I think we've seen and heard from health insurance companies that implementing significant changes in the first year is going to be really difficult to do, almost impossible. But we ought to be able to agree on some changes like capping the income of people who receive those premium tax credits. Right now, 94% of people who get the credits earn under $200,000 a year, and the average income for a single recipient is about a little over $30,000 a year. So most people who are getting these tax credits are not in that high income level --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Yeah. --",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: -- And so we should be able to agree on that. We should be able to agree that we don't want any fraud and abuse in the program. --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Right. --",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: -- That's something Republicans and Democrats believe in. So let's focus on what we can agree to. Let's look at what we can get done in the time frame we have, and recognize there is real urgency to get these premium tax credits extended.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you're going to have this vote around the second week of December, but premiums are already notified out. They are already --",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: -- Right. --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- sort of baked in here for- certainly for Americans who buy government health care. Is it too late to extend open enrollment? I mean, Senator Cassidy was saying like ship has sailed here.",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: No, we could actually decide that we were willing as part of this legislation to extend open enrollment. Obviously, we need support from the administration, but insurance companies, in meeting with the insurance industry, they've indicated that while it would be difficult, they could address some of the challenges around not getting agreement until December. Again, that's why there's urgency to get this done.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about another matter. Survivors of convicted child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, as well as some of the families of those survivors, wrote a letter to lawmakers supporting the release of Justice Department internal communications in regard to his case. In that letter, they said there was no middle ground here. There was no hiding behind party affiliation. We will remember your decision at the ballot box. You know, this House vote is set to come up this week. Should there be a vote in the Senate? And would you support it, to see the release of these documents?",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: Absolutely. We need to release the documents. The American people need to see what's in them. And if President Trump says there's nothing there that he's concerned about, then why doesn't he support release of the documents?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we will see if the Republican leader in the Senate takes up your proposal there. There has not been a commitment to have that kind of vote. But on Venezuela, since you are ranking member on Senate Foreign Relations, I want to make sure I ask you, the President said he has sort of made up his mind on what to do about Venezuela. You were one of the very few senators who have received briefings within the past few weeks from Secretaries Rubio and Hegseth regarding the strikes that are being carried out on these small, fast moving boats. Is there a clear end game here and is your understanding that ousting Nicolas Maduro from power is part of the administration's plan?",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: I don't think it's clear what the end game is for this administration with respect to Venezuela. They're relying on a legal opinion, excuse me, in terms of the boat strikes that they have not released. They have finally made it available to members of Congress, but they haven't released it to the public. They are escalating in a way that talking about a land strike through special operations that puts at risk our men and women in the military. We have so much firepower now in the Caribbean, the Gerald R. Ford has been taken from the Red Sea, so that now we don't have any firepower, really, in the Middle East as we look at the threats there. We don't have what we need, I think, in the Indo-Pacific or in Europe. And so what the President has done here is to put at risk other parts of the world and Americans in other parts of the world for this fascination on trying to get rid of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in Venezuela, who clearly is --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Yeah. --",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: -- a bad character. He's been involved in drug --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Yeah. --",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: -- illegal drugs. But he is not a threat to the United States of America. --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Okay. --",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: -- And what the President is doing is raising real questions.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Shaheen, thank you for your time this morning. We'll be back in a moment.",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Army Secretary Dan Driscoll that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Nov. 16, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We want to turn now to some of the challenges faced by the U.S. military, and we're joined by the Secretary of the Army, Dan Driscoll. Good morning, thank you for being here.",
      "SECRETARY OF THE UNITED STATES ARMY DAN DRISCOLL: Thank you so much for having me.",
      "MARGERET BRENNAN: A lot to get to with you. Just quickly on news of day, the president did say he \"sort of\" made up his mind on Venezuela. I know this is the Marines, this is the Navy that are deployed. But does the Venezuelan army pose any kind of threat to the U.S. if action is taken?",
      "SEC. DRISCOLL: I think that the President and Secretary of War have spent a lot of time thinking about what is the best thing they can do for the American people, and I can speak from the Army's perspective, which is, we have a lot of training in that part of the world. We're reactivating our jungle school in Panama, we would be ready to act on whatever the president and Sec. War needed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But no orders beyond these exercises at this point?",
      "SEC. DRISCOLL: I- we don't talk about those kinds of things, but we would be ready if asked.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I do want to ask you about what has been happening with this shutdown. The government's now funded through January 30, you did get from Congress full year funding for veterans affairs and military construction, a few other measures in this short term bill. But we have seen the shutdown hit military bases and hit military families. Costly. $400 million or more in emergency loans from USAA. How do you insulate the force so that the next shutdown doesn't hit these families the way it did this time.",
      "SEC. DRISCOLL: I think the shutdown is indicative of one of the bigger problems that we have a nation have had. And so if you look back for the last 30 or 40 years, one of the reasons we've had such bad outcomes, when we spend the American taxpayers hard earned dollars, and we go buy things that our soldiers will need to fight, when we build things where our soldiers and their families will live, we are such a bad customer, because when you're on the other side of the deal with us and you have to deal with shutdowns. I mean, this shutdown will take months and months for us to get back and going on these projects. And this is part of the calcification of our system that under President Trump, we are uniquely able to try to go after a lot of these things and actually get our army and their families living in better areas, and get our soldiers ready for the modern fight. And the shutdown does not help.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you about the modern fight. Tom Cotton, who is the chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, told our Olivia Gazis here at CBS that the threat to military sites and large civilian gatherings \"is severe and growing.\" He cited gaps in law enforcement authorities, some of them lapsed during the shutdown, I understand, and he's talking about trying to close enforcement gaps when it comes to drones. What authorizations do you need?",
      "SEC. DRISCOLL: So under Secretary of War Hegseth, the United States Army has been put in charge of the counter drone threat for the Pentagon, and then we are working hand in fist- or hand in glove with the broader law enforcement agencies. We just last week had a meeting right outside the White House where what we are trying to do, because this problem is different from nearly anything we've faced in a long time. It is a flying IED. And so this IED--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: IED, the explosive--",
      "SEC. DRISCOLL: IED, improvised explosive device. They're cheap. You can 3D print them at home, and they cross borders incredibly quickly. And so what you basically need is a digital layer to exchange information and exchange sensing and allow the closest person on the ground, or the closest effector on the ground, to be able to take out a drone. And Senator Cotton is right. I mean, this is the threat of humanity's lifetime. What's occurring in Ukraine, what's happening in Russia, if you look at the speed and scale of the devastation that can come from drones, we as a federal government have got to lead on it. But I'm really optimistic. This is actually something we are doing right. We are partnering with both federal law enforcement, in a couple of weeks, we're having the Sheriff's Association come. We were just at the NYPD. We're including all of the different law enforcement agencies, thinking about the borders and the ports and the upcoming NFL games and Olympics and World Cup. Like this is something we as a nation can lead on. And so under President Trump's leadership, we are moving fast at this problem.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And this is about radar jamming of drones to take them out, not exploding them.",
      "SEC. DRISCOLL: So the problem with the drone fight is you need all sorts of layered defense. One solution does not work. If you just try to jam them- if you look at what's happening in Ukraine, people have started to hard wire drones, and so you can't do RF jamming on a hard wire drone. And so there are things like net guns that are coming back, we're using all sorts of solutions and tools, and it makes it even more complicated. When you're by an airport and you're doing it in your own homeland, you just have different authorities. And so a lot of this is a human problem of communication, command and control and having a layered set of solutions that you can use for any given problem.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you're talking about here at the homeland, things like the U.S. hosting the Olympics, the World Cup, even just the Super Bowl, games that are coming up. Should there be restrictions in this country on who is able to own and operate drones?",
      "SEC. DRISCOLL: I'm pretty optimistic that we will be able to figure out a solution where we will know what is in the sky at every moment across our country, all at once. And so if you think of the President's--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're not there yet.",
      "SEC. DRISCOLL: We're not there yet, but under the President's Golden Dome, I would think about this like a golden mini dome, where, if you took one of the sites for the World Cup, we are heavily focused on being able to see everything in the area, have all of the interceptors we will need, have all of the training for all of the different forces that will have to be able to act. And so to your specific question, I think we are trying to design a system so that Americans are able to fly drones, so that commercial companies, like Amazon- like the future of delivery, in a lot of ways, is commercial drones. And so we will just have to de-conflict the skies, working with the FAA. But this is a big topic. I check in with Secretary of War Hegseth on this almost weekly.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So when we last saw the President of Ukraine, Zelenskyy, at the White House, he brought up to President Trump, on camera, we've got great drones we want to sell to the United States or provide to the United States. You referred to Ukraine as the \"only Silicon Valley of warfare\" right now. What do you mean by that? Are they really ahead of the United States on innovation?",
      "SEC. DRISCOLL: I think if you look at what's happening, Operation Spider's Web in Russia, the Ukrainians used probably a couple hundred thousand dollars worth of drones and took out almost $10 billion worth of equipment in Russia. And Russia's in that fight. And so I think what is amazing about our country is we are able to recognize where we need to innovate quickly. And what we're doing for drones, completely differently, I think, than we have done as an army in probably 50 or 60 years, is we are welcoming in American industry. So we just did an AI war game where we invited 15 of the top CEOs in the nation. They were worth probably $18 trillion in enterprise value. And we said, howdy, can you please help us? What do you have in your tech innovation pipeline to help us with data in contested environments? How do we do logistics 6,000 miles away if we're facing an enemy who's trying to contest us? And we are working with them, no joke, daily, to basically take their innovation and apply it to this problem.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But what I heard you saying there is, you look at the battlefield in Ukraine as kind of like a test lab for where warfare is going. Can you convince some of your fellow Republicans that there is value in that fight, in terms of, you know, those who are so isolationist they don't want to be involved in Ukraine, even financially?",
      "SEC. DRISCOLL: Well, I don't think I've talked to a single person who has said we shouldn't be learning from what's occurring in Ukraine. All of our equipment, all of the exquisite features we will need, are definitionally going to come- the data set that the Ukrainians are getting for their generative AI models of when they have drones and they're flying and they're learning and they're doing counter drone and they're taking all of this information from their sensors and trying to figure out what's going on. There's not a single person I know that doesn't think that is an incredible treasure trove of information for future warfare. I think a lot of the questions are, how do we actually execute on the President's agenda of peace in that part of the world. Where- I have not been to the White House, where it has not come up that we just want peace so that the American industrial base can thrive everywhere, and we have to focus on that part of the world unnecessarily right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you're at the Department of War.",
      "SEC. DRISCOLL: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you announced that the army wants to buy a million drones over the next two to three years. Navy, Marines, Air Force, they will obviously be very involved in any war in the Pacific, but you've got to defend those American bases.",
      "SEC. DRISCOLL: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So how do you think of the threat from China there? Because I've read that you think they're ahead of America.",
      "SEC. DRISCOLL: So we're working on something with Congress called SkyFoundry. And basically the idea is to, again, do it right from the beginning. What the army has historically gotten wrong in the last couple of decades is, we're either all in or all out, meaning we either use our organic industrial base and we make the drones ourselves, or we say, this is too complicated for us, we're going to have private industry do it. We are not doing that with drones. Because if you look at- Ukraine is manufacturing four million a year, China, I think, is at 12 to 14 million drones a year.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Wow.",
      "SEC. DRISCOLL: And we as a nation will have to have our private sector able to help us. And so what we are going to do is, we are going to invest in things like sensors and brushless motors and circuit boards and a lot of the components that are really hard for the private sector to get right now. The United States Army is going to build those on our bases and empower the private sector to purchase from us. And so we will make drones, our private partners will make drones, and we will catch up and surpass the Chinese incredibly quickly.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Secretary, thank you for your time. And I do want to make the point that you are taking questions, and that is unusual these days, since the Pentagon has restricted access to reporters. And we think it's important here that the American people hear about their own security as well as the military's three million or more employees. So thank you. We'll be right back.",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Reps. Tom Suozzi, Democrat of New York, and Don Bacon, Republican of Nebraska, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Nov. 16, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We begin today with two members of the so-called House Problem Solvers Caucus, New York Democrat Tom Suozzi and Nebraska Republican Don Bacon. Good morning. Good to have you here in a bipartisan conversation. You both recognize there's a problem here. Congressman Bacon, let me start with you. One out of every five dollars in this country that is spent goes to health care. We know these Covid-era tax credit subsidies for Obamacare will go away at the end of the month.* That's going to hit about 22 of the 24 million Americans who use that program. What can you do in the next six weeks to make costs go down in January?",
      "REP. DON BACON: Well, we need a temporary extension of these tax credits to keep these prices down. Republicans nor Democrats want to see premiums skyrocket, and they will if these expire with nothing in its place. That's why I worked with Tom Suozzi and other Democrats and Republicans to find a compromise. We just want to do a clean extension. Most Republicans don't anyway, so we think there needs to be some caps on income, and we want to ensure all these credits go directly to lowering people's premiums. And right now, about a third of the money doesn't make it to the premiums. So those are some reforms that we would like to see. And if we can get those accomplished, then we can extend these tax credits and keep these- the prices lower, but we do need a longer term fix. The Affordable Care Act is unaffordable, and I think we need to have this extension to give us time to work on something bigger and deeper, and that will help lower costs overall. But I'm proud to work with Tom Suozzi on this, and I appreciate his partnership.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman Suozzi, I understand this is a two-year proposed extension of those enhanced premium tax credits and an income cap that phases out for those making between $200,000 to $400,000. When you look at the breakdown, though, that's a pretty small portion of the overall recipients of the tax credits, it's like less than 10%. So what does this accomplish? How does this make it more affordable and fair?",
      "REP. TOM SUOZZI: Well, it helps everybody else who makes under $200,000 dramatically. And the number one concern people have in America is affordability and health care affordability is right at the top of the list. So we need to do something to extend these premium tax credit--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:-- How much more affordable?--",
      "REP. SUOZZI: -- It'll save people thousands and thousands of dollars, literally $1,000 a month for some people. So it'll be dramatically more affordable. The people who make above $400,000 are the teeny little percentage of people that are not a very small group of people that would benefit from the existing tax credits. Most of the people are below- below $200,000. That $200,000 to $400,000 is a way to taper it off so there's not a cliff.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And how much Democratic support do you have for this at this point?",
      "REP. SUOZZI: I think the Democrats are going to strongly back the idea of extending premium tax credits so that we can keep people's insurance affordable. So, we've got to come up with this compromise--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Even with these caps?--",
      "REP. SUOZZI: -- Even with the caps. Yeah, people- Democrats have always said that they want to direct the policy towards lower and middle income folks, people making under $400,000 a year- is- are bread and butter issues that we want to try and make things affordable for those folks. So- and that will be like literally 95%- 99% of the people that are affected right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman Bacon- sorry, go ahead.",
      "REP. BACON: I would just say, as Republicans, we push back on the thought of someone earning $600,000 getting all these tax credits. So when I listened to Speaker- or Leader Thune, that was one of his big concerns on these so that's why I wanted to ensure that we had this in our framework.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But a tweak with a not permanent, just a two-year extension. Republicans haven't really been proposing a lot of alternative Obamacare options here. Do you think the entire system needs to be rebooted, and when will we see that plan?",
      "REP. BACON: Well, I do I think Republicans and Democrats have to sit down at the table and figure out, what can we really do besides just throw more money at this. Right now, the- you know, the premiums are just going up so much faster than inflation. It's unsustainable and- but we can't do a Republican only fix it. It's not going to work. You're not gonna get 60 votes in the Senate to do it. And I know certainly some folks proposed that back in Congress. Let's go up with our plan. Well, it can't just be a Republican plan if we want to pass something. So we got to sit down with Democrats and figure out what can we do. And there's some good ideas out there. So for example, you know, I've heard, you know, if we can directly subsidize high risk people and put them in a separate pool and just lower their premiums through subsidies, and then the we can call it, the healthier folks, their premiums go- are going to go down significantly if we do that. So there's different concepts that we can do to that can have an impact, but it's going to- to be a bipartisan way forward. It's not going to be a Republican only bill, because you'll never get it passed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman Suozzi, I mean, Aetna pulled out of the Obamacare marketplace this year after CVS said they expected to lose as much as $400 million. Other big insurance companies have been pulling out. If insurance companies themselves are having problems with Obamacare, do Democrats need to be more open to broader reforms of the Affordable Care Act?",
      "REP. SUOZZI: Yeah, we absolutely should be looking at any kind of reform. I want to mend it, not end it. You know that over the past decade that there have been over 70 attempts, mainly by the Republicans, not guys like Don Bacon, who is a very reasonable guy, to try and get rid of Obamacare altogether. We think that's a terrible idea. But if people want to try and make it a better system, to make a- health care more affordable in America and to get health care to more people, we should be doing that. That's what the people want. That's what reasonable people in Congress want. We should be working together to try and expand health care coverage, lower prices for everybody, and make health care more effective and less expensive for people. Now that's not going to happen with everybody yelling and screaming at each other. Everybody says, why don't you just- doesn't know what the hell they're talking about. You cannot solve complicated problems in an environment of fear and anger, you need reasonable people to sit down and talk to each other and say, I think this. Well, I think that, and then work your way towards finding compromise, very hard to do in this toxic environment. People like Don Bacon and other members of the Problem Solvers Caucus want to do that type of thing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Yeah well, but private health care costs are also going up. But on this topic of toxic environments here Congressman Suozzi, Democrats who won elections just a few days ago credited their wins to this affordability issue and the message focused on that. Can you explain the focus this past week in the House by Democrats on the Jeffrey Epstein files? Is this a tactic to distract from the failure to extract health care changes, or is there something else going on here? I mean, does the Speaker putting it to a vote end this issue?",
      "REP. SUOZZI: I think it's a combination of factors, of people shining their lights on the most hot topic at the time. You know, Jeffrey Epstein, of course, is an important topic. I'm sure I'll vote to release his files, but that's not my priority. My priority is to focus on the things that the American people care about: affordability, immigration, taxes, crime and health care. That's what people are fighting about, that's what they're concerned about, that's what we should be focused on in Congress.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman Bacon, does the Speaker putting this to a vote end the Epstein issue and get you back on to health care? I mean, the Speaker said this is all a political exercise. Certainly the families of the victims don't think it is.",
      "REP. BACON: I think the Speaker realizes the train has left the station on this. Let's rip the Band-Aid off and get it done. I wish the president realized that. The more the White House pushes back on this. It's, you know, it just looks bad, right? I mean, it was- the attorney general came out and said, all these white binders, we're gonna release all this information and then, a month later, said, Oh, no, we're not. So it's been a PR blunder from the beginning. And I think the Speaker is right, this is gonna happen, so let's get it done and vote on it. Now, we got to realize it still has to go to the Senate. Then it has to go to the president for a signature. Meanwhile, our Oversight Committee is releasing thousands and thousands of pages of evidence concerning Epstein. So for example, like 3,000 pages was released late last week. So the Oversight Committee, Republicans and Democrats are putting out the data. They're putting out subpoenas. I think it's already working, but like Tom when this comes on the floor, I'm going to vote yes on it. I want transparency. We must- we want to protect the victims, but everything else should just be- should be open.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You also. Congressman Bacon, run the Cyber Subcommittee. I want to ask you about something significant this past week that AI firm Anthropic said that Chinese state sponsored hackers used their technology to automate break-ins and carry out the first cyber espionage operation, largely using AI. It hit like 30 different companies. What can you tell us about the scope and the targets of this attack?",
      "REP. BACON: I can't say much more than what was just released. Other than I can say this, China has replaced Russia as the most formidable cyber threat. They have much higher technology. They are using AI, which gives you a lot more capability in finding weaknesses in your adversaries' cyber defenses. What concerns me more than anything, while China is attacking us every single day, and Russia, we've had no commander in charge of cyber command for over eight months. You know, the White House or the president, fired the Cyber Command commander over eight months ago and has not replaced him. Also, the top two positions at the National Security Agency, the top two are vacant for over eight months, and we've been cutting CISA, which is the- the agency that protects our private sector, our businesses, our infrastructure, and we've cut it by about a third. And so our cyber capabilities are going backwards. We don't- we're rudderless in a time where China is attacking us every day, and that's something that really concerns me, and I've been pushing the White House to- to deal with this and to confront the cyber threat.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we will continue following that important story. Congressmen, thank you for trying to be problem solvers with us today. Face the Nation will be back in a minute. Stay with us.",

In a message on X, Spain's National Police posted a photo of Chavarria wearing a black and green track suit as he was escorted by police officers toward a patrol car.",
      "Chavarria is believed to be the leader of Los Lobos, a drug trafficking group with around 8,000 fighters that was recently designated a terrorist organization by the United States. Los Lobos has been linked to political assassinations in Ecuador and has also been accused of working closely with Mexico's Jalisco New Generation Cartel.",

    "story": [
      "Iran on Saturday confirmed the seizure of a Marshall Islands-flagged oil tanker as it traveled through the narrow Strait of Hormuz over violations, including carrying an illegal consignment, state media reported.",
      "A report by the official IRNA news agency carried a statement by the Revolutionary Guard that said the tanker was taken to Iranian waters. It did not elaborate on the \"illegal consignment,\" the crew or say where the ship was now heading.",
      "It said the seizure came following a court order and the operation was aimed at \"protecting Iran's national interests and resources.\" It identified the oil tanker as the Talara and said it was carrying 30,000 tons of petrochemical products.",
      "The seizure happened on Friday. Tehran has been increasingly warning it could strike back after a 12-day war with Israel in June that saw the U.S. strike Iranian nuclear sites.",
      "It said the ship had been en route to Singapore when Iranian forces intercepted. A private security firm, Ambrey, described the assault as involving three small boats.",
      "U.S. Central Command forces also acknowledged the incident, saying in a statement on Sunday that the M/V Talara was seized after being boarded by Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps forces via helicopter.",
      "\"IRGC operatives then steered the tanker to Iran's territorial waters where the ship remains,\" the statement said. \"Iran's use of military forces to conduct an armed boarding and seizure of a commercial vessel in international waters constitutes a blatant violation of international law, undermining freedom of navigation and the free flow of commerce. We call on Iran to articulate to the international community the legal basis for its actions.\"",
      "A U.S. Navy MQ-4C Triton drone had been circling above the area where the Talara was for hours on Friday, observing the seizure, flight-tracking data analyzed by The Associated Press showed.",
      "The British military's United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations center separately acknowledged the incident, saying a possible \"state activity\" forced the Talara to turn into Iranian territorial waters.",
      "Cyprus-based Columbia Shipmanagement later said in a statement that it had \"lost contact\" with the tanker, which was carrying high-sulphur gasoil. It did not immediately provide any update on Saturday.",
      "Iran has been blamed for a series of limpet mine attacks on vessels that damaged tankers in 2019, as well as for a drone attack on an Israeli-linked oil tanker that killed two European crew members in 2021. Those attacks began after President Trump, in his first term in office, unilaterally withdrew from Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers.",
      "In 2022, Iran took two Greek tankers and held them until November of that year. Iran seized the Portuguese-flagged cargo ship MSC Aries in April 2024.",
      "Years of tensions between Iran and the West, coupled with the situation in the Gaza Strip, exploded into a full-scale 12-day war in June.",
      "Tehran has long threatened to close off the Strait of Hormuz, the narrow mouth of the Persian Gulf through which 20% of all traded oil passes. The U.S. Navy has long patrolled the Mideast through its Bahrain-based 5th Fleet to keep the waterways open.",

    "summary": "President Trump had threatened to sue the BBC for $1 billion over a program it aired in 2024 about the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol.",
    "story": [
      "The BBC has issued an apology to President Trump over\u00a0editing of a speech he gave on Jan. 6, 2021, that aired in its documentary \"Trump: A Second Chance.\" Mr. Trump had threatened to sue the British broadcaster for $1 billion over the program about the Capitol riot, and the BBC noted in a statement Thursday that it \"strongly disagree[s]\" that there's a basis for a defamation claim.",
      "BBC lawyers wrote to Mr. Trump's legal team in response to a letter they received Sunday, the BBC Press Office said. In that letter, lawyers working for Mr. Trump alleged that the Oct. 28, 2024, episode of the network's \"Panorama\" documentary program, which was produced by an external production company, sought to mislead viewers by editing together three separate sections of the speech made by Mr. Trump.",
      "\"BBC Chair Samir Shah has separately sent a personal letter to the White House making clear to President Trump that he and the Corporation are sorry for the edit of the President's speech on 6 January 2021, which featured in the programme,\" the BBC Press Office said in its statement Thursday. \"The BBC has no plans to rebroadcast the documentary 'Trump: A Second Chance?' on any BBC platforms.\"",
      "\"While the BBC sincerely regrets the manner in which the video clip was edited, we strongly disagree there is a basis for a defamation claim,\" the press office added.",
      "The White House did not immediately comment on the BBC's apology. Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One Friday night, Mr. Trump said, \"We'll sue them for anywhere between a billion and $5 billion, probably sometime next week.\"",
      "The BBC's response to Mr. Trump's legal team laid out five main arguments why the organization believes there is no legitimate case against it, BBC News reported. CBS News has not seen the letter sent by the BBC in reply to Mr. Trump's legal team.",
      "According to BBC News' report, those arguments include that the episode in question did not air in the U.S.; that it did not cause Mr. Trump harm, as he won the election a week later; and that the edits made were intended to shorten a long speech rather than to mislead. It also said that the clip was not meant to be taken in isolation, and that matters of public concern and political speech are protected under U.S. law.",
      "An expert on international media law told CBS News that the BBC's response appears to be \"careful and considered.\"",
      "\"President Trump was clearly owed a fulsome apology and he's had that,\" U.K.-based attorney Mark Stephens told CBS News. \"I don't think he was entitled to damages, and so as a consequence, they've rightly hung tough on that particular issue. But, of course, this has been a massive PR victory for the president. He can now call the BBC 'fake news' ... pointing to some credible background for that.\"",
      "The letter over the weekend from Mr. Trump's lawyers claimed that the program \"has caused President Trump to suffer overwhelming financial and reputational harm,\" and that it was defamatory under Florida law. It outlined demands by Mr. Trump that the BBC retract the documentary, issue an apology and \"appropriately compensate President Trump for the harm caused.\"",
      "The letter did not clarify what would be considered appropriate compensation, but it warned that if the BBC failed to comply with Mr. Trump's demands by Friday at 5 p.m. ET, Mr. Trump would file \"legal action for no less than $1,000,000,000 (One Billion Dollars) in damages.\"",
      "Stephens told CBS News that while it would be possible for Mr. Trump to pursue a lawsuit against the BBC in the U.S., \"it's got a number of legal impediments and tripwires.\"",
      "First, Stephens said, was that the program which included the clip was not shown in the U.S.",
      "\"You can't be lowered in the estimation of right-thinking people by a program that wasn't seen by an American audience. So you can't sue, there's no jurisdiction to sue, in America,\" he said.",
      "He also said that because Mr. Trump is \"the president, the ultimate public figure,\" criticism of him would likely be protected under the First Amendment.",
      "Even if the case got past those hurdles, which he doubted, Stephens said, \"lawyers would be looking at whether or not the sting of this was true. And they can point to all sorts of previous judicial findings which have said that there was some measure of incitement in which the president was involved.\"",
      "The head of the BBC and its CEO of news resigned in the wake of the criticism of the broadcaster's editing of the speech. The BBC said Director-General Tim Davie and head of news Deborah Turness both announced their resignations on Sunday.",
      "In a letter to staff, Davie said quitting the job after five years \"is entirely my decision.\"",
      "\"Overall, the BBC is delivering well, but there have been some mistakes made and as director-general I have to take ultimate responsibility,\" Davie said, adding that he was \"working through exact timings with the Board to allow for an orderly transition to a successor over the coming months.\"",
      "Turness said that the controversy about the Trump documentary \"has reached a stage where it is causing damage to the BBC \u2014 an institution that I love. As the CEO of BBC News and Current Affairs, the buck stops with me.\"",
      "\"While mistakes have been made, I want to be absolutely clear recent allegations that BBC News is institutionally biased are wrong,\" she added.",

    "story": [
      "The United Kingdom will drastically reduce protections for refugees and end automatic benefits for asylum seekers, the Labour government announced late Saturday, under new plans aimed at slashing irregular immigration and countering the hard-right.",
      "The measures, modelled on Denmark's strict asylum system, were announced as Prime Minister Keir Starmer comes under pressure from surging popularity for the anti-immigrant Reform UK party.",
      "\"I'll end UK's golden ticket for asylum seekers,\" interior minister Shabana Mahmood declared in a statement.",
      "But the head of Britain's Refugee Council warned the government the measures would not deter people from trying to reach Britain, and urged a rethink.",
      "Presently, those given refugee status have it for five years, after which they can apply for indefinite leave to remain and eventually citizenship.",
      "But Mahmood's ministry, known as the Home Office, said it would cut the length of refugee status to 30 months.",
      "That protection will be \"regularly reviewed\" and refugees will be forced to return to their home countries once they are deemed safe, it added.",
      "The ministry also said that it intended to make those refugees who were granted asylum wait 20 years before applying to be allowed to live in the U.K. long-term. Currently, they can do so after five years.",
      "Asylum claims in Britain are at a record high, with some 111,000 applications made in the year to June 2025, according to official figures.",
      "The Home Office called the new proposals, which Mahmood is due to lay out in parliament on Monday, the \"largest overhaul of asylum policy in modern times.\"",
      "It said the reforms would make it less attractive for irregular migrants to come to Britain, and make it easier to remove those already in the country.",
      "A statutory legal duty to provide support to asylum seekers, introduced in a 2005 law, would be also be revoked, the ministry said.",
      "That means housing and weekly financial allowances would no longer be guaranteed for asylum seekers.",
      "It would be \"discretionary,\" meaning the government could deny assistance to any asylum seeker who could work or support themselves but did not, or those who committed crimes.",
      "Starmer, elected last summer, is under pressure to stop migrants crossing the English Channel in small boats from France, something that also troubled his Conservative predecessors.",
      "More than 39,000 people, many fleeing conflict, have arrived this year following such dangerous journeys -- more than for the whole of 2024 but lower than the record set in 2022.",
      "The crossings are helping fuel the popularity of Reform, led by firebrand Nigel Farage, which has led Labour by double-digit margins in opinion polls for most of this year.",
      "Labour is taking inspiration from Denmark's coalition government -- led by the center-left Social Democrats -- which has implemented some of the strictest migration policies in Europe.",
      "Senior British officials recently visited the Scandinavian country, where successful asylum claims are at a 40-year-low.",
      "Refugees in Denmark are entitled to a one-year renewable residency permit, and are encouraged to return home as soon as authorities deem there is no longer a need for a safe haven.",
      "Family reunions are also subject to strict requirements, including a minimum age for both parents, language tests and guarantees of funds.",
      "Britain's Mahmood is also expected to announce a tightening of rules around family reunions.",
      "Enver Solomon, chief executive of the Refugee Council, urged the government to rethink its plans, saying they \"will not deter\" the crossings.",
      "\"They should ensure that refugees who work hard and contribute to Britain can build secure, settled lives and give back to their communities,\" he said.",

Global temperatures, greenhouse gas emissions and sea levels all reached record highs in 2024, the\u00a0State of the Global Climate report\u00a0confirmed.",

      "Japan raised objections Saturday after China advised its citizens to avoid visiting Japan, as a feud over the new Japanese leader's remarks on Taiwan showed no signs of dying down.",
      "The government in Tokyo lodged a protest and its top spokesperson, Chief Cabinet Secretary Minoru Kihara, urged China to take \"appropriate measures,\" Japan's Kyodo News Service reported.",
      "China advised its citizens Friday to refrain from traveling to Japan in the near future. It cited earlier attacks against Chinese in Japan and what it called Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi 's \"erroneous remarks\" on Taiwan, which it said undermined the atmosphere for China-Japan\u00a0exchange.",
      "Kihara told reporters that it is precisely because of the differences between the two governments that multilayered communication is essential, a Kyodo report said.",
      "China has repeatedly recommended its nationals take security precautions when in Japan over the past year, but the latest announcement appeared to be stronger in advising against travel, according to notices posted on the website of its embassy in Tokyo.",
      "Japan is an immensely popular destination for Chinese tourists, providing a much-needed economic boost but also sparking an anti-China and anti-foreigner backlash from some. It's unclear what impact the advisory will have on the willingness of Chinese to visit Japan, but several Chinese airlines\u00a0offered no-penalty refunds on previously sold tickets to Japan following the government's announcement.",
      "The dispute suggests that Japan's already fragile relations with China could turn rocky under Takaichi, who supports building up the military to counter potential threats from Beijing and its claims to contested territory in nearby waters in the western Pacific.",
      "Takaichi, who became prime minister last month, said in parliament that a Chinese attack on Taiwan could constitute \"an existential threat\" to Japan, requiring the use of force by its military.",
      "The remark prompted strong objections from China, including a social media post from its consul general in Osaka last weekend saying \"we have no choice but to cut off that dirty neck that has been lunged at us.\"",
      "His comment, which was later taken down, sparked a Japanese diplomatic protest that was followed by a back-and-forth that continued all week.",
      "China claims Taiwan, a self-governing island off its coast, as its territory and has staged threatening military drills in the surrounding waters in recent years.",
      "Neither the United States nor Japan has official diplomatic relations with Taiwan, but the U.S. is the main supplier of defense equipment to the island's military and opposes resolution of the China-Taiwan situation by force.",

    "published": "Sat, 15 Nov 2025 08:14:13 -0500",
    "summary": "The Vatican has returned 62 artifacts to Indigenous peoples from Canada.",
    "story": [
      "The Vatican on Saturday returned 62 artifacts to Indigenous peoples from Canada as part of the Catholic Church's reckoning with its role in helping suppress Indigenous culture in the Americas.",
      "Pope Leo XIV gave the artifacts, including an iconic Inuit kayak, and supporting documentation to a delegation of the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops during an audience. According to a joint statement from the Vatican and Canadian church, the pieces were a gift and a \"concrete sign of dialogue, respect and fraternity.\"",
      "The items were part of the Vatican Museum's ethnographic collection, known as the Anima Mundi museum. The collection has been a source of controversy for the Vatican amid the broader museum debate over the restitution of cultural goods taken from Indigenous peoples during colonial periods.",
      "Most of the items in the Vatican collection were sent to Rome by Catholic missionaries for a 1925 exhibition in the Vatican gardens. The Vatican insists the items were \"gifts\" to Pope Pius XI, who wanted to celebrate the church's global reach, its missionaries and the lives of the Indigenous peoples they evangelized.",
      "But historians, Indigenous groups and experts have long questioned whether the items could really have been offered freely, given the power imbalances at play in Catholic missions at the time. In those years, Catholic religious orders were helping to enforce the Canadian government's\u00a0forced assimilation policy\u00a0of eliminating Indigenous traditions, which Canada's Truth and Reconciliation Commission has called \"cultural genocide.\"",
      "Part of that policy included confiscating items used in Indigenous spiritual and traditional rituals, such as the 1885 potlatch ban that prohibited the integral First Nations ceremony. Those confiscated items ended up in museums in Canada, the U.S. and Europe, as well as private collections.",
      "Negotiations accelerate on returning items",
      "Negotiations on returning the Vatican items accelerated after Pope Francis in 2022 met with Indigenous leaders who had traveled to the Vatican to receive his apology for the church's role in running Canada's disastrous residential schools. During their visit, they were shown some objects in the collection, including an Inuit kayak, wampum belts, war clubs and masks, and asked for them to be returned.",
      "Francis later said he was in favor of returning the items and others in the Vatican collection on a case-by-case basis, saying: \"In the case where you can return things, where it's necessary to make a gesture, better to do it.\"",
      "The Vatican said Saturday the items were given back during the Holy Year, exactly 100 years after the 1925 exhibition where they were first exhibited in Rome.",
      "\"This is an act of ecclesial sharing, with which the Successor of Peter entrusts to the Church in Canada these artifacts, which bear witness to the history of the encounter between faith and the cultures of the Indigenous peoples,\" said the joint statement from the Vatican and Canadian church.",
      "It added that the Canadian Catholic hierarchy committed to ensuring that the artifacts are \"properly safeguarded, respected and preserved.\" Officials had previously said the Canadian bishops would receive the artifacts with the explicit understanding that the ultimate keepers will be the Indigenous communities themselves.",
      "The items are expected to be taken first to the Canadian Museum of History in Gatineau, Quebec. There, experts and Indigenous groups will try to identify where the items originated, down to the specific community, and what should be done with them, officials said previously.",
      "A process of reckoning with abuses",
      "The Canadian ambassador to the Holy See, Joyce Napier, said the return had been a key priority for the Canadian government, something the embassy has been working on for years with the Holy See, Canadian church and Indigenous communities.",
      "\"This is historic, something Indigenous communities have been asking for,\" she told The Associated Press. \"Today's announcement is a significant step towards reconciliation.\"",
      "As part of its broader reckoning with the Catholic Church's colonial past, the Vatican in 2023 formally repudiated the \"Doctrine of Discovery,\" the theories backed by 15th-century \"papal bulls\" that legitimized the colonial-era seizure of Native lands that form the basis of some property laws today.",
      "The statement marked a historic recognition of the Vatican's own complicity in colonial-era abuses committed by European powers, even though it didn't address Indigenous demands that the Vatican formally rescind the papal bulls themselves.",
      "The Vatican on Saturday cited the 2023 repudiation of the Doctrine of Discovery in its statement, saying Leo's return of the artifacts concludes the \"journey\" initiated by Francis.",

    "story": [
      "A cache of confiscated explosives detonated inside a police station in Indian-administered Kashmir, killing at least nine people and injuring 32 others, police said on Saturday.",
      "The blast occurred in the Nowgam area of Srinagar, the region's main city, late Friday when a team of forensic experts and police were examining the explosive material, said Nalin Prabhat, the region's police director-general. He ruled out any foul play, saying it was an accident.",
      "The dead included six police and forensic officials, two civil administrators and one civilian, authorities said. Some of the injured were in critical condition.",
      "The huge blast ripped through the police station, setting it and multiple vehicles on fire. According to the news agency Press Trust of India, small successive explosions prevented immediate rescue operations.",
      "The police station blast came days after Monday's deadly car explosion in New Delhi, which killed at least eight people near the city's historic Red Fort. Indian officials called it a \"heinous terror incident\" carried out by \"anti-national forces.\" The car blast happened hours after police in Kashmir said they had dismantled a suspected militant cell operating from the disputed region, arresting at least seven people, including two doctors from Indian cities, and seizing a large quantity of bomb-making material in the city of Faridabad, near New Delhi.",
      "Indian security agencies have since carried out a series of raids in Kashmir as part of their investigation into the car blast, questioning hundreds while detaining scores others.",
      "Indian police said Saturday they used DNA to identify the car's driver and that he was a Kashmiri doctor. Government forces blew up his family home in the southern district of Pulwama on Thursday night, officials said.",
      "In the past, troops have demolished homes of suspects they accuse of being tied to militants fighting against Indian administration in Kashmir as a punishment.",
      "Police had brought the explosive material seized in Faridabad to Kashmir as part of their investigation and were \"kept securely in an open area\" at the police station, where the investigation that led to the suspected militant cell began last month, according to Prabhat, the top officer.",
      "Prabhat said a team of experts was taking samples for forensic investigation when the blast occurred, calling it an \"accidental explosion.\"",
      "\"Any other speculation into the cause of this incident is unnecessary,\" he said.",
      "The blast could be heard from miles away in Srinagar, locals said. Some of the victims' body parts were recovered from nearby houses, over 300 feet away from the police station. Multiple houses also suffered damage.",
      "\"The explosion produced a deafening roar that rattled houses and flung open windows closed tight,\" Bashir Ahmed, a resident, told The Associated Press.",
      "Nearly a dozen relatives of Mohammad Shafi Parray, killed in the blast, assembled at his home in Nowgam and marched in protest to the police station, chanting: \"We want justice.\"",
      "One of Parry's relatives, who didn't give her name, said the deceased, a tailor by profession, was summoned by the police Friday night. \"Why did (the police) take him?\" she shouted.",

    "story": [
      "Google is filing a federal lawsuit against a network of foreign cybercriminals based in China that is accused of launching massive text-message phishing attacks, the tech giant told CBS News in an exclusive interview.",
      "Google said the messages are part of a criminal network called \"Lighthouse.\" The texts look legitimate, often warning recipients of a \"stuck package\" or an \"unpaid toll,\" but they're actually phishing or what's called smishing \u2014 a type of phishing scam that uses text messages to try to trick recipients into revealing personal and sensitive information, such as passwords and credit card numbers, which are then stolen.",
      "\"These scammers ended up compromising anywhere from 15 [million] to 100 million potential credit cards within the U.S. and impacted, at our current estimates, over a million victims,\" Google's general counsel,   Halimah DeLaine Prado, told CBS News.",
      "DeLaine Prado said Google has filed what it calls a first-of-its-kind lawsuit under the RICO Act, which is typically used to take down organized crime rings.",
      "The case targets unknown operators \u2014 listed as John Does 1 through 25 \u2014 who allegedly built a \"phishing-as-a-service\" platform to power mass text attacks.",
      "DeLaine Prado said the lawsuit is not meant specifically to help victims recover any losses, but rather to serve as a \"deterrent for future criminals to create similar enterprises.\"",
      "Google said it found more than 100 fake sites using its logo to trick people into handing over passwords or credit card numbers. According to its complaint, it estimates the group has stolen sensitive information linked to tens of millions of credit cards in the U.S. alone.",
      "Kevin Gosschalk, the CEO of cybersecurity firm Arkose Labs, said that while recovering lost money is a challenge, lawsuits like Google's could help disrupt scammers' operations.",
      "\"It has an impact on the ecosystem,\" Gosschalk told CBS News. He said that if there are three major players and you go after the big one and take it down, \"then the other two start second-guessing, 'Hey, should we be in this business, or should we get out of this business?'\"",
      "Google's move appears aimed as much at setting a legal precedent as at seeking punishment \u2014 testing whether a 1970s racketeering law can be applied to a 21st-century digital crime.",
      "Gosschalk said it will be very hard for Google to go after cybercriminals overseas since a lot of them also operate in countries like Cambodia, where there are limited extradition laws.",
      "\"But it does mean the individuals behind those things will not be able to travel to the U.S. in the future, so it does add extra risk,\" Gosschalk said.",
      "Users can avoid text scams by not clicking links or replying to unknown messages. On an iPhone, users can turn on \"Filter Unknown Senders\" and \"Filter Junk.\" On Android, enable Spam Protection and forward scam texts to 7726 (SPAM).",
      "Note that those filters can also catch legitimate messages from numbers that are not in the phone's contact list, so be sure to check the unknown senders or spam folder once in a while.",

    "story": [
      "Expert talks about the gut health differences between men and women",
      "While gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) affects both men and women, men tend to experience more severe symptoms and complications.",
      "Studies show that men have higher acid exposure and are nearly twice as likely to develop Barrett\u2019s esophagus, a condition that can lead to esophageal cancer if left untreated.",
      "Esophageal cancer is up to nine times more common in men, making them far more likely to progress from chronic reflux to serious outcomes.",
      "HIDDEN CAUSES OF HEART ATTACKS OFTEN OVERLOOKED OR MISDIAGNOSED, STUDY FINDS",
      "Dr. Daryl Gioffre, gut health specialist, certified nutritionist and author of \"Get Off Your Acid\" and \"Get Off Your Sugar,\" spoke with Fox News Digital about how acid reflux is becoming a \"silent epidemic\" among men \u2014 and what they can do about it.",
      "\"This isn\u2019t just about heartburn, but about systemic inflammation that starts in the gut and spreads throughout the body,\" Gioffre said.",
      "While gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) affects both men and women, men tend to experience more severe symptoms and complications. (iStock)",
      "\"Acid reflux is the body\u2019s alarm system, warning that the gut, metabolism and stress response are all out of balance.\"",
      "\u2018The perfect storm\u2019",
      "Men today are living in a \"pressure cooker,\" Gioffre warned. \"Chronic stress, poor sleep, processed foods, alcohol and medication overuse are destroying gut health and digestion,\" he said.",
      "\"Combine that with typical diets heavier in meat, alcohol and ultraprocessed foods, and a greater tendency to ignore symptoms, and you\u2019re breeding a perfect storm for chronic inflammation and increased risk of reflux compared to women.\"",
      "EVEN LOW-CALORIE PROCESSED FOOD CAUSES WEIGHT GAIN, TESTOSTERONE LOSS IN MEN, STUDY SUGGESTS",
      "Late-night eating, larger portions, less fiber and high caffeine intake also stack the deck against men, he said. In addition to dietary choices, men\u2019s lifestyle behaviors can also impact digestion.",
      "Late-night eating and larger portions are part of what make men more prone to acid reflux and other digestive issues. (iStock)",
      "\"Many men skip meals, eat too quickly and rely on convenience foods stripped of minerals and fiber,\" Gioffre said.",
      "Over time, this \"ongoing acid assault\" erodes the gut lining, drives acid upward and turns normal esophageal cells into precancerous Barrett\u2019s cells, increasing cancer risk dramatically, he warned.",
      "Biggest food culprits",
      "When it comes to ultraprocessed foods, Gioffre called out three specific components that worsen acid reflux: refined salt, sugar and seed oils.",
      "\"Together, they inflame the gut and weaken both digestion and the lower esophageal sphincter, the valve that keeps acid in the stomach where it belongs,\" he said.",
      "\"Men need to slow down, eat foods that support digestion and strengthen the gut, and stop relying on quick fixes.\"",
      "Men also tend to drink more coffee than women, often two to three cups a day, usually on an empty stomach, Gioffre pointed out.",
      "\"That constant caffeine hit strips minerals, dehydrates the body and spikes acidity \u2014 all of which increase the risk of reflux.\"",
      "BREAKFAST TIMING MAY HOLD THE KEY TO LIVING LONGER, NEW RESEARCH REVEALS",
      "Ultimately, he said, \"men need to slow down, eat foods that support digestion and strengthen the gut, and stop relying on quick fixes. Otherwise, reflux will only keep getting worse and harder to treat.\"",
      "Biological differences",
      "There are some biological differences between the genders that contribute to men\u2019s higher risk of severe gastrointestinal conditions, according to Gioffre.",
      "\"Men produce less protective mucus and saliva \u2014 the body\u2019s natural defense system that buffers acid when it backflows into the esophagus. So when acid reflux strikes, it hits harder,\" he said.",
      "Some examples of alkaline-rich foods include leafy greens, vegetables, fruits, nuts and seeds, and mineral water or spring water. (iStock)",
      "\"That acid burns and erodes tissue that was never designed to handle acid in the first place, setting the stage for inflammation, damage and long-term complications.\"",
      "Younger men also tend to carry more visceral (abdominal) fat, Gioffre noted, which increases pressure in the stomach and forces acid up into the esophagus.",
      "SCIENTISTS REVEAL HOW YOUR FAVORITE SODA COULD QUIETLY MESS WITH YOUR MOOD",
      "Hormones also play a role.",
      "\"Estrogen in women appears to protect the esophagus by improving blood flow and mucosal repair, protection men have much less of,\" the doctor said. \"Without lower levels than women, their tissue where reflux hits doesn\u2019t recover as quickly from repeated acid exposure.\"",
      "5 things to start doing right now",
      "Gioffre recommends that men take the following simple steps to immediately begin lowering their risk.",
      "\"One of the biggest and most overlooked causes of acid reflux is eating too close to bedtime,\" Gioffre said. \"When you lie down after a meal, gravity is no longer helping to keep acid in your stomach where it belongs, so it\u2019s much easier for it to travel up the wrong way into your esophagus.\"",
      "Reflux symptoms often get worse at night, the doctor noted \u2014 \"and it\u2019s why so many men wake up coughing, choking or with a burning throat, hoarse voice or sour taste in their mouth.\" (iStock)",
      "This is why reflux symptoms often get worse at night, he noted \u2014 \"and it\u2019s why so many men wake up coughing, choking or with a burning throat, hoarse voice or sour taste in their mouth.\"",
      "Gioffre said it\u2019s best to stop eating three hours before bed, which gives the body time to fully digest, empty the stomach and drop acid levels before lying down.",
      "Common triggers include garlic, onions, spicy foods, alcohol, chocolate, caffeine, citrus fruits and carbonated water, according to Gioffre.",
      "CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "\"All of these weaken the lower esophageal sphincter, the valve that keeps stomach acid where it belongs,\" he said. \"Once that muscle relaxes, acid flows upward, causing heartburn by inflaming and irritating the esophageal and throat lining.\"",
      "\"If you want to heal reflux naturally, you can\u2019t just change what you eat \u2014 you have to change how you live.\"",
      "The doctor also recommends adding back alkaline minerals, digestive enzymes and a high-quality probiotic. Some examples of alkaline-rich foods include leafy greens, vegetables, fruits, nuts and seeds, and mineral water or spring water.",
      "Gioffre recommends starting the morning with warm lemon water with a teaspoon of local honey, or a tea with slippery elm.",

      "\"This helps soothe and calm the upper GI tract and eases reflux,\" he said. It\u2019s also important to stay hydrated throughout the day, the doctor added.",
      "Simple grounding practices, like walking barefoot in the grass, doing deep breathing or just stepping outside to reconnect with nature, can help promote gut health.",
      "Esophageal cancer is up to nine times more common in men, making them far more likely to progress from chronic reflux to serious outcomes. (iStock)",
      "\"These activate your parasympathetic \u2018rest-and-digest\u2019 system, calm your gut and keep acid levels in check naturally,\" Gioffre said. \"Get outside and move after meals, and swap your late-night snack for deep breathing or stretching.\"",
      "When men don\u2019t sleep well, the body produces more cortisol, which is the main stress hormone.",
      "\"High cortisol keeps you locked in a constant state of fight-or-flight, and when you\u2019re in that mode, your body isn\u2019t focused on rest, digest or repair \u2014 it\u2019s focused on survival,\" Gioffre said.",
      "TEST YOURSELF WITH OUR LATEST LIFESTYLE QUIZ",
      "In this state, blood flow is pulled away from the gut and sent to the muscles and brain, he noted, which means digestion slows down, stomach acid production drops and food sits in the stomach for too long, which leads to bloating, gas and more reflux.",

      "The Senate ultimately did not drag out passage of the interim spending bill aimed at ending the government shutdown. (J. Scott Applewhite/AP)",
      "There were several Senate factions not ready to vote right away to end the shutdown last Sunday. It was clear the Senate would eventually pass the bill to fund the government. That\u2019s to say nothing of the worsening impacts of the shutdown on a nearly hourly basis.",
      "Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., was the only Republican who broke with his party and voted no on the test vote to break a filibuster on the deal to re-open the government. Paul voted nay because he wanted a change in the bill regarding hemp.",
      "The measure prevents \"unregulated sales\" of \"intoxicating hemp-based\" products at gas stations and small retailers. It preserves the sale of non-intoxicating CBD in other hemp-related products.",
      "So, if the Senate got 60 votes Sunday night to break the filibuster and only needs 51 to pass the bill, why was the Senate stymied by Paul or even others?",
      "Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., told reporters there was a senator asking for a vote on an amendment that would hold members' pay in escrow during future government shutdowns. This would be in addition to Paul, asking for a vote on an amendment related to hemp policy.",
      "Paul's request was previously known. But this additional ask underscores the precarious balance of any unanimous consent agreement in the Senate. Once one senator gets something, others are likely to ask for something for themselves.",
      "Paul told reporters that he believed leadership was happy to give him his vote. But Paul said Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., blocked that for a short period.",
      "Meanwhile, Mullin said Democrats went \"radio silent\" on whether they were willing to yield back debate time to speed up consideration of the bill. Any one senator could drag this process out for days, so their cooperation would be crucial in bringing the shutdown to a quick end.",
      "It\u2019s about speed.",

      "SENATE DEMOCRATS, REPUBLICANS REACH DEAL TO REOPEN GOVERNMENT",
      "The vote on Sunday night was on breaking a filibuster to proceed to the original House-passed spending measure from September. That needed 60 yeas.",

      "By rule, the Senate can run out 30 hours of debate after breaking the filibuster, unless Paul relents. That would have gotten us to a minor procedural vote to actually get on the bill by dawn last Tuesday morning.",
      "That is, unless there was an agreement with Paul \u2013 or for that matter \u2013 other Democratic senators to expedite things.",

A substitute simply removes the House\u2019s old bill text and replaces it with the new spending package.",
      "But because this is a substitute amendment, Thune must then \"file cloture\" to break a filibuster on that. By rule, Thune could not do that until this past Tuesday. Cloture petitions require an intervening day before ripening. So that means the Senate could not vote to break a filibuster on the substitute (e.g. the new bill) until last Thursday. Again, that needs 60 yeas. And if there was no deal, the Senate could bleed out another clock before voting yes or no on the substitute. Presumably, that would have been on Friday.",
      "But we\u2019re not done yet.",
      "TRUMP ENDS SHUTDOWN, FACES BACKLASH AND MAKES SURPRISE EPSTEIN MOVE AMID CHAOTIC WEEK",
      "If the Senate would have adopted the new text on Friday, then Thune would have had to file cloture again on the underlying bill, wait a day (Saturday) and then have a vote to break a filibuster on that (again needing 60) on Sunday.",
      "This scenario meant that the Senate would finally pass the newly revamped spending bill on Monday. And it would mean that the House would not have tackled the bill until this coming Tuesday or Wednesday.",
      "So that really would have stretched out the government shutdown.",
      "It was in the interest of Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., to secure a deal with Paul in a bid to accelerate things. (Nathan Posner/Anadolu via Getty Images)",
      "That said, this was probably never going to happen. That\u2019s just doing things by the book.",
      "But it\u2019s also why it was in the interest of Thune to get a deal with Paul to accelerate things. Otherwise, Paul or the Democrats who oppose the bill could have slowed things down and extended the shutdown.",
      "But consider for a moment that if the left really wanted Democrats to stand and fight, there\u2019s a group of core Democrats who are upset that their party relented. But then again, they had an opportunity to stretch out the shutdown and opted not to do so. There was also a smattering of Democrats who were more than happy to have others vote to open the government \u2013 even though they wanted to do so but weren\u2019t willing to vote yes. They relied on the yes votes \u2013 or courage \u2013 of their colleagues.",
      "And Paul was upset at the hemp provision.",
      "\"It\u2019s really contemptuous,\" said Paul of the hemp issue. \"I\u2019m not looking to hold things up. I\u2019m looking to try to get things done.\"",
      "Paul said his \"goal is to condense the time.\" He got just that \u2013 a vote to strip out the hemp provision. But senators blocked it. And without significant Democratic protestations, the Senate approved the bill on Monday without deep delays.",

      "Meanwhile, China\u2019s third aircraft carrier, the Fujian, was commissioned this fall \u2013 the first with electromagnetic catapults similar to U.S. Ford-class carriers. The move signals Beijing\u2019s ambition to launch stealth jets from sea and project power well beyond its coast.",

Lawmakers had been expected to reconvene Dec. 1 for what would have been an unusual mid-decade attempt to redraw all nine congressional districts.",
      "\"Over the last several months, Senate Republicans have given very serious and thoughtful consideration to the concept of redrawing our state\u2019s congressional maps,\" Bray said, according to the Chronicle. \"There are not enough votes to move that idea forward.\"",
      "Gov. Mike Braun had called for lawmakers to meet in November to take up redistricting and argued that Republicans should add additional GOP-leaning districts before Democrats in other states complete their own mapping changes.TRUMP-BACKED MAP VICTORY IN MISSOURI COULD TRIGGER REDISTRICTING BATTLES IN THESE STATES",

      "Indiana\u2019s current map, drawn by Republicans in 2021, gives the GOP a 7-2 congressional advantage. Redistricting supporters had wanted lawmakers to craft a map in which all nine districts favored Republicans based on 2020 Census data.",
      "The push came after months of pressure from Trump allies, including strategist Marty Obst, who now leads the group Fair Maps Indiana. Obst told the Chronicle that Bray \"blocked the special session\" and warned that \"decisions have consequences.\"",

      "Democrats quickly praised Bray\u2019s announcement. Senate Minority Leader Shelli Yoder said in a statement to the Chronicle that \"Washington insiders pressured the governor to rig Indiana\u2019s congressional maps,\" calling the collapse of the effort a \"win for all of us.\"",
      "Public polling cited by the Chronicle suggested that Indiana voters also leaned against revisiting the maps. University of Indianapolis political science professor Laura Merrifield Wilson told the Chronicle that surveys indicated roughly a 2-to-1 margin opposing a mid-decade redraw.",

      "The Biden administration's Department of Justice stated that on Jan. 31, 2021, the day before Kaye was set to meet with FBI agents regarding a tip that she was at the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6 riot, she posted videos on social media in which she said she would \"shoot\" FBI agents if they came to her house. The FBI learned of Kaye's social media posts on Feb. 8, 2021, and arrested Kaye at her Florida home on Feb. 17, 2021.",

A White House official told Fox News Digital that the president made the decision to grant Wilson an additional pardon because the firearms were discovered during a search of Wilson's home related to the Capitol riot.",
      "Despite being included in the sweeping pardon granted to Jan. 6 defendants by Trump on Jan. 20, 2025, Wilson remained incarcerated due to the firearms charge and was set to be released in 2028. Prior to his sentencing on Jan. 6-related charges, for which he received five years in prison, Wilson pleaded guilty to possession of a firearm by a prohibited person and possession of an unregistered firearm.",

      "U.S. District Judge Dabney Friedrich, a Trump appointee involved in Wilson's case, rejected the expanded definition of what exactly Trump was pardoning, saying it stretched the bounds of the order too far. In her opinion, Friedrich criticized the use of the phrase \"related to\" from Trump's original pardon to expand its meaning.",
      "\"The surrounding text of the pardon makes clear that 'related to' denotes a specific factual relationship between the conduct underlying a given offense and what took place at the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021,\" Friedrich wrote in her opinion.",
      "An appeals court later supported her objections, saying that Wilson had to remain behind bars during the appeal process.",

She pledged to explore government-backed grocery stores if elected this fall after accepting the endorsement from grocery workers union UFCW 3000, Washington\u2019s largest\u00a0private-sector union. New York voters, meanwhile, saw a similar pitch from Mamdani.",

However, when pressed for more details, Wilson reportedly said the money comes in every few months.",

      "In-vitro fertilization (IVF) can take a serious toll on families, not only emotionally but financially, especially when every cycle comes with new bills and no clear sense of what the full journey might cost. Gaia Family aims to change that by removing the guesswork around pricing with a blend of tech and AI-driven forecasting.",
      "Instead of worrying about unpredictable costs, couples pay a fixed upfront price or monthly installments that cover their planned IVF treatment, medications, embryo transfers and built-in protections if cycles or transfers aren't successful. It gives families a clearer path forward and support that lasts through the entire process.",

      "Artificial intelligence is giving hopeful parents more clarity about their chances over multiple IVF cycles, helping them plan their journey with clearer expectations instead of guesswork. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How Gaia Family was born",
      "Gaia Family was founded by Nader AlSalim, a former Goldman Sachs executive who knew the IVF struggle firsthand. After spending over $50,000 across five IVF rounds in multiple countries, he and his wife finally had a son. The experience left him frustrated by how little clarity the system offered and how emotionally draining the process could be.",
      "He saw that most fertility systems were built around procedures, not people. His goal with Gaia Family was to build something different, a program that uses data to empower families instead of leaving them to navigate uncertainty and mounting debt. That personal experience became the foundation of Gaia Family's mission to bring agency, transparency and compassion to fertility care.",

      "Gaia Family gives families one fixed IVF price with built-in protection and full support every step of the way. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",

      "Choose your clinic:\u00a0Gaia partners with more than 100 fertility clinics across the U.S.Get your personalized quote: Your doctor designs your treatment plan, and Gaia uses it to calculate your fixed cost upfront.Start with confidence:\u00a0Pay monthly or upfront, then begin treatment knowing all your major expenses are covered.",

      "Get your personalized quote: Your doctor designs your treatment plan, and Gaia uses it to calculate your fixed cost upfront.",
      "Start with confidence:\u00a0Pay monthly or upfront, then begin treatment knowing all your major expenses are covered.",
      "If a cycle doesn't result in viable embryos, Gaia's built-in protection covers another attempt, helping families try again without financial shock. Once you have viable embryos, your Gaia Plan allows you unlimited frozen embryo transfers (usually $5,000 each) at no extra cost until you have a baby. And, if none of those transfers result in a live birth, then Gaia will give you money toward another cycle. Plus, you have the option of including all of your PGT-A testing and your medication for a fixed cost, so you have even more protection throughout your journey. AlSalim, tells CyberGuy the company's mission goes beyond technology.",
      "\"At Gaia Family, we're using AI not to replace the human element of fertility care, but to bring more confidence to it,\" AlSalim said. \"Fertility treatment can feel like a game of chance \u2014 our technology helps turn it into a guided, informed journey. By analyzing millions of data points, we can forecast the most effective and affordable pathway for each individual, so patients can make decisions grounded in data rather than uncertainty. Ultimately, it's about giving hopeful parents more agency, transparency and peace of mind in one of the most emotional experiences of their lives.\"",
      "SKIN DNA BREAKTHROUGH COULD LET 60-YEAR-OLD WOMEN HAVE GENETICALLY RELATED KIDS",
      "For many couples, this combination of data and compassion is transforming uncertainty into confidence and renewed hope. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why Gaia Family's model matters",
      "IVF in the United States can cost as much as $30,000 per cycle, and most couples need several tries. Each failed attempt adds more bills and stress. Gaia Family's fixed-cost model gives families financial predictability while keeping them emotionally supported. It also encourages clinics to focus on outcomes rather than repeated treatments.",
      "This approach is transforming how people view fertility care. Instead of relying on luck, families can benefit from AI insights to make better decisions. While it may not lower the medical costs yet, it changes how couples experience one of life's most emotional challenges, turning fear into informed planning and despair into hope. Gaia removes the spiraling costs, making couples' outcomes so much more cost-efficient.",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you are thinking about IVF or egg freezing, Gaia Family's model could make your path more manageable. It provides upfront transparency about costs, protection against financial loss and a data-driven forecast of success. It helps you make decisions based on evidence rather than guesswork.",
      "Still, while AI can analyze data patterns, it cannot alter biology. Factors like age, health and genetics continue to shape outcomes. Even so, Gaia Family's system gives couples a sense of control that traditional fertility care rarely provides by serving everyone, with no eligibility criteria in terms of age or health factors. Knowing that your finances are protected can ease stress and allow you to focus on what matters most: building your family.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Gaia Family is blending AI and empathy to rewrite how fertility care works. It replaces uncertainty with insight and transforms risk into reassurance. For many, it's not just about technology, it's about restoring hope and fairness to one of life's most personal journeys.",

    "story": [
      "Could the Klein Vision AirCar redefine the future of travel? Tech expert Kurt Knutsson discusses.",
      "Pennsylvania may soon join the few states ready to welcome flying cars. State Sen. Marty Flynn from the 22nd District has reintroduced Senate Bill 1077, also known as the Jetsons Act, during the 2025-2026 Regular Session.",
      "The proposal amends Title 75 of the Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes, creating a new legal category for roadable aircraft. These vehicles would have the unique ability to operate both on public roads as motor vehicles and in the air as aircraft.",
      "The legislation was referred to the Senate Transportation Committee Nov. 5, 2025. Although a similar version failed to pass last session, Flynn remains committed to positioning Pennsylvania as a leader in advanced transportation technology. He believes that laying the groundwork now will allow the state to adapt quickly when these vehicles become commercially viable.",

      "Lawmakers hope clear rules today will make tomorrow\u2019s skyways as safe as the highways below. (Rachel Wisniewski/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "Why this bill matters",
      "Technology is advancing faster than most laws can keep up. The rise of advanced air mobility is blurring the line between cars and aircraft.",
      "Several companies, including\u00a0Alef Aeronautics,\u00a0Samson Sky and\u00a0CycloTech are developing vehicles that can take off vertically or transform from cars to small aircraft within minutes.",
      "Some states are already laying the groundwork for this new era. Minnesota and New Hampshire have passed legislation formally recognizing \"roadable aircraft,\" making them the first states to treat flying cars as both vehicles and aircraft under state law. Pennsylvania now hopes to follow their lead with its own version through Sen. Marty Flynn's Jetsons Act.",
      "At the same time, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has begun approving real-world tests. In 2023, the FAA granted a special airworthiness certificate to SpaceX-backed Alef Aeronautics for its Model A prototype, allowing it to operate on roads and in the air for research and development. That approval marked the first time a flying car received official clearance for combined ground and flight testing in the United States.",
      "Sen. Flynn wants Pennsylvania to be part of this growing national conversation. In his co-sponsorship memo, he explained that proactive legislation will help the state prepare for the next wave of innovation.",
      "WOULD YOU BUY THE WORLD'S FIRST PERSONAL ROBOCAR?",
      "The Alef flying car is made of ultra-light material, allowing it to fly and travel on roads. (Alef Aeronautics)",
      "How the Jetsons Act would work",
      "Under Senate Bill 1077, Pennsylvania would officially define a \"roadable aircraft\" as a hybrid vehicle capable of both driving and flying. These vehicles would need to register with the state, display a unique registration plate and meet standard inspection requirements. When operated on highways or city streets, they would be subject to the same rules as other vehicles. When used in flight, they would remain under federal aviation oversight.",
      "The bill also clarifies how drivers and pilots must transition between ground and air operations safely. It allows take-offs and landings only in approved areas, except during emergencies. Flynn emphasizes that clear definitions and consistent oversight will prevent confusion for both motorists and law enforcement. He hopes this clarity will also encourage manufacturers to consider Pennsylvania a test site for future flying car technologies.",
      "CHINESE AUTO GIANT WANTS TO MAKE FLYING CARS YOUR NEXT COMMUTE OPTION",
      "Pennsylvania\u2019s Jetsons Act aims to prepare the state for the future of flying cars before they take off. (CycloTech)",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you live in Pennsylvania, this bill could one day change how you think about personal transportation. While flying cars remain in development, legislation like this sets the stage for their eventual arrival. Drivers may one day register, inspect and insure a flying car just like a regular vehicle. Pilots could use the same roadways to reach take-off zones before switching to flight mode.",
      "Even for residents who never plan to own a flying car, the ripple effects could be significant. New rules may influence local zoning, airspace management and infrastructure planning. Communities might see new vertiports or designated landing pads as part of urban development. Insurance companies and safety regulators will need to rethink how they handle this new class of hybrid travel.",
      "The bill also signals a broader change in how states approach innovation. Rather than waiting for federal action, Pennsylvania wants to establish a framework that welcomes new technologies while protecting public safety.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Sen. Flynn's Jetsons Act might sound futuristic, but it reflects a growing reality in transportation. As autonomous vehicles, drones and hybrid aircraft evolve, state governments must adapt to keep up. This legislation shows Pennsylvania's willingness to lead rather than follow. While it may take years before you see a flying car parked in your driveway, the groundwork is already being laid. Lawmakers are thinking ahead about licensing, safety and how to integrate flying cars into existing traffic systems. That forward-thinking approach could one day make Pennsylvania one of the first states to see cars take to the sky.",

The moment I saw that \"Payment order settled\" email, I realized something was off because I don't even have a Geek Squad account. That alone was a major red flag. If you ever get a message about a service you never signed up for, delete it right away. Instead of calling the number in the message, go to the official Best Buy or Geek Squad website to confirm if there is a real issue with your account. Also, sign up for strong antivirus software. Antivirus software acts as your digital guard. It scans downloads, detects malicious links and warns you before dangerous sites load.

    "story": [
      "Data breaches hit every kind of business, from hospitals to tech firms to major retailers. Now a leading government contractor has joined that list.",
      "Conduent, which manages critical public services across the United States, says hackers infiltrated its systems for nearly three months. The cyberattack exposed personal information linked to more than 10 million people.",
      "All about the Conduent breach and its scale",
      "Conduent discovered the intrusion in January 2025 and said hackers had infiltrated its network as early as Oct. 21, 2024. During this period, attackers reportedly stole large amounts of data linked to state-level programs such as Medicaid, child support, food assistance and toll systems. Conduent claims that its investigation found no ongoing malicious activity and said operations were safely restored after the breach was contained.",
      "Conduent manages technology and payment systems for dozens of U.S. state governments, processing roughly $85 billion in annual disbursements and handling over 2 billion customer service interactions every year. According to its own estimates, it supports around 100 million residents through various government health and welfare programs.",
      "MAJOR DATA BROKER HACK IMPACTS 364,000 INDIVIDUALS\u2019 DATA",
      "Hackers accessed Conduent\u2019s network for nearly three months, exposing sensitive data from major state programs like Medicaid and child support. (Felix Zahn/Photothek via Getty Images)",
      "The company reported that at least 400,000 people in Texas were affected, with compromised data including Social Security numbers, medical records and health insurance details. Other affected states include Washington, South Carolina, New Hampshire, Maine, Oregon, Massachusetts and California. Notifications are being sent to all impacted individuals, and a dedicated call center has been established to answer questions about the breach.",

      "How the Conduent breach unfolded",
      "In January, Conduent described the event as an \"operational disruption caused by a third-party compromise.\" The breach led to several days of downtime, disrupting vital services in multiple states. In Wisconsin, for instance, parents and beneficiaries were unable to process payments due to system outages, leaving many struggling to meet obligations related to child support and welfare programs.",
      "The SafePay ransomware group later claimed responsibility for the attack, alleging it had stolen 8.5 terabytes of data. Conduent confirmed in a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing that hackers had indeed exfiltrated files belonging to a limited number of clients. The company says it hired cybersecurity experts to analyze the stolen data and recently confirmed that it contained significant amounts of personal information from end-users across multiple programs.",
      "Despite the massive theft, Conduent said there is currently no evidence that the stolen data has been published online or on dark web marketplaces.",
      "HACKERS TARGET ONLINE STORES WITH NEW ATTACK",
      "We reached out to Conduent for a comment, and a rep for the company provided CyberGuy with the following statement:",
      "\"As previously disclosed in its April 2025 Form 8-K filing with the SEC, in January 2025, Conduent discovered that it was the victim of a cybersecurity incident.\u00a0 With respect to that incident, Conduent has agreed to send notification letters, on behalf of its customers, to individuals whose personal information may have been affected by this incident.\u00a0 In addition, a dedicated call center has been set up to address consumer inquiries. At this time, Conduent has no evidence of any attempted or actual misuse of any information potentially affected by this incident.",
      "\"Upon discovery of the incident, Conduent acted quickly to secure its networks, restore its systems and operations, notify law enforcement and conduct an investigation with the assistance of third-party forensics experts. In addition, given the nature and complexity of the data involved, Conduent has been working diligently with a dedicated review team, including internal and external experts, to conduct a detailed analysis of the affected files to identify the personal information contained therein, which was a time-intensive process. Conduent takes this matter seriously and regrets any inconvenience this incident may have caused.\"",

Data exfiltration on this scale has long-term implications, from identity theft to potential fraud within public benefit systems. The real test will be how both Conduent and its government partners adapt their cybersecurity oversight to prevent similar breaches. Because at this point, the question isn't whether these systems will be targeted again, but whether they'll be any better prepared when it happens.",

    "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/tech/texas-startup-raises-5-5m-revolutionary-solar-towers-produce-50-more-energy",
    "published": "Fri, 14 Nov 2025 07:06:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Texas startup Janta Power raises $5.5M for innovative vertical solar towers that generate 50% more energy than traditional panels while using just one-third the land.",
    "story": [
      "As AI data centers use more electricity, the solar industry is ramping up to provide more power.",
      "Texas startup Janta Power has secured $5.5 million in seed funding to expand its next-generation solar power towers, a vertical alternative to flat solar farms. The funding round was led by MaC Venture Capital with support from Collab Capital. The investment shows strong confidence in 3D solar systems that can reshape renewable energy worldwide.",
      "Why flat solar panels are no longer enough",
      "Traditional solar panels cover large flat areas on rooftops or open fields. This approach uses a lot of land and misses much of the day's available sunlight. The sun moves across the sky, but flat panels capture energy best only when it is directly overhead.",
      "Janta Power takes a different approach. The company's pivoting solar towers stack panels vertically to create a compact three-dimensional structure that captures more sunlight throughout the day. Think of it as the solar version of a skyscraper: more power from less ground space.",
      "Janta Power\u2019s 3D solar towers capture more sunlight throughout the day while using just a third of the land. (Janta Power)",
      "NEVER NEED AN EV CHARGING STATION AGAIN WITH THESE ROOFTOP SOLAR POWER PANELS",
      "How Janta's solar towers work",
      "Each tower uses smart tracking software that follows the sun's path from sunrise to sunset. By adjusting its position throughout the day, the system collects more sunlight than traditional fixed panels. This design allows the towers to produce about 50% more energy while using only one-third of the land required by flat-panel systems.",

      "Because of their vertical orientation, the towers can capture sunlight during early morning and late afternoon when flat arrays are least efficient. The result is a steadier flow of electricity across the entire day, reducing stress on power grids and lowering the need for short-term backup plants.",
      "Stronger, smarter and more efficient",
      "Janta's towers are also built for strength. Each structure can withstand winds up to 170 miles per hour. The towers feature durable steel frames and modular foundations that simplify installation in a wide range of environments.",
      "Pilot programs are already operating at Munich International Airport, Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport and facilities managed by Aena, which oversees more than 70 airports worldwide.",
      "A game-changer for energy economics",
      "The company's 3D geometry gives each site a capacity factor of around 32%, compared to roughly 22% for flat panels. This greater efficiency lowers the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) to about $0.05 per kilowatt-hour, well below the global average of $0.15.",
      "That advantage can make renewable power more accessible for industries such as data centers, universities and telecom operations that need reliable and consistent energy.",
      "Built to endure 170 mph winds, Janta\u2019s modular towers are already powering airports in Munich, Dallas\u2013Fort Worth, and across Aena\u2019s global network. (Shelby Tauber/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "CHINESE-MADE SOLAR PANELS USED ON AMERICAN FARMS PUTS US POWER GRID AT RISK: FORMER NSA OFFICIAL",
      "What this means for you",
      "For businesses and communities, Janta Power's technology could mean smaller solar installations that deliver more energy for less money. Because the towers need less land, they can fit into urban areas, airports or industrial zones that could not host traditional solar farms.",
      "For everyday consumers, these innovations can bring cleaner, more stable and more affordable power to local grids while supporting a greener energy future.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Janta Power's vertical tower design and intelligent tracking system show what happens when creativity meets clean energy. The company's technology makes it possible to generate more power from less space, setting a new standard for solar innovation.",

    "summary": "Discover how Apple&apos;s passkeys revolutionize Mac security by replacing vulnerable passwords with biometric authentication and encryption for ultimate protection.",
    "story": [
      "CyberGuy explains how to make safe and secure passwords on your iPhone.",
      "Your Mac holds a lot more than just files. It carries your personal information, payment data, messages and every online account you access. Keeping that information safe starts with how you sign in. For years, passwords have been the standard way to protect accounts, but they are also one of the weakest links in digital security. They can be guessed, stolen or reused across multiple sites.",
      "Apple's introduction of passkeys marks a major step forward. Instead of relying on something you need to remember, passkeys rely on something you have (your trusted Apple device) and something you are, like your fingerprint or face. Together with iCloud Keychain and two-factor authentication, passkeys create a seamless and much safer way to secure your Mac and your digital life.",
      "What are passkeys?",
      "Passkeys are a modern alternative to passwords. They use public key cryptography to let you sign in without ever creating or typing a password. When you register for an account using a passkey, your Mac creates two unique keys. One is public and stored by the website or app, and the other is private and stays securely on your device.",
      "The public key is not sensitive information. The private key, on the other hand, never leaves your Mac and is protected behind your device's security features. When you sign in, Touch ID or Face ID confirms your identity before your Mac uses the private key to authenticate you. This process prevents phishing and password leaks because no shared secret is ever transmitted to the website.",

      "HOW TO USE PASSKEYS TO KEEP YOUR COMPUTER SAFE",
      "A passkey on your Mac replaces passwords with a faster, more secure way to sign in. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How Apple keeps passkeys secure",
      "Passkeys are stored and synced across your devices through iCloud Keychain, which is protected by end-to-end encryption. This means that not even Apple can access your passkeys or passwords. iCloud Keychain also has built-in protection against brute force attacks, even if someone were to gain unauthorized access to Apple's servers.",
      "If you lose your devices, you can still recover your passkeys through iCloud Keychain recovery. To do this, you must sign in with your Apple ID and password, verify your identity with a code sent to your trusted number and confirm using your device passcode. The system limits the number of attempts, and if too many failed attempts occur, the recovery record is locked or destroyed to prevent misuse.",
      "You can also set an account recovery contact to make sure you never lose access, even if you forget your Apple ID password or device passcode. This multi-layered design ensures that your data remains secure even in extreme scenarios, such as a compromised Apple account or cloud breach.",
      "How to set up passkeys on your Mac",
      "Setting up passkeys is simple and requires iCloud Keychain to be enabled.",
      "Choose the Apple menu, then select\u00a0System Settings.Click your\u00a0name, then click\u00a0iCloud.Click\u00a0Passwords.

      "Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds another layer of protection to your Apple ID.

Then go to\u00a0System Settings \u2192 Apple ID \u2192 Devices and remove anything you don't recognize. Make sure your trusted phone number is still current, since it's critical for account recovery.",
      "Even though passkeys are replacing passwords, many sites still rely on traditional logins. A password manager helps you create, store and fill in unique passwords for every account. iCloud Keychain can do this automatically across all your Apple devices, but if you want more flexibility, you might want to consider a third-party password manager.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Phishing remains one of the most common ways attackers try to steal personal information. They may send fake emails or messages pretending to be from Apple or other trusted companies, urging you to click links or provide login details. Always double-check the sender's address and avoid clicking on links that seem suspicious. Instead, visit the website directly by typing the address into your browser.",
      "While macOS has strong built-in defenses such as Gatekeeper and XProtect, installing strong antivirus software adds another layer of protection against malware, adware and potentially unwanted programs. Strong antivirus software continuously monitors your system for suspicious behavior and can alert you to threats before they cause damage. It is especially useful if you download files from outside the App Store or connect external drives frequently.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "Apple regularly releases software updates that include important security patches. Cybercriminals often target outdated systems because they contain known vulnerabilities. By keeping macOS and your apps up to date, you make it harder for attackers to exploit weaknesses. To make this effortless, turn on\u00a0Automatic Updates under\u00a0System Settings \u2192 General \u2192 Software Update \u2192 Automatic Updates.",
      "Backing up your Mac is just as important as protecting it. Time Machine automatically backs up your files to an external drive or network disk, keeping your data safe from ransomware, hardware failure or accidental deletion. Make sure your backup drive is encrypted for extra protection.",
      "HOW A SINGLE MACBOOK COMPROMISE SPREAD ACROSS A USER\u2019S APPLE DEVICES",
      "Even with passkeys, your personal information can still be exposed through data broker sites that collect and sell your details. Using a data removal service can help remove your private data from hundreds of these sites automatically. It's an effective way to reduce your online footprint and protect your identity, especially when combined with Apple's built-in security tools.",

    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "Kids are spending more time online than ever, and that early exposure is opening the door to a new kind of danger.",
      "Artificial intelligence has supercharged online scams, creating personalized and convincing traps that even adults can fall for. The latest Bitwarden \"Cybersecurity Awareness Month 2025\" poll shows that while parents know these risks exist, most still haven't had a serious talk with their children about them.",
      "This growing communication gap is leaving the youngest internet users vulnerable at a time when online safety depends more than ever on education and oversight.",
      "Young children face real risks online",
      "Children as young as preschool age are now part of the connected world, yet few truly understand how to stay safe. The Bitwarden survey found that 42% of parents with children between 3 and 5 years old said their child had accidentally shared personal information online.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2014 free when you join my\u00a0CYBERGUY.COM newsletter.",
      "5 PHONE SAFETY TIPS EVERY PARENT SHOULD KNOW",
      "AI-powered scams are finding new ways to reach kids who go online earlier than ever. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Nearly 80% of kids between the ages of 3 and 12 already have their own tablet or another connected device. Many parents assume supervision software or family settings are enough, but that assumption breaks down when kids explore apps, games and chat spaces designed to hold their attention. Device access has become nearly universal by early elementary school, but meaningful supervision and honest safety conversations are lagging behind.",
      "The AI threat and the parental disconnect",
      "Artificial intelligence has changed the nature of online scams by making them sound familiar, personal and hard to recognize. Bitwarden's data shows that 78% of parents worry their child could fall for an AI-enhanced threat, such as a voice-cloned message or a fake chat with a friend. Despite that fear, almost half of those same parents haven't talked with their kids about what an AI-powered scam might look like. The disconnect is even stronger among Gen Z parents.",
      "About 80% of them say they are afraid their child will fall victim to an AI-based scheme, yet 37% allow their kids full or nearly full autonomy online. In those households, problems are more common. Malware infections, unauthorized in-app purchases and phishing attempts appear at the highest rates among families who worry the most but monitor the least. The paradox is clear. Parents recognize the threat but fail to translate awareness into consistent action.",
      "Why parents haven't had the talk",
      "There are many reasons this important talk keeps getting delayed. Some parents simply feel unprepared to explain AI, while others assume their existing safety tools will protect their children. Only 17% of parents in the United States actively seek information about AI technologies, according to related research by Barna Group. That leaves a large majority relying on partial knowledge or outdated advice.",
      "Many parents also juggle multiple devices at home, making it difficult to track every app or game their child uses. Some overestimate how safe their own habits are, even though they admit to reusing passwords or skipping security updates. Without firsthand understanding or personal discipline, it becomes even harder to teach those lessons to children. As a result, many kids face the internet with curiosity but without proper guidance.",
      "Smart ways to protect your child online",
      "The Bitwarden findings make one thing clear: kids are getting connected younger, and scams powered by artificial intelligence are already targeting them. The good news is that parents can take practical steps right now to reduce those risks and build lasting online safety habits.",
      "Set up tablets, laptops and gaming consoles in shared family areas rather than bedrooms. When screens stay visible, you naturally become part of your child's online world. This not only encourages open conversation but also helps spot suspicious messages, fake friend requests or scam links before they cause trouble.",
      "Staying involved in your child\u2019s digital life is the best defense against today\u2019s AI threats. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Most devices have strong tools you can activate in minutes. Apple's Screen Time and Google Family Link let you limit screen time, approve new app installs and monitor how long your child spends on specific apps. These controls are especially useful for younger kids who, according to the Bitwarden poll, often have little supervision despite heavy device use.",
      "TEENS TURNING TO AI FOR LOVE AND COMFORT",
      "Before your child installs a new game or app, take a moment to check it together. Read the reviews, look at what data it collects and confirm the developer's name. Explain why some games or \"free\" apps might ask for camera or contact access they don't need. This kind of shared review teaches healthy skepticism and helps children recognize red flags later on.",
      "AI scams thrive on weak or reused passwords. Use a password manager to create and store strong, unique logins for each account.\u00a0Turn on\u00a0two-factor authentication (2FA) wherever possible so that even if a password is stolen, the account stays protected.\u00a0Let your kids see how you use these tools so they learn that security isn't complicated, it's just a habit.",
      "Many parents delay important online safety talks because they feel unprepared to explain AI, leaving kids curious but without the guidance they need to stay safe. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches.

      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "One of the best defenses is simple: encourage your child to pause and talk before reacting to anything unusual online. Whether it's a pop-up claiming a prize, a strange link in a chat or a voice message that sounds familiar, remind them it's always okay to ask you first. Quick conversations like these can prevent costly mistakes and turn learning moments into trust-building ones.",
      "Outdated software can leave gaps that scammers exploit. Regularly update operating systems, browsers and apps to close those holes. Add strong antivirus software. Explain to your child that updates and scans keep their favorite games and videos running safely, not just their parents happy.",
      "The best way to safeguard from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices.

      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Don't save these conversations for when something goes wrong. Bring them up casually during family time or when watching YouTube or gaming together. Treat digital safety like any other life skill, something practiced daily and improved with time. The more normal it feels, the more confident your child becomes when facing online risks.",
      "Talking about online safety early helps build trust and awareness before trouble starts.\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you are a parent, guardian or anyone helping a child use technology, this issue deserves your attention. Start talking early, even before your child begins exploring the web on their own. Teach them simple concepts like asking before clicking or sharing. Instead of relying only on parental controls, have ongoing conversations that help them recognize suspicious links, messages or pop-ups. Show them that cybersecurity isn't about fear but about awareness. Model strong digital habits at home by using unique passwords and turning on\u00a0two-factor authentication. Explain why those steps matter. When your child understands the reasoning behind the rules, they are more likely to follow them. Make technology part of your family routine rather than a private space your child navigates alone. Regularly check the apps they use and the people they interact with. Set clear expectations and age-appropriate boundaries that can grow with your child's experience. Staying engaged is the most powerful protection you can offer.",
      "CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The numbers from Bitwarden show a clear warning sign. Concern among parents is high, yet actual conversations about AI-powered scams remain rare. That silence gives scammers the upper hand. Children who learn about online safety early are more confident, more cautious and better equipped to handle unexpected messages or fake alerts. It only takes a few minutes of honest conversation to create awareness that lasts for years. By taking action now, you can close the gap between fear and understanding, protecting your family in a digital world that changes every day.",

      "The dream of personal flight has always felt just out of reach, until now. A company called AltoVolo has unveiled something that might make it real: the world's first eVTOL configurator.",
      "That might sound technical, but it's actually simple. \"eVTOL\" stands for electric vertical takeoff and landing. Think of a small, quiet aircraft that lifts off like a helicopter but flies forward like a plane, all powered by electric or hybrid engines instead of noisy fuel-burning ones.",
      "And a configurator? It's a tool that lets you design your own version online, choosing colors, materials and other personal details. Put the two together, and you've got something quite remarkable: the ability to design your own flying vehicle from your laptop.",

      "With AltoVolo\u2019s world-first online configurator, you can design every detail of your Sigma eVTOL. (AltoVolo)",
      "A new kind of personal aircraft",
      "AltoVolo's aircraft is called the Sigma, and it's unlike anything on the market. It's a three-seater hybrid-electric vehicle that combines quiet operation with long range. The Sigma can fly about 500 miles, reach speeds over 220 mph and is more than 80% quieter than a helicopter.",
      "That quietness isn't just about comfort; it's what makes urban air travel possible. Imagine small aircraft quietly taking off from rooftops or open fields, connecting cities and towns without the noise pollution we associate with helicopters today.",
      "Safety is built in, too. The Sigma can keep flying even if one of its small electric jet engines fails, and it carries a ballistic parachute for emergencies. It's compact and light, just under 16 feet wide and weighing a little over 2,100 pounds, making it easier to operate and store than you might expect.",
      "The Sigma is over 80% quieter than a helicopter combining sleek hybrid-electric power with quiet performance. (AltoVolo)",
      "From concept to customization",
      "The idea of customizing your own aircraft might sound futuristic, but AltoVolo's online configurator makes it surprisingly accessible.",
      "Like building your own car online, you can choose colors, seat materials, interior details and even the stitching on your seatbelts. Founder and CEO Will\u00a0Wood says the company's goal isn't to compete on price but on experience and technology.",
      "\"Much like you'd expect from a supercar brand, we're focused on performance and refinement,\" he explained.",
      "The first 100 Sigma models will be limited editions, offering special finishes and materials that won't appear on later production units.",
      "NASA'S 'QUIET' SUPERSONIC JET COMPLETES FIRST FLIGHT IN POTENTIAL BREAKTHROUGH FOR COMMERCIAL AIR TRAVEL",
      "Taking flight before you take off",
      "AltoVolo isn't stopping at online design. They've built a high-fidelity flight simulator that mirrors the Sigma's cockpit exactly, right down to its carbon fiber and soft leather interior.",
      "Customers can train in the simulator and even use those hours toward a pilot's license. The simulator gives them a chance to \"fly\" their customized Sigma before ever leaving the ground.",
      "And for everyone else? The company is sharing flight footage from its simulator on YouTube, so people can see how the Sigma handles in the air.",
      "\"For AltoVolo, opening our order book is a major milestone in bringing the Sigma to life,\" Wood tells CyberGuy. \"Having early customers make an initial financial commitment shows us real demand. In turn, we are able to raise capital to finalise the product, progress certification and prepare for production. Presenting the flight simulator has been a useful catalyst. Allowing customers to fly in a simulated environment really helps them realise how easy this type of aircraft will be to fly.\"",
      "An exclusive community for early Sigma owners shapes the future of personal air travel and sustainable innovation. (AltoVolo)",
      "Innovation you can feel",
      "One of the most interesting details about the Sigma is something you can't see: the sound inside the cabin. AltoVolo's engineers are working to reduce vibration and interior noise, creating a calm, smooth flight experience.",
      "At the same time, they're experimenting with a synthesized soundscape, a gentle background tone that changes with the aircraft's power use. It helps pilots sense how the vehicle is performing and adds a cinematic touch to the flying experience.",
      "It's part science, part art and a hint at how human-centered this design really is.",
      "Future pilots can train in a realistic Sigma cockpit simulator and even log hours toward a license. (AltoVolo)",
      "The path to certification",
      "The Sigma will benefit from new U.S. aviation rules called MOSAIC, which simplify the process for certifying small, advanced aircraft. This means the Sigma can be sold as a light sport aircraft, lowering costs for both the company and future pilots. Certification is also underway in Europe and the UK, which could make global operations possible in the next few years.",
      "Building a community around flight",
      "Buying a Sigma isn't just about owning an aircraft; it's about joining a new kind of community. AltoVolo wants Sigma owners to become collaborators, helping to shape the product and the future of urban flight. The company is also planning a global service and support network, including maintenance and training centers, to make ownership practical for people beyond traditional aviation circles.",
      "What this means to you",
      "For most of us, flying still means boarding a big plane at a crowded airport. But companies like AltoVolo are trying to change that. The Sigma represents a future where small, efficient aircraft could handle regional travel, connecting towns, suburbs and cities in new ways. It's the kind of innovation that could one day make air travel as personal as driving. And while it's still very early, AltoVolo's new configurator makes the dream of personal air travel feel a bit more real.",
      "Take my quiz: How safe is your online security?",
      "Think your devices and data are truly protected? Take this quick quiz to see where your digital habits stand. From passwords to Wi-Fi settings, you\u2019ll get a personalized breakdown of what you\u2019re doing right and what needs improvement. Take my Quiz here:\u00a0CyberGuy.com",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "AltoVolo's Sigma may not replace your car anytime soon, but it gives us a glimpse of what's coming: a world where flight is cleaner, quieter and designed around the individual. It's a preview of how the future of travel might not be on the road at all, but instead in the air.",

      "These cases involve instances of sex trafficking, labor trafficking and additional types of exploitation that may not be specified or remain unknown, according to the Hotline. In North Carolina, data indicates that in 2024, there were 145 reported cases of sex trafficking, 73 cases of labor trafficking and 38 cases of both sex and labor trafficking.",

      "North Carolina is ranked ninth in the country for human trafficking, according to data from the National Human Trafficking Hotline. (iStock)",
      "\"It really is kind of like a perfect storm,\" Arrowood told Fox News Digital. \"There are a lot of variables. One of the things that we have to know is that trafficking happens everywhere. It happens in every city and every town, whether you're rural [or in a] city \u2013 it really doesn't matter. But for Charlotte, one thing is that we have a lot of factors that attract demand.\"",
      "The eye-watering number of cases is best explained by North Carolina\u2019s sweeping interstate highway system, high demand for inexpensive labor throughout its agricultural industry and increased amount of gang activity, experts said.",
      "\"Part of the reason why Charlotte is such a huge trafficking hub is because of the highway system,\" Toby Braun, founder of American Special Investigative Group, told Fox News Digital. \"A lot of these traffickers are running victims and may start in South Florida. From South Florida, they go to Atlanta, and from Atlanta, they pass through Charlotte. Oftentimes there, they may put them in safe houses.\"",

      "According to Braun, victims will then be transported to other major cities throughout the country \u2013 like New York or Houston \u2013 after passing through Charlotte.",
      "\"Charlotte is kind of like a central hub, or an epicenter,\" Braun said. \"For the most part, it\u2019s kind of a pit stop.\"",
      "The number of Charlotte residents falling victim to trafficking can partially be attributed to the prevalence of gang activity within the city, with criminal organizations maintaining a firm grip on the area\u2019s network, according to experts.",
      "MORE THAN 30 CHILDREN RESCUED AMID TRAFFICKING OPERATION IN MAJOR US CITY AS EXPERT WARNS OF GROWING CRISIS",
      "\"The Bloods have a huge stronghold in human trafficking,\" Braun said. \"They're one of the primary organized crime groups responsible for trafficking [in Charlotte]. For the most part, these are criminal networks. And that also makes it tougher, because of the kind of resources that they have and the ability to traffic people around, hide them in places and really stay undetected.\"",
      "While many victims can be from out of state, Arrowood emphasizes that many of the individuals being trafficked are coming from within the Charlotte area, with perpetrators targeting school-aged children within the city.",
      "According to data from the Charlotte Metro Human Trafficking Task Force, 48% of trafficking cases in 2024 involved minors aged 15 or younger.",

      "\"We do see every ethnicity affected \u2013 every socioeconomic class,\" Arrowood said. \"The pathway or grooming might look different if someone has housing insecurity or food insecurity, versus living in a middle-to-upper class, two-parent home, right? The method might look different, the coercion might look different, but we do see it across the board.\"",
      "Of the reported cases, residence-based commercial sex and domestic work were the leading venues for sex and labor trafficking, respectively. Additionally, 214 victims were female, 63 were men, and four included gender minorities, according to the Hotline.",
      "CHARLOTTE TEEN ARRESTED 111 TIMES IN 2 YEARS STILL WALKING FREE IN SOFT-ON-CRIME BLUE CITY: POLICE",
      "In 2024, data provided by the task force revealed that authorities identified 106 minors within the Charlotte area who were confirmed or suspected victims of trafficking. The number is primarily attributed to criminals using newer, more creative methods to recruit their victims.",
      "\"The primary way is through online [platforms],\" Arrowood said. \"They are connecting in some way or somehow, whether it's through social media, a gaming app, [or] through a dating app. Then there usually is a meet in-person, right? We call it digital grooming. They're grooming them, building trust \u2013 a lot of times they're presenting as boyfriend, so [victims] are thinking they're in a relationship with this person.\"",
      "However, due to the nature of trafficking crimes, most cases go unreported.\u00a0Arrowood also points to a backlog of cases piling up for local law enforcement, who may not have the resources needed to fully investigate each case.",
      "\"Agencies are just always at limited capacity in terms of the amount of work, or the amount of people and manpower they have to manage the amount of referrals that are coming in,\" Arrowood told Fox News Digital.",

We've seen cases with coaches and people that you would never really expect, and I think that's what makes them dangerous \u2013 the fact that they can be individuals that are hiding in plain sight.\"",

      "In the years before Ted Kaczynski's name became synonymous with his title as the \"Unabomber,\" he was tapped for an intense psychological experiment that has left experts with questions regarding its potential impact on his nearly two-decade career as a notorious criminal.",
      "Kaczynski was just 16 years old when he enrolled at Harvard University in 1958, marking a significant milestone in the teenager\u2019s life. However, it was at the prestigious university where he was selected to partake in a three-year-long psychological study that may have changed the trajectory of his life.",
      "After investigators uncovered that Kaczynski was the mastermind behind a series of bombings that killed three people and injured 23, they focused their attention on the experiments conducted by psychologist Henry A. Murray on the impressionable teenager studying at Harvard, according to History.com.",

The group of Ivy Leaguers were tasked with writing a comprehensive essay detailing their own personal philosophies, beliefs and worldviews in the first portion of the study.",
      "However, the experiment quickly escalated.",
      "Once each student submitted their essay, they were wired to electrodes and seated in front of bright lights, according to History.com. Murray would then reportedly instruct his team to belittle each student's ideals, while subjecting them to what he described as \"vehement, sweeping, and personally abusive\" interrogations.",

So they got some measures \u2013 some hard measures \u2013 but evidently this was allowed over at Harvard and the way Murray played it, this was OK.\"",

      "In the time it takes to process thousands of tips and chase down leads, serial offenders can strike again.",
      "That's why forensic expert David Mittelman is arguing the rapid DNA breakthroughs in the Idaho murders and Rachel Morin cases have revealed a new tool for crimefighters \u2014 investigative genetic genealogy (IGG) research has become so fast and cheap that it could be the first thing investigators reach for, not their finishing touch.",
      "\"You should be reading the DNA the same way you're checking the video cameras,\" the Othram forensics lab founder told Fox News Digital. \"Because the very first question you have is, who is at the scene? So check the cameras nearby, check the DNA, and then start your investigation.\"",

      "The current trend in most active cases is for investigators to use DNA as a \"confirmatory tool,\" he said \u2014 a final step to make sure police have the right suspect. DNA and IGG research is more widely used in cold cases, he said. And that's something he hopes will change.",
      "\"So DNA goes from being the last step in the process as a confirmatory tool to the first step,\" Mittelman said. \"It's like checking the video feed, except that you're checking the DNA feed.\"",

      "In the Idaho student murders and the Maryland slaying of mom of five Rachel Morin, police with few leads turned to Othram for help conducting the IGG, which led them to now-convicted killers Bryan Kohberger and Victor Martinez-Hernandez.",
      "Traditional DNA testing compares a suspect's sample to a law enforcement database in search of a match, but not all criminals can be identified in this manner, especially if it's their first offense. IGG testing involves a blend of forensic science and the same methods used to trace a person's ancestry in order to track down an unknown suspect.",
      "\"When IGG becomes as common as fingerprint and digital forensics, it will ensure that other families don\u2019t have to endure the same pain as the Morins,\" said Randolph Rice, a Baltimore-area attorney who represented Morin's family. \"IGG should not be viewed as a last resort or a luxury; it should be a standard, front-line investigative tool.\"",
      "JONBEN\u00c9T RAMSEY'S FATHER BELIEVES CRUCIAL PROGRESS BEING MADE TO FIND DAUGHTER'S KILLER",

      "\"DNA testing identified him [Kohberger], in a month or in weeks, and the end-to-end cost for that DNA testing was under $10,000,\" Mittelman said. \"So you can't even pay the detective for a month for the amount of money it costs to solve that case.\"",

      "In the Morin case, Martinez-Hernandez was already an international fugitive and suspected killer connected to another sex assault in Los Angeles.",

      "A Massachusetts community is split on allowing two towering bronze statues of Catholic saints outside its new public safety building.",
      "In an interview with Fox News Digital, Joe Davis, senior counsel at the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, said Quincy, Massachusetts\u2019 plan to erect statues of St. Michael the Archangel and St. Florian reflects a centuries-old artistic and cultural tradition of honoring courage and sacrifice, not a violation of the Constitution\u2019s separation of church and state.",
      "\"This case is about a city trying to beautify a public space and honor those who put their lives on the line every day,\" Davis said. \"These are figures that are important to firefighters and police officers around the world. The purpose of these statues is to inspire and encourage the people who work there.\"",
      "Side-by-side view of two bronze statues commissioned for Quincy\u2019s new public safety building.

      "COLORADO SCHOOL ACCUSED OF PREVENTING STUDENT FROM DECORATING PERSONAL PARKING SPACE WITH BIBLE VERSE",
      "Background on the dispute",
      "The statues, each roughly 10 feet tall and costing a combined $850,000, were commissioned by Mayor Thomas P. Koch in 2023 and are slated to be installed on the fa\u00e7ade of Quincy\u2019s new Public Safety Building, a $150 million facility that will house the city\u2019s police and fire departments.",
      "The project has ignited months of heated debate across the south of Boston, with critics arguing that using taxpayer money to display Catholic imagery on government property violates both the Massachusetts Constitution and the First Amendment\u2019s establishment clause.",
      "In May 2025, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Massachusetts, joined by the Freedom From Religion Foundation and Americans United for Separation of Church and State, filed a lawsuit on behalf of 15 residents from a variety of faith traditions.",

      "\"Placing larger-than-life statues of Catholic saints in front of a public building unequivocally advances one religion to the exclusion of all others,\" the letter stated, noting that the imagery of St. Michael standing on a demon\u2019s neck was \"particularly abhorrent\" and \"reminiscent of brutal force.\"",

      "Davis: \u2018This is about honoring service, not promoting faith\u2019",
      "Davis rejected those claims, insisting that the city\u2019s intent is consistent with long-standing American traditions of civic art that carry religious associations.",
      "\"If we say that a symbol cannot be displayed in public just because it has religious associations for some, that\u2019s going to require us to take down quite a bit of public imagery across this country,\" Davis said. \"At the U.S. Supreme Court, there\u2019s a statue of Moses holding the Ten Commandments. It has religious meaning, yes, but it also symbolizes law and justice. The same is true here.\"",
      "Davis compared Quincy\u2019s statues to the Bladensburg Peace Cross, a World War I memorial in Maryland that the U.S. Supreme Court upheld in 2019 as constitutional.",
      "\"That cross honored the war dead. Quincy wants to honor firefighters and police officers,\" he said.",

      "The Becket Fund, which specializes in defending religious expression in public life, plans to appeal the injunction that has temporarily halted installation of the statues. Davis said the team hopes the case will clarify whether public symbols with religious origins can exist in civic spaces when used for secular or historical purposes.",
      "\"It could either go to the intermediate Massachusetts appeals court or straight to the Supreme Judicial Court, which is the high court of Massachusetts,\" Davis said. \"And that court is going to be asked to address an important question and to set an important precedent, which is whether public symbols can be scrubbed from the public square just because they have religious associations to some people. I don't think that's right. It would set a very dangerous precedent.\"",

The works are being sculpted in Italy by artist Sergey Eylanbekov, who also created public monuments of John Adams and John Hancock for the city.",
      "Critics say the mayor commissioned the project without public notice or City Council approval. According to the lawsuit reviewed by Fox News Digital, the first payments to the artist were made in 2023, but most city officials and residents did not learn of the plan until February 2025, when a local newspaper published renderings of the building showing the two saints flanking its entrance.",
      "A petition opposing the statues gathered more than 1,600 signatures, and an interfaith coalition of 19 clergy members from Catholic, Jewish, Unitarian and Protestant congregations issued a public statement warning that the display \"sends a message that there are insiders and outsiders in this community.\"",

      "Davis, however, said courts have long recognized that government displays can have mixed religious and secular meanings.",
      "\"It's very troubling to say that because some people might view something as religious, it therefore has to be taken down.

      "The original batch of documents released online is divided into seven large files roughly centered around the main Nazi criminals covered in them. There are multiple documents related to Adolf Eichmann, the engineer of the \"Final Solution,\" the plan for the extermination of European Jewry.

What happened to the U-boats loaded with Nazi gold brought to the country and given to the authorities?\" he asked.",
      "\"On the one hand, it is shameful that Argentina kept these documents a secret for so long, but on the other hand, we also need to acknowledge the enormous efforts being made by this government to make these documents public.

      "\"Jews after World War II lived a golden age of about 80 years where antisemitism had subsided, at least apparently, and they could be productive and contributing members of society. This has now ended \u2014 partially because of the genocide committed against Israelis by Hamas on Oct. 7, 2023, with world opinion projecting on Israelis and Jews the false role of perpetrators of genocide in the war in Gaza, but also by bringing back the same old antisemitic views that had been alive in Germany and before then,\" Lippman says.",

      "Powell, who stars in the new film \u201cThe Running Man,\u201d made his \u201cSNL\u201d hosting debut Nov. 15 alongside musical guest Olivia Dean.",
      "During his opening monologue, Powell recalled how he was supposed to host the late-night sketch comedy show four years ago to promote \u201cTop Gun: Maverick,\u201d but his plans were thwarted by a pushed release date for the film.",
      "\u201cWhen I got the call, I was on a porch with my family and we all just lost our minds,\u201d Powell explained. \u201cWe were jumping up and down celebrating, and a UPS driver happened to be delivering a package at that exact same moment and he was like, \u2018What is going on?\u2019\u201d",
      "Powell explained to the UPS driver that he had gotten the call to host \u201cSNL\u201d and told the driver to tune in for the Christmas episode that season.",
      "\u201cAnd so we all took a selfie with him, and this is the selfie to mark the occasion,\u201d Powell said, before showing a photo posing with the UPS driver as well as his parents and sisters. \u201cSo that\u2019s me and my whole family and the UPS driver.\u201d",
      "However, Powell said his \u201cdream got taken away\u201d after the \u201cTop Gun: Maverick\u201d release was delayed due to the pandemic, and \u201cSNL\u201d rescinded the offer for him to host.",
      "Powell joked that the show\u2019s creator and producer, Lorne Michaels, called him and told him that without \u201cTop Gun: Maverick,\u201d nobody \u201cwill know who the eff you are.\u201d",
      "\u201cSo, I didn\u2019t end up hosting, which means for four years, this UPS driver was just going around saying Glen Powell is a liar,\u201d Powell said. \u201cSo now, I am here hosting. It feels amazing. But what feels even better is proving to this UPS driver that I am not crazy.\u201d",
      "In a surprise twist, Powell then shared that his sisters, Lauren and Leslie, were able to track down the UPS driver, joking that the women in his family \u201care terrifying.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey found the cell number of this UPS guy, his name is Mitch,\u201d Powell said. \u201cSo to prove to Mitch that I am not a liar, I flew him all the way to New York \u2014 coach, I don\u2019t know how \u2018The Running Man\u2019 is going to do yet \u2014 but I flew him here, and he thought it was a scam, but he still came. And he is sitting in the audience tonight, so let\u2019s give it up for Mitch, the UPS guy.\u201d",
      "The camera panned to Mitch sitting in the audience as he gave a wave to the camera. Powell then invited Mitch onto the stage of Studio 8H to re-create that original selfie and \u201cbring this thing full circle.\u201d",
      "While this marked Powell\u2019s first time hosting the late-night sketch comedy show, the actor made two brief appearances in March 2024 during his \u201cAnyone But You\u201d co-star Sydney Sweeney\u2019s hosting debut.",
      "During her monologue, Sweeney called out the \u201ccraziest rumor\u201d she\u2019d heard about herself online, which was that she and Powell had an affair while they filmed the 2023 rom-com. Sweeney refuted the rumors and said her then-fianc\u00e9, Jonathan Davino, produced the movie and he was with the duo the entire time during filming.",
      "Sweeney added that Davino was in the audience to show his support. But the cameras cut to Powell smiling in the audience, leaving Sweeney to yell, \u201cThat\u2019s not my fianc\u00e9! He\u2019s in my dressing room!\u201d",
      "Powell also appeared during a sketch called \u201cLoud Table,\u201d which featured Sweeney on a date with her boyfriend, played by Andrew Dismukes. However, during the date, Sweeney confessed she cheated on him with her boss, played by none other than Powell."

      "Jessi Ngatikaura was happy to hear this reassurance from her husband but expressed her concerns.",
      "\"Throughout this whole separation, I've been in limbo of like really not knowing what I wanted and I'm still scared. My biggest fear is that we're going to move back in together and get back together and give it a chance and it's just going to go right back to how it was, and that's it's easy to just get comfortable and fall back into old patterns, you know? So I am really scared of that if I'm being honest,\" she said.",
      "Jordan Ngatikaura said he felt like he's had the opportunity to address \"traumas\" from his past and avoid falling back into old habits.",
      "\"Before all of this, I didn't know why you would act certain ways or treat me certain ways. You didn't know why I would pull away and avoid things,\" Jessi Ngatikaura said.",
      "She went on to explain that therapy taught her that her husband's \"aggression\" comes from childhood wounds and becoming a dad as a teenager.",
      "\"There's so much that I understand now about you. And not that it makes your behavior OK, but I understand it now and it's changing, which is the most important part,\" Jessi Ngatikaura said, adding that she's also made her own progress with being more emotionally available for her husband.",
      "In a confessional interview, Jessi Ngatikaura opened up about what therapy has taught her about herself.",
      "\"I've seen how being avoidant has hurt my relationships. And in our culture, there is a lot of pressure to have the perfect relationship, the perfect family and everything's great. And I think that it kind of taught me these patterns to go numb and avoid and pretend everything's OK,\" she said.",
      "\"And if I'm going to make the marriage work, I need to drop that and I'm willing to do that because Jordan has made so many changes. And I want to make sure that I'm doing the same thing.\""

      "Kim Kardashian said she had no room for error when it came to the California bar exam.",
      "In the latest episode of \"The Kardashians,\" which was filmed three months before Kardashian took the bar exam and failed, she explained why she needed to pass the test on the first try.",
      "The reality TV star said she spent about \"nine hours a day\" studying and was happy to wrap her Hulu show \"All's Fair\" so she could focus more on her studies.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m really just excited to have \u2018All\u2019s Fair\u2019 wrapped and behind me so that I can just dive right on into studying and make that my No. 1 focus,\" she said on Season 7, Episode 4, of the series.",
      "In a confessional, Kardashian admitted that she was feeling \"exhausted.\"",
      "When a producer asked her if she was \"nervous\" about taking the bar, she responded, yes.",
      "\u201cYeah! Absolutely. I\u2019m not ready yet,\" she said. \"You know, you feel like you don\u2019t know anything and then it all clicks and then you feel like you don\u2019t know it. It\u2019s just the craziest, most emotional roller coaster.\"",
      "\"I really do need to pass on the first try,\" Kardashian added. \"I don\u2019t have another few months I can give up.\"",
      "The State Bar of California released the results of its July 2025 exam on Nov. 7, announcing that 54.8% of exam takers passed. Just over 7,300 people took the test, 73.9% of which were first-time test takers. The pass rate for first-time takers was 69.7%, per the state bar.",
      "Kardashian\u2019s name was not included in the publicly available pass list.",
      "She spoke about failing the bar in a TikTok video that she filmed while getting ready for her mother's 70th birthday party. Kardashian told someone on the phone that fortune tellers had inaccurately predicted her future.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just letting you guys know that all of the f--king psychics that we have met with and that we\u2019re obsessed with are all f--king full of s--t,\" she said angrily. \u201cThey all collectively \u2014 maybe four of them have told me that I was going to pass the bar, so they\u2019re all full pathological liars. Don't believe anything they say.\"",
      "Last May, Kardashian completed her law program after six years of studying. Now that she's failed the bar, she'll have to re-take the test. The bar is given twice a year, in July and February."

    "story": [
      "Small business owners Jaclyn and Kevin Elbaum are always tickled pink when someone wears one of their beautiful pieces of jewelry. But they were enchanted to see one of the world's biggest stars sporting not one, but two special items from their collection last week.",
      "On Nov. 5, Taylor Swift was spotted wearing a stunning yellow gold diamond lock necklace and a diamond chain lariat during a date night with fianc\u00e9 Travis Kelce in New York City.",
      "Word quickly spread that the items came from the Elbaums\u2019 brand, Audry Rose, which the couple founded in 2015.",
      "\u201cIt felt like a top 10 life moment kind of thing,\u201d Kevin Elbaum tells TODAY.com in a joint interview with his wife, calling the experience \u201csurreal.\u201d",
      "The married couple first learned that Swift was a fan of their jewelry while they were sitting down to dinner with their family.",
      "\u201cOne of my friends, she just saw it and she calls me and was like, \u2018I think this is your necklace.\u2019 And so I open up Instagram and I zoom in and I was like, \u2018Oh my God, that is my necklace,\u2019\u201d Jaclyn Elbaum recalls.",
      "The mother of two's animated reaction initially concerned her husband.",
      "\"I wasn\u2019t sure if someone had died. I couldn\u2019t figure it out because her reaction was so insane that my heart sank,\" Kevin Elbaum says.",
      "He decided to film his wife's reaction and post it on Instagram. In the video, Jaclyn Elbaum holds back tears as she looks at the photo of Swift wearing the two necklaces.",
      "The couple was especially touched by Swift's selections. The \"Life of a Showgirl\" singer wore two pieces from their collection that hold special meaning to their family.",
      "Jaclyn Elbaum designed the Pave Diamond Lock Necklace around five years ago and says the piece is \u201creally close to my heart.\u201d",
      "Every part of the necklace is handmade, including the chain, which is named after the couple\u2019s daughter Sloan.",
      "\u201cShe couldn\u2019t have picked a more important piece to us,\u201d Kevin Elbaum adds.",
      "The lariat that Swift paired with the lock necklace also holds sentimental value: Jaclyn Elbaum designed it for her mother\u2019s 70th birthday.",
      "A Life-Changing Moment for a Small Business",
      "The Elbaums are the latest small business owners to experience the \"Taylor Swift effect,\" referring to the singer's cultural and economic influence. Other examples include the NFL's increase in female viewership after Swift started dating Kelce and jewelry designer Kindred Lubeck's explosion in social media followers after Kelce proposed with one of her rings.",
      "Even in their wildest dreams, the Elbaums had never imagined something like this could happen to their small business.",
      "\"We don\u2019t have a publicist or anything. We hadn\u2019t tried to get it to her, so we really were completely blindsided that this could even happen. We assumed the only way it could happen was if you got it to her stylist or something,\u201d Kevin Elbaum says.",
      "Ever since the photo of Swift wearing their jewelry went viral, the Elbaums have noticed an uptick in traffic to their brand\u2019s website and more people purchasing the $7,800 lock necklace.",
      "They\u2019ve since added a sterling silver version of the lock necklace that retails for $890.",
      "The Elbaums say they're incredibly grateful for Swift's support of small businesses.",
      "\"We would have paid her to have the necklace. This is clearly a passion project for her to just sprinkle the Taylor aura around to businesses she likes, so it\u2019s really special,\" Kevin Elbaum says.",
      "Jaclyn Elbaum adds that Swift \"clearly cares about the craft and how things are made.\"",
      "After seeing the photo of Swift wearing items from their brand, the Elbaums emailed the singer's team to express their gratitude.",
      "\"I appreciate what she does to all small businesses, not just ours. It's really a special thing to see,\" Jaclyn Elbaum says.",
      "A Launchpad for a 'New Phase'",
      "The Elbaums started Audry Rose in 2015 shortly after Jaclyn Elbaum's grandmother, the brand's namesake, passed away.",
      "\"She started in the clothing industry and was entrepreneurial before that was really a thing for women. She was really ahead of her time and I always looked up to her. She was always a role model for me. Quality of things was always very important to her, so we wanted that to be infused into the brand,\" Jaclyn Elbaum says.",
      "Before the launch of their brand, Kevin Elbaum specialized in customer acquisition while Jaclyn Elbaum worked in the fashion industry.",
      "\u201cI always really wanted to do something with her, and it was just getting her over her fear to jump with me,\u201d Kevin Elbaum says.",
      "The Elbaums say it'll be a long time before they're able to shake off the feeling of seeing Swift wearing one of their designs.",
      "Looking ahead, the couple hopes this is simply the beginning of a new phase for their brand.",
      "\"I want everyone to know quality for us is really important and I hope other people trust our brand like she did,\" Jaclyn Elbaum says. \"We\u2019re just really excited to keep going, keep designing, keep growing.\"",
      "This moment will certainly be hard to beat, but the Elbaums are excited to see what's next.",
      "\"We're just kind of trying to keep moving forward and hoping for some other special moment in the next 10 years,\" Kevin Elbaum says."

      "\u201cPalm Royale\u201d Season 1 ended with a bang and started with one as well.",
      "The finale of the Apple TV+ show ended with Ricky Martin\u2019s character, Robert, accidentally getting shot by Mary (Julia Duffy) after she attempted to assassinate President Nixon. The final scene showed Robert, who was pretending to be Astronaut Grant, bleeding on the floor.",
      "With Season 2 of \u201cPalm Royale\u201d premiering Nov. 12, fans are curious to know: Is Robert dead?",
      "\u201cWell, we\u2019re not saying he (dies),\u201d creator Abe Sylvia previously told TODAY.com following the 2024 finale. \u201cThis is a classic soap opera cliffhanger.\u201d",
      "The showrunner also noted that if people looked closer, he was still breathing. But did Robert survive?",
      "Season 2 begins with a major musical production. Maxine Dellacorte (Kristen Wiig) returns to the Palm Royale and orders a drink, but instead of her signature cocktail, a grasshopper, she gets served a martini.",
      "When she asks the waiter where Robert is, he says he's getting ready for \u201chis big number.\u201d Confused, she enters the ballroom and to her surprise Robert, in a snazzy and bedazzled tuxedo, starts singing \u201cComin\u2019 Home Baby,\u201d complete with dancers and backup singers.",
      "It becomes a whole production when Maxine, in a bright yellow two-piece ensemble, gets on the table and starts to perform her own dance routine. The performance, Sylvia tells TODAY, is the \u201cmusical number of my dreams.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe wanted to start with a bang. I\u2019m such a huge fan of movie musicals. I started as a dancer myself, and so I brought a whole book full of inspirations to the designers and brought in the choreographer,\u201d Sylvia says. \u201cIt\u2019s a mash up of a lot of my personal influences, and I was just so grateful that everybody brought their A-game and that we were able to make the musical number of my dreams.\u201d",
      "Shot in one day from beginning to end in a single take, he says, the dancers rehearsed for about three days while the costumes took weeks. They also built the set from scratch.",
      "However, as the performance continues, Robert is shot and begins to bleed. Maxine, still on top of the table, is dragged away from Robert as flashbacks of the Season 1 finale when he was shot appear on screen. The musical number continues and ends with Robert on the floor.",
      "It turns out Maxine was hallucinating and admitted into mental institute Sunny Tides. They have drugged her and she keeps asking for Robert.",
      "Robert is then seen unconscious in a hospital bed with Norma (Carol Burnett) by his side asking how he knew her name. Robert appears to be alive, for now.",
      "As viewers recall, Robert discovered that Norma was really Agnes and stole her identity. This was after Norma asked Robert to marry her so that he could inherit all her wealth.",
      "In the second season's first episode, Norma begins to put the pieces together.",
      "But will Robert survive and be a threat to Norma?",
      "In one scene, Maxine escapes Sunny Tides and visits Robert at the hospital. She hides underneath the hospital bed as Norma walks in and the doctor tells her that Robert is \u201ctouch and go,\u201d leaning on go. If he does wake up, the doctor says, his speech will be their first sign of hope and from there they will assess for any brain damage.",
      "After the doctor leaves, Norma talks to an unconscious Robert and tells him, \u201cI know who told you about Agnes.\u201d",
      "By the end of the episode, Robert opens his eyes and simply says, \u201cAgnes.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s so funny because I read the last episode last season and I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh, am I dying?\u2019 and then Abe told me, \u2018Oh, Ricky, I\u2019m sorry I forgot to tell you, you\u2019re not going to die,\u2019\u201d Martin tells TODAY.com. \u201cBut I am open to anything.\u201d",
      "Kristen Wiig adds that \u201cit\u2019s been hard to keep\u201d Robert\u2019s fate a secret, \u201cbecause people have seen photos. So it\u2019s been really hard for us to be like, \u2018Is he a ghost?\u2019\u201d",
      "But as viewers know, if anyone gets in Norma's way, their future could be up in the air.",

Even though the show is ostensibly a comedy, we want people on the edge of their seat and have this element of thriller to it,\u201d he adds. \u201cAnd as you make your way through the season, that just keeps building and building and building.\u201d",
      "As for Martin and Wiig, they joke that \u201ca fake death every season\u201d would be \u201cfunny.\u201d",

      "As of Friday evening, Trump has not signed off on strikes on land, but that could change, the officials said. The military options are ready for him, and the U.S. has assets in the region now, so if he decides to move forward with strikes, they can begin quickly, the officials said.",

      "Playtime is canceled for 69 schools in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) on Monday morning thanks to a colorful but potentially risky batch of sand.",
      "Kmart and Target issued product recalls Saturday after samples of a widely used play sand were found to have traces of asbestos, forcing the schools to close, the state government said Sunday.",
      "Inspections are underway and could \u201ctake days,\u201d ACT Education Minister Yvette Berry wrote in a post on Facebook, adding that testing so far had come back \u201cnegative to airborne asbestos\u201d from all schools. People who have been in contact with the sand do not require a clinical assessment, health officials say.",
      "The Australian Competition & Consumer Commission (ACCC) said there was a low risk that the asbestos could become airborne or fine enough for inhalation.",
      "The recall follows a similar sand scare last week, sparking fears the playground drama is far from over.",
      "Several schools and preschools in the region were fully or partially closed on Friday after a warning over asbestos risks in children\u2019s sand sold by Officeworks, before the further product recalls were issued.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, these sand products are even more widely used in our schools than the Officeworks products,\u201d said Berry, adding that State Emergency Service volunteers and school staff spent their weekends walking through buildings and \u201cmapping all coloured sand they see.\u201d",
      "The government is \u201crequired to eliminate risk as much as reasonably practicable,\u201d she continued.",
      "Exposure to asbestos, once widely used in building materials, is known to cause lung cancer, mesothelioma and other cancers, and it is linked to more than 40,000 deaths in the U.S. each year.",
      "Australian law prohibits the import or export of asbestos or goods containing asbestos. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in 2024 announced a comprehensive ban on the mineral."

      "LONDON \u2014 A flap of outrage is brewing over the fate of 15 residents of a cramped central London building, who critics say live out their lives indoors with no daylight, fresh air or adequately deep water.",
      "The gentoo penguins are one of the star attractions at the Sea Life London Aquarium, in one of the city\u2019s most popular tourist hot spots, across the river from the British Parliament and nestled between a \u201cShrek\u201d-themed experience and the popular London Eye landmark.",
      "British lawmakers this week joined campaigners in voicing mounting concerns for their 15 feathered neighbors, calling for government intervention over what they say is \u201cun-British\u201d treatment.",
      "The company that owns the aquarium says its penguin enclosure meets the standards of modern zoo practice set by the government.",
      "Visitors file past sharks, turtles and tropical fish in big tanks to reach the penguins, housed in a noticeably colder exhibit, built of rocks and artificial snow cliffs that hover over a pool of water.",
      "There, the 10 females and five males appear to spend their time mostly bobbing, jumping and swooshing through the water while visitors look on, children squealing with excitement while adults whip out their phones to take pictures.",
      "Most people filing by Thursday, largely families with children, told NBC News they were not aware of the brewing controversy.",
      "Shivani Gupta, visiting from Canada, said the conditions in the enclosure \u201cdid not seem right,\u201d although she added she would have still visited the aquarium as she has never seen penguins before.",
      "Chelsea Gibbons, 25, on vacation from Massachusetts, said she was not aware of the concerns raised by the campaigners, but noted there was no access to the outdoors for the penguins and the pool area appeared \u201ca bit small,\u201d although there is an additional area for the penguins to waddle around. Had she known about the efforts to free the birds ahead of time, Gibbon said, she would not have come. \u201cThe aquarium is saying it\u2019s meeting the standards, but we can always improve those standards,\u201d she added.",
      "Dozens of British lawmakers have signed an open letter to Environment Secretary Emma Reynolds asking her to \u201cconsider whether the penguins should be relocated to a more suitable facility better aligned with their behavioral, ecological and physiological needs,\u201d according to British media reports.",
      "David Taylor, a member of Parliament with the ruling Labour Party, has been spearheading the campaign, posting on X that \u201cabusing animals for money is un-British.\u201d",
      "The largest populations of gentoo penguins are found in the Falkland Islands and the South Georgia Islands in the South Atlantic, and on the Antarctic Peninsula, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature.",
      "Rory Wilson, a professor of aquatic biology at Swansea University in the United Kingdom, told NBC News that in the wild, gentoo penguins routinely dive up to more than 160 feet deep.",
      "\u201cI know that the official guidelines for captive penguins is that they need at least 4 feet of water depth, which I don\u2019t know who thought of that. It clearly wasn\u2019t someone who thought much about penguins,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are monstrously efficient, wonderful swimmers. They are one of the fastest penguins, most athletic, and therefore any condition that they are being kept in captivity, which constrains their ability to move themselves, is obviously of concern,\u201d he said.",
      "As far as fresh air and daylight are concerned, Wilson said, some subspecies of gentoo could struggle to survive outside in the U.K. due to a risk of fungal infections.",
      "Freedom for Animals, a U.K. charity that opposes the captivity of animals in \u201czoos, aquariums, mobile zoos and circuses,\u201d launched a campaign to free the penguins in February 2024, but the movement has picked up steam with a protest held outside the facility last month and the intervention from MPs.",
      "A petition started by the charity has garnered more than 40,000 signatures and asks theme park operator Merlin Entertainments, which owns the aquarium, to guarantee the \u201csafe and permanent retirement of the penguins\u201d to a facility that can provide \u201ca much more suitable environment.\u201d",
      "In a statement to NBC News, Merlin Entertainments said the penguin enclosure is located on the ground floor of the aquarium, not the basement, and was \u201ccarefully designed to reflect important elements of the penguins\u2019 natural environment as closely as possible to ensure good health, including climate-controlled temperature and filtered fresh air.\u201d",
      "The company also said the enclosure has technology that creates appropriate seasonal lighting, reflecting changing seasons. The penguin colony is regularly inspected by independent veterinarians, and local and national authorities, it added.",
      "\u201cThis is a complex issue,\u201d its statement said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to consider, and we take every decision seriously, always guided by what\u2019s best for the animals. We\u2019re open. We\u2019re listening. And we\u2019ve always done what\u2019s right for our animals based on expert advice and their individual needs. That\u2019s a commitment we stand by.\u201d"

      "China, which claims the self-ruling island democracy as its territory and has not ruled out the use of force against it, has demanded that Takaichi retract her \u201cegregious\u201d remarks.",
      "Others have gone further: One prominent Chinese commentator called Takaichi an \u201cevil witch,\u201d while a Chinese diplomat in Japan talked about cutting off the \u201cdirty neck\u201d extending itself into what Beijing considers an internal matter.",
      "Both countries have summoned each other\u2019s ambassadors as the saga enters its second week, and on Friday China advised its citizens to avoid travelling to Japan, citing \"significant risks\" to their personal safety.",
      "The war of words underscores the complicated relationship between China and Japan, which are major trading partners but have modern territorial disputes as well as lasting historical tensions over Japan\u2019s World War II-era occupation of China.",
      "It was only two weeks ago that Takaichi, who last month became Japan\u2019s first female prime minister, met with Chinese leader Xi Jinping on the sidelines of a regional summit in South Korea, during which they agreed to pursue stable ties.",
      "Like its ally the United States, Japan has traditionally been vague as to how far it would go to protect Taiwan \u2014 which at its closest point is about 70 miles from Japanese territory \u2014 against Chinese military aggression.",
      "But Takaichi, a China hard-liner who has long advocated for Taiwan, told lawmakers last week that Chinese use of force around Taiwan could qualify as \u201can existential threat,\u201d triggering a military response.",
      "Though former Japanese leaders \u2014 including Takaichi\u2019s mentor, the late Shinzo Abe \u2014 have made similar comments about military action after leaving office, \u201cit\u2019s breaking new ground for a sitting prime minister to state this,\u201d Jeff Kingston, a professor of Asian studies and history at Temple University\u2019s Japan campus, told NBC News.",
      "The reaction from China was strong and swift, with one comment in particular getting the most attention.",
      "\u201cThe dirty neck that sticks itself in must be cut off,\u201d Xue Jian, the Chinese consul general in the Japanese city of Osaka, said in a post on X that has since been deleted.",
      "The Japanese government says it continues to favor a peaceful resolution of the Taiwan issue and has criticized Xue\u2019s \u201chighly inappropriate\u201d remarks, which some interpreted as a death threat against Takaichi.",
      "The U.S. ambassador to Japan, George Glass, has also weighed in on Xue\u2019s comments. \u201cTime for Beijing to behave like the \u2018good neighbor\u2019 it talks repeatedly about \u2014 but fails repeatedly to become,\u201d he said in a post on X.",
      "On Friday, Tokyo summoned the Chinese ambassador to Japan, Wu Jianghao, to lodge a protest over Xue\u2019s post.",
      "China said later Friday that Wu had himself \u201csummoned Japan\u2019s Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs, Takehiro Funakoshi, to lodge solemn representations\u201d and assail Takaichi for failing to retract her comments, which it said \u201cviolated basic common sense, crossed China\u2019s red line, constituted a military threat, and amounted to war-mongering.\u201d",
      "A day earlier, Beijing summoned the Japanese ambassador, Kenji Kanasugi, to warn him over Taiwan.",
      "The Chinese Ministry of National Defense also issued a warning on Friday, saying that Japan would \u201cinevitably crash against the steel wall\u201d of the Chinese military if it intervenes in the Taiwan Strait, \u201cpaying a bitter and heavy price.\u201d",
      "Takaichi has also been excoriated in Chinese state media. A Friday editorial in the People\u2019s Daily newspaper said the Taiwan remarks by Takaichi, who has vowed to increase defense spending and favors revising Japan\u2019s pacifist constitution, were \u201caimed at finding an excuse for Japan\u2019s military expansion.\u201d",
      "Hu Xijin, a Chinese nationalist commentator, said Takaichi was an \u201cevil witch\u201d who had \u201csuccessfully ignited a new explosion of mutual hatred between Chinese and Japanese public opinion.\u201d",
      "Taiwan, which was ruled by China\u2019s Qing dynasty from 1683 to 1895 and by Japan from 1895 to 1945, has emphasized its sovereignty and noted Beijing\u2019s escalating military activity in the Taiwan Strait.",

      "China\u2019s harsh response will only \u201cenhance her reputation\u201d among conservatives in Japan, Kingston said. It could also give her a boost with President Donald Trump, who seemingly hit it off with Takaichi during his visit to Japan last month.",
      "\u201cTaking a hard line on China doesn\u2019t really hurt her in terms of bilateral relations with the United States,\u201d Kingston said.",
      "Because China is so sensitive to the issue of Taiwan, which it describes as its \u201ccore of core interests,\u201d its rebuke of Takaichi\u2019s comments is also unsurprising, said Richard McGregor, senior fellow for East Asia at the Lowy Institute, a foreign policy think tank in Australia.",

      "Every day this week, Zhu has been showing up to the empty venue he had booked for the film festival as a form of protest.",
      "\u201cIt was not the film festival that I prepared for,\u201d the filmmaker told NBC News on Friday morning.",
      "In a statement ahead of the film festival\u2019s cancellation, the organizer said he received messages saying that filmmakers, directors and producers from China set to participate in the event, as well as their relatives, were facing harassment.",
      "Many participants who pulled out of the independent film festival did not say why or cited \u201cpersonal reasons,\u201d but a few said they or their family members had been told to do so by Chinese authorities, according to Zhu.",
      "\u201cI hope this announcement of the cancellation of IndieChina Film Festival will make certain unknown forces stop harassing all the directors, guests, former staff, volunteers and my friends and family,\u201d Zhu said in a statement on the festival\u2019s website.",
      "By the time Zhu suspended the film festival, it was too late for him to cancel the venue he had booked. Throughout the week, he has gone to the event space \u2014 sometimes by himself or with a handful of other filmmakers \u2014 to watch some films and discuss them.",
      "\u201cI am still a filmmaker. I\u2019m still a filmmaker from China and I\u2019m still an independent film curator,\u201d Zhu said, adding that independent filmmaking in China \u201cis really difficult; it is extremely different from before.\u201d",
      "Before moving to New York City a decade ago, Zhu had worked on independent film festivals in China for nearly 20 years and co-founded the Beijing Independent Film Festival.",
      "But independent film festivals in China began facing increasing crackdowns after Chinese President Xi Jinping, known for his stringent ideological control, stepped into power in 2012, according to Human Rights Watch. The nongovernmental organization investigating human rights abuses around the world has said that Chinese authorities have shut down all three major independent film festivals in China, including Zhu\u2019s Beijing Independent Film Festival.",
      "\u201cEventually, all of my film festivals were banned, none of them could continue,\u201d Zhu said.",
      "Following what happened to his film festival in Beijing, Zhu had been rethinking how to host a film festival focused on Chinese independent films that could avoid censorship \u2014 the New York City event was the first attempt at that.",
      "\u201cThe Chinese government reached around the globe to shut down a film festival in New York City,\u201d Yalkun Uluyol, China researcher at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement. \u201cThis latest act of transnational repression demonstrates the Chinese government\u2019s aim to control what the world sees and learns about China.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "KYIV, Ukraine \u2014 As explosions boomed and smoke blanketed Ukraine\u2019s capital early Friday, it was the same old fear for Nadiia Chakrygina.",
      "Like clockwork, she got her three children \u2014 Tymur, 13, Elina, 9, and 9-month-old Diana \u2014 out of bed and into a basement, where they waited, some asleep, some awake, for the strikes to be over.",
      "\u201cWhy do our children deserve this,\u201d Chakrygina, 34, told NBC News in a telephone interview. \u201cWhy are they living under strikes? Why can\u2019t they get proper sleep and go to school? There is anger about everything.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s a routine millions of Ukrainians have been begrudgingly following since Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his invasion almost four years ago, and the nearly nightly barrages of Ukrainian cities that have followed.",
      "As Chakrygina and her family emerged from their shelter, they learned at least four people were killed and another 29 injured in the massive attack, which authorities said had damaged residential buildings in the Ukrainian capital.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who has been pushing for an end to the war, took to X shortly afterward to call it a \u201cwicked attack.\u201d",
      "But with peace negotiations effectively stalled and Russian troops pushing deeper into eastern Ukraine, there is little end in sight.",
      "Chakrygina, who used to work as a pension fund clerk before she had her three children, said she moved to Kyiv from the town of Vuhledar in the eastern Donetsk region shortly after the war started in February 2022.",
      "Vuhledar, which has been obliterated by years of fighting, was captured by Russian forces last October as part of Putin\u2019s wider push to recapture the entire Donbass region, which is made up of  Donetsk and the neighboring region of Luhansk.",
      "While their progress has been slow, earlier this week Russian forces appeared to be advancing on the city of Pokrovsk, a key logistics hub seen as a gateway to the broader region, which sits around 35 miles north of Vuhledar.",
      "Back in Kyiv, business manager Maryna Davydovska said she could feel the air \u201cshake\u201d around her as powerful and loud explosions interrupted the night, forcing her family to go to an underground shelter.",
      "\u201cI feel numb inside,\u201d Davydovska, 36, said in an interview on WhatsApp messenger after the attack. \u201cIt\u2019s too much pain we are carrying every day, and it feels like it will not be over, never. I am not angry or fed up, I am desperate.\u201d",
      "Russia has been pummeling Ukraine with near-daily drone and missile strikes, killing and wounding civilians.",
      "The Russian Defense Ministry said Friday that forces targeted Ukraine\u2019s \u201cmilitary-industrial complex and energy infrastructure\u201d with \u201chigh-precision long-range weapons.\u201d It made no mention of civilian sites hit.",
      "The Kremlin has repeatedly said its only targets are linked to Kyiv\u2019s war effort, but it has relentlessly targeted Ukraine's energy sector in a bid to plunge the country into the cold and dark ahead of winter.",
      "\u201cWe are used to everything. The strikes come, we get scared but life continues,\u201d Chakrygina said, reciting the motto that gets her through the relentless attacks.",
      "But while civilians simply try to survive, there was public anger this week after Ukraine\u2019s justice minister was suspended Wednesday in an investigation into an alleged $100 million kickback scheme in the country\u2019s energy sector.",
      "German Galushchenko was removed from office after anti-corruption authorities said they exposed a scheme which allegedly saw current and former officials, and businesspeople  receive benefits and launder money through the country\u2019s state energy company, Energoatom, authorities said.",
      "Five people have been arrested and another seven were placed under suspicion, according to a statement Tuesday from Ukraine\u2019s National Anticorruption Bureau, the NABU, and Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor\u2019s Office, SAPO.",
      "Zelenskyy said in a statement on Telegram on Wednesday that those involved \u201ccannot remain in their positions,\u201d adding: \u201cThis is a matter of trust in particular. If there are accusations, they must be answered.\u201d",
      "Davydovska called the scandal \u201cdemotivating,\u201d although she said   she was encouraged that the corruption was uncovered and investigated.",
      "\u201cWe have a joke \u2014 Ukraine is the richest country: no matter how much is stolen, there is still money here,\u201d she said. But on a more serious note, she added that Ukrainians had been fundraising for the army for the last four years, \u201cwhile some bastards are doing such things.\u201d",
      "Chakrygina meanwhile, said she was hopeful that peace can be reached. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe anymore in Vuhledar, in our [Donetsk] region, because Vuhledar has been erased from the face of the Earth. But we want to at least live here [in Kyiv],\u201d she said.",
      "It\u2019s her three children that keep her going every day, she said. \u201cThey need their future. They need to live without war,\u201d she added.",
      "Daryna Mayer reported from Kyiv. Yuliya Talmazan from London."

      "The attacks have taken place near populated areas, primarily in the mountainous north, occurring near supermarkets, bus stations, schools and even a hot springs resort.",
      "The embassy noted the closure of Maruyama Park in the northern city of Sapporo, which is adjacent to the U.S. Consulate General, and was shuttered for two weeks on Tuesday after a brown bear was sighted there on a number of occasions.",

      "Experts believe the bear population is growing because they have more habitat as people move to cities from rural areas. Climate change has also been cited as a factor because of its effect on food supply and hibernation patterns.",
      "Japan is home to two main types of bears, including the Asiatic black bear and the Hokkaido brown bear.",
      "It is uncommon for the U.S. to issue wildlife alerts in a foreign country. Japan currently has a Level 1 travel advisory, the least serious on a four point scale, indicating that travelers should \u201cexercise normal precautions.\u201d"

      "BOGOTA, Colombia \u2014 Intelligence \u201cis not for killing,\u201d Colombian President Gustavo Petro told NBC News in a wide-ranging interview Wednesday, explaining his decision to stop sharing information with the United States in opposition to lethal strikes on boats allegedly carrying illegal drugs.",
      "Describing President Donald Trump as a \u201cbarbarian\u201d who \u201cwants to frighten us,\u201d Petro, a former Marxist revolutionary and one of the few international leaders willing to openly criticize his American counterpart, called the U.S. military buildup in the Caribbean \u201cundoubtedly an aggression against Latin America.\u201d",
      "Colombia would not \u201cpass on the information because we would be collaborating with a crime against humanity,\u201d he told NBC News at the presidential palace in Bogota, reiterating a decision announced earlier this week.",
      "Acknowledging \u201cthe most key thing is intelligence\u201d in combating the drug trade, he added, \u201cThe more we coordinate intelligence, the better. That is what I have been doing. But intelligence is not for killing.\u201d",
      "Tensions have risen dramatically between Trump and Petro in recent weeks over the issue of American military attacks against boats allegedly carrying illegal narcotics in the Caribbean and the eastern Pacific, which have killed dozens. At least 19 strikes have been carried out so far, according to Reuters.",
      "Trump has justified them by saying the United States is in \u201carmed conflict\u201d with drug cartels and claiming the boats are operated by foreign terror organizations that are flooding America\u2019s cities with drugs.",
      "But his administration has provided no evidence for these assertions and lawmakers, including Republicans, have pressed for more information on who is being targeted and the legal justification for the strikes.",
      "A White House official said in an email Thursday that it was \u201chardly surprising\u201d that Petro was opposed to Trump\u2019s \u201csuccessful operations to halt the flow of drugs to our country.\u201d They added that Trump had directed the actions \u201cconsistent with his responsibility to protect Americans and United States interests abroad and in furtherance of United States national security and foreign policy interests.\u201d",
      "\u201cDespite billions of U.S. taxpayer dollars invested in Colombia\u2019s counterdrug efforts, cartels are thriving under Petro\u2019s failed policies,\u201d they said.",

      "After Petro called a U.S. strike \u201cmurder\u201d in a post on X, Trump said he would cut aid and raise tariffs on Colombia. The Treasury Department subsequently hit his Colombian counterpart and members of his family with sanctions.",
      "Petro then announced this week that he was suspending intelligence sharing with Washington.",
      "The United Kingdom has also stopped sharing intelligence because of concerns about the legality of U.S. strikes, two sources with knowledge of the matter told NBC News.",
      "And French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot also said at the start of a a Group of Seven foreign ministers meeting in Canada on Tuesday that the strikes \u201cviolate international law\u201d and were concerning for France\u2019s territories in the region.",
      "Petro did not say definitively that the boats that have been recently attacked were not carrying drugs. \u201cMaybe or maybe not. We do not know,\u201d he said. \u201cAccording to due process, the civilized treatment of people, they \u200bshould be seized and detained.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey are poor boatmen, they know how to drive a boat, they are hired in their poverty by the gangsters. But gangsters don\u2019t sit on the boats,\u201d he said. \u201cThen when one of those missiles arrives [it] kills that boatman. It doesn\u2019t kill the drug trafficker.\u201d",
      "His government, he said, \u201chas seized more cocaine than any other government in world history. Trump\u2019s insult is at odds reality, how can he call the largest destroyer of cocaine a chief trafficker?\u201d",
      "Petro strongly denied Trump\u2019s personal accusations, calling the president \"lost\" and suggesting that he was being misled by other U.S. officials on the issue. \u201cHe is lost on the issue of the real analysis of what is going on with cocaine in Colombia.\u201d",
      "Petro, who considers himself a left-wing revolutionary, added, \u201cHe is a barbarian, but anyone can change.\u201d",
      "The Colombian president is not the only leader in the region feeling pressure. Trump has also singled out the president of neighboring Venezuela, Nicolas Maduro, as a target for his ire and leveled accusations of complicity in the drug trade against him, too.",

      "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 All five members of the K-pop girl group NewJeans say they plan to return to their record label after losing a long-running legal battle to leave over what they said was mistreatment and harassment.",
      "The band, one of the top-selling acts in the world, announced its intention to return to the label, Ador, in separate statements on Wednesday, with Haerin and Hyein confirming their decision first, followed by the other three members, Danielle, Minji and Hanni, according to South Korean news agency Yonhap.",
      "Last year, NewJeans unilaterally announced a split from Ador, citing the agency\u2019s alleged failure to protect its members following the dismissal of Min Hee-jin, the former chief executive of Ador and the group\u2019s mentor. Ador denied the allegations.",
      "Last month, a South Korean court rejected NewJeans\u2019 argument, ruling that its exclusive contract with Ador remains valid as Min being CEO is not necessarily part of Ador\u2019s contractual obligations.",
      "Ador, which is based in Seoul, confirmed the return of Haerin and Hyein and said it was checking on the return of the other three members.",
      "\u201cAdor is committed to providing its full support to Haerin and Hyein to ensure the seamless continuation of their artistic endeavors,\u201d the label said in a statement. \u201cWe request the warm support from the fans and respectfully urge you to avoid engaging in unfounded speculation regarding the members.\u201d",
      "Shortly after Ador\u2019s announcement, the remaining three members, Danielle, Minji and Hanni, said they were also returning to the label after \u201cprudent consultations,\u201d Yonhap reported.",
      "\u201cOne member is currently in Antarctica, and thus our stance was delivered late,\u201d they said in a statement. \u201cAs Ador is currently not responding, we are notifying it individually.\u201d",
      "In March, NewJeans announced a pause on all independent activities under its new name \u201cNJZ\u201d during a concert in Hong Kong, to the surprise of global fans and supporters. The announcement came after a ruling by a Seoul court in favor of Ador, which had filed an injunction against the group\u2019s independent activities.",
      "The group said it did not regret the choice to break from Ador \u201cat all\u201d and that they had to \u201cspeak up to protect the values\u201d they believe in.",
      "After the court ruling in late October that upheld NewJeans\u2019 exclusive contract with Ador, the members said they planned to appeal \u201cimmediately.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt is impossible to return to Ador and continue normal entertainment activities under the current circumstances, where trust between the parties has completely broken down,\u201d the group said.",
      "NewJeans, which debuted in 2022, is known for songs combining pop and R&B music. Billboard named it \u201cone of the most recognized and most influential groups in pop\u201d in 2023.",
      "It also broke the Guinness World Record for the fastest K-pop act to reach 1 billion streams on Spotify, surpassing K-pop veterans BTS and Blackpink."

    "published": "Wed, 12 Nov 2025 20:52:44 GMT",
    "summary": "A flu strain that emerged over the summer is causing outbreaks in other countries. The CDC hasn't provided any insights on what's happening in the U.S. in weeks.",
    "story": [
      "As flu season gets underway, global health experts are increasingly worried about a new strain of the virus that popped up in June \u2014 four months after the makeup of this year\u2019s flu shots had been decided.",
      "The new strain, a version of H3N2, is causing outbreaks in Canada and the U.K., where health officials are warning about the early wave that\u2019s sending people to the hospital.",
      "\u201cSince it emerged, it\u2019s rapidly spreading and predominating in some countries so far in the Northern Hemisphere,\u201d Dr. Wenqing Zhang, head of the World Health Organization\u2019s Global Respiratory Threats Unit, said Wednesday during a media briefing.",
      "The version of H3N2 that\u2019s circulated worldwide this year \u201cacquired 7 new mutations over the summer,\u201d Antonia Ho, a consultant in infectious diseases at Scotland\u2019s University of Glasgow, said in a media statement. That \u201cmeans the virus is quite different to the H3N2 strain included in this year\u2019s vaccine,\u201d she said.",
      "The U.K. is heading \u201cinto what looks set to be a cruel winter, with flu cases being triple what they were this time last year,\u201d the head of the U.K.\u2019s National Health Service, James Mackey, said last week.",
      "It\u2019s picking up in Canada, too, said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the University of Saskatchewan. H3N2 is generally thought to cause more illness and be worse for older adults than other strains. Japan is also experiencing an unusually early and harsh flu season that\u2019s \u201cunprecedented,\u201d Rasmussen said.",
      "Japanese news outlet Nippon TV reported that as of Nov. 4, flu cases in Tokyo had surged to nearly six times the level seen at this time last year, according to the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare. More than 2,300 day cares and schools in the country were at least partially closed because of the outbreak, the outlet reported.",
      "\u201cThese are not good signs,\u201d Rasmussen said.",
      "Is this flu strain already in the U.S.?",
      "H3N2 is an A strain of influenza. While there are plenty of anecdotal reports of people testing positive for flu A across the country, the insights stop there.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention hasn\u2019t provided a detailed, national report on flu activity since Sept. 26 because of the government shutdown.",
      "Even if it reopens in the coming days, Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious diseases expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee, said that the \u201chollowing out\u201d of the CDC in the form of massive layoffs could further delay flu data collection and analysis. Earlier this year, the Department of Health and Human Services announced it would cut up to 10,000 full-time jobs in the public health sector.",
      "\u201cWe are going to be dependent on state laboratories and academic laboratories for these investigations and report them out,\u201d Schaffner said. \u201cThe information will not be as comprehensive, centralized and as quickly analyzed and communicated from the CDC as we have had in previous years.\u201d",
      "Will this year\u2019s flu shot be helpful?",
      "Global health officials and drugmakers select which viral strain to include in fall flu vaccines for the Northern Hemisphere each year in February, based on which types are circulating in the Southern Hemisphere. This year\u2019s flu shots protect against three strains of influenza, including two types of influenza A and one type of influenza B.",
      "The annual flu shot doesn\u2019t prevent people from getting infected with the flu. It\u2019s mainly used to lessen the severity of the illness. Last year, the vaccine was up to 55% effective in keeping adults with the flu out of the hospital.",
      "On Tuesday, health authorities in the U.K. published preliminary evidence that this year\u2019s vaccine is up to 40% effective in preventing hospitalization among adults.",
      "Schaffner encouraged people to get the shot anyway.",
      "\u201cAll of the data over previous decades shows that even if there is not a close match, use of the vaccine continues to prevent hospitalizations, intensive care unit admissions and continues to help keep people out of the cemetery,\u201d he said."
