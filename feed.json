      "To underscore that point, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex cited research from advocacy group ParentsTogether that found researchers posing as children experienced harmful interactions every five minutes they spent with an artificial intelligence chatbot.",
      "\u201cThis wasn\u2019t content created by a third party. These were the companies\u2019 own chatbots working to advance their own depraved internal policies,\" said Prince Harry at Spring Studios in Manhattan Thursday night as he and Markle were named Humanitarians of the Year by the nonprofit Project Healthy Minds. \"But here\u2019s what gives us hope: these families aren\u2019t facing this alone.\u201d",

      "Their remarks came at the annual gala for Project Healthy Minds, a Millennial- and Gen Z-driven tech nonprofit that runs a free online marketplace aiming to connect patients with the exact mental health care they seek.",
      "The couple has made youth mental health a cornerstone of their philanthropic work since launching the Archewell Foundation in 2020 after stepping aside as working royals. Through its network for families who have experienced online harm and support of youth-led organizations shaping responsible technology, the nonprofit works to make digital spaces safer.",
      "Prince Harry has previously stressed the need to hold powerful social media companies accountable. He warned last year that young people are experiencing an \u201cepidemic\u201d of anxiety, depression and social isolation driven by negative experiences online.",
      "According to numerous studies, few guardrails exist to mitigate kids' exposure to age-inappropriate content including pornography and violence on social media, where they also face cyberbullying and sexual harassment.",
      "The issue could also be considered personal for the couple. Markle has been open about her mental health struggles due to what she describes as the royal family\u2019s intense pressures and tabloid attacks. Harry's own personal life has been the subject of much tabloid reporting, including targeted phone hacking and surveillance.",
      "Prince Harry brought his awareness campaign to a reception Wednesday night hosted by men's health nonprofit Movember. In a conversation with television journalist Brooke Baldwin, he emphasized that men should not feel isolated because he repeatedly hears the same struggles when he speaks with them.",
      "\u201cThe biggest barrier is the belief that no one will understand,\u201d he said in comments reshared on his blog. \"Loneliness convinces you you\u2019re the only one, which is rarely true.\u201d",

      "Hungarian writer L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Krasznahorkai has won the Nobel Prize in literature for his \"compelling and visionary oeuvre.\"",
      "STOCKHOLM -- STOCKHOLM (AP) \u2014 Hungarian writer L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Krasznahorkai, whose philosophical, bleakly funny novels often unfold in single sentences, won the Nobel Prize in literature Thursday for his for his \"compelling and visionary oeuvre that, in the midst of apocalyptic terror, reaffirms the power of art.\u201d",
      "Several works including his debut, \u201cSatantango\u201d and \u201cThe Melancholy of Resistance,\u201d were turned into films by Hungarian director B\u00e9la Tarr.",
      "The Nobel judges praised his \u201cartistic gaze which is entirely free of illusion, and which sees through the fragility of the social order combined with his unwavering belief in the power of art,\" Steve Sem-Sandberg of the Nobel committee said at the announcement.",
      "\u201cL\u00e1szl\u00f3 Krasznahorkai is a great epic writer in the Central European tradition that extends through (Franz) Kafka to Thomas Bernhard, and is characterized by absurdism and grotesque excess,\" the Nobel judges said.",
      "Krasznahorkai, 71, could not immediately be reached for his reaction. He did not speak at the announcement.",
      "He has received many awards including the 2015 Man Booker International Prize. The Booker judges praised his \u201cextraordinary sentences, sentences of incredible length that go to incredible lengths, their tone switching from solemn to madcap to quizzical to desolate as they go their wayward way.\u201d",
      "He also won the National Book Award for Translated Literature in the U.S. in 2019 for \u201cBaron Wenckheim\u2019s Homecoming.\u201d",
      "The American writer and critic Susan Sontag has described Krasznahorkai as the \u201ccontemporary master of the Apocalypse.\u201d He was also friends with American poet and writer Allen Ginsberg and would regularly stay in Ginsberg\u2019s apartment while visiting New York City.",
      "He is the first winner from Hungary since Imre Kertesz in 2002. He joins an illustrious list of laureates that includes Ernest Hemingway, Toni Morrison and Kazuo Ishiguro.",
      "The literature prize has been awarded by the Nobel committee of the Swedish Academy 117 times to a total of 121 winners. Last year's prize was won by South Korean author Han Kang for her body of work that the committee said \u201cconfronts historical traumas and exposes the fragility of human life.\u201d",
      "The literature prize is the fourth to be announced this week, following the 2025 Nobels in medicine, physics and chemistry.",

      "In Luca Guadagnino's \u201cAfter the Hunt\u201d Yale academics go at each other on everything from Foucault to feminism in a psychological battle set across a #MeToo minefield",
      "It\u2019s not so often that the font of a movie\u2019s opening credits is, itself, a provocation.",
      "But in Luca Guadagnino \u2019s muddled but darkly absorbing \u201cAfter the Hunt,\u201d the white Windsor Light Condensed lettering against a black background, with cast in alphabetical order and soft jazz playing, is immediately recognizable as the style of a Woody Allen movie opening.",
      "In the juggling act to follow in \u201cAfter the Hunt,\u201d where Guadagnino will playfully twirl a twisting narrative of alleged sexual assault, cancel culture, privilege in academia and Gen Z victimization, the credits are not so much an opening salvo than they are an introductory wink.",
      "Like many an Allen film, \u201cAfter the Hunt\u201d is set among a well-educated, self-involved class. It takes place around Yale University. But unlike Allen\u2019s anxious, existential, chattering characters, Guadagnino\u2019s cocktail party collection of professors and students is a more scheming and unpleasant lot.",
      "That includes a philosophy professor, Alma Imhoff (Julia Roberts), on the precipice of tenure, her friend and department colleague, Hank Gibson (Andrew Garfield), and Imhoff\u2019s star pupil, a Ph.D. student named Maggie Resnick (Ayo Edebiri), who after a party at Alma\u2019s house accuses Hank of sexual assault.",
      "Guadagnino\u2019s film, shot by Malik Hassan Sayeed, is somberly and flatly lit and rife with reflections. Under these drab surfaces, the central characters of \u201cAfter the Hunt\u201d \u2014 an ensemble of singularly charming actors who here have drained away much of their natural charisma \u2014 go at each other on everything from Foucault to feminism in a psychological battle set across a #MeToo minefield.",
      "That, at least, is the promise of \u201cAfter the Hunt.\u201d But Guadagnino\u2019s dour and languid film, scripted by Nora Garrett, only fitfully coheres as the conversation piece it aspires to be. Its plot turns can be rash or implausible, and the movie increasingly feels like ideas and set pieces strung tenuously together.",
      "Yet I also enjoyed the prickliness of \u201cAfter the Hunt.\u201d Though there\u2019s a strong anti-woke vein to it, Guadagnino\u2019s film is more about how seemingly quite different generations have much more in common than they might appear. The cultural debates depicted in the movie are often so colored by moralistic superiority, but that\u2019s not the case here. Everyone is kind of rotten in \u201cAfter the Hunt.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s especially unusual for Roberts, whose Alma is far more complicated a character than she normally tackles. Alma is esteemed, fiercely intelligent, ambitious and hard to read. Her husband, a psychiatrist named Frederik (a fabulous Michael Stuhlbarg as combustible cocktail of cuckold and cook) worships her, but her affection is less evident.",

      "But shorn of her natural ebullience, Roberts' restraint of the role comes off more like weariness. That adds to some of the off-kilter tenor of \u201cAfter the Hunt,\u201d but it\u2019s hard not to imagine someone like Cate Blanchett in the part.",
      "\u201cWhen did offending someone become a cardinal sin?\u201d Hank asks at the party that opens the movie.",
      "A sign of what Guadagnino might be up to comes not long after, after Maggie has alleged the assault. Alma goes to meet a distraught Hank at a local restaurant. While they hash out what\u2019s true and what\u2019s fiction in Maggie\u2019s account, it\u2019s hard not to notice the mirrors that surround Hank.",
      "The real mirror of \u201cAfter the Hunt\u201d is Alma and Maggie. Edebiri is here a kind of stand-in for Gen Z, and her case expands to include a wider range of issues of inclusivity and othering. As things spiral and Maggie\u2019s case leads to increasing intensity on campus and in Alma\u2019s personal life, Alma shifts from Maggie\u2019s mentor to something more like a foe. But Alma\u2019s own past begins to play a role in the fallout, adding a new frame to \u201cAfter the Hunt\u201d that casts Alma and Maggie\u2019s plights in a different light.",
      "Is this a good time? Not especially, though Garfield is great in a rage. Glib insertions don\u2019t help. In one scene, when Alma meets a fellow faculty member (Chlo\u00eb Sevigny) in a bar, a Smiths song plays and she seems surprised a Morrissey tune isn\u2019t outlawed.",
      "I'm not sure \u201cAfter the Hunt\u201d has too much more to say than that shrug-of-the-shoulders scene. But \u201cAfter the Hunt\u201d deserves credit not so much more wading into these hot-button topics, but for trying to find its own way through them. It's not a #MeToo procedural but more like a tragedy. When \u201coptics over substance\u201d governs all, as one character laments, no one lives happily ever after.",
      "\u201cAfter the Hunt,\u201d an Amazon MGM release, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for language and some sexual content. Running time: 139 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four.",

      "According to Luminate, an industry data and analytics company, Latin music is primarily consumed via streaming. They found that Bad Bunny saw a 26% increase in on-demand streams in the United States following the Sept. 28 announcement, soaring from 173 million nine days before the announcement to 218.5 million streams in the eight days that followed.",
      "The singer born Benito Antonio Mart\u00ednez Ocasio recently said concerns about the mass deportation of Latinos played into his decision to bypass the mainland U.S. during his residency. He performs in Spanish and will do so at the Super Bowl, further proving that connecting with a U.S. and international audience does not require singing in English.",
      "Since the NFL, Apple Music and Roc Nation announced Bad Bunny will lead the halftime festivities from Levi\u2019s Stadium on Feb. 8 in Santa Clara, California, the selection has provoked conversation.",
      "For his fans, Bad Bunny's booking at the Super Bowl is viewed as a landmark moment for Latino culture. That feeling is no doubt related to his just-concluded, 31-date residency in Puerto Rico that brought approximately half a million people to the island during the slow summer tourism season and generated an estimated $733 million for the island.",
      "Roc Nation founder Jay-Z said in a statement that what Bad Bunny has \u201cdone and continues to do for Puerto Rico is truly inspiring. We are honored to have him on the world\u2019s biggest stage.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Tenor Rolando Villaz\u00f3n was singing the title role in Massenet's \u201cWerther\u201d in 2006 at Nice, France, when he started thinking about how he would direct the opera.",
      "\u201cI said, \u2018oh, this last act is very difficult. He shot himself and keeps singing for 40 minutes.' And so, what would I do?\u201d he recalled. \u201cAnd I started inventing, creating for fun a staging.\u201d",
      "Nearly two decades later, Villaz\u00f3n is making his Metropolitan Opera directing debut in Bellini's \u201cLa Sonnambula,\u201d which opened Monday night with a standout cast of Nadine Sierra, Xabier Anduaga and Alexander Vinogradov.",
      "\u201cHe is very sensitive to singers,\u201d Sierra said. \u201cMaybe some directors, because they\u2019re not singers or they were never singers, it\u2019s hard for them to really relate to the psychological struggle that some singers, we deal with on stage. We want to make our characters as believable as humanly possible through the actions that we show, but sometimes it\u2019s hard to do that because you also have to sing high notes.\u201d",
      "Villaz\u00f3n grew up in Mexico City, won Pl\u00e1cido Domingo\u2019s Operalia competition in 1999 and made his European debut that year in Massenet\u2019s \u201cManon\u201d at Genoa, Italy. He debuted at the Met in Verdi\u2019s \u201cLa Traviata\u201d in 2003 and gained wide renown when he sang Alfredo with Anna Netrebko\u2019s Violetta in Willy Decker\u2019s austere staging at the 2005 Salzburg Festival.",
      "Vocal problems developed in 2007, causing Villaz\u00f3n to cancel his schedule, and he had surgery in 2009 to remove a cyst from his vocal cords. He developed performance anxiety around 2015 and had another operation in 2018 to relieve acid reflux.",
      "\u201cTwo things coincided when I stopped singing for a year in 2009 \u2014 and that was I wrote my first novel and I prepared my staging, but both didn\u2019t happen because I was resting,\u201d he said. \u201cWould I have finished my novel? I don\u2019t know. But stage direction for sure that would have happened.\u201d",
      "When Villaz\u00f3n conceived his \u201cWerther\u201d staging, he shared it with Alain Lanceron, then head of the tenor's record label, Virgin Classics. Richard Jones, a director Villaz\u00f3n had worked with, helped him find a theater.

      "Filmmaker Derek Cianfrance goes to extreme lengths to make immersive environments for his actors",
      "TORONTO -- TORONTO (AP) \u2014 The lengths writer-director Derek Cianfrance goes to create immersive environments for his actors has grown into a kind of legend. After making the much-improvised doomed romance of \u201cBlue Valentine\u201d (2010), Michelle Williams said she would have to remind herself that she was never, actually, married to Ryan Gosling.",
      "Cianfrance\u2019s last feature, 2016\u2019s \u201cThe Light Between the Oceans,\u201d was shot almost entirely at a remote New Zealand lighthouse. The making of that film did lead together its stars, Michael Fassbender and Alicia Vikander. So did Cianfrance\u2019s \u201cThe Place Beyond the Pines,\u201d with Gosling and Eva Mendes. Method filmmaking can produce real-life results.",
      "But Cianfrance\u2019s ways are for a purpose. He wants his actors, as much as possible, to live in a movie. For his latest film, \u201cRoofman,\u201d starring Channing Tatum and Kirsten Dunst, that approach was especially important because the story was so far-fetched.",
      "\u201cI wanted to immerse the entire cast in this story because it\u2019s a crazy story,\u201d Cianfrance said in an interview. \u201cJeff\u2019s actions are kind of unbelievable. I felt like just for me, to have my suspension of disbelief, I needed to be down there. I think that\u2019s why I do a lot of this immersion because I need to believe it. I need to believe it\u2019s actually happening.\u201d",
      "In \u201cRoofman,\u201d which Paramount Pictures releases Friday in theaters, Tatum plays Jeffrey Manchester, a U.S. Army veteran who found civilian life difficult. In 1998, he began robbing McDonald\u2019s by sawing through roofs. He\u2019s believed to have robbed more than 40 stores. Both his novel entry point, and his reported cordial manner with employees, made the \u201cRoofman\u201d an intriguing figure on the local TV news.",
      "In 2000, Manchester was caught in North Carolina and was later sentenced to 45 years in prison. But in 2004, he escaped and, to elude the authorities, hid out in a Charlotte Toys \u201cR\u201d Us. He clandestinely lived there for months, eating what was on the shelves, and, most audaciously, trying to live a seemingly normal life outside the store. He attended a local church and dated a woman named Leigh Wainscott (played by Dunst).",
      "Mostly, the events of \u201cRoofman\u201d happened as they\u2019re portrayed. But how do you make a stranger-than-fiction tale believable? For the filmmakers of \u201cRoofman,\u201d it meant going to some extreme lengths to give real-life authenticity to a made-for-Hollywood story. At a time when major studios seldom release star-led original films at all, let alone fiercely realistic ones shot on location, \u201cRoofman\u201d \u2014 a modest sized production cobbled together with an assortment of companies, including Miramax, FilmNation and Limelight \u2014 effectively tunneled its way to the big screen.",
      "\u201cI had many producers tell me: Why don\u2019t you shoot this in South Africa? You\u2019ll have double the amount of days,\u201d Cianfrance says, referencing the appeal of tax credits. \u201cI said, \u2018Well, because the people aren\u2019t there, and the ghosts of this story aren\u2019t there.\u2019\u201d",
      "Cianfrance wanted to shoot in the Toys \u201cR\u201d Us where Manchester hid out, but he couldn\u2019t. The toy chain went bankrupt in 2017, and the one where Manchester camped out in is now a mega church. So, he turned an abandoned Toys \u201cR\u201d Us in Pineville, North Carolina, into a nearly fully operational one. The production redid the electricity, added plumbing, installed new fluorescent lighting and stocked 40,000 square feet of shelves with truckloads of period-appropriate toys.",
      "\u201cThat was my \u2018Fitzcarraldo,\u2019 bringing the steam ship over the mountain, building that Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us,\u201d Cianfrance says, chuckling.",
      "That gave Tatum, whom Cianfrance had initially sought for \u201cBlue Valentine,\u201d a box store sandbox in which to play. The biggest gift Cianfrance could give to Tatum, he felt, was \u201cto unleash him in a toy store.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was 360, all around,\u201d says Tatum, speaking alongside Dunst. \u201cIt\u2019s not like this is a giant budget movie. It involved, like: \u2018There\u2019s not even enough toys from this era in the world to fill this place.\u2019 And Derek kept going. \u2018I promised Chan that he would have a fully working store where he could do whatever he wanted.\u2019 He put it on me!\u201d",
      "Dunst was particularly drawn to Cianfrance\u2019s process. \u201cThe kind of acting that Derek likes,\u201d Dunst says, \u201cis the kind of acting that I like: when it doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s acting.\u201d",

      "Yet much of the most extensive work to give \u201cRoofman\u201d veracity was below the surface. Manchester is currently serving out his sentence at Central Prison in Raleigh, North Carolina. He can only make outgoing calls, but Cianfrance estimates that he spoke to him more than a hundred times. That gave Cianfrance an understanding of Manchester\u2019s motives and mistakes and turned \u201cRoofman\u201d into a comic but tender examination of misguided materialism.",
      "\u201cJeff wrote a crazy movie for himself, and he lived it,\u201d Cianfrance says. \u201cWhat made me ultimately understand what the movie was that Jeff \u2014 he was just trying to figure out how to be a dad. He was doing it all for family.\u201d",
      "Tatum also spoke frequently with Manchester by phone. Manchester, among other things, expressed his approval of the movie poster, featuring Tatum with a stuffed bear on his shoulders, a floaty around his waist and a gun in his right hand. Tatum says they bonded talking about their children and their hopes for the future. Manchester is scheduled to be released in 2036.",
      "\u201cI got more than I could possibly convey. I just found myself being held almost by him, taken care of,\u201d Tatum says. \u201cI didn\u2019t grow up bad. But I definitely am a couple bad decisions away from hopefully not being in jail for 45 years. But I think we\u2019re all one or two bad decisions away from having a completely different life. Jeff did tell me, \u2018I got greedy.\u2019\u201d",
      "As he prepped the movie, Cianfrance interviewed everyone he could who was associated with Manchester\u2019s escape. Usually, he gave them parts. Wainscott plays a crossing guard in the film. The pastor of the church attended by Manchester, Ron Smith, plays a pawnshop owner. Dunst is interrogated by the police officers who actually interviewed Wainscott.",
      "Cianfrance cast Tatum and Dunst, he says, partly because they are each parents themselves. Dunst spent time with the actors who play her daughters, going shopping and making a meal together.",
      "\u201cIt builds layers that people feel when they watch a film,\u201d Dunst says.",

      "\u201cI don\u2019t know if I could have done this movie without having my daughter, and specifically my journey with her. I miss her a lot,\u201d says Tatum. \u201cThat loneliness and wanting for that was something infused in there. I didn\u2019t have to create that.\u201d",

Not in his performance as a Yale philosophy professor accused of sexual misconduct in \u201cAfter the Hunt,\u201d but while discussing an actor\u2019s responsibility to comment on the work they\u2019re putting out in the world.",
      "It\u2019s a blue-sky day outside the luxurious Hotel Cipriani and Garfield is seated alongside his co-stars Julia Roberts and Ayo Edebiri discussing a film that has, for better or worse, become the topic of some spirited debates. Just a few days prior at the Venice Film Festival, journalists at a press conference asked Roberts and filmmaker Luca Guadagnino if the film undermines the feminist movement.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s the actor\u2019s responsibility at all to express anything in public. Ever,\u201d Garfield said, using his hands for extra emphasis. \u201cPlease, tell them about the gesticulation.\u201d",
      "Roberts chimed in: \u201cThe hair as well.\u201d (It was bouncing).",
      "With \u201cAfter the Hunt,\u201d in theaters Friday, Guadagnino and his actors knew they were making something thorny, something challenging, about messy, imperfect people whose lives, and lies, are upended with the accusation. They were ready to own the decision to use a typeface in the opening credits made famous by Woody Allen. But they had not anticipated the anti-feminist question, which was perhaps less a question than an accusation.",
      "\u201cThis question was so tone deaf to the movie itself,\u201d Guadagnino said. \u201cLike, you\u2019ve mistaken the subject with the object.\u201d",
      "The film is an ensemble piece about a few characters in and around Yale whose heady philosophical chats about agency and power become less theoretical under the glare of sticky real life dramas. Roberts plays Alma, a revered professor up for tenure alongside her colleague and flirty drinking buddy Hank (Garfield). Edebiri is a student named Maggie, a child of billionaires who everyone says is brilliant and who is a little obsessed with Alma.",
      "After a boozy party at Alma\u2019s, Maggie comes to Alma first to tell her that Hank crossed the line. Hank denies anything happened and claims that Maggie is retaliating because he accused her of plagiarizing her thesis. No one knows quite who to believe. Alma, too, is harboring her own secrets. And everything in their world unravels in spectacularly melodramatic fashion.",
      "The screenplay comes from Nora Garrett, who was working as a data analyst at Meta before her script caught the attention of Guadagnino and Roberts, in quick succession.",
      "\u201cThe story really started with the character of Alma,\u201d Garrett said. \u201cI was really interested in this idea of a woman who had a lie or something that she was deeply ashamed of at the core of her being.\u201d",
      "But Alma's controlled compartmentalization of her past starts to unspool with Maggie's accusation. The part allows Roberts to do some of her best work in years.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m saying something that might sound obvious, but she\u2019s one of the greatest stars and one of the great actresses,\u201d Guadagnino said. \u201cThe symbol, the beauty of the symbol, and at the same time the truth of the performance. She\u2019s so three-dimensional.\u201d",
      "Roberts was particularly fascinated by Alma\u2019s relationship with her husband, Frederik, a shrink played by Guadagnino regular Michael Stuhlbarg, whose unexpected choices had her in awe.",

      "The Skins Game, which began in 1983 with some of golf's biggest stars, was last played in 2008 and won by K.J. Choi.",
      "The new Skins Game will have a similar format. A player wins the dollar amount for each hole, and it carries over if the hole is tied. The difference is a \u201creverse purse,\u201d in which all four players start with $1 million and their fortunes rise or fall with every hole won or lost.",

      "Ross, a public television stalwart in the 1980s and '90s, \u201cdedicated his life to making art accessible to everyone,\u201d said Joan Kowalski, president of Bob Ross Inc. \u201cThis auction ensures his legacy continues to support the very medium that brought his joy and creativity into American homes for decades.\u201d",
      "Bonhams in Los Angeles will auction three of Ross' paintings on Nov. 11. Other auctions will follow in London, New York, Boston and online. All profits are pledged to stations that use content from distributor American Public Television.",
      "The idea is to help stations in need with licensing fees that allow them to show popular programs that include \u201cThe Best of Joy of Painting,\u201d based on Ross' show, \u201cAmerica's Test Kitchen,\u201d \u201cJulia Child's French Chef Classics\u201d and \u201cThis Old House.\u201d",

      "Bonhams sold two early 1990s mountain-and-lake scenes of Ross in August for $114,800 and $95,750. The auctions of the 30 paintings soon to be sold have an estimated total value of $850,000 to $1.4 million, Bonhams said.",

      "Taylor Swift's new film, \u201cThe Official Release Party of a Show Girl,\u201d has topped the weekend box office with $33 million in North America",
      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 This weekend\u2019s box office belonged to two undeniable draws: Taylor Swift and Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson.",
      "It might have looked like a heavyweight matchup, but Swift\u2019s devoted fanbase once again proved unstoppable with her film \u201cThe Official Release Party of a Show Girl,\u201d which debuted at No. 1 with $33 million in North America, according to Sunday estimates from Comscore. The AMC Theatres release -- announced only two weeks ago with minimal promotion -- served as a companion piece to Swift\u2019s 12th studio album, packaging music videos, behind-the-scenes footage and profanity-free lyric visuals into an 89-minute experience.",
      "The film played at all 540 AMC theaters in the U.S. for three days, ending after Sunday. AMC aired the show in Mexico, Canada and across Europe.",
      "\u201cFor Taylor Swift to harness the power of the movie theater to build her brand, create excitement among her fans, and create a communal experience outside of her touring, outside of her live performances, is really a stroke of genius,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. \u201cTo be able to add another $33 million to the box office bottom line is much welcomed by theater owners who were looking for content for their big screens.\u201d",
      "It comes nearly two years after her \u201cThe Eras Tour\u201d concert film opened to $96 million, with Swift extending her streak of box office dominance.",
      "Meanwhile, Johnson saw a more modest showing. His A24 drama \u201cThe Smashing Machine,\u201d co-starring Emily Blunt, opened in third place with a mere $6 million, trailing Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s \u201cOne Battle After Another,\u201d which earned $11.1 million and has now accumulated $107 million globally.",
      "Despite strong reviews and a 15-minute standing ovation at the Venice Film Festival -- where Johnson drew praise for portraying MMA legend Mark Kerr \u2014 the film marked one of the lowest openings as a lead.",
      "\u201cWhen major movie stars branch out into more indie roles, like Tom Cruise in \u201dMagnolia,\" they're trying to redefine their career,\" Dergarabedian said. \u201cThey can straddle both universes, so Dwayne Johnson and all the acclaim he\u2019s getting. That prestige factor. That\u2019s the currency. He knows box office. He studies this and he's a business person. But also realize that when you go outside of your comfort zone, it puts him in a certain light. ... Dwayne Johnson is redefining what he can do.\u201d",
      "Beyond the two marquee names, the rest of the weekend lineup offered a wide mix ranging from animated adventures to horror sequels and international releases.",
      "DreamWorks Animation\u2019s family adventure \u201cGabby\u2019s Dollhouse: The Movie\u201d debuted in fourth place with $5.2 million, expanding the popular Netflix preschool series to the big screen. Warner Bros.\u2019 supernatural thriller \u201cThe Conjuring: Last Rites\u201d followed in fifth with $4 million, pulling in $458.2 million globally.",
      "In sixth was \u201cDemon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba \u2013 Infinity Castle,\u201d the latest entry in the hit Japanese anime saga, earning $3.5 million. A re-release of \u201cAvatar: The Way of Water\u201d made a splash in seventh with $3.1 million \u2014 a solid return for the 2022 blockbuster ahead of \u201cAvatar: The Fire and Ash\u201d on Dec. 19.",
      "Rounding out the top 10 were \u201cThe Strangers: Chapter 2\u201d with $2.8 million, the IFC dark comedy \u201cGood Boy\u201d with $2.2 million, marking the company's second-best opening weekend ever. \u201cKantara: A Legend \u2013 Chapter 1\u201d with $1.7 million.",
      "Dergarabedian said he's looking forward to October films such as \u201cTron: Ares,\u201d \u201cKiss of the Spider Woman\u201d and \u201cRoofman,\" starring Channing Tatum.",

      "The 37-year-old Jets center, who was playing his first NHL game since April 13, 2023, with the Chicago Blackhawks, logged 18:19 of ice time in his 1,068th career regular-season game. He had one shot on goal.",

      "Toews said he felt \u201cclose\u201d to being in game form. He played on the second line with wingers Gustav Nyquist and Nikita Chibrikov.",
      "\u201cBut a lot of room for improvement, a lot of little things I can do better,\u201d Toews said. \u201cDefinitely trying to start the play with the puck off the faceoffs. Didn\u2019t really get that going for my line out there. But other than that there were some situations where the three of us created and had some chances, even on the power play as well.",
      "\u201cI was pretty close to making things happen, getting us on the board, so I think there are some positives I\u2019m excited about. (I\u2019ll) just keep trying to build on it.\u201d",

      "\u201cAt the end of the day, that\u2019s a tough one because our whole group wasn\u2019t good. And for him, certainly would\u2019ve liked for it to be a better first game.\u201d",

      "District Judge Jackson Lofgren's said in his decision Wednesday that the law discriminates based on age and medical purpose, not sex, and that there's little evidence the Legislature passed the law for \u201can invidious discriminatory purpose.\u201d He also noted various concerns and ongoing debates over the medical treatments involved.",
      "\u201cThe evidence presented at trial establishes there is a legitimate concern regarding the capacity of minors to understand and appreciate the long-term consequences of the practices prohibited by the Health Care Law,\u201d the judge wrote, adding that he doesn't believe the law violates the state constitution.",
      "The ruling means parents who decided to seek gender-affirming medical care for their children after the state's ban took effect in April 2023 will need to do so out of state.",
      "\u201cThis ruling is devastating for transgender youth and their families in North Dakota. The evidence in this case was overwhelming: this law inflicts real harm, strips families of their constitutional rights, and denies young people the medical care they need to thrive,\u201d Jess Braverman, the legal director for the gender equity nonprofit Gender Justice, which represented the plaintiff, said in a statement.",
      "Republican state Rep. Bill Tveit, who introduced the legislation, said he is pleased with the ruling.",
      "\u201cIt's a law that needs to be there. We need to protect our youth, and that's what the whole goal of this thing was from the beginning,\u201d Tveit said.",
      "The lawsuit was brought by several affected families and a pediatric endocrinologist, but the judge dismissed some of their claims and left only the physician as a plaintiff.",
      "About half of U.S. states, nearly all of which have fully Republican-led governments, have banned gender-affirming care for minors. North Dakota's law makes it a misdemeanor for a health care provider to prescribe or give hormone treatments or puberty blockers to a transgender child. It also makes it a felony to perform gender-affirming surgery on a minor.",

      "Although the law exempts children who were already receiving treatments before North Dakota\u2019s ban took effect, attorneys for the families who sued said providers held off because they perceived the law as vague and didn\u2019t want to risk it. That led the families to miss work and school so they could travel to Minnesota for treatment.",
      "The judge later said those kids can receive any medical care they were receiving before the law took effect, though that decision wasn\u2019t enough of a final ruling to satisfy attorneys for health care organizations.

      "The law seeks to define ultraprocessed foods, the often super-tasty products typically full of sugar, salt and unhealthy fats. The legislation requires the state\u2019s Department of Public Health to adopt rules by mid-2028 defining \u201cultraprocessed foods of concern\u201d and \u201crestricted school foods.\u201d",
      "Schools have to start phasing out those foods by July 2029, and districts will be barred from selling them for breakfast or lunch by July 2035. Vendors will be banned from providing the \u201cfoods of concern\u201d to schools by 2032.",

      "Legislatures across the country have introduced more than 100 bills in recent months seeking to ban or require labeling of chemicals that make up many ultraprocessed foods, including artificial dyes and controversial additives.",
      "Americans get more than half their calories from ultraprocessed foods, which have been linked to a host of health problems, including obesity, diabetes and heart disease. However, studies haven\u2019t been able to prove that the foods directly cause those chronic health problems.",
      "Defining ultraprocessed foods has been tricky. The most common definition is based on the four-tier Nova system developed by Brazilian researchers that classifies foods according to the amount of processing they undergo.",
      "Researchers often describe ultraprocessed foods as the types of products that contain industrially made ingredients that you won\u2019t find in a home kitchen.",
      "But some highly processed foods \u2013\u2014 think tofu, certain types of whole-grain bread and infant formula \u2013 can be healthful. And it\u2019s not clear whether it\u2019s the processing of the foods or the combination of nutrients such as sugar, fat and salt that leads to poor health outcomes.",
      "U.S. health officials recently launched an effort to come up with a federal definition of ultraprocessed foods, saying there are concerns over whether current definitions \u201caccurately capture\u201d the range of foods that may affect health.",

      "A new UNICEF report has found that the number of children displaced by violence in Haiti has nearly doubled to 680,000",
      "PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti -- PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) \u2014 The number of children displaced by violence in Haiti has nearly doubled to 680,000, according to a new UNICEF report released Wednesday that warns minors are increasingly facing hunger, violence and recruitment by armed groups in the Caribbean nation.",
      "Overall, around 6 million Haitians \u2014 half the country\u2019s population \u2014 need humanitarian assistance, including more than 3.3 million children, UNICEF said.",
      "\u201cWithout decisive action, the future of an entire generation is at stake,\u201d the report stated.",
      "Gang violence has displaced a record 1.3 million Haitians in recent years, with many cramming into makeshift shelters after their communities were razed.",
      "The number of such shelters has doubled countrywide to 246 in the first six months of the year, according to the report. Of those, more than 30% lack infrastructure that would provide basic protection.",
      "Many of the shelters are located in dangerous areas, with gangs controlling up to 90% of Port-au-Prince, Haiti\u2019s capital.",
      "\u201cIn many areas, aid workers cannot safely reach communities, and families cannot travel to clinics, food distribution points or schools,\u201d the report noted.",
      "About 5.7 million people, including more than 1 million children, are facing acute hunger.",
      "\u201cThis has to change,\u201d said Geraldine Matha-Pierre, mother of two boys, ages 13 and 15. \u201cI\u2019m hungry. My kids are hungry.\u201d",
      "They have been living in a shelter for the past two years after gangs raided their community, and Matha-Pierre often calls friends to see if they have any food they can send over.",
      "She used to sell plantains, bananas and other crops from Haiti\u2019s countryside at a local market, but gang violence left her without a job to help feed her children and send them to school.",
      "Her two boys have missed an entire school year, but Matha-Pierre said that a relative promised to help pay for them this year, with classes having just started.",
      "At least one in four children in Haiti is out of school, with violence forcing more than 1,080 schools to close this year, according to UNICEF\u2019s report.",
      "During the last school year, more than 1,600 institutions were closed and 25 were occupied by armed groups, affecting more than 243,400 students and 7,548 teachers, UNICEF found.",
      "Meanwhile, 84 schools this year are being used as makeshift shelters, with displacement disrupting education for nearly 500,000 school-age children, according to the report.",

The news hit me hard: She was 14, the same age as my youngest daughter, and the lioness responsible may have been one of the animals we see in our neighborhood almost weekly.",
      "Our children are growing up in a part of Nairobi where lions roam free. We see them while taking our kids to school. We\u2019ve lost pets and livestock. Neighborhood WhatsApp groups share warnings when big cats come close \u2014 and feature CCTV footage of lions hunting family pets.",
      "It\u2019s a conservation headache for the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS), which is tasked with keeping people who share space with wildlife safe, while protecting the wildlife as well \u2014 especially endangered species. KWS estimates that \u201cjust over 2,000\u201d lions remain in Kenya.",
      "\u201cDuring the rainy season, tall grass and shifting herbivore patterns make it difficult for carnivores to hunt,\u201d KWS wrote on a reel of a Nairobi lion cub rescue posted to its social media in July. The cub in the video had been seen starving in the park, causing a public outcry. KWS added it was \u201cconducting a feeding intervention, providing meat daily to the pride residing in the park to help them regain their strength and resume natural hunting.\u201d",
      "Nairobi National Park, bordering the city to the north, has long relied on vast southern grazing lands for its wildlife to migrate to other protected areas. With those areas fast turning into residential and industrial developments, Kenya\u2019s State Department for Wildlife announced a nearly $5 billion plan to create a migratory corridor between Nairobi and conservancies to the south. There are also nongovernment initiatives that pay landowners bordering Nairobi National Park a small annual fee to keep their properties unfenced for wildlife.",

      "What\u2019s missing is greater awareness on how to behave around predators, especially among increasingly urban communities who are coming into contact with them.",
      "My children never learned this in school. Their closest encounter with a lion was in 2020, when we took advantage of a post-COVID bookings slump to show them the Maasai Mara National Reserve. An incredibly knowledgeable local guide led us through the southern reserve in a completely open safari vehicle, surrounded by surging wildebeest.",
      "On one outing, our guide stopped the car for a passing trio of hunting lionesses. The first strode by, ignoring us. The second looked as if she was going to pass behind the car, but was distracted by the glint of a seatbelt buckle, which my daughter was absentmindedly playing with. The lioness stopped, turned to stare, then wandered up to us. Stretching her head up towards my child, she sniffed the buckle before taking it between her teeth. My daughter sat stiff, perhaps ten inches from the lioness\u2019s head, which suddenly seemed impossibly huge.",
      "\u201cKeep still,\u201d the guide murmured under his breath. \u201cDon\u2019t move. Don\u2019t make a sound.\u201d",
      "Her curiosity satisfied, the lioness ducked under the car and moved on.",
      "That day, we learned a lesson in predator behavior during a holiday experience very few Kenyans can afford. It may have recently saved my wife\u2019s life when she encountered a lioness in our garden. Checking to see what our dog was barking at, she spotted a lioness under a bush less than 10 yards away. Only its head was visible.",

      "\u201cI reached for the maize flour and saw Simon\u2019s head. It was separated from his body. I reached for the head and saw a hand, then a leg inside a gumboot,\u201d Daniel remembers. Horrified, he called me. As we started on the grisly task of trying to find Simon\u2019s remains, we were pushed back by a warning growl. It was a male lion, still guarding the kill.",
      "At this point, Simon had been missing for 2 1/2 days. No one knows whether the lion that was with him by the time we found him was responsible for his death. Lions who kill humans \u2013 the notorious man-eaters \u2013 are shot to avoid recurrence, and KWS claim to have shot the lioness that killed Peace Mwende the night of that attack.",
      "Although human-wildlife conflict has existed for as long as humans have, predator attacks are likely to rise as space for Kenya\u2019s lions shrinks and their hunting opportunities diminish. This can only spell doom for Nairobi\u2019s world-famous national park, which some already want to see turned into housing developments.",
      "I mourn Simon like the friends and colleagues who died on assignment in Sierra Leone and Afghanistan. Every lion sighting also still fills me with joy and wonder, in spite of the horrors of that day in 2019. I hope solutions can be found to keep both people and lion populations safe, and that this remarkable wilderness that makes Nairobi such a unique capital city survives for the joy and wonder of many others.",

      "Robert Roberson hopes he will again avoid becoming the first person in the U.S. executed for a murder conviction tied to the diagnosis of shaken baby syndrome",
      "LIVINGSTON, Texas -- LIVINGSTON, Texas (AP) \u2014 Robert Roberson was calm and hopeful as he pondered his mortality and whether he could again avoid becoming the first person in the U.S. executed for a murder conviction tied to the diagnosis of shaken baby syndrome.",
      "With days to go before his scheduled Oct. 16 execution, Roberson maintained his innocence in the 2002 death of his 2-year-old daughter, Nikki Curtis, in the east Texas city of Palestine. He is set to die by lethal injection nearly a year to the day after a group of Texas lawmakers, who say he is innocent, secured an extraordinary last-minute court reprieve as Roberson waited outside the death chamber in Huntsville.",
      "Roberson said he was placing his hopes for another execution stay in the hands of his lawyers, his supporters and God.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not going to stress out and stuff because I know God has it, you know. He\u2019s in control. No matter what, God\u2019s in control, you know, and he does have the last say, you know,\u201d Roberson, 58, told The Associated Press last week as he sat behind a glass partition in the visiting area of the Polunsky Unit in Livingston, where Texas' male death row inmates are housed.",
      "During an hourlong interview, Roberson said he thinks about his daughter every day and what kind of life she would have today.",
      "Prosecutors at Roberson\u2019s 2003 trial argued he hit his daughter and violently shook her, causing severe head trauma and that she died from injuries related to shaken baby syndrome. Roberson\u2019s lawyers and some medical experts say his daughter died not from abuse but from complications related to pneumonia. They say his conviction was based on flawed and now outdated scientific evidence.",
      "The diagnosis of shaken baby syndrome refers to a serious brain injury caused when a child\u2019s head is hurt through shaking or some other violent impact, like being slammed against a wall or thrown on the floor.",
      "Roberson\u2019s attorneys have argued his undiagnosed autism helped convict him as authorities and medical personnel felt he didn\u2019t act like a concerned parent because his flat affect was seen as a sign of guilt.",
      "Last year, Roberson was on the verge of being put to death when a flurry of last-minute legal maneuvering on the night of his scheduled execution, including an unprecedented intervention by a bipartisan group of Texas lawmakers, stayed his lethal injection. In July, a judge set the new execution date, Roberson's third.",
      "During his interview with the AP, Roberson often would not keep eye contact and would repeat words or phrases \u2014 behaviors that experts say are associated with autism.",
      "\u201cThey assumed (guilt) because of the way I was acting, you know. And I didn\u2019t know I was autistic, you know, until years and years later, you know,\u201d said Roberson, who wasn\u2019t diagnosed with autism until 2018.",
      "Roberson\u2019s supporters and his legal team are again holding rallies and asking state and federal appeals courts and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott to halt his execution. His supporters include both liberal and ultraconservative lawmakers, Texas GOP megadonor and conservative activist Doug Deason, bestselling author John Grisham and Brian Wharton, the former police detective who helped put together the case against him.",
      "\u201cThe whole world is watching. Texas, do not kill this innocent man,\u201d Wharton said during a rally Saturday outside the Texas Capitol building in Austin.",
      "The office of Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, as well as some medical experts and other family members of Nikki, maintain the girl died because of child abuse and that Roberson had a history of hitting his daughter.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time coming. \u2026 In my opinion he did it, 100%,\u201d Matthew Bowman, Nikki's half brother, told reporters in July. Bowman declined to speak with the AP.",
      "Abbott's office did not immediately reply to emails seeking comment. Abbott has the power to grant a one-time 30-day reprieve.",

      "Planned Parenthood officials say in court filings that Missouri's Republican attorney general is trying to get the medical records of patients who\u2019ve had abortions",
      "Missouri's Republican attorney general is trying to get the medical records of Planned Parenthood patients who've had abortions, officials who oversee clinics in Kansas City and St. Louis said in legal filings.",
      "The fight over the subpoenas is playing out in a lawsuit filed last year by Planned Parenthood Great Plains, the abortion provider's affiliate for Kansas City, and Planned Parenthood Great Rivers, the affiliate for St. Louis. Planned Parenthood officials argue that the state's restrictions violate an amendment to the Missouri Constitution narrowly approved by voters in November to protect abortion rights.",
      "The Missouri attorney general\u2019s office issued subpoenas starting in late August to two employees of the Kansas City Planned Parenthood affiliate, a physician contracting with it, and two former board members of the St. Louis-area Planned Parenthood affiliate, according to Planned Parenthood court filings last month. One filing seeking to quash the subpoenas said the attorney general demanded patient records, reports on adverse events and communications about patient care, along with clinical protocols, equipment maintenance records, contract documents and records related to compliance with state requirements.",
      "\u201cDespite the Missouri Attorney General\u2019s blatant attempts to overturn the will of the people, all patients expect and have the right for their medical records to be private,\u201d the two affiliates said in a joint statement Tuesday. \u201cPoliticians have no place in the exam room with patients and their medical providers.\u201d",
      "Attorney General Catherine Hanaway\u2019s office did not immediately respond to an email Tuesday requesting comment. But in a filing in June, the state questioned Planned Parenthood officials\u2019 repeated statements that \u201cabortion rarely involves medical complications\u201d and that state requirements do not improve patients\u2019 health.",
      "\u201cThe purpose of litigation is to \u2018ascertain the truth,\u2019\u201d the filing said.",
      "Abortion policy has been in flux nationally since the 2022 U.S. Supreme Court decision that overturned Roe v. Wade and allowed states to enforce bans. Twelve states now ban abortion at any stage of pregnancy, with limited exception, and women now are more likely to cross state lines for abortions or to obtain them via pills shipped in by prescribers elsewhere.",
      "A multiyear legal battle has seen Missouri swing back and forth between banning and allowing most abortions. Before last year's ballot question, the state had a near-total ban.",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Democrats believe health care is an issue that resonates with a majority of Americans as they demand an extension of subsidies in exchange for their votes to reopen the shuttered U.S. government. But it is also one of the most intractable issues in Congress \u2014 and a real compromise amid the government shutdown will not likely be easy, or quick.",
      "There are some Republicans in Congress who want to extend the higher subsidies, which were first put in place in 2021 amid the COVID-19 pandemic, as millions of people who receive their insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplaces are set to receive notices that their premiums will increase at the beginning of the year. But many GOP lawmakers are strongly opposed to any extension \u2014 and see the debate as a new opportunity to cut back on the program altogether.",
      "\u201cIf Republicans govern by poll and fail to grab this moment, they will own it,\u201d wrote Texas Rep. Chip Roy, a Republican, in a letter published in the The Wall Street Journal over the weekend. He encouraged senators not to go \u201cwobbly\u201d on the issue.",
      "\u201cThe jig is up, the pandemic is over and my colleagues shouldn\u2019t blink in any other direction,\u201d Roy wrote.",
      "Republicans have been railing against the Affordable Care Act, former President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health care law, since it was enacted 15 years ago. But while they have been able to chip away at it, they have not been able to substantially alter it as a record 24 million people are now signed up for insurance coverage through the ACA, in large part because billions of dollars in subsidies have made the plans more affordable for many people.",
      "Now, some of them see the Democrats\u2019 fight as their chance to revisit the issue \u2014 putting Republican congressional leaders and President Donald Trump in a complicated position as the government shutdown enters its seventh day and hundreds of thousands of federal workers are going unpaid.",
      "\u201cI am happy to work with Democrats on their Failed Healthcare Policies, or anything else, but first they must allow our Government to reopen,\u201d Trump wrote on social media Monday night, walking back earlier comments saying there were ongoing negotiations with Democrats.",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Supreme Court will hear arguments in its latest LGBTQ+ rights case Tuesday, weighing the constitutionality of bans passed by nearly half of U.S. states on the practice known as conversion therapy for children.",
      "The justices are hearing a lawsuit from a Christian counselor challenging a Colorado law that prohibits therapy aimed at changing sexual orientation or gender identity. Kaley Chiles, with support from President Donald Trump's Republican administration, argues the law violates her freedom of speech by barring her from offering voluntary, faith-based therapy for kids.",
      "Colorado, on the other hand, says the measure simply regulates licensed therapists by barring a practice that's been scientifically discredited and linked to serious harm.",
      "The arguments come months after the Supreme Court's conservative majority found states can ban transition-related health care for transgender youths, a setback for LGBTQ rights. The justices are also expected to hear a case about sports participation by transgender players this term.",
      "Colorado has not sanctioned anyone under the 2019 law, which exempts religious ministries. State attorneys say it still allows any therapist to have wide-ranging, faith-based conversations with young patients about gender and sexuality.",
      "\u201cThe only thing that the law prohibits therapists from doing is performing a treatment that seeks the predetermined outcome of changing a minor\u2019s sexual orientation or gender identity because that treatment is unsafe and ineffective,\u201d Colorado state attorneys wrote.",

      "Linda Robertson is a Christian mom of four from Washington state whose son Ryan underwent therapy that promised to change his sexual orientation after he came out to her at age 12. The techniques led him to blame himself when it didn\u2019t work, leaving him ashamed and depressed. He died in 2009, after multiple suicide attempts and a drug overdose at age 20.",

She said she believes \u201cpeople flourish when they live consistently with God\u2019s design, including their biological sex,\" and she argues evidence of harm from her approach is lacking.",
      "Chiles says Colorado is discriminating because it allows counselors to affirm minors coming out as gay or identifying as transgender but bans counseling like hers for young patients who may want to change their behavior or feelings. \u201cWe're not saying this counseling should be mandatory, but if someone wants the counseling they should be able to get it,\u201d said one of her attorneys, Jonathan Scruggs.",

      "Still, the Supreme Court has also found that regulations that only \u201cincidentally\u201d burden speech are permissible, and the state argues that striking down its law against conversion therapy would undercut states' ability to regulate discredited health care of all kids.",

      "The government health agency on Monday announced it has adopted recommendations made last month by advisers picked by U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "Before this year, U.S. health officials \u2014 following recommendations by infectious disease experts \u2014 recommended annual COVID-19 boosters for all Americans ages 6 months and older. The idea was to update protection against the coronavirus as it continues to evolve.",
      "As the COVID-19 pandemic waned, experts increasingly discussed the possibility of focusing vaccination efforts on people 65 and older \u2014 who are among those most at risk for death and hospitalization.",

      "The panel also urged the CDC to adopt stronger language around claims of vaccine risks, despite pushback from outside medical groups who said the shots had a proven safety record from the billions of doses administered worldwide.",
      "In a statement Monday, O\u2019Neill celebrated the change, saying past guidance \"deterred health care providers from talking about the risks and benefits of vaccination.\u201d",

      "There is a single shot that contains all four, but it carries a higher risk of fevers and fever-related seizures. Since 2009, the CDC had said it prefers separate shots for initial doses of those vaccines and 85% of toddlers already get the chickenpox vaccine separately.",

      "Several groups and nonprofit organizations have filed a lawsuit against the Environmental Protection Agency over the canceling of a $7 billion Solar for All program intended to make solar power accessible to more than 900,000 lower-income Americans",
      "Several groups and nonprofit organizations filed a lawsuit Monday against the Environmental Protection Agency over the canceling of a $7 billion Solar for All program intended to make solar power accessible to more than 900,000 lower-income Americans.",
      "They say the Trump administration's termination of the program was illegal and they want a federal judge to direct the EPA to reinstate it. The program is affiliated with another $20 billion in green funding also terminated under President Donald Trump that EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin had characterized as a fraudulent scheme fraught with waste.",
      "The EPA said in an email Monday that it does not comment on litigation.",
      "The lawsuit is the latest legal action against the administration amid its assault on clean energy policy and related funding and programs across the country. Trump has moved to boost production of fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal.",
      "The lawsuit filed in Rhode Island by the Rhode Island AFL-CIO labor organization and others \u2014 including the public interest law center Rhode Island Center for Justice and the nonprofit Solar United Neighbors \u2014 detailed the importance of the program for local workforces and lower-income communities looking for access to clean-energy project funding.",
      "Patrick Crowley, president of the Rhode Island AFL-CIO, said Monday that the program's termination kills jobs and will drive up electricity prices.",
      "The Solar for All money was rescinded after Trump\u2019s massive tax and spending law passed in Congress in July. Zeldin said in a statement on social media at the time, \u201cthe bottom line is this: EPA no longer has the statutory authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive.\"",
      "The groups argued in the lawsuit that the law only revoked climate grants not yet awarded by the EPA and that these solar funds were already awarded.",
      "\u201cThe Trump administration\u2019s rollback of the Solar for All program is a shameless attempt to prop up fossil fuel companies at the expense of families,\u201d said Kate Sinding Daly, senior vice president for law and policy at the Conservation Law Foundation, one of the nonprofit legal advocacy groups representing the plaintiffs.",
      "\u201cThis program would provide families with low incomes access to clean, affordable solar power: energy that lowers bills, improves air quality, and keeps people safer during extreme heat,\u201d she added in a statement.",
      "The lawsuit cites previous EPA estimates that the program would have saved recipients about $400 each year on electricity bills and cumulatively reduced or avoided greenhouse gas emissions by over 30 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent.",

      "Experts say a food aid program that helps 6 million low-income mothers and young children will run out of federal money unless the government shutdown ends within two weeks",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 A food aid program that helps more than 6 million low-income mothers and young children will run out of federal money within two weeks unless the government shutdown ends, forcing states to use their own money to keep it afloat or risk it shutting down, experts say.",
      "The $8 billion Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, also known as WIC, provides vouchers to buy infant formula as well as fresh fruits and vegetables, low-fat milk and other healthy staples that are often out of financial reach for low-income households.",
      "The shutdown, which began Wednesday, coincided with the beginning of a new fiscal year, meaning programs like WIC, which rely on annual infusions from the federal government, are nearly out of money. Currently, the program is being kept afloat by an $150 million contingency fund, but experts say it could run dry quickly.",
      "After that, states could step in to pay for the program and seek reimbursement when a budget finally passes, but not all states say they can afford to do so.",
      "\u201cWe feel good about one to two weeks,\u201d said Ali Hard, policy director for the National WIC Association. \u201cAfter that, we are very worried.\u201d",
      "Taylor Moyer, a mother of three who recently separated from her husband, has been receiving WIC since her first son was born nine years ago. She said the program allowed her to feed her children nutritious food that tends to be pricier than calorie-dense, processed options. It also provided guidance when she struggled to breastfeed and counseled her on how to handle her son's picky eating stage.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s been times where I have sat back in my house and really wondered how I was going to feed my family,\u201d said Moyer, who works at the LGBT Life Center in Virginia Beach, Virginia. \u201cAnd I went to the store with my WIC card ... I get rice, I got avocados, I got eggs, and I made a balanced meal that was actually good.\u201d",
      "The shutdown came as Democrats and Republicans failed to pass a new spending plan. Democratic lawmakers want to extend tax credits that make health care cheaper for millions of Americans, and they want to reverse deep cuts to Medicaid that were passed earlier this year. They refused to sign on to any spending plan that did not include those provisions.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana, blamed Democrats for the shutdown and called them hypocritical because failing to fund the federal government endangers so many health programs.",
      "The WIC program, which has long had bipartisan support, aids those who are pregnant, mothers and children under age 5. Research has tied it to lower infant mortality, healthier birth weights, higher immunization rates and better academic outcomes for children who participate. Nearly half of those who are eligible don't enroll, often because they believe they don't qualify or they can't reach a WIC office.",
      "Some Republican lawmakers want to cut WIC, which is targeted for elimination in Project 2025, the influential policy blueprint authored by the man who's now President Donald Trump\u2019s budget chief. Trump\u2019s budget request and the spending plan backed by House Republicans would not fully fund the program. They also want to cut funding for families to buy fresh fruits and vegetables.",
      "In the event of an extended shutdown, several states have sought to reassure WIC recipients that they will continue to receive benefits. Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont, a Democrat, said the state will pick up the tab if federal funding runs out.",

Brown-capped porcini and bay boletes lay beside slimy purple brittlegills and honey-colored armillaria \u2014 and, among them, the lethal green death caps.",
      "Bivour, one of Germany's most famous fungi connoisseurs, described the different species just collected in an oak and beech forest on the outskirts of Potsdam in eastern Germany. Surrounding him were 20 people who listened attentively, among them university students, retirees and a Chinese couple with their 5-year-old daughter.",
      "Across Germany, the traditional forest art of mushroom hunting is enjoying a revival, fed by the coronavirus pandemic restrictions, which pushed people from cramped apartments into forests, and by the growing popularity of the vegan lifestyle. A growing interest in the use of medicinal fungi is also playing a role.",
      "While people in rural areas have gone mushroom picking for ages, city dwellers are now also discovering its joys.",
      "Mushroom hunting was necessity for many in Germany in the difficult years after World War II, when people scoured forests for anything edible. But when West Germany's economy started booming in the 1950s, and economic conditions also improved in East Germany, many turned away from the practice.",
      "In recent years, images of mushrooms have gone viral on social media, and a hobby once considered uncool has become a chic lifestyle pastime.",
      "Bivour, a 75-year-old retired meteorologist, said the tour he led on a recent, drizzly autumn day wasn't \u201cprimarily about filling your basket \u2014 although it\u2019s always nice to find something for the dinner table.\u201d",
      "Instead, he said, it was \u201cabout teaching people about the importance of mushrooms in the ecosystem and, of course, about biodiversity.\u201d",

      "He has also been giving mushroom tours in the Potsdam region southwest of Berlin for more than five decades.",
      "When the members of his group showed him mushrooms, he identified them with their German and sometimes their Latin names. He spoke about their healing powers or toxicity, gave suggestions on how to prepare some of them, offered historical anecdotes. He invited them to smell and taste the ones that were not poisonous.",

      "Many people are embracing their new passion with caution, afraid of accidentally picking and eating poisonous mushrooms.",
      "While the poisonous red-capped, white-dotted fly agaric can be easily identified, the very toxic green death cap is sometimes confused with the common button mushroom, or champignon, which is the most widely sold mushroom in stores across the country.",

      "Tim Ko\u0308ster, a 25-year-old university student from Berlin who joined the excursion with his girlfriend, said he had never foraged for mushrooms as a child, and is often satisfied with the white button mushrooms in the stores. But he also wants to be able to find and prepare his own porcini mushrooms \u2014 considered the most popular delicacy among Germany\u2019s more than 14,000 different kinds of mushrooms.",
      "While porcini are often served in risotto or pasta in Italian cuisine, in Germany porcini, as well as bay boletes, are often fried in butter and eaten on toasted sourdough bread with salt and pepper.",
      "As Ko\u0308ster stood amid an abundance of yellow and red fall foliage, he said that the tour was a good start. But asked if he was ready to start collecting mushrooms on his own, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t dare yet.\u201d",
      "Instead, he said he considers picking mushrooms and taking them to an expert to verify that they are edible.

      "SEOUL, South Korea (AP) \u2014 At a massive military parade attended by foreign leaders, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un rolled out his nuclear-armed military\u2019s most powerful weapons, including a new intercontinental ballistic missile he may be preparing to test in coming weeks.",
      "The parade, which began Friday night in the rain and marked the 80th anniversary of the founding of the ruling Workers\u2019 Party, highlighted Kim\u2019s growing diplomatic footing and his relentless drive to build an arsenal that could target the continental United States and his rivals in Asia.",
      "North Korea\u2019s official Korean Central News Agency said Saturday that the parade featured a new, yet-to-be-tested intercontinental ballistic missile called the Hwasong-20, which it described as the country's \u201cmost powerful nuclear strategic weapon system.\u201d",
      "In a speech at the parade, Kim said his military \"should continue to grow into an invincible entity that destroys all threats,\u201d but made no direct mention of Washington or Seoul, according to comments published by KCNA.",
      "Photos and videos from North Korean and Russian state media showed thousands of spectators packing the brightly lit square.",

      "The parade saw the debut of the massive Hwasong-20 mounted on an 11-axle launcher truck. The new missile\u2019s existence was first revealed in recent weeks as North Korea tested a new solid-fuel rocket engine that it said was intended for future ICBMs. State media said the engine, built with carbon fiber, is more powerful than past models.",

      "The high-level visits highlight Kim\u2019s increasingly assertive foreign policy as he seeks to break out of isolation and establish a larger role for North Korea in a united front against the U.S.-led West. North Korea has shunned any form of talks with Washington and Seoul since Kim\u2019s high-stakes nuclear diplomacy with Donald Trump fell apart in 2019 during the American president\u2019s first term. In a recent speech, Kim urged Washington to drop its demand for the North to surrender its nukes as a precondition for resuming diplomacy.",

      "Peruvians woke up to their seventh president in less than a decade Friday",
      "LIMA, Peru -- LIMA, Peru (AP) \u2014 Peruvians woke up to their seventh president in less than a decade Friday, as 38-year-old Jos\u00e9 Jer\u00ed took the reins of the shaken nation after Congress ousted widely loathed President Dina Boluarte in a lightening overnight impeachment.",
      "The young lawyer with scarce political experience, who just became president of the Congress in July, said shortly after being sworn in early Friday that he would seek \u201creconciliation,\u201d tackle Peru\u2019s runaway crime and ensure \u201cneutrality\u201d in elections when Peruvians elect a new president in April.",
      "Lawmakers had set up a debate and impeachment trial late Thursday in the 130-member unicameral Congress after voting to accept four requests for a vote to remove Boluarte from office over what they said was her government\u2019s inability to stem crime.",
      "They requested that Boluarte come before them shortly before midnight to defend herself, but when she did not appear they immediately voted to oust her. In short order, 124 lawmakers voted just past midnight to impeach Boluarte. There were no votes against the effort, the ninth attempt to remove her.",
      "The shocking turn of events came just hours after a man open fired at a concert in the capital, injuring five and inflaming anger over crime roiling the country.",
      "Jer\u00ed's rapid ascension was all the more surprising because in August he gave a lengthy interview to Peruvian newspaper El Comercio in which he said he wouldn't replace Boluarte if she were impeached because he believed in \u201cpresidential institutionality and we're so close to the end of her term.\u201d",
      "Boluarte, Peru\u2019s first female president, took office in December 2022 after Parliament used the same mechanism to impeach her predecessor. Then-President Pedro Castillo was removed from office just two years into his five-year term after attempting to dissolve the legislature to avoid his own removal.",
      "Boluarte had served as Castillo\u2019s vice president before becoming president, so there was no vice president to take her place when she was removed Friday. Next in line was the president of the Congress, Jer\u00ed.",
      "After Friday's vote, Boluarte spoke on national television, recounting her administration\u2019s achievements.",
      "\u201cI have not thought of myself, but rather of Peruvians,\u201d she said.",
      "Minutes into her speech, the broadcast was interrupted to show Jer\u00ed\u2019s swearing in.",
      "On Friday, the Attorney General's Office asked a judge to prohibit Boluarte from leaving the country while it investigates two cases, one alleged money laundering and the other alleged corruption. The judge did not immediately rule.",
      "In a statement, investigators said that they are looking at money allegedly funneled through Boluarte before her presidency to the fugitive leader of a political party. The other case has to do with Boluarte using her influence as president to do favors for friends, in particular the plastic surgeon who gave her a secret nose job in 2023. She eventually confirmed that she had undergone the procedure.",

Months later, the office announced the investigation was shelved without further explanation. Jer\u00ed denied the accusations in the interview with El Comercio in August.",
      "Jer\u00ed will serve out Boluarte's term as interim president. Elections are scheduled for next April and Boluarte's term was to end July 28, 2026.",
      "There were more than 500 protests demanding Boluarte's resignation in the first three months of her presidency.",

      "On Friday, Boluarte's lawyer Juan Portugal told local radio station RPP that Boluarte was at her home in Lima and had no desire to seek political asylum elsewhere.",

      "Mar\u00eda Corina Machado, a key figure in Venezuela's opposition, has been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize",
      "CARACAS, Venezuela -- CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) \u2014 Mar\u00eda Corina Machado has long been the face of resistance to Venezuela's 26-year ruling party. Now, she may become a symbol of peace, too.",
      "Machado, the Venezuelan opposition powerhouse who commandeered millions of Venezuelans to reject President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in last year's election, on Friday was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for her work \u201cto achieve a just and peaceful transition\u201d of power in the South American country. The award also recognized the seasoned politician for being a \u201cunifying figure\u201d in the fractured opposition.",
      "The award, however, is being granted at a time when opposition supporters are questioning her leadership, including her embrace of U.S. President Donald Trump's Venezuela policy, which has seen Venezuelan migrants sent to an infamous prison in Central America and deadly U.S. military strikes in the Caribbean.",
      "Here are some things to know about Machado:",
      "Machado, an industrial engineer and daughter of a steel magnate, began challenging the ruling party in 2004, when the non-governmental organization she co-founded, S\u00famate, promoted a referendum to recall then-President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez. The initiative failed, and Machado and other S\u00famate executives were charged with conspiracy.",
      "She drew the anger of Ch\u00e1vez and his allies the following year for her Oval Office meeting with then-U.S. President George W. Bush. Ch\u00e1vez considered Bush an adversary.",
      "Her full transformation into a politician would come until 2010, when she was elected to a seat in the National Assembly, receiving more votes than any aspiring lawmaker ever. It was from this position that she boldly interrupted Ch\u00e1vez as he addressed the legislature and called his expropriation of businesses theft.",
      "\u201cAn eagle does not hunt a fly,\u201d he responded. The exchange is seared in voters\u2019 memories.",
      "Machado, 58, sought Venezuela's presidency for the first time in 2012, but she finished third in the race to be the presidential candidate for the Democratic Unity Roundtable.",
      "The ruling party-controlled National Assembly ousted Machado in 2014 and, months later, the Comptroller General\u2019s Office barred her from public office for a year, citing an alleged omission on her asset declaration form. That same year, the government accused her of being involved in an alleged plot to kill Maduro, who succeeded Ch\u00e1vez after his 2013 death.",
      "Machado, a free-market firebrand, denied the charge, calling it an attempt to silence her and opposition members who had called tens of thousands of people to the streets in anti-government protests that at times turned violent.",

      "She kept a low profile for the next nine years, supporting some anti-Maduro initiatives and election boycotts and criticizing opposition efforts to negotiate with the government. By the time she announced a new bid for the presidency in 2023, her careful messaging had softened her image as an elitist hard-liner, allowing her to connect with skeptics on both sides.",
      "She won the opposition's presidential primary with more than 90% of the vote, unifying the faction \u2014 as noted by the Nobel Prize committee. But ruling-party loyalists who control the country\u2019s judiciary kept her from appearing on the ballot, which forced her to throw her support behind former diplomat Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez.",
      "She hiked overpasses, walked highways, rode motorcycles, sought shelter in supporters\u2019 homes and saw her closest collaborators be arrested as she kept campaigning across Venezuela. She repeatedly joined thousands of supporters chanting in unison \u201cFreedom! Freedom! Freedom!\u201d in rallies and asked them to vote for Gonz\u00e1lez, a virtual unknown who had never run for office before.",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez crushed Maduro by a more than two-to-one margin, according to voting machine records collected by the opposition and validated by international observers. Still, Venezuela's National Electoral Council, loyal to the ruling party, declared Maduro the winner of the July 28, 2024, contest.",
      "People protested the results across the country, and the government responded with full force, arresting more than 2,000 people and accusing them of plotting to oust Maduro and sow chaos. Most were released over the following months, but the government simultaneously arrested dozens of people who actively participated in Machado\u2019s efforts last year.",
      "Some of Machado's closest collaborators, including her campaign manager, avoided prison by sheltering for more than a year at a diplomatic compound in Caracas, where they remained until May, when they fled to the U.S.",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez went into exile in Spain after he became the subject of an arrest warrant, and Machado has not been seen in public since January, when she joined people protesting Maduro's planned swearing-in ceremony. Her and Gonz\u00e1lez's inability to stop Maduro from taking the oath of office again led to a decline in support.",
      "People's trust has only shrunk since then, primarily over Machado's unquestionable support for Trump, including the large U.S. maritime deployment in the Caribbean that has carried out deadly strikes off the coast of Venezuela. This has led to fresh divisions within the opposition.",

      "BEIRUT -- BEIRUT (AP) \u2014 Syria's foreign minister arrived in Lebanon's capital on Friday in what observers say could mark a breakthrough in relations between the two neighbors, which have been tense for decades.",
      "Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shibani held talks with his Lebanese counterpart and is expected to meet with President Joseph Aoun and Prime Minister Nawaf Salam. It was the first high-profile Syrian visit to Lebanon since insurgent groups overthrew President Bashar Assad\u2019s government in early December 2024.",
      "Lebanon and Syria have been working to rebuild strained ties, focusing on the status of roughly 2,000 Syrian nationals detained in Lebanese prisons, border security, locating Lebanese nationals missing in Syria for years and facilitating the return of Syrian refugees.",
      "The current Syrian leadership resents Lebanon\u2019s Iran-backed Hezbollah group for taking part in Syria\u2019s civil war, fighting alongside Assad\u2019s forces, while many Lebanese still grudge Syria\u2019s 29-year domination of its smaller neighbor, where it had a military presence for three decades until 2005.",
      "Following their meeting, al-Shibani and Lebanese Foreign Minister Joe Rajji announced at a news conference that the Lebanese-Syrian Higher Council has been suspended and all dealings will be restricted to official diplomatic channels.",
      "Created in 1991, the council symbolized Syria\u2019s influence over Lebanon. Its role declined after Syria\u2019s 2005 withdrawal, the assassination of Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri and the 2008 opening of the Syrian Embassy in Beirut, which marked Syria\u2019s first official recognition of Lebanon as an autonomous state since it gained independence from France in 1943. In recent years, the council was largely inactive, with only limited contact between officials.",
      "In early September, a Syrian delegation, which included two former Cabinet ministers and the head of Syria\u2019s National Commission for Missing Persons, visited Beirut. Lebanon and Syria also agreed at the time to establish two committees to address outstanding key issues.",
      "These efforts are part of a broader regional shift following Assad\u2019s ouster and Hezbollah\u2019s significant losses during its recent war with Israel.",
      "Al-Shibani reiterated Syria\u2019s \u201crespect for Lebanon\u2019s sovereignty,\u201d saying Damascus seeks to \u201cmove past previous obstacles and strengthen bilateral ties.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy visit to Beirut is meant to reaffirm the depth of Syrian-Lebanese relations,\u201d he said.",
      "Many of the Syrians held in Lebanon remain in jail without trial \u2014 about 800 are detained for security-related reasons, including involvement in attacks and shootings.",

      "Meanwhile, Lebanon hosts an estimated 1.5 million Syrian refugees who fled the uprising-turned-civil war that erupted more than 14 years ago. Since Assad\u2019s fall in December, around 850,000 refugees have returned to Syria from neighboring countries as of September, with the number expected to rise, according to UNHCR Deputy High Commissioner Kelly T. Clements. Lebanese authorities granted an exemption to Syrians staying illegally if they left by the end of August.",
      "Syria\u2019s conflict, which began in March 2011, has killed nearly 500,000 people and displaced half the country\u2019s prewar population of 23 million. More than 5 million Syrians fled the country as refugees, most of them to neighboring countries, including Lebanon, which has the highest number of refugees per capita in the world.",
      "Although many Syrians initially hoped for stability after Assad was ousted, sectarian killings against members of Assad\u2019s Alawite minority sect in Syria\u2019s coastal region in March and against the Druze minority in the southern province of Sweida in July claimed hundreds of lives and revived security concerns.",
      "Meanwhile, the Lebanon-Syria border has long been a flashpoint for clashes, with periodic exchanges of fire and infiltration attempts, particularly in the northeastern Bekaa Valley. In March 2025, the two countries signed an agreement to demarcate the border and enhance security coordination, aiming to prevent disputes and curb smuggling and other illicit activities.",
      "Hezbollah has been heavily involved in cross-border smuggling, primarily to move weapons and military supplies, leading to tensions and violent confrontations along the border. Syrian security forces have repeatedly intercepted Hezbollah-linked trucks carrying weapons into Lebanon.",
      "Since the fall of Assad, two Lebanese prime ministers have visited Syria. Aoun and Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa also held talks on the sidelines of an Arab summit in Egypt in March.",

      "French President Emmanuel Macron is set to appoint a new prime minister on Friday to break a political deadlock",
      "PARIS -- PARIS (AP) \u2014 After a week of intense political turmoil, French President Emmanuel Macron is set to appoint a new prime minister Friday in his latest bid to break the political deadlock that has gripped the country for more than a year, as France struggles with mounting economic challenges and ballooning debt.",
      "The appointment is widely seen as the president\u2019s last chance to revive his second term, which runs until 2027. With no majority in the National Assembly to push through his agenda, Macron faces increasingly fierce criticism, even from within his own camp, and has little room to maneuver.",
      "Outgoing Prime Minister S\u00e9bastien Lecornu abruptly resigned Monday, only hours after unveiling a new Cabinet. The shock resignation prompted calls for Macron to step down or dissolve parliament again. But they remained unanswered, with the president instead announcing on Wednesday that he would name a successor within 48 hours.",
      "Over the past year, Macron\u2019s successive minority governments have collapsed in quick succession, leaving the European Union\u2019s second-largest economy mired in political paralysis as France is faced with a debt crisis. At the end of the first quarter of 2025, France\u2019s public debt stood at 3.346 trillion euros ($3.9 trillion), or 114% of gross domestic product.",
      "France\u2019s poverty rate also reached 15.4% in 2023, its highest level since records began in 1996, according to the latest data available from the national statistics institute.",

      "Macron may turn to a figure from the left, which managed to form a coalition in the 2024 legislative elections, or opt for a technocratic government to sidestep partisan deadlock.",
      "In any case, the new prime minister will have to seek compromises to avoid an immediate vote of no confidence and may even be forced to abandon the pension reform that gradually raises the retirement age from 62 to 64. Macron fought fiercely for the deeply unpopular measure, which was enacted into law in 2023 despite mass protests.",
      "Lecornu argued that Macron\u2019s centrist bloc, its allies, and parts of the opposition could still rally to form a working majority. \u201cThere\u2019s a majority that can govern,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel that a path is still possible. It is difficult.\u201d",
      "The stalemate stems from Macron\u2019s shock decision in June 2024 to dissolve the National Assembly. The snap elections produced a hung parliament, with no bloc able to command a majority in the 577-seat chamber. The gridlock has unnerved investors, infuriated voters, and stalled efforts to curb France\u2019s spiraling deficit and public debt.",
      "Without stable support, Macron\u2019s governments have stumbled from one crisis to the next, collapsing as they sought backing for unpopular spending cuts. Lecornu\u2019s resignation, just 14 hours after announcing his Cabinet, underscored the fragility of the president\u2019s coalition amid deep political and personal rivalries.",

Decades ago dubbed Morocco\u2019s \u201cKing of the Poor,\u201d he now faces a public expressing disillusionment with slow progress and widening economic divides.",

      "The speech will come more than a week after protesters sent a letter of demands sent directly to the palace, thrusting the king into the spotlight and upending the careful distance he usually maintains from public debate.

      "A family that runs two costume stores in Chicago is putting a creative twist on Halloween this year due to tariffs on Chinese imports",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 With Halloween on the horizon, Chicago Costume is stuffed. Packaged costumes, including superheros and Japanese animation characters in both kid and adult sizes, dangle near colorful wigs and bottles of fake blood. Downstairs, vintage clothes from the 1970s beg for one more boogie night.",
      "The frightening possibilities mask the work that\u2019s gone on behind the scenes to stock the family-owned shop and its sister store for the spooky season. Owner Courtland Hickey said he ordered 40% fewer costumes this year because of President Donald Trump's tariffs on products from China.",
      "To fill the gap, Hickey and his mother, Chicago Costume founder Mary Hickey Panayotou, looked to their decade's worth of unsold costumes and accessories to see what could be repackaged or repurposed. The tariffs made new imports more expensive, and storewide price increases might spook customers, he said.",
      "\u201cIf people have less money in their pocket to spend, ... then costumes are going to be lower on their list,\u201d Hickey said. \u201cSo the more we have to invest in new products, the riskier it is for the business because we aren\u2019t going to sell it.\u201d",
      "Tapping the old inventory required sorting through several thousand items stored in backrooms and a warehouse. Vintage pieces once reserved for rentals combined with fresh items became sets. A surplus of black robes became the foundation for Halloween wizards, judges, choir members and graduating students, Hickey said.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re a staple piece that gets transformed by the accessories we pair with them,\u201d he said.",
      "Some of Chicago Costume's 35 employees also got busy sewing fabric scraps and foam material into imitations of the miter headdresses worn by high-ranking Catholic clergy. Paired with a robe, the headwear would let someone dress up as Pope Leo, a Chicago native.",
      "Panayotou founded Chicago Costume in 1976 by custom-designing and renting costumes for the Windy City\u2019s theater companies. It fast became a destination for non-actors looking for Halloween outfits.",
      "Commercially made children\u2019s costumes followed, and a stockpile of capes, masquerade masks, \u201cStar Wars\u201d kits and other leftovers grew from there.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m kind of a hoarder,\u201d Panayotou said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to throw stuff away. So there\u2019s a lot of accessory items and pieces. Here\u2019s the dress, but we have only one glove.\u201d",
      "Having excess inventory typically is avoided in retail, but the practice has given Chicago Costume a supply cushion during what has been an unpredictable 2025 for import-reliant segments of the industry, including toy manufacturers and stores.",
      "Hickey said tariffs weren't on his radar until he and and other Chicago Costume staff members met with suppliers at the Halloween & Party Expo in January. Whether Trump would impose duties on Chinese goods after his inauguration the following week was a big topic of conversation at the Las Vegas event, he said.",
      "On Feb. 1, the president signed the first tariff order of his second term. Hickey already had ordered his usual number of new costumes but put fulfillment and delivery on hold when the tariff rate on imports from China ballooned to 145% in April. Nearly 90% of the costumes Chicago Costume sells in stores and online are made in China, in line with the costume industry average, he said.",
      "Some suppliers already had products ready and said they would not charge him extra, Hickey said. Others said he would have to pay more to cover the cost of tariffs. \u201cTake it or leave it,\u201d he recalls being told. \u201cI pretty much left it.\u201d",
      "Other small businesses that rely on Halloween describe similar their own tariff-related woes. Trick or Treat Studios, which designs masks based on characters from popular horror movies as well as costumes and props, laid off 15 employees, one-fourth of its staff, in May, co-founder Christopher Zephro said.",
      "Zephro uses factories in China to make plastic masks but said he is reducing the amount of work done there and shifting it to Mexico, where his latex masks are manufactured. In the meantime, he raised prices by 15%.",

      "At Chicago Costume, which generates well under $1 million dollars in annual sales, shoppers will see fewer sales promotions and discounts, Hickey said. Children\u2019s costumes of officially licensed characters and bulky sets will cost at least 25% more, he said. A lederhosen costume, for example, is priced at $49.99, or $10 more that it did a year ago.",
      "Hickey, who has served on the board of the National Costumers Association for 20 years, initially saw a silver lining in Trump's tariffs. Big retail chains have siphoned sales from independent costume shops with the help of cheap costumes from China, he said.",
      "In May, Hickey published a column on the National Costumers Association's website that outlined Chicago Costume's can-do, environmentally superior approach this year. He hoped it would galvanize the trade group's 100 independent store members \u2014 a group that numbered 220 a decade ago \u2014 to dust off old stock, reorganize their shops and prepare for \u201ca potentially great Halloween.\u201d",
      "Tariffs have \u201cpeeled back the curtain on just how deep our reliance on cheap overseas manufacturing has become,\" he wrote. \u201cIf this shift hurts Amazon dropshippers, Spirit Halloween, or Walmart\u2019s over-imported costume lines, I\u2019m not going to mourn. In fact, I see it as a chance for us to reclaim what made local retail special.\"",
      "Some of Hickey's idealism has since faded. The impact of tariffs on Halloween played out differently than he expected. The largest retail chains doubled down, flooding the market with cheap costumes and dropping prices to hold onto customers.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a lot harder than I hoped, but I still believe that optimism, adaptability, and differentiation are what will keep independent costume shops like us alive,\u201d he said.",
      "Chicago Costume is used to embracing challenges. To keep revenue flowing year-round, the stores cater to cosplay fans and themed parties. The Hickey-Panayotou family has a separate business making mascot costumes for the Chicago Bulls and other professional sports teams, and acquired a theatrical services company founded in 1886 along with its collection of period pieces.",
      "Diversifying made it easier to rotate and refurbish old stock instead of slashing prices after Halloween or throwing pieces away, he said.",
      "For a customer who wanted to be a Hollywood diva, his wife, Erin, who handles social media for Chicago Costume, paired a robe trimmed with feather boas from the vintage collection with a new cigarette holder, hat and pair of sunglasses. Total cost: $65.",
      "Damien Johnson, 53, is a longtime Chicago Costume patron whose birthday is Oct. 31. He has spent as much as $300 on his Halloween getups and said he would never shop online or at discount stores.",
      "Despite his loyalty, Johnson delayed his costume-buying by a month this year. He also gave himself a spending cap. Transforming himself into the clown-faced Pennywise character from Stephen King\u2019s \u201cIt\u201d will come to $90, including hair and makeup.",
      "\u201cI always overbought.\u201d he said. \u201cThis year, I am good.\u201d",

      "\u201cThis wasn\u2019t content created by a third party. These were the companies\u2019 own chatbots working to advance their own depraved internal policies,\" said Prince Harry at Spring Studios in Manhattan Thursday night as he and Markle were named Humanitarians of the Year by the nonprofit Project Healthy Minds. \"But here\u2019s what gives us hope: these families aren\u2019t facing this alone.\u201d",
      "To build their movement of families fighting for online safety, the couple also announced Thursday that their foundation's Parents Network would join forces with ParentsTogether.",
      "Their remarks came at the annual gala for Project Healthy Minds, a Millennial- and Gen Z-driven tech nonprofit that runs a free online marketplace aiming to connect patients with the exact mental health care they seek.",
      "The couple has made youth mental health a cornerstone of their philanthropic work since launching the Archewell Foundation in 2020 after stepping aside as working royals. Through its network for families who have experienced online harm and support of youth-led organizations shaping responsible technology, the nonprofit works to make digital spaces safer.",
      "Prince Harry has previously stressed the need to hold powerful social media companies accountable. He warned last year that young people are experiencing an \u201cepidemic\u201d of anxiety, depression and social isolation driven by negative experiences online.",
      "According to numerous studies, few guardrails exist to mitigate kids' exposure to age-inappropriate content including pornography and violence on social media, where they also face cyberbullying and sexual harassment.",
      "The issue could also be considered personal for the couple. Markle has been open about her mental health struggles due to what she describes as the royal family\u2019s intense pressures and tabloid attacks. Harry's own personal life has been the subject of much tabloid reporting, including targeted phone hacking and surveillance.",
      "Prince Harry brought his awareness campaign to a reception Wednesday night hosted by men's health nonprofit Movember. In a conversation with television journalist Brooke Baldwin, he emphasized that men should not feel isolated because he repeatedly hears the same struggles when he speaks with them.",
      "\u201cThe biggest barrier is the belief that no one will understand,\u201d he said in comments reshared on his blog. \"Loneliness convinces you you\u2019re the only one, which is rarely true.\u201d",
      "\u201cCulture makers\u201d such as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are important voices in mental health conversations because they inspire their enormous audiences to seek care, according to Project Healthy Minds CEO Phil Schermer.",

      "Trump ordered approval of the Ambler Road project earlier this week, saying it will unlock access to copper, cobalt and other critical minerals that the United States needs to compete with China on artificial intelligence and other resource development. Copper is used in the production of cars, electronics and even renewable energy technologies such as wind turbines.",
      "The road was approved in Trump\u2019s first term, but was later blocked by Biden after an analysis determined the project would threaten caribou and other wildlife and harm Alaska Native tribes that rely on hunting and fishing.",
      "The Biden-era restrictions also included a block on new mining leases in the nation's most productive coal-producing region, the Powder River Basin in Montana and Wyoming. On Monday, the Trump administration held the biggest coal sale in that area in more than a decade, drawing a single bid of $186,000 for 167.5 million tons of coal, or about a tenth of a penny per ton.",
      "Trump has largely cast aside Biden's goal to reduce climate-warming emissions from the burning of coal and other fossil fuels extracted from federal land. Instead, he and congressional Republicans have moved to open more taxpayer-owned land to fossil fuel development, hoping to create more jobs and revenue. The Republican administration also has pushed to develop critical minerals, including copper, cobalt, gold and zinc.",
      "A decision on whether to accept the recent bid from the Navajo Transitional Energy Co. is pending, and the lease cannot be issued until the Montana land plan is altered. The dirt-cheap value reflects dampened industry interest in coal despite Trump's efforts. Many utilities have switched to cheaper natural gas or renewables such as wind and solar power.",
      "Administration officials expressed disappointment that they did not receive \u201cstronger participation\u201d in the Montana sale. In a statement, Interior Department spokesperson Aubrie Spady blamed a \u201cdecades long war on coal\u201d by Biden and former Democratic President Barack Obama.",
      "Republican Sen. Tim Sheehy of Montana said the repeal of the land-management plan in his state was \u201cputting an end to disastrous Biden-era regulations that put our resource economy on life support.\u201d",

      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom has signed a bill to prevent the state\u2019s plan that provides insurance to homeowners who can\u2019t get private coverage from running out of money",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) \u2014 California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bipartisan bill Thursday that aims to prevent the state's home insurer of last resort from running out of money following a natural disaster.",
      "The FAIR Plan is an insurance pool that provides policies to people who can\u2019t get private insurance because their properties are deemed too risky to insure. The number of homeowners forced onto the FAIR Plan has skyrocketed. With high premiums and basic coverage, the plan is designed as a temporary option until homeowners can find permanent coverage.",
      "But more Californians are relying on it than ever as increasingly devastating and destructive fires spark across the state, including in densely populated areas. There were nearly 600,000 home policies on the FAIR Plan as of June. Leaders of the plan last year warned state lawmakers that it could go insolvent after a major wildfire or disaster.",
      "That reality came true earlier this year after wildfires swept through Los Angeles and destroyed more than 17,000 structures. The plan faced a loss of roughly $4 billion and needed a $1 billion bailout from private insurers to pay out claims. Half of that cost is expected to be passed onto all policyholders.",
      "The law Newsom signed allows the FAIR Plan to request state-backed loans and bonds and spread out claims payments over multiple years after a disaster. Insurance companies were previously required to pay the full bailout within 30 days. Supporters of the new law said it will prevent the need for future bailouts that raise rates for everyone.",
      "\u201cThe kinds of climate-fueled firestorms like we saw in January will only continue to worsen over time. That\u2019s why we\u2019re taking action now to continue strengthening California\u2019s insurance market to be more resilient in the face of the climate crisis,\" Newsom said in a statement.",

      "Newsom also signed another bill to expand the FAIR Plan board, which currently consists of nine voting insurers and four nonvoting members appointed by the governor. The new law adds two representatives from the Legislature to serve as non-voting members on the board.",
      "Supporters, including the state\u2019s top insurance regulator, said the law adds a new layer of oversight and transparency. Opponents said it wouldn't make a difference because the new members don't have any voting power.",
      "California is undergoing a yearslong effort to stabilize its insurance market after several major insurance companies either paused or restricted new business in the state in 2023, which pushed hundreds of thousands of homeowners onto the FAIR Plan. Wildfires are becoming more common and destructive in California because of climate change, and insurers say that is making it difficult to truly price the risk on properties.",
      "Of the top 20 most destructive wildfires in state history, 15 have occurred since 2015, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.",
      "The state now gives insurers more latitude to raise premiums in exchange for issuing more policies in high-risk areas. That includes regulations allowing insurers to consider climate change when setting their prices and allowing them pass on the costs of reinsurance to California consumers.",

      "MILAN -- MILAN (AP) \u2014 Italian luxury sports carmaker Ferrari raised its 2025 guidance on Thursday, despite global 15% tariffs on foreign car imports to the United States, as the company unveiled the new powertrain and chassis of its first fully electric production vehicle.",
      "Ferrari CEO Benedetto Vigna declined to give target production numbers or a price for the Ferrari Elettrica, which will be delivered beginning late next year, with the design to be revealed in the spring.",
      "Under the carmaker\u2019s new five-year plan, 40% of the product lineup will be the brand\u2019s core internal combustion engines, 40% will be hybrid and 20% will be electric by 2030, with an average of four new launches a year in the period. The new business plan calls for more models with lower volumes of each.",
      "The fully electric vehicle Ferrari Elettrica represents a new segment that Vigna said would bring new buyers to Ferrari. It builds on 15 years of electrification research at Ferrari, starting with Formula 1 technology that was first incorporated into the limited edition La Ferrari hybrid supercar that debuted in 2013.",
      "To maintain the sports car feel and emotions integral to the Ferrari experience, the Elettrica will capture powertrain vibration through accelerometers on the rear axle that will be amplified to create a sports car roar. Drivers also can select five power levels using steering panels to create the sensation of continuous acceleration.",
      "Ferrari also is manufacturing most critical components internally, including the battery system and software. The chassis and body shell will be made out of 75% recycled aluminum, saving 6.7 tons of carbon dioxide per vehicle.",

      "In 2013, mired in debt, Detroit filed for bankruptcy",
      "DETROIT -- DETROIT (AP) \u2014 Before the arrival of sprawling suburban malls featuring amusement park rides and stores peddling anything from jeans to jelly beans, there was Hudson's in downtown Detroit.",
      "The towering department store mirrored the growth and opulence of the auto-manufacturing town, but its fortunes \u2014 like the city\u2019s \u2014 soured with population shifts and economic downturns.",
      "In 1998, more than a century after J.L. Hudson's Co. opened shop, the 25-story building was demolished, leaving \u2014 literally and figuratively \u2014 a deep hole as a reminder of what Detroit used to be.",
      "Until this year.",
      "Standing on the Woodward Avenue site are a gleaming 45-story tower and a 12-story office building. The new 1.5 million-square-foot (140,000-square-meter) Hudson's Detroit development also contains retail space and will feature high-end condos. General Motors Corp. is relocating its headquarters there and a five-star hotel is slated to open in 2027.",
      "\u201cPeople are saying this isn\u2019t your father\u2019s or grandfather\u2019s Detroit anymore,\" said Dan Gilbert, whose property management company Bedrock developed the $1.5 billion construction. \u201cYou don\u2019t even have to look at the numbers. You can just feel it walking around \u2014 you\u2019re going to feel a different Detroit.\u201d",
      "The old Hudson's building commanded attention and demanded respect, according to Jeremy Dimick, director of collections at the Detroit Historical Society. The new one is just as impressive. Its tower rises 685 feet (210 meters) over downtown Detroit.",
      "Its arrival is the latest chapter in the city's recovery.",
      "Mired in debt, Detroit once struggled to pay its bills and keep the streetlights on. It filed for bankruptcy in 2013, when its credit rating was at junk bond status.",
      "The city emerged from bankruptcy in 2014, built up a general fund balance of more than $1 billion, and has since recorded 10 consecutive years of budget surpluses. Moody\u2019s Investment Services gave Detroit its 11th consecutive credit rating upgrade this year and named the Hudson's development in its report.",
      "\u201cYou feel the energy when you\u2019re walking downtown,\u201d said Gilbert, whose company, Bedrock, owns more than 100 properties in downtown Detroit. \u201cThere\u2019s been just significant change.\"",
      "Launched in Detroit in 1881, the J.L. Hudson store initially specialized in clothing for men and boys. After occupying various downtown spaces, it set up shop at the Woodward Avenue site a decade later and expanded its wares, according to the Detroit Historical Society.",
      "The building grew over the years. About a dozen of its eventual 25 stories were used as retail space in what was considered the world's tallest department store for more than half a century.",
      "Dimick called it a Detroit institution.",
      "\u201cThat was the reason to go downtown,\u201d he said. \"It had been around so long that it became this multigenerational experience of shopping. \u2018I went there with my parents and I\u2019m going to take my children.'\"",
      "The grand department store offered fine linen, tableware and kitchen appliances. Factory workers could find overalls there. But most of all, Hudson's provided holiday magic.",
      "Bedecked in color, sounds and excitement, it was the center of downtown festivities. Thousands of shoppers entered the store every day, moving from department to department on escalators and in elevators. The longest line was of children waiting to sit on Santa's lap and whisper wishes of gifts.",

      "\u201cIt will feel like back in the day,\u201d he said.",
      "It was a grand and exciting time to be a Detroiter until \u2014 like many big manufacturing hubs \u2014 the city began to change. New freeways were built. Middle- and upper-class families left the city for new suburban homes with big yards.",
      "In the mid-1950s, Northland Center \u2014 then the largest mall in the U.S. \u2014 opened just north of Detroit, providing more options for suburban shoppers.",
      "Detroit reached its population peak of 1.8 million that decade before a trickle of people leaving became a flood, taking their money with them and hitting Hudson's bottom line. The city's population only started to see growth again in 2023.",
      "The old Hudson\u2019s building downsized and eventually closed in 1983. It was imploded into a hulking mound of rubble, stone, steel and dust on Oct. 24, 1998.",
      "\u201cIt was sad,\u201d remembers Bullock, who watched the implosion from her brother-in-law's downtown apartment.",
      "What was left was worse.",
      "\u201cIf you put all your stock, memory and nostalgia into this one place, when that place goes away it leaves you with a literal and figurative hole,\u201d Dimick said.",
      "Gilbert, 63, says it will take decades to get a return on his Hudson's investment, but that isn't the point of the development.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re doing this for ourselves,\" the fourth-generation Detroiter said, \"but we\u2019re also doing it for the city.\u201d",

      "The franchise won its third WNBA championship in four seasons, completing a sweep of Phoenix in the best-of-seven Finals on Friday night. Only Houston has done better over a four-season span, winning the first four titles in WNBA history from 1997-2000.",
      "Wilson was a huge reason why the Aces were champions again after falling in the semifinals last season. She became the first player to win the regular-season MVP, Defensive Player of the Year and Finals MVP in the same season. The 29-year-old forward was the best player on the court and is already in the conversation for the greatest in league history.",
      "Wilson averaged 28.5 points, 11.8 rebounds and two blocks in the Finals.",
      "\u201cYou have your Mount Rushmore, she\u2019s alone on Everest,\u201d Aces coach Becky Hammon said. \u201cThere\u2019s no one around.\u201d",
      "Whether Las Vegas can keep its run going depends a lot on how negotiations for a new collective bargaining agreement go. Most of the Aces, like a majority of players in the league, are free agents. The team could look very different next season if players decide to go elsewhere.",
      "If Wilson, Jackie Young, Chelsea Gray and Jewell Loyd decide to stay, the Aces could keep this run going for a while. With a fourth title, Las Vegas would match Houston, Seattle and Minnesota for the most in league history.",
      "\u201cVegas is the standard. We\u2019re here for a reason. Took a little bit to get here,\u201d Young said. \u201cProud to put on a Aces uniform every night.\u201d",
      "This might have been the most difficult of Las Vegas' championships. The Aces had a 14-14 record in early August and were coming off a record-breaking 53-point home loss to Minnesota. That defeat could have torn the team apart, but instead it grew closer, and Las Vegas didn't lose a game during the rest of the regular season, winning 16 straight. Including playoffs, the Aces went 25-3 after that loss.",

      "\u201cThis one hits different because it was different,\u201d said Hammon, who is 10-2 in the WNBA Finals. \u201cThere was a lot more adversity then any of us anticipated. At the end of day we\u2019re all humans. We wanted to get it right and get it right together.\u201d",
      "This Finals, which was the first best-of-seven series in league history, only lasted four games. The series was a bit more competitive than the sweep would indicate as Phoenix had a chance in Game 1, missing two late free throws. Wilson hit a game-winner with 0.3 seconds left in Game 3.",

      "\u201cTo me, that's embarrassing. I feel bad that I was tossed. Been around this game a long time. I think it's one of the weakest double technicals ever,\u201d Tibbetts said. \u201cI didn't even know I got the second one, to be completely honest. I don't understand it.\u201d",

      "The Philadelphia Phillies face a challenging offseason after their playoff exit against the Los Angeles Dodgers",
      "PHILADELPHIA -- PHILADELPHIA (AP) \u2014 Orion Kerkering airmailed a throw into the Los Angeles night that not only unimaginably ended the Phillies\u2019 season \u2014 it all but ended the run of the core of a roster that suffered through four straight postseasons without a World Series title.",
      "NL home run and RBI champion Kyle Schwarber, veteran catcher J.T. Realmuto and rotation stalwart Ranger Su\u00e1rez are all free agents. Outfielder Harrison Bader, who raised his value with a dynamite two months with the Phillies, has a mutual option he is sure to decline.",
      "And what about manager Rob Thomson? Thomson has guided the Phillies through four playoff berths in his four seasons in charge. He led them to the 2022 World Series (where they lost to Houston) and the Phillies did just win their second straight NL East title.",
      "The ring is the thing and the Phillies fell shy again of winning their first championship since 2008. That failure could weigh heavily on managing partner John Middleton and team president Dave Dombrowski's call to bring back Thomson for a fifth season or start fresh with a new manager and a roster makeover after years of essentially running it back with the same core.",
      "The Phillies could lose valuable pieces to more than just free agency in the offseason.",
      "What will they do with right fielder Nick Castellanos \u2014- who has one year left on the five-year, $100 million deal signed ahead of the 2022 season \u2014 who seemed unhappy and cited personal issues with Thomson after losing his starting job late in the season?",
      "Jos\u00e9 Alvarado has a club option for 2026 but are the Phillies really keen on keeping the left-hand reliever who served an 80-game suspension and was left off the postseason roster for violating baseball\u2019s performance-enhancing drugs policy?",
      "The real question that has haunted the Phillies in each of the last three playoff years is this: How do the Phillies \u2014 with a $291.7 million payroll \u2014 snap out of the same October pattern of frigid bats from their highest-priced players that doomed them again against the Dodgers?",
      "Kerkering's errant throw was only the final shovel of dirt on a playoff hole dug deep by a collapse at the plate from Schwarber, Bryce Harper and Trea Turner. Harper and Turner aren't going anywhere and top minor league prospects such as starting pitcher Andrew Painter, outfielder Justin Crawford and infielder Aidan Miller are on the brink of joining the big leagues.",
      "So what's next?",
      "The 62-year-old Thomson is on the short list of greatest managers in franchise history. Outside of Castellanos, Thomson is generally well-liked and highly-regarded inside the clubhouse. His decision-making had some hits \u2014 such as the Aaron Nola-Su\u00e1rez pitching combo in Game 3 \u2014 and misses \u2014 a rally-killing Bryson Stott in the the ninth inning of Game 2 \u2014 in the NL Division Series. He's 346-251 (.580) in the regular season and that kind of record usually doesn't get managers fired.",
      "Whiffing his way down the postseason ladder \u2014- losing in the 2022 World Series; the 2023 NL Championship Series and two straight defeats in the NLDS \u2014 raises some concern about Thomson's job security.",
      "\u201cIt's out of my control,\u201d Thomson said. \u201cI\u2019m not even thinking about it. I\u2019ve got 60 people in there that are brokenhearted right now. So I\u2019m thinking about that more so than my job right now.\u201d",
      "Harper \u2014 who has six years left on his 13-year, $330 million contract \u2014 and Turner both stumped for Thomson to return.",
      "Yes, they both like the affable Canadian. Yet, there's a tinge of guilt that their postseason slumps are the bulk of the reason why the Phillies are home empty-handed in October.",
      "Turner went 4-for-17 with no homers and three RBIs in the NLDS while Schwarber went 3-for-16 (with two homers in Game 3) and Harper was just 3-for-15 with no home runs and no RBIs. Throw out Game 3's offensive outburst, and Turner-Schwarber-Harper went a combined 3-for-35 in the series. Castellanos, Stott and outfielder Max Kepler all hit under .200 in the series.",

      "Facial hair is making a comeback for the New York Islanders after Lou Lamoriello's departure",
      "EAST MEADOW, N.Y. -- EAST MEADOW, N.Y. (AP) \u2014 Images from the New York Islanders\u2019 annual charity golf outing last month on social media went viral because something was very different about some of the familiar faces fans have seen for years.",
      "Many had beards on them.",
      "Facial hair is back in style on Long Island in the post-Lou Lamoriello era. The old-school hockey executive during his seven years in charge had a policy, much like late New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner, requiring players, coaches and staff to be clean shaven.",
      "Lamoriello's contract was not renewed last spring, and the beards have returned for coach Patrick Roy and many of the Islanders. Goaltender Ilya Sorokin even has one for the first time in his NHL career.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one less thing to worry about when you come to the rink,\u201d forward and beard aficionado Kyle Palmieri said. \u201cI think it was part of our team standard to be clean-shaven, and I had no issues with it other than having to go through a lot of razors.\u201d",
      "Those razors shelved for now for some, players are quick to praise Lamoriello, a three-time Stanley Cup-winning general manager in New Jersey who also spent time in Toronto and brought with him a level of decorum and class that they appreciated.",
      "\u201cWe all respected Lou\u2019s rules in here, and rules are rules,\u201d defenseman Ryan Pulock said. \u201cGuys look presentable at all times when we were clean-shaven.\u201d",
      "Fourth-liner Casey Cizikas is the organization's longest-tenured player and has run the gamut from stubble and full beards to a Movember mustache. He put the razor away and let his next beard start growing as soon as last season ended.",
      "\u201cI shaved once throughout the summer,\" Cizikas said on the first day of training camp. \u201cBut (I am) just going in, seeing how it looked and here we are.\u201d",
      "There are a lot of fresh faces around this fall who were brought in by new GM Mathieu Darche, a retired player with a pair of championship rings from his time in Tampa Bay's front office. Darche considers himself lucky to arrive after the Islanders won the draft lottery for the No. 1 pick and the chance to select defenseman Matthew Schaefer, who has already made a strong impression and on Thursday night became the youngest player in league history to record a point in his debut.",
      "Schaefer, for what it's worth, just turned 18 and is clean-shaven. Maybe he'll follow Sidney Crosby's lead and keep the facial hair to a minimum well into his 30s.",

      "Brazil, which beat South Korea 4-1 at the 2022 World Cup, again proved too strong for the hosts in the friendly match watched by 66,000 fans at a wet Seoul World Cup Stadium. Brazil claimed just its third win in 12 away games.",

      "Arctic seals are being pushed closer to extinction by climate change and more than half of bird species around the world are declining under pressure from deforestation and agricultural expansion, according to an annual assessment from the International Union for Conservation of Nature.",
      "One bright spot is green sea turtles, which have recovered substantially thanks to decades of conservation efforts, the IUCN said Friday as it released its latest Red List of Threatened Species.",
      "While many animals are increasingly at risk of disappearing forever, the updated list shows how species can come back from the brink with dedicated effort, Rima Jabado, deputy chair of the IUCN Species Survival Commission, told The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cHope and concern go hand in hand in this work,\u201d Jabado wrote by email. \u201cThe same persistence that brought back the green sea turtle can be mirrored in small, everyday actions \u2014 supporting sustainable choices, backing conservation initiatives, and urging leaders to follow through on their environmental promises.\u201d",
      "The list is updated every year by teams of scientists assessing data on creatures around the world. The scope of the work is enormous and important for science, said Andrew Farnsworth, a visiting scientist at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology who studies bird migration and wasn't involved with the IUCN report.",
      "\u201cEvery time one is done and every time there\u2019s revision, there\u2019s more information, and there\u2019s more ability to answer questions\u201d on species, some of which are still largely a mystery to researchers, Farnsworth said.",
      "Because all the marine mammals native to the Arctic \u2014 seals, whales and polar bears \u2014 rely on the habitat provided by sea ice, they're all at risk as it diminishes because of human-caused climate change, said Kit Kovacs, co-chair of IUCN\u2019s Species Survival Commission Pinniped Specialist Group, which focuses on seals.",
      "The three species highlighted in the latest IUCN report \u2014 harp, hooded and bearded seals \u2014 have been moved up to a designation of greater concern in the latest update, indicating they are increasingly threatened by extinction, Kovacs said.",
      "The same melting of glaciers and sea ice destroying seal habitats also \u201cgenerally will bring escalation in extreme weather events, which are already impacting people around the globe,\u201d wrote Kovacs.",
      "\u201cActing to help seals is acting to help humanity when it comes to climate change,\u201d Kovacs said.",
      "The update also highlighted Madagascar, West Africa and Central America, where Schlegel\u2019s asity, the black-casqued hornbill and the tail-bobbing northern nightingale-wren were all moved to near-threatened status. Those are three specific birds in trouble, but numbers are dropping for around three-fifths of birds globally.",
      "Deforestation of tropical forests is one of a \u201cdepressing litany of threats\u201d to birds, a list that includes agricultural expansion and intensification, competition from invasive species and climate change, said Stuart Butchart, chief scientist at BirdLife International.",

      "DENVER -- DENVER (AP) \u2014 Voting equipment company Dominion Voting Systems, a target of false conspiracy theories from President Donald Trump and his supporters since the 2020 election, has been bought by a firm run by a former Republican elections official, the new company announced Thursday.",
      "The newly formed company, Liberty Vote, also vowed to follow the executive order Trump signed last spring seeking sweeping changes to election policies that multiple judges have put on hold for violating the Constitution.",
      "KNOWiNK, a St. Louis-based provider of electronic poll books that allow election officials to confirm voter information, announced the deal and the name change. In a possible nod to a groundless conspiracy theory that linked Dominion to the late Venezuelan dictator Hugo Chavez, the release highlighted that the company would become \u201c100% American-owned.\u201d",
      "The announcement also quotes KNOWiNK's owner, former St. Louis elections director Scott Leiendecker, as vowing to provide \u201celection technology that prioritizes paper-based transparency,\u201d one of the longtime demands of election conspiracy theorists. Almost all U.S. voting equipment already leaves a paper trail.",
      "Dominion\u2019s former CEO confirmed the sale in a single-sentence statement on Thursday: \u201cLiberty Vote has acquired Dominion Voting Systems,\u201d John Poulos said.",
      "The release from the new company vows to reintroduce \u201chand-marked paper ballots\u201d and adjust company policies to follow Trump's executive order on voting procedures, which is not in effect because judges have ruled that Trump doesn't have the power to mandate them. Part of the president's order sought to prohibit voting equipment that produces a paper record with \u201ca barcode or quick-response code\u201d \u2014 equipment that is currently in use in hundreds of counties across 19 states.",
      "Denver-based Dominion was at the heart of some of the most fevered conspiracy theories about Trump's loss to Democrat Joe Biden in the 2020 election., Those false allegations sparked a number of defamation lawsuits against conservative-leaning media and the president's allies, including a settlement in 2023 in which Fox News agreed to pay Dominion $787 million and one this year that Newsmax settled for $67 million.",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Federal auto safety regulators have opened yet another investigation into Tesla's so-called full-self driving technology after dozens of incidents in which its vehicles ran red lights or drove on the wrong side of the road, sometimes crashing into other vehicles and injuring people.",
      "The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said in a filing dated Tuesday that it has 58 incident reports of Tesla vehicles violating traffic safety laws while operating in full self-driving mode. In reports to regulators, many of the Tesla drivers said the cars gave them no warning about the unexpected behavior.",
      "The probe covers 2,882,566 vehicles, essentially all Teslas equipped with full self-driving technology, or FSD, of which there are two types. Level 2 driver-assistance software, or \u201cFull Self-Driving (Supervised),\u201d requires drivers to pay full attention to the road. The company is still testing a version that does not require driver intervention, something that the automaker's owner and CEO Elon Musk has been promising to roll out for years.",
      "The new investigation follows a host of other probes into the FSD feature on Teslas, which has been blamed for several injuries and deaths. Tesla has repeatedly said the system cannot drive itself and human drivers must be ready to intervene at all times.",
      "Tesla is also under investigation by NHTSA for a \u201csummon\u201d technology that allows drivers to tell their cars to drive to their location to pick them up, a feature that has reportedly led to some fender benders in parking lots. A probe into driver-assistance features in 2.4 million Teslas was opened last year after several crashes in fog and other low-visibility conditions, including one in which a pedestrian was killed.",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 La Nina, the cooler and at times costlier flip side of El Nino, has arrived to warp weather worldwide, meteorologists said Thursday. This natural weather phenomenon often turbocharges the Atlantic hurricane season, but this La Nina may be too weak and fleeting to cause much trouble.",
      "In the United States, La Nina often means more precipitation \u2014 including possible snowstorms \u2014 in northern areas and winter dryness in the South. It can bring heavier rains in Indonesia, the Philippines, parts of Australia, Central America, northern South America and southeastern Africa. It also can mean drought in the Middle East, eastern Argentina, eastern China, Korea and southern Japan, meteorologists said.",
      "A La Nina occurs when certain parts of the Central Pacific Ocean cool by half a degree Celsius (0.9 degrees Fahrenheit) compared to normal. The world had been flirting with one this year and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration declared Thursday that La Nina conditions have formed. But it's likely to be not very strong and may disappear in the next few months, based on multi-factor computer model forecasts by NOAA and Columbia University, said Michelle L'Heureux, lead scientist on the NOAA team that studies both La Nina and El Nino.",
      "\"There is a three out of four chance it will remain a weak event,\" L'Heureux said in an email. \u201cA weaker event tends to exert less of an influence on the global circulation, so it's possible there will be surprises ahead.\u201d",
      "Surprising already describes the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, which was forecast to be stronger than normal, but so far is a tad below average in activity. Traditionally, during a La Nina, there's a weakening of the wind shear that hampers hurricane formation and strengthening, allowing more and bigger storms, especially later in the year, such as late October and into early November and in the Caribbean, said University of Albany hurricane expert Brian Tang.",
      "But Brian McNoldy, who studies tropical cyclones, sea level rise and extreme heat at the University of Miami, said he thinks this La Nina is too late and too little to do much.",
      "The conditions, especially wind shear, favor more hurricane activity, yet it's not happening and long-range computer models don't show much forming for the next couple weeks, said Colorado State University hurricane expert Phil Klotzbach.",

      "Financial institutions are raising concerns about a potential AI investment bubble",
      "LONDON -- LONDON (AP) \u2014 Lingering doubts about the economic promise of artificial intelligence technology are starting to get the attention of financial institutions that raised warning flags this week about an AI investment bubble.",
      "Officials at the Bank of England on Wednesday flagged the growing risk that tech stock prices pumped up by the AI boom could burst.",
      "\u201cThe risk of a sharp market correction has increased,\u201d the U.K. central bank said.",
      "The head of the International Monetary Fund raised a similar alarm hours after the Bank of England\u2019s report.",
      "Global stock prices have been surging, fired up by \u201coptimism about the productivity-enhancing potential of AI,\u201d IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said.",
      "But financial conditions could \u201cturn abruptly,\u201d she warned in a speech ahead of the organization\u2019s annual meeting next week in Washington.",
      "\u201cBubbles obviously are never very easy to identify, but we can see there are a few potential symptoms of a bubble in the current situation,\u201d said Adam Slater, lead economist at Oxford Economics.",
      "Those symptoms include rapid growth in tech stock prices, the fact that tech stocks now comprise about 40% of the S&P 500, market valuations that appear \u201cstretched\u201d beyond their worth and \u201ca general sense of extreme optimism in terms of the underlying technology, despite the enormous uncertainties around what this technology might ultimately yield,\u201d Slater said.",
      "The most optimistic projections about the fruits of generative AI products foresee a transformation of the economy, leading to annual productivity gains that Slater says have not been seen since the reconstruction of Europe after World War II. At the lower end, economist Daron Acemoglu of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has predicted a \u201cnontrivial but modest\u201d U.S. productivity gain of just 0.7% over a decade.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve got this incredibly wide range of possibilities,\u201d Slater said. \u201cNobody really knows where it\u2019s going to land.\u201d",
      "Investors have closely watched a series of intertwined deals over recent months between top AI developers such as OpenAI, maker of ChatGPT, and the companies building the costly computer chips and data centers needed to power these AI products.",
      "OpenAI doesn't turn a profit but the privately held San Francisco firm is now the world's most valuable startup, with a market valuation of $500 billion. It recently signed major deals with chipmaker Nvidia, the world's most valuable publicly traded company, and its rival AMD.",
      "The Bank of England didn't name any specific companies but said that on \u201ca number of measures, equity market valuations appear stretched, particularly for technology companies focused on Artificial Intelligence.\u201d",
      "The report said stock market valuations are \u201ccomparable to the peak\u201d of the 2000 dotcom bubble, which then deflated and led to a recession. With tech stocks accounting for an increasingly large share of benchmark stock indexes, stock markets are \u201cparticularly exposed should expectations around the impact of AI become less optimistic.\u201d",
      "The bank outlined so-called downside risks, including shortages of electricity, data or chips that could slow AI progress, or technological changes that could lessen the need for the type of AI infrastructure currently being built around the world.",
      "The IMF's Georgieva said current stock valuations \u201care heading toward levels we saw during the bullishness about the internet 25 years ago. If a sharp correction were to occur, tighter financial conditions could drag down world growth,\u201d she said.",

      "When Associated Press photographer Lindsey Wasson knocked on the door of Mary E. Brunkow's Seattle home around 4 a.m. local time Monday, it was the scientist's dog who woke up first. Zelda's barking roused Brunkow's husband, Ross Colquhoun.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think he really knew what I was there for,\" Wasson said. \"And I said, \u2018You know, sir, I think your wife just won the Nobel Prize.'\u201d",

      "\"Don\u2019t be ridiculous,\" she told her husband.",
      "But it was true. The trio had, in research dating back two decades, uncovered a key pathway the body uses to keep the immune system in check, called peripheral immune tolerance. Experts called the findings critical to understanding autoimmune diseases such as Type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis and lupus.",
      "The following day, AP photographers Mark J. Terrill and Damian Dovarganes headed to Santa Barbara, California, to find physicist John Martinis before the sun rose. His wife, Jean, answered the door and told them to come back later: Martinis needed to sleep.",
      "\u201cFor many years, we would stay up on the night the physics award was announced,\u201d she told the photographers. \u201cAt some point we just decided, that's nuts. We'll figure it out if it's happening, but let's just get our sleep.\u201d",
      "She added, laughing: \u201cI was trying to think how I can introduce this. Like, 'Do you think you should plan a trip to Sweden?\"",

They have the potential to supercharge computing and communications.",
      "The 100-year-old field of quantum mechanics deals with the seemingly impossible subatomic world where switches can be on-and-off at the same time and parts of atoms tunnel through what seems like impenetrable barriers.",

      "The work is a crucial building block in the fast-developing world of quantum mechanics.",
      "\u201cQuantum computers is one very sort of obvious use, but they\u2019re also can be used for quantum sensors, so to be able to make very sensitive measurements of, for example, magnetic fields, and perhaps also for cryptography, so to encode information so it cannot be easily listened to by a third party,\u201d Mark Pearce, a professor of astrophysics and Nobel Physics Committee member, told The Associated Press.",
      "Quantum computing when fully achieved would be a large leap from what we now know, scientists said.",

      "Both Bagger and Fitzgerald said it\u2019s a bit of a stretch to say our everyday cellphones now use the breakthrough made by Clarke and colleagues. But ultra-sensitive measuring devices rely on that team\u2019s work and while we could have magnetic resonance imaging (MRIs) without their work, it makes it far more sensitive and useful, Bagger said.",

      "The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday refused to protect Google from a year-old order requiring a major makeover of its Android app store that's designed to unleash more competition against a system that a jury declared an illegal monopoly.",
      "The rebuff delivered in a one-sentence decision by the Supreme Court means Google will soon have to start an overhaul of its Play Store for the apps running on the Android software that powers most smartphones that compete against Apple's iPhone in the U.S.",
      "Among other changes, U.S. District Judge James Donato last October ordered Google to give its competitors access to its entire inventory of Android apps and also make those alternative options available to download from the Play Store.",
      "In a filing last month, Google told the U.S. Supreme Court that Donato's order would expose the Play Store's more than 100 million U.S. users to \u201cenormous security and safety risks by enabling stores that stock malicious, deceptive, or pirated content to proliferate.\"",
      "Google also said it faced an Oct. 22 deadline to begin complying with the judge's order if the Supreme Court didn't grant its request for a stay. The Mountain View, California, company was seeking the protection while pursuing a last-ditch attempt to overturn the December 2023 jury verdict that condemned the Play Store as an abusive monopoly.",
      "In a statement, Google said it will continue its fight in the Supreme Court while submitting to what it believes is a problematic order. \u201cThe changes ordered by the U.S. District Court will jeopardize users\u2019 ability to safely download apps,\u201d Google warned.",
      "Google had been insulated from the order while trying to overturn it and the monopoly verdict, but the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected that attempt in a decision issued two months ago.",
      "In its filing with the Supreme Court, Google argued it was being unfairly turned into a supplier and distributor for would-be rivals.",
      "Donato concluded the digital walls shielding the Play Store from competition needed to be torn down to counteract a pattern of abusive behavior. The conduct had enabled Google to to reap billions of dollars in annual profits, primarily from its exclusive control of a payment processing system that collected a 15-30% fee on in-app transactions.",

      "STOCKHOLM -- STOCKHOLM (AP) \u2014 Mary E. Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell and Dr. Shimon Sakaguchi won the Nobel Prize in medicine on Monday for their discoveries concerning peripheral immune tolerance.",
      "Brunkow, 64, is a senior program manager at the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle. Ramsdell, 64, is a scientific adviser for Sonoma Biotherapeutics in San Francisco. Sakaguchi, 74, is a distinguished professor at the Immunology Frontier Research Center at Osaka University in Japan.",
      "Brunkow got the news of her prize from an AP photographer who came to her home in the early hours of the morning.",
      "She said she had ignored the earlier call from the Nobel committee. \u201cMy phone rang and I saw a number from Sweden and thought: \u2018That\u2019s just, that\u2019s spam of some sort.'\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen I told Mary she won, she said, \u2018don\u2019t be ridiculous,\u2019\u201d said her husband, Ross Colquhoun.",
      "\u201cIt was a nice surprise,\u201d Sakaguchi told a news conference from the University of Osaka in western Japan. \u201cI hope researches into the area will further progress so that our findings can be used in treatment, and I hope we can contribute to that as well.\u201d",
      "The immune system has many overlapping systems to detect and fight bacteria, viruses and other bad actors. Key immune warriors such as T cells get trained on how to spot bad actors. If some instead go awry in a way that might trigger autoimmune diseases, they\u2019re supposed to be eliminated in the thymus \u2014 a process called central tolerance.",
      "The Nobel winners unraveled an additional way the body keeps the system in check.",
      "The Nobel Committee said it started with Sakaguchi\u2019s discovery in 1995 of a previously unknown T cell subtype now known as regulatory T cells or T-regs. Then in 2001, Brunkow and Ramsdell discovered a culprit mutation in a gene named Foxp3, a gene that also plays a role in a rare human autoimmune disease.",
      "The Nobel Committee said two years later, Sakaguchi linked the discoveries to show that the Foxp3 gene controls the development of those T-regs \u2014 which in turn act as a security guard to find and curb other forms of T cells that overreact.",
      "Brunkow said she and Ramsdell were working together at a small biotech company and they were investigating why a particular strain of mice had an over-active immune system. They had to work with brand new techniques to find the mouse gene behind the problem \u2014 but quickly realized it could be a major player in human health, too",
      "\u201cFrom a DNA level, it was a really small alteration that caused this massive change to how the immune system works.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "ACA enhanced subsidies are set to expire at the end of the year.",
      "As the federal government shutdown enters its tenth day, one major health care issue has continued to be a sticking point: insurance subsidies.",
      "The Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies, or premium tax credits, help lower or eliminate the out-of-pocket cost of monthly premiums for those who purchase insurance through the health insurance marketplace.",
      "Eligibility for the subsidies can include factors such as household income and geographic location.",
      "The subsidies were part of the original Affordable Care Act passed during the Obama administration and were enhanced during the COVID-19 pandemic to increase the amount of financial assistance to those who were already eligible and to expand eligibility to more people. They are set to expire at the end of the year.",
      "Republicans have said the expansions from the pandemic era went too far and have tried to persuade Democrats to fund a temporary spending bill that doesn't address the expiring ACA subsidies, with promises of discussing ways to continue the subsidies later.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., referred to the Dec. 31 deadline to extend subsidies as being far away.",
      "\"That's a Dec. 31 issue,\" he said during a news conference earlier this week. \"There are lots of conversations and deliberations and discussions right now, even bipartisan amongst members about necessary changes that would have to be made, pretty dramatic changes to even have that considered on the floor. But look, I'm not going to forecast the outcome of that.\"",
      "However, Democrats say that with open enrollment for ACA plans beginning Nov. 1, the subsidies not being approved could be detrimental for millions of American families.",
      "\"The Democrats have said that their position on getting out of the shutdown period is that they would want to both extend and make permanent these enhanced marketplace premium tax credits,\" Melinda Buntin, a professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and Johns Hopkins Carey Business School, told ABC News.",
      "\"The thing at the very top of the list is these subsidies because they are so salient and they will directly affect the pocketbooks of so many millions of Americans,\" Buntin said.",
      "Buntin said that if open enrollment begins and these subsidies are not approved and loaded into the enrollment systems, people are likely to see their premiums go up.",
      "Estimates from the Congressional Budget Office suggest that, without an extension, gross benchmark premiums could increase by 4.3% in 2026 and by 7.7% in 2027 for those on marketplace plans.",
      "A KFF analysis last month found that people who buy insurance from the marketplace, and receive financial assistance, would see their premiums rise by about 114% on average, from $888 in 2025 to $1,904 in 2026.",
      "There is broad support for the tax credits. A recent KFF poll, which was fielded just before the government shut down on Oct. 1, found that 78% of Americans support extending the enhanced tax credits, including more than half of Republicans and of \"Make America Great Again\" supporters.",
      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries expressed on Thursday the need to extend tax credits, stating, \"[U]nless we extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits, tens of millions of Americans are about to experience dramatically increased premiums, co-pays and deductibles by thousands of dollars per year.\"",
      "Buntin says this could affect many Americans, but particularly those who live in states where Medicaid was not expanded and buying insurance on the marketplace is their only option.",

      "However, James Blumstein, university distinguished professor of constitutional law and health law and policy at Vanderbilt University School of Law, told ABC News that even if the subsidies lapse and the Nov. 1 deadline arrives, a deal could be worked out to retroactively fix the issue.",
      "He added that he believes congressional Democrats and Republicans could also come up with a deal that saves the ACA subsidies but doesn't keep the full expansions that were offered during the pandemic.",
      "\"I think the leverage for the Democrats will diminish,\" he said. \"Republicans have passed a continuing resolution so that this issue is going to come back up five or six weeks again.\"",
      "Blumstein continued, \"Democrats will have leverage again in five or six weeks and I think that whether this goes into the period of new enrollment or not, that can all be fixed in the deal. In other words, if the time lapses that can be overcome by the subsidies coming a little bit later.\"",
      "Earlier this week, President Donald Trump indicated that he was negotiating with Democrats on health care policy and that he was open to making a deal on health care subsidies in an attempt to reopen the government.",

      "She continued, \"Democrats are seeing a political opening, because there are so many millions of people who depend on these subsidies to be able to afford health insurance, and there's nothing like a deadline to use to get something you want.\"",
      "A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services told ABC News in a statement earlier this week that Democrats are to blame for the shutdown.",

      "Rescue workers are helping hundreds of hikers trapped by heavy snow at a tourist camp on Mount Everest in Tibet",
      "BEIJING -- BEIJING (AP) \u2014 Rescuers were helping hundreds of hikers trapped by heavy snow at tourist campsites on a slope of Mount Everest in Tibet, Chinese state media said.",
      "About 350 hikers had reached a meeting point in Tingri country and rescuers were in contact with another 200, state broadcaster CCTV said late Sunday. There was no immediate update on rescue efforts on Monday.",
      "The hikers were trapped at an elevation of more than 4,900 meters (16,000 feet), according to an earlier report from Jimu News, a Chinese online site. Mount Everest is about 8,850 meters (29,000 feet) tall.",
      "A hiker who rushed to descend before snow blocked the way told Jimu News that others still on the mountain told him the snow was 1 meter (3 feet) deep and had crushed tents.",
      "Hundreds of rescuers headed up the mountain Sunday to clear paths so that trapped people could come down, the Jimu report said. A video shot by a villager showed a long line of people with horses and oxen moving up a winding path in the snow.",
      "The snowstorm struck during a weeklong national holiday in China, when many travel at home and abroad.",
      "In another mountainous region in western China, one hiker died of hypothermia and altitude sickness and 137 others were evacuated in the north part of Qinghai province, CCTV said Monday.",
      "The search in an area in Menyuan county with an average altitude of more than 4,000 meters (13,100 feet) was complicated by the terrain, unpredictable weather and continuous snowfall, a CCTV online report said.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Lawyers for Luigi Mangione asked a New York federal judge Saturday to dismiss some criminal charges, including the only count for which he could face the death penalty, from a federal indictment brought against him in the December assassination of UnitedHealthcare\u2019s chief executive.",
      "In papers filed in Manhattan federal court, the lawyers said prosecutors should also be prevented from using at trial his statements to law enforcement officers and his backpack where a gun and ammunition were found.",
      "They said Mangione was not read his rights before he was questioned by law enforcement officers, who arrested him after Brian Thompson was fatally shot as he arrived at a Manhattan hotel for an investor conference.",
      "They added that officers did not obtain a warrant before searching Mangione's backpack.",
      "Mangione, 27, has pleaded not guilty to state and federal charges in the fatal shooting of Brian Thompson on Dec. 4 as he arrived at a Manhattan hotel for his company\u2019s annual investor conference.",
      "The killing set off a multi-state search after the suspected shooter slipped away from the scene and rode a bike to Central Park, before taking a taxi to a bus depot that offers service to several nearby states.",
      "Five days later, a tip from a McDonald\u2019s about 233 miles (375 kilometers) away in Altoona, Pennsylvania, led police to arrest Mangione. He has been held without bail since then.",

In April, Bondi directed prosecutors in New York to seek the death penalty, calling the killing of Thompson a \u201cpremeditated, cold-blooded assassination that shocked America.\u201d",
      "Murder cases are usually tried in state courts, but prosecutors have also charged Mangione under a federal law on murders committed with firearms as part of other \u201ccrimes of violence.\u201d It\u2019s the only charge for which Mangione could face the death penalty, since it's not used in New York state.",
      "The papers filed early Saturday morning argued that this charge should be dismissed because prosecutors have failed to identify the other offenses that would be required to convict him, saying that the alleged other crime \u2014 stalking \u2014 is not a crime of violence.",
      "The assassination and its aftermath has captured the American imagination, setting off a cascade of resentment and online vitriol toward U.S. health insurers while rattling corporate executives concerned about security.",
      "After the killing, investigators found the words \u201cdelay,\u201d \u201cdeny\u201d and \u201cdepose,\u201d written in permanent marker on ammunition at the scene. The words mimic a phrase used by insurance industry critics.",

      "A family cleaning their backyard in New Orleans discovered an unusual marble tablet with some characters in Latin",
      "NEW ORLEANS -- NEW ORLEANS (AP) \u2014 A New Orleans family cleaning up their overgrown backyard made an extremely unusual find: Under the weeds was a mysterious marble tablet with Latin characters that included the phrase \u201cspirits of the dead.\"",
      "\u201cThe fact that it was in Latin that really just gave us pause, right?\u201d said Daniella Santoro, a Tulane University anthropologist. \u201cI mean, you see something like that and you say, \u2018Okay, this is not an ordinary thing.\u2019\u201d",
      "Intrigued and slightly alarmed, Santoro reached out to her classical archaeologist colleague Susann Lusnia, who quickly realized that the slab was the 1,900-year-old grave marker of a Roman sailor named Sextus Congenius Verus.",
      "\u201cWhen I first saw the image that Daniella sent me, it really did send a shiver up my spine because I was just floored,\u201d Lusnia said.",
      "Further sleuthing by Lusnia revealed the tablet had been missing from an Italian museum for decades.",
      "Sextus Congenius Verus had died at age 42, of unknown causes, after serving for more than two decades in the imperial navy on a ship named for the Roman god of medicine, Asclepius. The gravestone calls the sailor \u201cwell deserving\" and was commissioned by two people described as his \u201cheirs,\" who were likely shipmates since Roman military could not be married at the time, Lusnia said.",
      "The tablet had been in an ancient cemetery of around 20 graves of military personnel, found in the 1860s in Civitavecchia, a seaside in northwest Italy about 30 miles (48 kilometers) from Rome. Its text had been recorded in 1910 and included in a catalog of Latin inscriptions, which noted the tablet\u2019s whereabouts were unknown.",
      "The tablet was later documented at the National Archeological Museum in Civitavecchia prior to World War II. But the museum had been \u201cpretty much destroyed\u201d during Allied bombing and took several decades to rebuild, Lusnia said. Museum staff confirmed to Lusnia the tablet had been missing for decades. Its recorded measurements \u2014 1 square foot (0.09 square meters) and 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) thick \u2014 matched the size of the tablet found in Santoro\u2019s backyard.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t have better DNA than that,\u201d Lusnia said.",
      "She said the FBI is in talks with Italian authorities to repatriate the tablet. An FBI spokesperson said the agency could not respond to requests for comment during the government shutdown.",
      "A final twist to the story suggests how the tablet made its way to New Orleans.",

      "Perhaps no one would be more thrilled by the tablet\u2019s rediscovery than Sextus himself. Grave markers were important in Roman culture to uphold legacies, even of everyday citizens, Lusnia said.",
      "\u201cNow Sextus Congenius Verus is being talked about so much,\u201d Lusnia said. \u201cIf there\u2019s an afterlife and he\u2019s in it and he knows, he\u2019s very happy because this is what a Roman wants \u2014 to be remembered forever.\u201d",

      "In February, after Trump announced he was ending TPS for Venezuelans, Machado told reporters her team had been in contact with members of Congress to \u201cfind a type of effective protection\u201d for law-abiding Venezuelans. But after the Supreme Court on Oct. 3 allowed the Trump administration to end the program, she expressed no concerns of progress in her effort for an alternative protection for migrants.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Two jurors who voted in June to convict Harvey Weinstein of sexual assault said they regret the decision and only did so because others on the panel bullied them, the former movie mogul\u2019s lawyers said in a newly public court filing.",
      "Weinstein's lawyers are seeking to overturn his conviction for first-degree criminal sex act, arguing in papers unsealed Thursday that the guilty verdict was marred by \u201cthreats, intimidation, and extraneous bias,\u201d and that the judge failed to properly deal with it at the time.",
      "In sworn affidavits included with the filing, two jurors said they felt overwhelmed and intimidated by jurors who wanted to convict Weinstein on the charge, which accused him of forcing oral sex on TV and film production assistant and producer Miriam Haley in 2006.",
      "One juror said she was screamed at in the jury room and told, \u201cwe have to get rid of you.\u201d The other juror said anyone who doubted Weinstein\u2019s guilt was grilled by other jurors and that if he could have voted by secret ballot, \"I would have returned a not guilty verdict on all three charges.\u201d",
      "\u201cI regret the verdict,\u201d that juror said. \u201cWithout the intimidation from other jurors, I believe that the jury would have hung on the Miriam Haley charge.\u201d",
      "Weinstein, 73, was acquitted on a second criminal sex act charge involving a different woman, Polish psychotherapist and former model Kaja Sokola. The judge declared a mistrial on the final charge, alleging Weinstein raped former actor Jessica Mann, after the jury foreperson declined to deliberate further.",
      "It was the second time the Oscar-winning producer was tried on some of the charges. His 2020 conviction, a watershed moment for the # MeToo movement, was overturned last year. Now his defense team, led by attorney Arthur Aidala, is fighting to eliminate his retrial conviction and head off another retrial on the undecided count.",
      "Judge Curtis Farber gave Manhattan prosecutors until Nov. 10 to conduct its own investigation and file a written response before he rules on Dec. 22. That means a decision and a possible retrial or sentencing won\u2019t come until after Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg is up for reelection on Nov. 4.",
      "In the affidavits, which blacked out juror names and identifying numbers, the two jurors said they feared for their safety and the foreperson\u2019s safety. They said that when the foreperson asked for civility, another juror got in his face, pointed a finger and told him: \u201cYou don't know me. I'll catch you outside.\u201d",
      "One of the jurors said deliberations were poisoned by a belief among some jurors that a member of the panel had been paid off by Weinstein or his lawyers. That claim, which has not been supported by any evidence, shifted the jury of seven women and five men \u201cfrom an even 6-6 spit to a sudden unanimous verdict,\" the juror said.",
      "Some of what was said in the affidavits echoed acrimony that spilled into public view during deliberations. As jurors weighed charges for five days, one juror asked to be excused because he felt another was being treated unfairly.",

      "After the jury returned a verdict on two of the three charges, Farber asked the foreperson whether he was willing to deliberate further. The man said no, triggering a mistrial on the rape count.",
      "After the trial, two jurors disputed the foreperson\u2019s account. One said no one mistreated him. The other said deliberations were contentious, but respectful.",
      "When jurors came forward with concerns, Farber was strict about respecting the sanctity of deliberations and cautioned them not to discuss the content or tenor of jury room discussions, transcripts show. In their affidavits, the two jurors said they didn\u2019t feel the judge was willing to listen to their concerns.",
      "When jurors were asked if they agreed with the guilty verdict, one of the jurors noted in her affidavit that she paused \u201cto try and indicate my discomfort in the verdict.\u201d Afterward, when Farber spoke with jurors, she said she told him \u201cthe deliberations were unprofessional.\u201d",
      "Weinstein denies all the charges. The first-degree criminal sex act conviction carries the potential for up to 25 years in prison, while the unresolved third-degree rape charge is punishable by up to four years \u2014 less than he already has served.",

      "The Trump administration has provided a $300 million infusion to a food aid program for low-income mothers and children, easing concerns about funding during the government shutdown",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 A food aid program that supports millions of low-income mothers and their young children received a $300 million infusion from the Trump administration this week, alleviating some anxiety that it would run out of money during the government shutdown.",
      "The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children helps more than 6 million low-income mothers, young children and expectant parents to purchase nutritious staples like fruits and vegetables, low-fat milk and infant formula. The program, known as WIC, was at risk of running out of money this month because of the government shutdown, which occurred right before it was slated to receive its annual appropriation.",
      "This week, White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt posted on X the White House had found \u201ca creative solution\u201d to use tariff revenues to keep the program afloat. By Thursday, at least some states were receiving WIC money. Alaska and Washington said they received enough federal funds to keep their programs running until at least the end of October. The Inter-Tribal Council of Nevada, which had closed its office Thursday after running out of money, received money that allowed it to reopen Friday, radio station KUNR reported.",
      "Officials from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which runs WIC, told congressional staffers they were using $300 million in unspent tariff revenue from the last fiscal year to keep the program afloat, two people briefed on the call told AP. The people declined to be named because they were not authorized to share details from the call.",
      "Tariff revenue supports many USDA programs. The law permits the administration to transfer money allocated for other programs to WIC.",
      "Without the additional money, state and local governments would have had to step in to pay for their WIC programs and later seek reimbursement from the federal government when funding was restored. Washington state, which is dealing with a massive budget shortfall, said it could not afford to use state money for the WIC program.",
      "In Alaska, the WIC program only had enough federal money to operate through Saturday, meaning the state would have had to step in with its own funding to keep the program running. But this week, officials learned they were receiving nearly $900,000, enough to fully fund the program through Nov. 8, according to Shirley Sakaye, a spokesperson with the state\u2019s health department. About half a million of that came from leftover funds from other programs, she said.",
      "The government has been shut down since Oct. 1, after Republicans and Democrats in Congress failed to pass a bill to continue funding the government. Congressional Democrats want to reverse cuts to Medicaid that were passed earlier this year as part of President Donald Trump's mega-bill.

      "Hegseth, who made the announcement during a visit by Qatar's defense minister, said the facility to be built at the Mountain Home Air Force Base would \u201chost a contingent of Qatari F-15s and pilots to enhance our combined training, increase the lethality, interoperability.\u201d",

      "Others that received the 10-page proposal are: Vanderbilt, the University of Pennsylvania, Dartmouth College, the University of Southern California, the University of Arizona, Brown University and the University of Virginia. It was not clear how the schools were selected or why.",
      "University leaders face immense pressure to reject the compact amid opposition from students, faculty, free speech advocates and higher education groups. Leaders of some other universities have called it extortion. The mayor and city council in Tucson, home of the University of Arizona, formally opposed the compact, calling it an \u201cunacceptable act of federal interference.\u201d",
      "Even some conservatives have dismissed the compact as a bad approach. Frederick Hess, director of education policy at the American Enterprise Institute, called it \u201cprofoundly problematic\u201d and said the government's requests are \"ungrounded in law.\"",
      "Kornbluth's letter did not explicitly decline the compact but suggested that its terms are unworkable. Still, she said MIT is already aligned with some of the values outlined in the deal, including prioritizing merit in admissions and making college more affordable.",

      "Every week hundreds of millions of people around the world gather to worship in peace. But for some, there comes a day when deadly violence invades their sacred spaces and shatters that sense of sanctuary and safety.",
      "It happened recently at a synagogue in England and two churches in the U.S. Before that, there were high-profile attacks at mosques in New Zealand, a synagogue in Pennsylvania and a Sikh temple in Wisconsin. This violence can intensify anxiety and outright fear among clergy and worshippers worldwide.",
      "Security measures have been bolstered, congregants have been placed on alert, and yet the key question lingers: Can believers feel safe \u2014 and at peace \u2014 continuing to worship together?",
      "The Oct. 2 attack on a synagogue in Manchester, England, left two congregants dead and, according to police, was carried out by a man who had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group. Two days later, a mosque in an English coastal town was targeted with a suspected arson attack.",
      "Following those two attacks, \u201cthere is real fear,\u201d said a Church of England bishop, the Right Rev. Toby Howarth. \u201cPeople must feel safe in going to places of worship.\u201d",
      "How to instill that feeling is a constant challenge. In Germany, in response to several attacks, many synagogues have been surrounded by barriers and guarded by heavily armed police. In the United States, most synagogues \u2014 and many non-Jewish houses of worship \u2014 employ layered security strategies. These can involve guards, cameras, and various systems for controlling access to events through ticketing, registration or other forms of vetting.",
      "The deadliest attack on Jews in the United States occurred in October 2018, when a gunman killed 11 worshippers from three congregations at Pittsburgh\u2019s Tree of Life synagogue.",
      "Eric Kroll, deputy director of community security at the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh, said synagogues there had begun systemic security trainings before the attack.",
      "Some of the training recommendations \u2014 such as keeping a phone on hand for emergencies even on the Sabbath, when observant Jews normally wouldn\u2019t use a phone \u2014 helped save lives during that attack, he said. The federation continues to evaluate attacks such as the one in Manchester to prepare for assailants\u2019 evolving tactics.",
      "\u201cThe wounds still run deep here in Pittsburgh for a lot of people,\u201d said Kroll, adding that preparations help them to worship together confidently.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s so easy to talk about all these things and be frightened,\" he said. \"But if you teach ways to respond to those things, it empowers people to go and live their lives.\u201d",
      "A similar tone was sounded by Bishop Bonnie Perry, leader of the Episcopal Diocese of Michigan, in a letter to her congregations two days after a gunman killed four people inside The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Michigan's Grand Blanc Township on Sept. 29.",
      "\u201cMany of us feel grief, fear, and deep unease,\u201d Perry wrote. \u201cIt is natural to wonder whether the places where we pray and gather are safe.\u201d",
      "She proceeded to detail a balanced approach to security, rejecting suggestions to lock church doors during worship but encouraging greater vigilance and preparedness, including formation of emergency response teams at the diocese's churches.",
      "\u201cWe do not want our churches to feel like fortresses; they are houses of prayer for every person,\u201d she wrote. \u201cAt the same time, love of neighbor includes readiness to act swiftly should danger appear. \u2026 Our goal is not to shut people out but to keep everyone safe while maintaining the radical hospitality of the Gospel.\u201d",
      "While some Christian pastors in the U.S. encourage congregants to bring firearms to church as an extra security measure, numerous denominations and individual houses of worship forbid this. After the Grand Blanc attack, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints affirmed that it prohibits carrying firearms and other lethal weapons inside its meetinghouses and temples, except for current law enforcement officers.",
      "Black churches in the U.S. have withstood a long history of violent attacks, from decades of church burnings and bombings to the murder of nine Bible study participants in 2015 at Mother Emanuel AME in Charleston, South Carolina.

      "Roy Lee Ward, 53, was put to death at the Indiana State Prison in Michigan City. Indiana Department of Correction said in a statement that the process started shortly after midnight and Ward was pronounced dead at 12:33 a.m.",
      "Ward\u2019s last meal was from Texas Corral and included a hamburger. His last words reported by Indiana Department of Correction were \u201cBrian is going to read them,\u201d but it was unclear when exactly he made the statement.",
      "He was convicted in the rape and murder of 15-year-old Stacy Payne. Authorities said Ward attacked the girl with a knife and dumbbell in her family\u2019s home near Dale, about 30 miles (48 kilometers) east of Evansville. The crime rocked the small community of roughly 1,500 people.",
      "Ward had exhausted his legal options after more than two decades. His attorney, Joanna Green, said days before the execution that Ward was \u201cvery remorseful\u201d about the crime.\u201d",
      "Ward\u2019s execution came amid questions about Indiana\u2019s handling of the powerful sedative pentobarbital. Last year state officials ended a 15-year pause on executions, saying they\u2019d been able to obtain drugs used in lethal injections that had been unavailable for years.",
      "The Indiana Department of Correction said it had obtained \u201cenough pentobarbital to follow the required protocol\u201d for Ward\u2019s execution. Ward\u2019s attorneys had raised concerns about the use of the drug and how the state stored it, including temperature issues.",
      "Among 27 states with death penalty laws, Indiana is one of two that bar media witnesses to executions. Ward\u2019s witness list included attorneys and spiritual advisers.",
      "His case trailed through the courts for more than 20 years.",
      "Ward was convicted of the crimes in 2002 and sentenced to death. But after the Indiana Supreme Court overturned the conviction and ordered a new trial, he pleaded guilty in 2007. A decade later, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the case. In 2019, he sued Indiana seeking to stop all pending executions.",
      "Last month, the Indiana Supreme Court declined to stay the execution and Gov. Mike Braun rejected Ward\u2019s clemency bid.",

      "The Senate has voted to repeal the resolution that authorized the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq, following a House vote last month that would return the basic war power to Congress more than two decades later",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 More than two decades later, Congress is on the verge of writing a closing chapter to the war in Iraq.",
      "The Senate voted Thursday to repeal the resolution that authorized the 2003 U.S. invasion, following a House vote last month that would return the basic war power to Congress.",
      "The amendment by Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, a Democrat, and Indiana Sen. Todd Young, a Republican, was approved by voice vote to an annual defense authorization bill that passed the Senate late Thursday \u2014 a unanimous endorsement for ending the war that many now view as a mistake.",
      "Iraqi deaths were estimated in the hundreds of thousands, and nearly 5,000 U.S. troops were killed in the war after President George W. Bush\u2019s administration falsely claimed that then-President Saddam Hussein was stockpiling weapons of mass destruction.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the way the war ends, not with a bang but a whimper,\u201d Kaine said after the vote, which lasted only a few seconds with no debate and no objections. Still, he said, \u201cAmerica is forever changed by those wars, and the Middle East is too.\u201d",
      "Supporters in both the House and Senate say the repeal is crucial to prevent future abuses and to reinforce that Iraq is now a strategic partner of the United States. The House added a similar amendment to its version of the defense measure in September, meaning the repeal is likely to end up in the final bill once the two chambers reconcile the two pieces of legislation. Both bills also repeal the 1991 authorization that sanctioned the U.S.-led Gulf War.",
      "While Congress appears poised to pass the repeal, it is unclear whether President Donald Trump will support it. During his first term, his administration cited the 2002 Iraq resolution as part of its legal justification for a 2020 U.S. drone strike that killed Iranian Gen. Qassim Soleimani. It has otherwise been rarely used.",
      "Young said after the vote that he thinks Trump should \u201ctake great pride\u201d in signing the bill after campaigning on ending so-called \u201cforever wars,\u201d especially because he would be the first president in recent history to legally end a longstanding war.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The day she was elected New York's attorney general, Letitia James blasted President Donald Trump as a \u201ccon man\u201d and \u201ccarnival barker\" and pledged to scrutinize his public policies and personal business dealings. As James mounted a lawsuit claiming that Trump's business persona was built partly on lies, he returned fire, calling her \u201cgrossly incompetent\u201d and \u201can evil person.\"",
      "James, a Democrat, and Trump, a Republican, have long been legal and political foes, tangling in dozens of lawsuits over the years.",
      "On Thursday, Trump's Justice Department indicted James on mortgage fraud charges after he vowed revenge on his enemies, escalating a feud that has persisted since she campaigned for attorney general in 2018. She has denied wrongdoing.",
      "Here's a look at some of James and Trump's legal tussles:",
      "James sued Trump after his first term, alleging in September 2022 that he inflated his net worth by billions of dollars by misleading banks and insurers about the value of assets such as Trump Tower and the Mar-a-Lago property in Florida. She dubbed it \u201cThe art of the steal,\u201d a twist on the title of Trump's memoir. After a trial, a judge ordered Trump last year to pay a massive monetary penalty. An appeals court later threw out the penalty, which had grown to more than $500 million with interest, but affirmed a lower-court finding that Trump committed fraud. James is now asking the state's highest court to reinstate the penalty, while Trump is seeking to have other non-monetary punishments lifted.",
      "Trump sparred with James at a deposition for her civil fraud lawsuit in April 2023. Answering questions for seven hours at her Manhattan office, he told her that \u201cthe whole case is crazy\u201d and accused her staff of trying to trip him up like fictional TV lawyer Perry Mason did to witnesses. A few months later, they came face-to-face again as Trump testified at trial. Trump looked away from James and scowled as he walked past her on the way into court. On the witness stand, he accused her of pursuing him to advance her career. \u201cShe\u2019s a political hack, and this is a disgrace that a case like this is going on,\u201d he testified, adding that James \u201cshould be ashamed of herself.\u201d",
      "Working with a coalition of Democratic state attorneys general, James sued Trump and his administration multiple times since he returned to the White House in January, challenging everything from cuts to funding for counterterrorism and public safety to plans to deploy National Guard troops in Oregon. Those efforts began the day after Trump took office with a lawsuit challenging his effort to overturn birthright citizenship. Other lawsuits have challenged the work of Elon Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency, mass firings of federal workers and the revocation of temporary protected status for Venezuelans.",

      "During his first term, James sued the administration at least 66 times in a two-year span, challenging policies on environmental, immigration and education policy, health care and other issues. She fought his plans to include a question about immigration status on the Census, winning in the U.S. Supreme Court, and sued the U.S. Postal Service over slowdowns before the 2020 election. Other major victories during the first term included restoring what\u2019s known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals or DACA, which allows people who came to the country unlawfully as children to remain, and a ruling that barred immigration authorities from arresting people at courthouses.",
      "James teamed with then-Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. to bring tax fraud charges against the Trump Organization and Allen Weisselberg, its chief financial officer. The company was convicted in 2022 of helping its executives dodge taxes on extravagant perks such as Manhattan apartments and luxury cars. James assigned two lawyers to work with Vance\u2019s office after uncovering evidence of potential criminal wrongdoing. James was not involved when Trump was prosecuted last year by Alvin Bragg, the current District Attorney, and convicted of falsifying business records.",
      "In 2019, James finalized an agreement brokered by her predecessor dissolving his charitable foundation and forcing him to pay $2 million to various nonprofits as a fine for misspending funds to further his political and business interests. The Trump Foundation\u2019s $1.7 million in remaining funds were also given away. Trump acknowledged in a court filing that he allowed campaign staff to coordinate with the charity for a veterans fundraiser before the 2016 Iowa caucuses. He also admitted to arranging for it to pay $10,000 for a 6-foot (1.8-meter) portrait of him and the spending of $11,525 in foundation funds on sports memorabilia and Champagne at a charity gala.",
      "Trump sued James in 2021 in an attempt to block her from investigating him and his businesses. After a federal judge in New York quickly threw out the case, Trump sued her again in Florida. A judge there refused to block the probe, writing in December 2022: \u201cThis litigation has all the telltale signs of being both vexatious and frivolous.\u201d Trump abandoned efforts to revive his first lawsuit against James after the Florida judge rejected a lawsuit he filed against his 2016 presidential election rival Hillary Rodham Clinton. In tossing that case, U.S. District Judge Donald M. Middlebrooks ordered Trump and one of his lawyers \u2014 Alina Habba, currently acting U.S. attorney in New Jersey \u2014 to pay nearly $1 million for filing frivolous lawsuits for political purposes, which the judge said amounted to a \u201cpattern of abuse of the courts.\u201d",

      "Lopez said she was \"immediately floored\" when she read the script for the film by writer and director Bill Condon, known for his work on \"Chicago\" and \"Dreamgirls.\" The movie is based on a 1970s novel by Manuel Puig, which Lopez described as being far ahead of its time.",
      "The story's central message focuses on a transgender character and a cisgender political revolutionary who come from completely different worlds but, through extraordinary circumstances, come to recognize each other's humanity and develop a deep bond.",
      "\"I thought to myself: this is something I've wanted to do my whole life,\" she said.",
      "Playing three \"very different characters\"",
      "Lopez said the last time she felt that same thrill was when she was preparing for her star role in \"Selena.\" In \"Kiss of the Spider Woman,\" Lopez plays three different versions of the same woman.",
      "\"They're the same person, but they're three very different iterations of this woman and they're all very different characters and they have very different looks as well. And that was fun. But I think the essence of who they were was very different, but still the same. And I think that was the challenge,\" Lopez explained.",

But the truth is, we're all human, we're all the same. And if we can just see that we can allow people to be who they are and love each other anyway,\" she said.",
      "She also spoke about her character, Ingrid Luna, who appears in one musical sequence. In that scene, Ingrid helps another character escape the harsh reality of prison through a fantasy-like performance. The number, titled \"Where You Are,\" serves as an emotional moment of release, inviting the character to forget his surroundings and find comfort through imagination.",
      "\"And I think that's what art and music and movies...films do for people. You know, and especially in difficult times of their life, I know for me, it definitely has been that way,\" Lopez said.",

      "\"Music and art transcends language. It doesn't matter,\" she said. \"And he's done that probably more than anybody of any generation he really has.\"",
      "Lopez said the Super Bowl gives artists a rare opportunity to reach new audiences and show who they are.",
      "\"It's about not having so many ideas and closing yourself off to experiences that you might be missing out on something wonderful. Don't do that to yourself. That's what I would say,\" she said.",
      "She praised a moment when Bad Bunny brought singer Marc Anthony, the father of Lopez's children, onstage during a concert in Puerto Rico.",
      "\"It couldn't have been a more perfect moment. And I didn't even see it. I know it was perfect-- God didn't let me see it, because I would've exploded. I would've died,\" Lopez said.",
      "For Lopez, it's always important to keep her mind and heart open, telling King she still considers herself a \"hopeful romantic\" - the term she told King she preferred over \"hopeless romantic\" in an interview in 2022.",
      "\"100%. 100%. And the more self aware I become with the lessons that I learn and the hardships that I go through, the more I feel whole and complete on my own, the more I become hopeful for that same type of person to come into my life,\" said Lopez. \"The more I know the more, you know, that type of person will come into my life.

      "Parton's spokesperson, Marcel Pariseau, told CBS News on Tuesday that she was filming the video to address everyone's concerns. It comes after Parton's sister, Freida Parton, posted on social media asking for prayers for the \"9 to 5\" singer.",
      "\"I wanted to put everybody's mind at ease,\" Parton said in her video. \"I appreciate your prayers because I'm a person of faith. I could always use the prayers for anything and everything. But I want you to know that I'm OK.\"",
      "Parton appeared in good spirits and joked that she had seen some AI images of Reba\u00a0McEntire at her deathbed.",
      "\"If I was really dying, I don't think Reba would be the one at my death bed. She might come visit me earlier,\" she said. \"Anyway, there's just a lot of rumors flying around, but I figured if you heard it from me, you'd know that I was OK.\"",
      "The country superstar added that she had not been taking care of herself when her husband Carl Dean, who died earlier this year, was sick for a long time.",
      "\"When I got around to it, the doctor said, 'We need to take care of this. We need to take care of that.' Nothing major but I did have to cancel some things so I could be closer to home,\" Parton said.",
      "Last month, Parton announced she was postponing her upcoming Las Vegas concerts over recent \"health challenges.\"",
      "\"I'm not ready to die yet,\" Parton said in closing. \"I don't think God is through with me and I ain't done working. So I love you for caring, and thank you for praying for me.\""

      "He was drawn to the theatricality of music and trusted his instincts as a performer since his early days performing in school productions.",
      "\"When I was on stage, I made people feel something,\" he said. \"That doesn't come from a place of cockiness or arrogance, I just knew that I could make people move and I could make people jump and I could make people laugh and I could make people cry.\"",

    "story": [
      "Thirty paintings created by the bushy-haired, soft-spoken Bob Ross will soon be up for auction to defray the costs of programming for small and rural public television stations suffering under cuts in federal funding.",
      "Ross, a public television stalwart in the 1980s and '90s, \"dedicated his life to making art accessible to everyone,\" said Joan Kowalski, president of Bob Ross Inc. \"This auction ensures his legacy continues to support the very medium that brought his joy and creativity into American homes for decades.\"",
      "The 30 paintings to be auctioned span his career. Most were created on-air during single episodes of Ross' show, \"The Joy of Painting.\" Ross was known for his calm demeanor. During the show, he often spoke about painting happy little clouds and trees, and making no mistakes, only \"happy accidents.\" He died of cancer complications in 1995.",
      "Bonhams in Los Angeles will auction three of Ross' paintings on Nov. 11. Other auctions will follow in London, New York, Boston and online. Bonhams sold two early 1990s mountain-and-lake scenes of Ross in August for $114,800 and $95,750.",
      "The auctions of the 30 paintings soon to be sold have an estimated total value of $850,000 to $1.4 million, Bonhams said. All profits are pledged to stations that use content from distributor American Public Television.",
      "The idea is to help stations in need with licensing fees that allow them to show popular programs that include \"The Best of Joy of Painting,\" based on Ross' show, \"America's Test Kitchen,\" \"Julia Child's French Chef Classics\" and \"This Old House.\"",
      "As desired by President Donald Trump, Congress has eliminated $1.1 billion allocated to public broadcasting, leaving about 330 PBS and 246 NPR stations to find alternative funding sources.",
      "Many stations launched emergency fund drives. Some stations have received more help than they expected, CBS News previously reported. North Carolina public radio station WQHR raised more than $200,000 in just three days, surpassing the $174,000 they needed to fill. Hawaii Public Radio lost $525,000, but donations raised $650,000.",
      "NPR has also encouraged donors in wealthier areas to support stations in regions that are in greater need. PBS and NPR have also worked to reduce the annual dues stations pay for programming and other services to lower their costs. Some stations are working on collaborations to see if they can share services and reduce costs.",
      "Still, the federal cuts have had an impact. Not all stations have seen an outpouring of donors. PBS slashed its budget by 21% and laid off about 100 employees in September. Stations have also had to lay off staff and reduce programming, CBS News previously reported. No stations have shut down yet, but operators are worried about what happens if donor money dries up.",
      "\"I am a realist,\" PBS president Paula Kerger said in September. \"I have to believe that there are some vulnerable stations that are not going to make it.\"",
      "National Public Radio president and CEO Katherine Maher\u00a0told CBS News in July\u00a0that defunding public media services \"is a real risk to the public safety of the country.\"",
      "\"Public media, public radio, public television, are a critical part of the emergency response plans of nearly half of the states in this nation,\" Maher said in an interview with CBS News. \"If these types of emergency alerting go away, you will have fewer outlets to be able to respond in real time\" to future natural disasters."

      "In a letter, Combs' lawyers urged the judge presiding over his case, Arun Subramanian, to \"strongly recommend\" that the federal Bureau of Prisons place Combs at FCI Fort Dix, a massive prison located on the grounds of the joint military base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst.",
      "FCI Fort Dix, one of several dozen federal prisons with a residential drug treatment program, will best allow Combs \"to address drug abuse issues and to maximize family visitation and rehabilitative efforts,\" Combs' lawyer Teny Geragos wrote. He also cited educational and occupational programs available at the prison, located about 70 miles south of New York City.",
      "The request from Combs' attorney came after Subramanian asked his lawyers on Friday at the sentencing hearing to let him know their preference for a prison facility.",
      "Also Monday, President Trump told reporters that Combs had asked him for a pardon. Mr. Trump, referring to Combs by the nickname \"Puff Daddy,\" did not say if he would grant the request.

An adjacent minimum-security prison camp has 210 inmates.",

For a time, it was run by the warden who had been in charge of a Manhattan federal jail when financier Jeffrey Epstein killed himself at the jail in 2019. That warden, Lamine N'Diaye, has since retired.",

The same year, a Fort Dix correctional officer pleaded guilty in a separate case to pocketing bribes to smuggle in contraband.",

      "\"You have to admit, I've been misunderstood,\" said singer-songwriter Yusuf Islam. \"Even when I wrote 'Foreigner,' I started with the words, There are no words I can use because the meaning still leaves for you to choose. And so, the artist, to try and explain himself, has got to work a bit harder.\"",

      "I asked, \"Do you get something out of playing on stage that you don't, playing alone?\"",
      "\"I get scared,\" he replied. \"A lot of human beings out there!\"",

      "Nicole Perry Ellis came to London's Hyde Park with her daughter Natasha to attend a Yusuf concert. She described it as a \"very emotional moment. Because before [Natasha] was born, we used to listen to the music when I was pregnant.\"",

      "\"I think my songs have always been kind of profound in some way,\" Yusuf said. \"A lot of them are so relevant to the world today. I mean, 'Wild World'? You know, come on! And 'Peace Train,' waiting for the train to arrive. Boy, do we need it, yeah. I mean they're relevant.\"",
      "His core themes have endured, as his name has gone through its evolutions. \"I had a girlfriend who looked at me one day and said, 'Ooh, you look like a cat.' And I went, 'What?' That stuck. And then I was looking for a name, because it was going to be difficult to go into the record store and ask for, like, Stephen Demetre Georgiou's latest album.\"",

Are you that person on the screen, on the stage, or is there something more to you? I was looking for some big answers.\"",
      "I asked, \"What all did you try, spiritually?\"",
      "\"Well, you know, the bookshop is full of lots of different views of life and beliefs and philosophies, so I was digging around everywhere. I think the most important thing was when I finally reached the Quran at the end. And that just brought everything together.\"",
      "He took the name Yusuf Islam, and \u2013 believing that music was haram, or forbidden \u2013 redirected his royalties to fund his charity efforts, auctioned off instruments, focused on family, and for nearly 30 years left music.",
      "Why did he believe music was forbidden? \"It took me time to realize that a lot of what I was told in the beginning when I became a Muslim was not exactly right,\" he said. \"You know, Islam doesn't forbid anything that's healthy and morally good.\"",
      "I asked, \"How do you reconcile the you who put that aside, with the you who embraced music again?\"",
      "\"You go through stages,\" Yusuf said. \"At one time you can fall in love, and next time you're having such an argument with a person, you say, 'What the hell, get out of my life!' You know, you change, your attitude changes according to circumstance. Context is key.\"",
      "He provides context to a controversial chapter regarding Salman Rushdie's novel \"The Satanic Verses,\" which inflamed the Muslim world \u2013 and the fatwa calling for the author's death. In 1989, in an appearance on a British TV program where hypothetical questions were posed, he was asked if he'd attend an effigy burning of Rushdie, to which he replied, \"I would have hoped that it would have been the real thing, but actually no, if it's just an effigy I don't think I would be that moved to go there.\"",
      "\"I mean, I've got a British sense of humor,\" Yusuf said. \"I took it in a kind of slightly comical direction. It wasn't a good thing to do, because nobody laughed. So, you know, I kind of, I made a mistake in thinking that people might get the joke. But it was a serious issue, so I shouldn't have really done that.\"",
      "\"The joke you mean, saying preferred the real thing, not the effigy?\"",
      "\"Whatever, whatever, whatever.\"",
      "\"When you saw the headlines after that, do you worry even today that \u2013 \"",

      "\"No, it was only a little part of the book.\"",
      "I said, \"But it seems like with this book you partially wanted to set the record straight from your perspective.\"",
      "\"That's right,\" Yusuf replied. \"I think I've done that.\"",
      "I asked, \"How is it to sit down and write something so personal, to go through the good, the bad, the ugly, the beautiful?\"",
      "\"I left quite a lot of the ugly out, actually, to be honest!\"",
      "\"You were hard on yourself.\"",

      "Asked how it is to be performing using both names, Yusuf/Cat Stevens replied, \"Actually, it's very symbolic in a way, because for a long time what I wanted to do was to separate myself in a way from my past, and I did that. So, joining these two names together actually forms the complete picture of, like, who I am. And you just have to listen to the songs. They're biographical in themselves. I didn't have to write a book, actually. You just buy the records, you know?\"",

    "summary": "The three-time Oscar-winning actor has been absent from movie screens for eight years, until a collaboration with his son, Ronan, brought him back for \"Anemone,\" the story of a man living in self-exile.",
    "story": [
      "He has been called the greatest actor of his generation \u2013 a three-time Oscar-winner, and reluctant star. \"The work itself has always been, has remained nothing but a source of fascination and pleasure to me, the work itself,\" said Daniel Day-Lewis. \"The aftermath of the work has always been difficult for me. You know, you become to some extent a sales rep for that work. And I'm not good at that. I never was. And I'm still not. And that particular part of it, the public part of it, has always left me feeling emptied out.\"",
      "And eight years ago, he announced his retirement. But now, a clarification: \"I think that was a mistake,\" he said. \"I think it just created a kind of confusion. At the time, I never intended to retire from anything. I chose to stop doing one kind of work so that I could perhaps concentrate on a different kind of work.\"",
      "It was part musical interlude: \"My youngest son, Cashel, is a fiddle player. And once the idea took root in my head, like, 'I wonder if I could make him a fiddle,' that was the \u2014 you know, things tend to, yeah, it's hard to let go of a thing.\"",
      "He made three, and he says he has the makings of a fourth, \"but I just haven't got down to it yet.\"",
      "Day-Lewis admits he was surprised to feel a strong impulse to return to acting: \"And largely it was in response to the knowledge that Ronan would be making films.\"",
      "Twenty-seven-year-old middle son Ronan Day-Lewis brings credentials and expectations: His mother, filmmaker and author Rebecca Miller, and grandfather, playwright Arthur Miller.",
      "I asked Ronan, \"Was your move to film a surprise to your parents?\"",
      "\"Not really, because I started making little movies with my friends when I was, like, seven,\" he replied. \"When I was really young, I would always be the one kind of annoyingly trying to corral everyone into making a little movie on our dad's, like, flip camera in the backyard or something.\"",
      "\"Anemone\" is his directorial debut, co-written with his father, who plays Ray Stoker. The story unfolds in a remote cabin. Ronan said, \"The first kind of concrete anchor, I think, was the idea of this man who's kind of in this form of self-exile, that he's living in the middle of nowhere. For some reason that pertains to his past, he's kind of separated himself and banished himself to this isolated place.\"",
      "After twenty years, his brother (played by Sean Bean) arrives to bring Ray Stoker back to the son he's never met. Daniel said, \"I felt I knew Ray fairly early on in the writing process. I don't know why I did. I just did. I can't explain it.\"",
      "To watch a trailer for \"Anemone\" click on the video player below:",
      "Daniel Day-Lewis is legendary for his immersive preparation \u2013 as a fashion designer (\"Phantom Thread\"), in the boxing ring (\"The Boxer\"), in a wheelchair (\"My Left Foot\"). But after more than 20 film roles, one character remains elusive: Daniel Day-Lewis.",
      "I asked what drives him to such perfection.",
      "\"I've resisted analysis to a large extent because, maybe out of superstition, I thought it might interfere with the impulse, which was strong in me and still is,\" Daniel replied. \"But I mean, put on the spot I'd say it's got something to do with that period of time which was very bleak in my life when I was sent away to school.\"",
      "His mother, actress Jill Balcon, came from a prominent British film family. His father, Cecil Day-Lewis, who died when Daniel was 15, was well-known in literary circles \u2013 perhaps not so well-known at home.",
      "\"It's not that we never got to see him,\" said Daniel. \"He was a good man. But my only conversations that I remember having with him [was] when I was in trouble, which I was frequently for all kinds of different things. That's my memory of it. It may be a distorted memory.\"",
      "In 1968, his father was named poet laureate of the United Kingdom, and Daniel was sent to boarding school at 11. \"I felt like I was at sea,\" he said. \"I had no friends. I was being bullied. I was scrappy, but in that place you're considered to be, like, just outrageously uncivilized if you took a swipe at someone, which I did now and then.\"",
      "Despite pleading, he was left to tough it out: \"It was my father's decision. He believed I should stay there, and that I would feel a sense of defeat if I left. But I don't think, because he didn't really see me, he didn't understand the degree to which I was already defeated.\"",
      "And yet, boarding school is where he found his life's work. \"I did a few little bits and pieces in school plays,\" he said. \"And it wasn't the magic of the theater for me; it was the alternative world, where everything around me seemed fairly dark. That was a place that was illuminated for me.\"",
      "But stardom came with a darker side, as he was forewarned by the head of a prestigious summer theater program for teens 50 years ago. \"He launched into a kind of cautionary tale about the world of professional acting and the theater, about the sleaze and the corruption, and I was really quite na\u00efve at that time. But something about what he said that day stayed with me. I never wondered about the work, but I began to wonder about the world that I was going into. And so, I did reach a crossroads where I wondered whether perhaps I'd become a cabinet maker, a furniture maker, instead.\"",
      "He seems to have found a comfortable place at the crossroad in \"Anemone\":\u00a0 a reluctant father on film, and devoted father off-camera.",
      "\"Anemone\" is the culmination of a yearslong father-son collaboration.",
      "I asked Ronan about the trust and confidence implied in that collaboration. \"Yeah, yeah, he never implied that that was a big deal,\" he replied. \"But I always felt that incredible sense of pressure, not wanting to let him down. I felt that actually probably more deeply than the kind of external pressure of how the film might be received, or the expectations that come with his, you know, comeback.\"",
      "An unexpected return eagerly awaited. Yet, Daniel Day-Lewis is muted in his expectations: \"We don't last long. Film sometimes can have a long life, and I suppose you can't help hoping that something of your work will be significant to a person in times to come. But there's, yeah, no guarantee of that.\"",

    "summary": "The \"Hannah Montana\" actress-turned-Grammy-winning pop star talks about her album \"Something Beautiful,\" sobriety, and reconnecting with her dad through music.",
    "story": [
      "Miley Cyrus has been in the public eye for most of her life, and while you might know her music, don't think you really know her.",
      "Asked what it's like to go through life and have strangers think they know her, Cyrus replied, \"I love my life, so I don't ever really have \u2013 I haven't made too much of a list of the things that are negative about it, 'cause there's so many great things. But I would say one of the things that I don't love and don't appreciate so much is when you meet somebody and they go, 'Wow, you're like, so cool. You're so smart. You're nothing like I thought you would be.' So yeah, that's a tough one.\"",
      "Her ninth album might not be what you'd expect, either. In \"Something Beautiful,\" Cyrus stretches herself artistically. As one critic put it, the album takes her from pop princess to legacy artist. That's quite a leap, even for someone with music in their blood.",
      "Miley's mom, Tish Cyrus Purcell, is a producer. Dad is country star Billy Ray Cyrus. Her godmother? Dolly Parton.",
      "Miley Cyrus lived with showbiz royalty, and that raspy voice, all her life: \"I've sounded like this since I was little. My dad used to have all the country singers come over to the house, and George Jones would, you know, joke that I had smoked cigarettes or been up all night, you know, even when I was four years old.\"",
      "At age 13, she was suddenly famous after being cast as \"Hannah Montana,\" in the Disney Channel series about a girl who was a typical teen by day and a pop star by night. It's a role she's still proud of: \"I love her. She's everything. I would have nothing, none of this \u2013 I mean, maybe I could've figured it out, maybe I could've gotten myself from Nashville, Tennessee, to Los Angeles. I don't know. But she did it a lot faster, and better, and set me up for the life that I have now. So love her, gratitude, all of that.\"",
      "The years after \"Hannah Montana\" were a bit less wholesome. Her 2013 MTV Music Video Awards performance was met with shock and outrage, especially among moms of young kids who had grown up watching her as a Disney star.",
      "I asked, \"There were moms that were trying to, I guess, cancel you?\"",
      "\"Yeah. I was the first person to maybe ever be canceled, I guess.\"",
      "\"How would you describe that time in your life?\"",
      "\"Well, you know, I didn't know until I was older actually how brutal it really was,\" Cyrus said. \"It was very, I guess, you know, challenging for other people. But for me it was a good time. It looked fun, and it was fun.\"",
      "Eventually it was all a little too much fun. Cyrus says she's been sober for a few years now.",
      "\"How has sobriety affected you?\" I asked.",
      "\"Well, I like showing up 100%, 100% of the time,\" Cyrus replied. \"The hardest part about balancing, you know, any sort of substance use or drinking when you want to do what I do is you're going, 'Okay, well, now I have to get sober for this thing, 'cause I wanna show up my best.' And now, I get to trim out so much of the preparation of getting yourself into the right place mentally and physically. I'm just always ready.\"",
      "Something she was ready for: \"Flowers,\" the biggest pop single of 2023, and her biggest record to date.",
      "She was also ready for this: Her first two Grammys, for best pop solo performance and record of the year, for \"Flowers.\" Accepting the Grammy she said, \"This award is amazing, but I hope it doesn't change anything, because my life was beautiful yesterday.\"",
      "For Miley Cyrus, today is looking good as well.",
      "\"Sunday Morning\" joined her this summer at L.A.'s Million Dollar Theatre, where she was shooting a music video for the deluxe version of \"Something Beautiful.\" The song is \"Secrets,\" and if you think it sounds a bit like Fleetwood Mac, you're right: you can hear drummer Mick Fleetwood and guitarist Lindsey Buckingham on the track.",
      "Miley sings about a white flag of surrender, and her outfit is basically a white flag in itself. She told us the song is meant as a peace offering to her dad, Billy Ray Cyrus. They'd been estranged since her parents' divorce in 2022.",
      "Asked how he reacted when she gave him the song, Miley replied, \"My dad cried. You know, you don't see your dad cry a lot. But with me and my dad, we just have always communicated better through music with each other.\"",
      "\"And you're at peace now with each other?\"",
      "\"Yeah.\"",
      "And at 32, it seems Miley Cyrus is at peace with herself.",
      "\"I think the authentic joy of doing what I want to do has always eclipsed the negatives for me,\" she said. \"I feel really good. And I really like who I am, and I like what I'm doing with my life. And I think if I was outside of myself, I would want to be a part of what I'm doing in any way that I could be. 'Cause I think what I'm doing is cool. So, that actually feels good. I like what I do. I like who I am.\"",

    "story": [
      "Stockholm\u00a0\u2014 Mary E. Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell and Dr. Shimon Sakaguchi won the Nobel Prize in medicine on Monday for their discoveries concerning peripheral immune tolerance.",
      "Brunkow, 64, is a senior program manager at the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle. Ramsdell, 64, is a scientific adviser for Sonoma Biotherapeutics in San Francisco. Sakaguchi, 74, is a distinguished professor at the Immunology Frontier Research Center at Osaka University in Japan.",
      "Brunkow got the news of her prize from an AP photographer who came to her home in the early hours of the morning.",
      "She said she had ignored the earlier call from the Nobel committee. \"My phone rang and I saw a number from Sweden and thought: 'That's just, that's spam of some sort.'\"",
      "\"When I told Mary she won, she said, 'don't be ridiculous,'\" said her husband, Ross Colquhoun.",
      "\"It was a nice surprise,\" Sakaguchi told a news conference from the University of Osaka in western Japan. \"I hope researches into the area will further progress so that our findings can be used in treatment, and I hope we can contribute to that as well.\"",
      "The immune system has many overlapping systems to detect and fight bacteria, viruses and other bad actors. Key immune warriors such as T cells get trained on how to spot bad actors. If some instead go awry in a way that might trigger autoimmune diseases, they're supposed to be eliminated in the thymus \u2014 a process called central tolerance.",
      "The Nobel winners unraveled an additional way the body keeps the system in check.",
      "The Nobel Committee said it started with Sakaguchi's discovery in 1995 of a previously unknown T cell subtype now known as regulatory T cells or T-regs. Then in 2001, Brunkow and Ramsdell discovered a culprit mutation in a gene named Foxp3, a gene that also plays a role in a rare human autoimmune disease.",
      "The Nobel Committee said two years later, Sakaguchi linked the discoveries to show that the Foxp3 gene controls the development of those T-regs \u2014\u00a0which in turn act as a security guard to find and curb other forms of T cells that overreact.",
      "Brunkow said she and Ramsdell were working together at a small biotech company and they were investigating why a particular strain of mice had an over-active immune system. They had to work with brand new techniques to find the mouse gene behind the problem \u2014 but quickly realized it could be a major player in human health, too.",
      "\"From a DNA level, it was a really small alteration that caused this massive change to how the immune system works.\"",
      "The work opened a new field of immunology, said Karolinska Institute rheumatology professor Marie Wahren-Herlenius. Researchers around the world now are working to use regulatory T cells to develop treatments for autoimmune diseases and cancer.",
      "\"Their discoveries have been decisive for our understanding of how the immune system functions and why we do not all develop serious autoimmune diseases,\" said Olle K\u00e4mpe, chair of the Nobel Committee.",
      "The award is the first of the 2025 Nobel Prize announcements and was announced by a panel at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm.",

    "story": [
      "French President Emmanuel Macron on Friday reappointed S\u00e9bastien Lecornu as prime minister, just days after his resignation, asking him to try again to form a government and produce a budget in a bid to end the country's political deadlock.",
      "Lecornu's reappointment followed days of intense negotiations and came less than a week after he resigned amid infighting in his freshly named government. France is struggling with mounting economic challenges and ballooning debt, and the political crisis is aggravating its troubles and raising alarm across the European Union.",
      "The appointment is widely seen as Macron's last chance to reinvigorate his second term, which runs until 2027. Lacking a majority in the National Assembly to push through his agenda, Macron faces mounting criticism \u2014 including from within his own ranks \u2014 and has little room to maneuver.",
      "Macron's office released a one-sentence statement late Friday night announcing the appointment, one month after the statement issued a month ago when Lecornu was initially named and four days after he resigned.",
      "Lecornu said in a statement on social networks that he accepted the new job offer out of \"duty.\" He said he was given a mission \"to do everything to give France a budget by the end of the year and respond to the daily problems of our compatriots.\"",
      "All those who join his new government will have to renounce ambitions to run for president in 2027, Lecornu said, adding that the new Cabinet will \"incarnate renewal and a diversity of skills.\"",
      "\"We must put an end to this political crisis that exasperates the French, and to this bad instability for France's image and its interests,\" he wrote.",
      "Lecornu abruptly resigned on Monday, only hours after unveiling a new Cabinet that drew opposition from a key coalition partner. The shock resignation prompted calls for Macron to step down or dissolve parliament again, as he did in June 2024. But they remained unanswered, with the president instead announcing on Wednesday that he would name a successor to Lecornu within 48 hours.",
      "Political party leaders met for more than two hours on Friday with Macron, at his request. Some cautioned that another prime minister picked from the ranks of Macron's fragile centrist camp would risk being disavowed by Parliament's powerful lower house, prolonging the crisis.",
      "\"How can one expect that all this will end well?\" said Marine Tondelier, leader of The Ecologists party. \"The impression we get is that the more alone he is, the more rigid he becomes.\"",
      "Over the past year, Macron's successive minority governments have collapsed in quick succession, leaving the European Union's second-largest economy mired in political paralysis as France is faced with a debt crisis. At the end of the first quarter of 2025, France's public debt stood at 3.346 trillion euros ($3.9 trillion), or 114% of gross domestic product.",
      "France's poverty rate also reached 15.4% in 2023, its highest level since records began in 1996, according to the latest data available from the national statistics institute.",
      "The economic and political struggles are worrying financial markets, ratings agencies and the European Commission, which has been pushing France to comply with EU rules limiting debt.",
      "The two biggest opposition parties in the National Assembly \u2014 the far-right National Rally and the far-left France Unbowed party \u2014 weren't invited to the discussions on Friday. The National Rally wants Macron to hold fresh legislative elections, and France Unbowed wants him to resign.",
      "Lecornu argued earlier this week that Macron's centrist bloc, its allies and parts of the opposition could still clump together into a working government. \"There's a majority that can govern,\" he said. \"I feel that a path is still possible. It is difficult.\"",
      "Lecornu will now have to seek compromises to avoid an immediate vote of no confidence and may even be forced to abandon an extremely unpopular pension reform that was one of Macron's signature policies in his second presidential term. Rammed through parliament without a vote in 2023 despite mass protests, it gradually raises the retirement age from 62 to 64. Opposition parties want it to be scrapped.",
      "The political deadlock stems from Macron's shock decision in June 2024 to dissolve the National Assembly. The snap elections produced a hung parliament, with no bloc able to command a majority in the 577-seat chamber. The gridlock has unnerved investors, infuriated voters, and stalled efforts to curb France's spiraling deficit and public debt.",
      "Without stable support, Macron's governments have stumbled from one crisis to the next, collapsing as they sought backing for unpopular spending cuts. Lecornu's resignation, just 14 hours after announcing his Cabinet, underscored the fragility of the president's coalition amid deep political and personal rivalries."

    "summary": "President Trump said Friday he will impose an additional 100% tariff on imports from China starting next month \u2014 marking a significant escalation in the U.S.-China trade war.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump said Friday he will impose an additional 100% tariff on imports from China starting next month, citing new Chinese export controls \u2014 marking a significant escalation in the U.S.-China trade war.",
      "The new 100% tariffs will add on to any existing import taxes on Chinese goods, the president wrote in a Truth Social post. Tariffs on Chinese imports currently stand at 30%. Mr. Trump said the U.S. will also impose export controls on \"any and all critical software\" starting next month.",
      "The tariffs could be imposed on Nov. 1 or sooner, \"depending on any further actions or changes taken by China,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "The president's announcement came hours after he threatened steeper duties on China. He pointed to new Chinese rules that require companies to get special approval to export products containing even trace amounts of rare earths from China, even if they were manufactured outside of the country. China mines and processes most of the world's rare earth metals, which are\u00a0critical minerals used to manufacture products including semiconductors, electric car batteries, jet engines and defense weapons.",
      "\"It is impossible to believe that China would have taken such an action, but they have, and the rest is History,\" the president wrote in his Friday message announcing the tariffs, calling China's export controls \"extraordinarily aggressive\" and a \"moral disgrace.\"",
      "Separately on Friday, China\u00a0imposed port fees on U.S.-owned ships that dock in the country, retaliating against what Beijing called a \"discriminatory\" U.S. port fee on Chinese ships.",
      "Major stock indexes fell sharply on Friday after Mr. Trump's initial tariff threat. The S&P 500 dropped 2.7%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average 1.8% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite 3.6%.",
      "The new tariffs and export restrictions could inflame trade talks between China and the Trump administration. Mr. Trump is set to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping later this month, but the U.S. president said earlier Friday \"there seems to be no reason\" for the meeting to take place.",
      "China is the United States' third-largest trading partner after Mexico and Canada, with the U.S. importing $438.9 billion worth of Chinese goods and China buying $143.5 billion in U.S. goods last year, according to federal statistics.",
      "But China and the U.S. have had a rocky relationship on trade in recent months. Over the spring, American tariffs on Chinese goods spiked to 145% and Chinese tariffs on U.S. imports soared to 125%, following a set of tit-for-tat hikes that began with import duties unveiled by the Trump administration. In May, the U.S. and China agreed to slash their tariffs to 30% and 10%, respectively, while the two sides pursued a broader trade deal.",
      "The U.S.-China economic relationship has other complexities, too. The Trump administration needs Beijing's permission to close a deal to transfer ownership of TikTok's U.S. operations away from China-based parent company ByteDance. China has also chafed at some of the administration's restrictions on international students."

      "Stocks had been heading for a slight gain in the morning, until Mr. Trump said on his social media platform said he's considering \"a massive increase of tariffs\" on Chinese imports. He's upset at restrictions China has placed on exports of its rare earths, which are materials that are critical for the manufacturing of everything from consumer electronics to jet engines.",
      "\"We have been contacted by other Countries who are extremely angry at this great Trade hostility, which came out of nowhere,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"Our relationship with China over the past six months has been a very good one, thereby making this move on Trade an even more surprising one. I have always felt that they've been lying in wait, and now, as usual, I have been proven right!\"",
      "Mr. Trump also threatened to call off a planned meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea later this month.",
      "\"Threatening significantly increased tariffs on China is a hallmark of Trump's negotiating tactics, and all it took was a headline to entice investors to take some chips off the table,\" Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist for Allianz Investment Management, said in an email.",
      "Primed for a slide?",
      "The market may have been primed for a slide. U.S. stocks were already facing criticism that their prices had shot too high following a nearly relentless 35% run for the S&P 500 from a low in April to record heights.",
      "Critics say the market looks overpriced after prices rose much faster than corporate profits. Worries are particularly high about companies in the artificial-intelligence industry, where pessimists are making comparisons to to the 2000 dot-com bubble that ultimately imploded. For stocks to look less expensive, either their prices need to fall, or profits need to rise.",
      "Other factors also weighed on investor sentiment Friday, including the ongoing U.S. government shutdown and fresh data showing that consumers are anxious about the economy.",
      "The University of Michigan's preliminary October sentiment index,\u00a0released\u00a0Friday, shows consumer sentiment fell 0.1% on a monthly basis, from 55.1 points in September to 55. While the drop was nominal, it represents the third consecutive month the confidence measure, which is closely watched by investors, has declined.",
      "\"Pocketbook issues like high prices and weakening job prospects remain at the forefront of consumers' minds,\" Joanne Hsu, director of the Surveys of Consumers at the University of Michigan, said in a statement.",
      "The job market has slowed so much that the Federal Reserve cut its main interest rate last month for the first time this year. Fed officials have penciled in more cuts through next year to give the economy more breathing room. But Chair Jerome Powell has also said they may have to change course if inflation stays high. That's because lower interest rates can push inflation even higher."

      "Vessels owned or operated by American companies or individuals, and ships built in the U.S. or flying the American flag, would be subjected to a 400 yuan ($56) per net ton fee per voyage if they dock in China, China's Ministry of Transport said on Friday.",
      "The fees would be applied on the same ship for a maximum of five voyages each year, and would rise every year until 2028, when it would hike to 1,120 yuan ($157) per net ton, the ministry said. They would take effect on Oct. 14, the same day when the United States is due to start imposing port fees on Chinese vessels.",
      "China's Ministry of Transport said on Friday in a statement that its special fees on American vessels are \"countermeasures\" in response to \"wrongful\" U.S. practices, referring to the planned U.S. port fees on Chinese vessels.",
      "The ministry also slammed the United States' port fees as \"discriminatory\" that would \"severely damage the legitimate interests of China's shipping industry\" and \"seriously undermine\" international economic and trade order.",
      "China has announced a string of trade measures and restrictions before an expected meeting between Trump and Xi on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in South Korea that begins at the end of October. On Thursday, Beijing unveiled new curbs on exports of rare earths and related technologies, as well as new restrictions on the export of some lithium battery and related production equipment.",
      "The port fees announced by Beijing on Friday mirrors many aspects of the U.S. port fees on Chinese ships docking in American ports. Under Washington's plans, Chinese-owned or -operated ships will be charged $50 per net ton for each voyage to the U.S., which would then rise by $30 per net ton each year until 2028. Each vessel would be charged no more than five times per year.",
      "China's new port fee is \"not just a symbolic move,\" said Kun Cao, deputy chief executive at consulting firm Reddal. \"It explicitly targets any ship with meaningful U.S. links \u2014 ownership, operation, flag, or build \u2014 and scales steeply with ship size.\"",
      "The \"real bite is on U.S.-owned and operated vessels,\" he said, adding that North America accounts for roughly 5% of the world fleet by beneficial ownership, which is still a meaningful figure although not as huge as compared to Greek, Chinese and Japanese ship owners.",
      "However, the United States has only about 0.1% of global commercial shipbuilding market share in recent years and built fewer than 10 commercial ships last year, Reddal added.",
      "While shipping analysts have said that the U.S. port fees on Chinese vessels would likely have limited impact on trade and freight rates as some shipping companies have been redeploying their fleets to avoid the extra charge, shipping data provider Alphaliner warned last month in a report that the U.S. port fees could still cost up to $3.2 billion next year for the world's top 10 carriers.",

However, in the 90 days leading up to the sale, the tablet was being offered for between $50 and $85, with a median price of $72, according to the suit.",

      "The estates of wealthy Americans will see a bigger tax break in 2026 than they did this year. The IRS said Thursday that the estates of people who die in 2026 will have a basic exclusion amount of $15 million, up from nearly $14 million in the 2025 tax year.",
      "Health Flexible Spending",
      "U.S. workers can now voluntarily contribute up to $3,400 to their health flexible spending accounts, up $100 from prior year. These contributions, which are deducted pre-tax from employee paychecks, go toward an account that can be used to pay for out-of-pocket medical expenses.",
      "Understanding your tax bracket",
      "There's a misconception that Americans pay the top tax rate on every dollar of their income, but that isn't the case. Taxation in the U.S. is progressive, meaning that tax rates increase the more you earn. In other words, the seven income tax rate brackets \u2014 10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, 35% and 37% \u2014 represent the percentage you'll pay on portions of your income.",
      "For instance, a single taxpayer making $50,000 in taxable income in 2026, will pay 10% in federal taxes on the first $12,400 of their income (the top threshold for the 10% bracket) and then 12% on the remaining $37,600.",
      "To determine your marginal tax bracket, you must first figure out what your highest taxable income is. Take the example of a married couple with $150,000 in gross income. They would first subtract the 2026 standard deduction of $32,200 from that amount, leaving them with $117,800 in taxable income. That would put their top marginal tax rate at 22%.",
      "However, their effective tax rate \u2014 meaning the percentage of their annual income that they will pay to the IRS \u2014\u00a0is much lower, as follows:",
      "Their first $24,800 of income will be taxed at 10%, or $2,480 in taxesTheir earnings from $24,800 to $100,800 would be taxed at 12%, or $9,120 in taxes\u00a0Their income from $100,800 to $117,800 would be taxed at 22%, or $3,740 in taxes",
      "Their first $24,800 of income will be taxed at 10%, or $2,480 in taxes",
      "Their earnings from $24,800 to $100,800 would be taxed at 12%, or $9,120 in taxes",
      "Their income from $100,800 to $117,800 would be taxed at 22%, or $3,740 in taxes",
      "Combined, they would pay $15,340 in federal income taxes, giving them an effective tax rate of 13%.",
      "How the OBBBA will impact taxes",
      "The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed into law by President Trump in July, made most of the tax cuts from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act permanent, helping some American taxpayers avert a scheduled tax increase.",
      "As a result of the Republican spending bill, the typical filer could see an average tax cut of $3,752 in 2026, with benefits varying depending on the filer's geographic location, according to an\u00a0analysis\u00a0in August from the Tax Foundation.",
      "A taxpayer's income will also influence the tax cuts they see, with higher-income Americans more likely to see a bigger benefit from tax provisions in the legislation than lower-income households.",
      "A July\u00a0analysis\u00a0from the Tax Policy Center found that the typical household in the bottom quintile \u2014 those earning up to $34,600 per year \u2014 will save an average of about $150 in tax payments in 2026, or 0.8% of their income. By comparison, those in the top quintile \u2014 those who earn $217,101 or more \u2014 will save an average of $12,540 next year, or 2.5% of their income."

    "story": [
      "Senators have launched an inquiry into companies paid billions in taxpayer dollars to build eligibility systems for Medicaid, expressing concern that error-riddled technology and looming work requirements \"will cause Americans to lose Medicaid coverage to this bureaucratic maze.\"",
      "The letters, dated Oct. 10, were sent to four companies and follow a KFF Health News investigation that exposed widespread issues in states using Deloitte-run systems to assess Medicaid eligibility for millions of people. Failures have resulted in the erroneous loss of health coverage and other vital safety-net benefits for low-income people. Malfunctions in those systems can cost millions and take years to fix.",
      "As most states prepare to institute work requirements mandated by the tax and domestic spending law President Trump signed in July, senators wrote it is each company's responsibility to build functioning systems, \"rather than to prioritize their bottom line.\"",
      "Democratic Sens. Ron Wyden of Oregon, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, and Raphael Warnock of Georgia, as well as Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), sent the letters to several companies the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services identified as eligibility system contractors: Deloitte, GDIT, Gainwell Technologies, and Conduent.",
      "\"They're essentially health care middlemen that are in the business of red tape, and they profit when Americans don't get health care,\" Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, which oversees Medicaid, said in an interview.",
      "\"They've got a history of poor performance when it comes to determining eligibility or in helping Americans enroll in Medicaid,\" Wyden said. \"Without stronger oversight and real accountability, these contractors are just going to get a jumbo windfall for creating systems that actually harm Americans trying to get health care.\"",
      "Spokespeople for the four companies did not provide comments for this article.",
      "As of June, 70.5 million people were enrolled in Medicaid, according to CMS.",
      "A handful of states operate their own Medicaid eligibility and enrollment systems, but most rely on contractors to build and run them. KFF Health News found that Deloitte, a global consultancy that generated $70.5 billion in revenue in fiscal year 2025, dominates this slice of government business. Twenty-five states have awarded Deloitte contracts for eligibility systems. The agreements, in which the company commits to design, develop, implement, or operate state-owned systems, are worth at least $6 billion, dwarfing any of its competitors.",
      "Kinda Serafi, a partner at Manatt Health, is advising states on how to reconfigure their systems to incorporate work requirements.",
      "States are in a \"major sprint\" to make changes by 2027, she said, and they're being \"inundated\" with pitches from vendors looking to secure contracts. It underscores the business opportunity these system changes represent for contractors.",
      "\"I think we have to really be vigilant to make sure that these vendors are implementing the requirements consistent with the law,\" Serafi said.",
      "Companies sign contracts with state governments, but the federal government pays the bulk of the cost. The federal government covers 90% of states' costs to develop and implement state Medicaid eligibility systems and 75% of ongoing maintenance and operations expenses, according to federal regulations.",
      "The Senate letters cite problems with Deloitte-run eligibility systems that KFF Health News identified. Among other issues, the Florida eligibility system erroneously cut benefits for new moms, and a problem in Kentucky prevented coverage applications from getting through online, which cost $522,455 and took 10 months to resolve.",
      "\"Unfortunately, these are just a few examples of third-party systems' failure to serve their very function: to reliably and accurately determine an individual's eligibility for Medicaid coverage and services,\" the senators wrote.",
      "The senators asked the companies to respond by Oct. 31 to their questions, such as whether companies' contracts with states include financial incentives tying payment to the removal of Medicaid enrollees and whether the companies are penalized for coverage terminations made in error. The senators also demanded an accounting of the company's lobbying expenditures for the past five years and protocols for making system changes.",
      "By 2027, the Congressional Budget Office projected, based on an early version of the bill, 18.5 million Medicaid beneficiaries will have to work or complete other qualifying activities for 80 hours a month to keep their benefits, unless they qualify for an exemption. The CBO estimates that 5.3 million enrollees will lose coverage by 2034.",
      "The new work requirements are just one of several federally mandated Medicaid changes that are forcing states to adapt their eligibility systems.",
      "Medicaid work requirements have been plagued with problems in the few states where they've been tested. Medicaid enrollees have been frustrated in trying to navigate byzantine rules and glitchy technology. Work requirements have also come at great cost.",
      "Georgia has not adopted the ACA Medicaid expansion, which has granted benefits to millions of adults earning up to 138% of the federal poverty level. Instead, the state offers benefits to some people earning up to the poverty line who can prove they're working or participating in similar activities for 80 hours a month. Nearly 110,000 Georgians had applied to the state's Georgia Pathways to Coverage program through May, but only 9,157 people were enrolled as of mid-August. Under typical ACA expansion rules, 336,000 adults would be eligible for coverage, according to KFF.",
      "The Georgia program has cost $109 million, with $34 million spent on health benefits and more than $20 million allocated to marketing contracts, according to a KFF Health News analysis of state reports. Deloitte built Georgia's eligibility system and is the primary consultant for the Pathways program.",
      "Before Medicaid work requirements became federal law, Arizona also submitted a request to federal regulators to launch its own version that would apply to roughly 190,000 people.",
      "The state's application provided insight into the types of system changes states may soon need to make to manage the new federal work requirement.",
      "Arizona Medicaid officials said they would gather information on enrollees' work hours, training, and education. The state's eligibility system, which is operated by Accenture, would also need to check whether someone is exempt.",
      "States are in the early stages of determining changes they need to make to implement work requirements.",
      "Tessa Outhyse, a spokesperson for the California Department of Health Care Services, said the state expects upgrades to be processed \"through the existing contractual change order process.\" State contracts with eligibility companies often set aside millions to cover the cost of changes, but systems may require upgrades beyond the agreed-upon work.",
      "In Missouri, upgrades are expected to cost roughly $33 million, according to a state budget document.",
      "The state has a contract with private company RedMane to handle some of its Medicaid eligibility processing. Missouri plans to hire an additional contractor to ensure it properly institutes Medicaid work requirements, according to Baylee Watts, a spokesperson for Missouri's Department of Social Services.",
      "Medicaid eligibility contractors \"have a lot of leverage and expertise to influence contracts, to win contracts,\" Wyden said. \"They can do a lot more, to the value of what we're giving them.\"",

    "summary": "A prolonged government shutdown, as occurred in 2018, could lead to long lines at TSA checkpoints and economic losses, experts warn.",
    "story": [
      "Although a short U.S. government shutdown would be unlikely to have much impact on air travel, a prolonged impasse could lead to disruptions for passengers and financial losses for businesses, according to travel experts and industry groups.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration and Transportation Security Administration define most of their employees as essential, requiring them to work even if the government closes and workers at other federal agencies are furloughed. That means airport screeners, air traffic controllers, federal air marshals, safety inspectors and other workers with the two agencies are expected to continue showing up on the job \u2014 without pay \u2014 even as lawmakers failed this week to strike a deal on federal funding.",
      "But things could get messy if a shutdown dragged on and government employees suddenly deprived of a paycheck come under financial pressure, Caleb Harmon-Marshall, a former TSA officer, told CBS News.",
      "\"TSA officers are expected to continue to report to work. But in the past, if a shutdown exceeds two weeks, officers start to get frantic, and they stop going to work,\" he said, adding that agency personnel may call in sick and even seek other job opportunities if a shutdown persists.",
      "Any ensuing labor shortages can lead to snarled lines at airport security. For example, roughly 10% of TSA workers called in sick during the 34-day government shutdown that started in December 2018 and extended into 2019, driving up screening times at major airports across the country.",
      "\"So if officers decide not to come to work, there is less personnel manning checkpoints, and wait times can potentially get longer,\" Harmon-Marshall said.",
      "A shutdown began at 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday, Oct. 1, after the Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded. If lawmakers passed a spending bill, TSA and FAA workers would be entitled to back pay for any time worked during a shutdown.",
      "$1 billion hit",
      "The U.S. Travel Association, a trade group, warned that a government shutdown could cost the economy $1 billion a week, while also inconveniencing passengers and hurting travel industry businesses.",
      "\"A shutdown exacerbates staffing shortages among Transportation Security Administration officers and air traffic controllers, threatening longer airport security lines, flight delays and cancellations,\" the group said in a Sept. 25 letter. \"It halts hiring and training of new air traffic controllers when we are already short more than 2,800 controllers nationwide, and restarting the process adds further delays even after funding is restored.\"",
      "The U.S. is already experiencing a shortage of air traffic controllers, and has launched an effort to hire more than 2,000 additional controllers by the end of the fiscal year.",
      "Neither the White House nor the Transportation Department responded to requests for comment about the impact of a potential government shutdown on travel in the U.S.",
      "By contrast, train travel is unlikely to be disrupted if the government closes this week, according to the Rail Passengers Association, which represents the nation's rail travelers. Although Amtrak receives some federal funding and could eventually be impacted if a shutdown dragged on, the rail service is financially healthy enough to pay workers in the near term and keep trains in operation, the group\u00a0said in a statement last week.",
      "Passport services are also deemed essential and would be expected to operate during a government shutdown."

      "Even with a U.S. government shutdown beginning on Wednesday, Oct. 1, the 74 million Americans who collect Social Security will continue receiving their monthly checks, although some services could be disrupted due to a potential halt in federal activities, according to experts.",
      "Social Security benefits are covered by mandatory spending, which means that the funding for the program has already been approved by Congress without an expiration date. As a result, Social Security recipients, including retirees, disabled Americans and the dependents of deceased workers, wouldn't see an interruption in their monthly payments if the government shuts down.",
      "However, other Social Security services could be impacted by a shutdown, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare. The Social Security Administration's working budget requires approval from Congress. The Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded past Sept. 30.",
      "With no agreement having been reached, some Social Security services could be temporarily halted until the issue is resolved, according to both the Social Security Administration and experts on the retirement program.",
      "\"The system hasn't missed a payment in its entire 90-year history and won't start now,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare, said in an email. \"But customer service at the Social Security Administration (SSA) may be disrupted, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing, and replacing Medicare cards.\"",
      "In preparation for past shutdowns, each federal agency has created a contingency plan for its operations, with some employees expected to work without pay because they're considered to be providing essential services. In an email to CBS News, the SSA said beneficiaries would continue to receive payments even if the government closes.",

The COLA is intended to ensure that people's benefits keep up with inflation and that the value of their Social Security income doesn't erode over time.",
      "The SSA announces the annual COLA each October when the Labor Department releases its Consumer Price Index data that month, which this year is scheduled for Oct. 15. But there could be a hitch this year if federal agencies shut down, according to the Labor Department.",
      "\"A delay of the CPI release during October of each year might have an impact on the Cost of Living Adjustment announcement by the Social Security Administration,\" the Labor Department said in issuing a\u00a0contingency plan that covers the impact of a possible shutdown on its operations.",
      "When is the next Social Security payment?",
      "Social Security payments would continue to go out as usual during a shutdown, with recipients of Supplemental Security Income \u2014 a program for low-income and disabled people \u2014 scheduled to receive their next checks on Oct. 1.",
      "Social Security recipients will receive their checks on their usual schedule, which is based on their birth date.

    "story": [
      "Airports in U.S. cities including Denver; Newark, New Jersey; and Burbank, California, experienced flight delays Monday amid shortages of air traffic controllers, according to federal flight data.",
      "Federal officials have flagged more air traffic control facilities for low staffing levels in recent days than they have since the summer of 2022, when the post-COVID travel boom sent delays and cancellations soaring, according to a CBS News data analysis of Federal Aviation Administration airspace advisories.",
      "The shortage of air traffic controllers at some airports comes as the U.S. government shutdown that has shuttered federal agencies continues into a second week.",
      "Flights into Hollywood Burbank Airport, which serves Los Angeles, were slowed until 1 a.m. Tuesday, resulting in average delays of 2.5 hours, FAA data shows. No air traffic controllers were on duty on Monday evening at the airport, California Gov. Gavin Newsom wrote in a social media post.",
      "According to CBS News Los Angeles, plane captains taking off from the Burbank airport were being asked to contact SoCal Approach, a San Diego-based company also known as Southern California TRACON, so they could communicate and get departure clearance.",
      "When there's a shortage of air traffic controllers, the FAA reduces the number of takeoffs and landings to ensure the on-duty personnel aren't overwhelmed and the system remains safe. But that can creates flight delays and cancellations.",
      "\"Fragile\" aviation system",
      "On Monday, a total of almost 6,000 flights were delayed in the U.S., including 42% of flights leaving from Chicago's O'Hare International Airport and 23% of those from Hollywood Burbank\u00a0according to tracking site FlightAware. Weather issues also caused some flight delays on Monday.",
      "As of Tuesday morning at 9 a.m. EDT, more than 600 flights within the U.S. had been delayed, FlightAware data shows.",
      "The National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA), the union representing the nation's air traffic controllers, on Monday instructed its members to keep working\u00a0during the\u00a0government shutdown. Because air traffic controllers are classified as essential workers, they're expected to continue working without pay, although they would receive back pay once the shutdown ends.",
      "\"It is normal for a few air traffic controllers to call in sick on any given day, and this is the latest example of how fragile our aviation system is in the midst of a national shortage of these critical safety professionals,\" NATCA said in statement.",
      "It added, \"NATCA has consistently warned that the controller staffing shortage leaves the system vulnerable, and today's events underscore the urgent need to accelerate training and hiring.\"",
      "The TSA has seen a slight increase in air traffic controllers\u00a0calling in sick\u00a0since the shutdown began last week, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Monday at a news conference at Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey.",
      "\"We're tracking sick calls, sick leave. And have we had a slight tick up in sick calls? Yes,\" he told reporters. \"You'll see delays come from that. ... Our priorities are safety, and so if we have additional calls, we will reduce the flow consistent with a rate that's safe for the American people.\"",
      "Near the end of a 34-day government shutdown in late 2018 and early 2019, there were widespread flight delays because of shortages of controllers.",

    "summary": "Minutes from September Fed meeting reveal a divide between members who support additional rate cuts and those worried about inflation.",
    "story": [
      "Federal Reserve officials remain cautious about future interest rate cuts, with an account from the central bank's meeting in September underscoring the division among central bank officials over the best path for monetary policy.",
      "While some officials think the Fed's benchmark rate is too high and weighing on the economy, others point to persistent inflation that remains above the central bank's 2% target as evidence of the need need to show caution in lowering borrowing costs.",
      "Most members of the Fed's rate-setting committee supported further reductions to its key interest rate this year, according to minutes from last month's meeting released on Wednesday.",
      "A majority of Fed officials perceived growing risks to the job market since their previous meeting in July, while the threat of rising inflation \"had either diminished or not increased,\" according to the minutes. As a result, the central bank decided at its Sept. 16-17 meeting to reduce its key rate by a quarter of a percentage point, its first cut since December of 2024.",
      "\"The overall message appears to be that, although most participants are on board with further cuts, it probably won't take much for the FOMC to take a slower approach than it indicated last month,\" Stephen Brown, deputy chief North America economist at Capital Economics, said in a research note. \"We still see scope for the Fed to skip its projected cut in December, based on our view that the economy and labor market will outperform current downbeat expectations.\"",
      "Fed rate cuts often gradually lead to lower borrowing costs for mortgages,\u00a0auto loans, credit cards and business loans, encouraging more spending and hiring.",
      "Only one official formally dissented from the quarter-point cut \u2014 Stephen Miran, who was appointed by President Trump and was approved by the Senate just hours before the meeting began. He supported a larger, half-point cut instead.",
      "But the minutes also noted that \"a few\" policymakers said they could have supported keeping rates unchanged, or said that \"there was merit\" in such a step.",
      "The differences help explain Chair Jerome Powell's statements during the news conference that followed the meeting: \"There are no risk-free paths now. It's not incredibly obvious what to do.\"",
      "Miran said in remarks Tuesday that he thinks inflation will steadily decline back toward the Fed's 2% target, and as a result he doesn't think the Fed's rate needs to be nearly as high as it is. Rental costs around the U.S. are steadily falling and will bring down inflation, he predicted, while higher tariff revenues will reduce the government's budget deficit and reduce longer-term interest rates, giving the Fed more room to cut.",
      "Yet ther Fed officials remain concerned about stubbornly high inflation, the minutes showed. Jeffrey Schmid, president of the Federal Reserve's Kansas City branch, said in a speech Monday that \"inflation is too high\" and argued that the Fed should keep rates high enough to cool demand and prevent inflation from worsening.",
      "\"Looking ahead, most participants indicated that additional policy easing would likely be appropriate later this year, provided inflation continued to trend lower and labor market risks persisted,\" EY-Parthenon Chief Economist Gregory Daco said in a research note assessing the latest Fed minutes. \"However, views diverged, with some participants noting that financial conditions were not particularly tight and warning against over-correcting.\"",
      "Austan Goolsbee, president of the Fed's Chicago branch, said in an interview Friday with The Associated Press that he supported a cautious approach toward further lowering rates, and wanted to see evidence that inflation would cool further.",
      "\"I am a little uneasy with front-loading rate cuts, presuming that those upticks in inflation will just go away,\" he said."

    "published": "Wed, 08 Oct 2025 15:12:26 -0400",
    "summary": "A range of factors has driven gold prices to record highs this year \u2014 a surge some Wall Street analysts think is likely to continue.",
    "story": [
      "Gold is glittering for investors, with prices now topping a record $4,000 an ounce. But the reasons behind the shiny metal's surge may be less than dazzling, with Wall Street analysts saying it reflects growing unease over the U.S. economy and political stability.",
      "The price of gold has leaped 53%\u00a0this year alone, far outpacing the 15% gain in the S&P 500 stock index over the same period. The price of an ounce of gold edged higher on Wednesday, touching $4,078, according to financial data company FactSet, with some analysts predicting it to go higher.",
      "Investors have long turned to gold during periods of economic turmoil and high inflation, viewing it as both a safe haven when markets turn volatile and a hedge against rising prices.",
      "Of late, however, stock prices have steamed to record highs this year, economic growth has accelerated in recent months and inflation this year has remained relatively subdued, prompting questions about what's fueling investors' renewed appetite for gold.",
      "\"$4,000 an ounce seemed far-fetched at the start of the year as gold entered 2025 near $2,800 an ounce. But after a ~50% rally, here we are,\" eToro U.S. investment analyst Bret Kenwell said in an email.",
      "The reasons for the surge boil down to several economic and political factors, according to Kenwell and other investment analysts.",
      "Economic uncertainty",
      "Gold is often a refuge for investors when they're worried about the economy, and the ongoing U.S. government shutdown is only fueling their anxieties, according to Nigel Green, CEO of investment firm deVere Group.",
      "\"The situation in Washington has reminded investors that political promises do not equate to financial security. Gold represents protection from that uncertainty, but its price now also reflects how much faith has drained from other assets. That level of dependence always carries risk,\" Green said in an email.",
      "Although the economy continues to expand, investors are also expressing concern about potential headwinds to growth, including the impact of U.S. tariffs and a weakening job market, according to economists.",
      "Federal agencies currently aren't releasing economic data due to the government shutdown, now in its second week. That makes it more difficult to get a handle on the state of the economy, said Kevin Ford, FX and macro strategist at Convera.",
      "\"[T]he US economy remains a challenge to read due to the ongoing government shutdown, which has severely diminished visibility,\" Ford noted. \"However, the shutdown is a material headwind: S&P Global Ratings estimates it could trim GDP growth by 0.1\u22120.2 percentage point for every week the government remains closed.\"",
      "Fed rate cuts",
      "In September, the Federal Reserve lowered its benchmark interest rate for the first time since late 2024 and signaled that two more cuts could be in the cards later this year.",
      "Gold has risen partly due to investor expectations that the Fed is entering a cycle of easing its monetary policy, according to Bart Melek, head of commodity strategy at TD Securities.",
      "With interest rates seemingly heading lower, gold is more attractive as a financial asset because investors aren't losing out on higher yields from Treasuries and other government bonds, he told investors in a report. And with inflation drifting up due to the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs, gold can also continue to offer an inflation hedge.",
      "Gold \"may be a better safe-haven than Treasuries,\" Melek wrote. \"Add to that the fact that ore grades are dropping, the increased use of these factors of production suggests that gold would be better at protecting purchasing power.\"",
      "Global gold demand",
      "Investments in gold have also been driven by other factors. Analysts point to strong gold demand from central banks around the world amid heightened geopolitical tensions, such as the ongoing wars in Gaza and Ukraine.",
      "\"The gold rally started in 2022,\" Giovanni Staunovo, commodity analyst at UBS Global Wealth Management, said via email on Tuesday. The \"trigger point\" for the increase was when the U.S. and other Western allies moved to freeze around $300 billion of Russian foreign holdings at the beginning of the war in Ukraine, he added.",
      "Central banks in other nations are \"the quiet force behind this climb,\" deVere's Green said. \"They are buying close to one thousand [tons] of gold each year to reduce exposure to the dollar and to reinforce their financial resilience. When official institutions keep accumulating at this rate, they create a strong foundation beneath the market, but even that has limits.\"",
      "Where could gold go from here?",
      "Some investment pros think gold has more room to run, pointing to ongoing economic challenges such as the slowing U.S. job market and rising inflation, as well as the Fed likely continuing to push down borrowing costs.",
      "\"We think the rally is not yet done \u2014 we expect prices to rise to $4,200/oz over the coming months \u2014 and keep our 'attractive' rating on gold in our global strategy,\" Ulrike Hoffmann-Burchardi, CIO Americas and global head of equities at UBS Global Wealth Management, told investors in an email.",
      "Goldman Sachs is forecasting that gold could hit $4,900 an ounce by December 2026, Reuters reported.",
      "Still, experts urge average investors not to put all their eggs in one basket. Critics say gold isn't always the inflation hedge many claim and that there are more efficient ways to protect against potential loss of capital, such as derivative-based investments.",
      "\"Gold is perceived by many market participants as a safe-haven asset. But investors need to be aware it has a volatility of 10-15%,\" Staunovo noted. He added that smaller amounts of physical gold, such as gold coins or 1-gram bars, have larger ranges between buying and selling prices."

    "summary": "A growing number of Americans, squeezed by inflation and elevated interest rates, face the risk of losing their home in foreclosure.",
    "story": [
      "Kimberly Draxler was in shock when she called her mortgage lender in April and was told her four-bedroom home in Hillview, Kentucky, would be sold out from under her in a matter of days.",
      "Though she had been alerted that something might be wrong by a letter in the mail from an attorney offering assistance in warding off foreclosure, she said her lender never informed her that she was about to lose her home.",
      "\"They never called me and told me they were just going to rip my house right underneath me,\" Draxler told CBS News.",
      "Draxler's lender said it notifies all borrowers of a possible foreclosure by mail and by phone throughout the process, in compliance with federal debt collection rules.",
      "Before learning that her home was entering foreclosure, Draxler, who is 57 and on disability, said she stayed afloat financially by relying on her son, who contributed $600 a month to help take care of household expenses. But after he moved out in 2024, her bills began to pile up, she told CBS News. Draxler soon fell behind on her mortgage.",
      "The financial pressures bearing down on Draxler highlight the struggles of homeowners still grappling with the rising cost of everything from housing and\u00a0groceries to\u00a0energy bills\u00a0and insurance coverage. With many households stretched thin, unexpected events such as job loss, unplanned medical expense or even simple car problems can cause people to fall behind on their mortgages.",
      "\"I just couldn't do it anymore\"",
      "Although foreclosures \u2014 which include default notices, scheduled auctions or bank repossessions \u2014 remain well below their pre-pandemic levels, they are on the rise.",
      "As of August, foreclosure filings had risen six straights months year-over-year and were up 18% from the same period in 2024, according to property data firm ATTOM. Through June, roughly 188,000 properties had foreclosure filings, putting the U.S. on track to surpass the roughly 322,000 U.S. properties that went into foreclosure in 2024.",
      "\"Paying for the house, the car, the necessity bills \u2014 I just couldn't do it anymore,\" said Draxler, who had come close to losing her home in foreclosure on three previous occasions over the last decade.",
      "Roughly 94% of mortgage defaults occur after a homeowner loses income to extenuating circumstances,\u00a0according\u00a0to The Urban Institute, citing\u00a0data\u00a0from the National Bureau of Economic Research.",
      "Rising homeownership costs",
      "A key factor behind the rise in foreclosure rates is the growing cost home insurance, utilities, property taxes, repairs and other homeownership expenses. For example, single-family homeowners with a mortgage today pay an average of\u00a0$2,370 a year for property coverage\u00a0\u2014 up nearly 70% from five years ago, according to data from ICE Mortgage Technology.",
      "In addition to rising homeowners insurance costs, many households are also contending with exorbitant property taxes as well as elevated interest rates.",
      "\"All of these rising costs associated with holding a home, you have increasing pressure on existing homeowners to continue to be able to afford and pay for their mortgages,\" Geoff Smith, executive director of the Institute for Housing Studies at DePaul University, told CBS News.",
      "Todd Teta, chief product and technology officer at ATTOM, also cited the recent slowdown in hiring as a factor behind rising mortgage delinquencies, noting that job loss often drives foreclosures.",
      "A high interest rate environment can be particularly challenging for homeowners with variable-rate loans, which reset at certain intervals in part based on market conditions. That means a homeowner might see a major jump in their monthly mortgage payment if their reset occurs when interest rates are elevated.",
      "A narrow escape",
      "More such loans are now hitting their reset periods, Teta noted, a trend he expects to continue. \"While there has been a small dip in interest rates, they remain significantly higher than just a few years ago, so borrowers with upcoming resets are still likely to see sizable payment increases.\"",
      "As for Draxler, she managed to keep her home by filing for Chapter 13 bankruptcy, which allows debtors to hold onto their property and pay off debt over time, usually within three to five years. But coming so close to losing her home of more than 30 years continues to weigh on her.",
      "\"I did not want to lose my house,\" Draxler said. \"I wouldn't have no place to go.\""

    "summary": "Low-income older Americans on average die nearly a decade earlier than wealthier people, a new analysis finds.",
    "story": [
      "Wealth has long been tied to longevity in the U.S. and other countries, but a new analysis helps quantify the gap between how long low-income older Americans and their more affluent peers tend to live.",
      "Low-income people over 60 years old die an average of nine years earlier than high-income older Americans, according to the new study from the National Council on Aging\ufeff\u00a0(NCOA) and University of Massachusetts Boston's LeadingAge LTSS Center, which studies aging.",
      "Generally, middle-income older Americans are also dying younger than wealthier people, the researchers founds. About 15% of seniors with annual household incomes of roughly $60,000 died during the four-year study period, compared with about 11% in households with incomes of around $120,000.",
      "\"This is the first time we've tied health and wealth together \u2014 this was really shocking for me,\" said Jessica Johnston, senior director of the NCOA's Center for Economic Well-Being, of the nine-year life gap. \"We all traditionally and culturally were taught to value our elders, and if we played by the rules we could age well, and I think that's changing.\"",
      "The study is based on an analysis of data from 2018 to 2022 gathered through the University of Michigan's Health and Retirement Study, a longitudinal panel study that tracks 10,000 households. NCOA, a nonprofit group based in Arlington, Virginia, advocates for older adults.",
      "The findings have implications for an aging society that has seen widening economic inequality, with the income gap between the richest and poorest households growing wider in recent decades, according to the Urban Institute, a think tank in Washington, D.C., as well as\u00a0to other researchers.",
      "As the U.S. population ages, the divide between rich and poor is also reflected in the experiences of senior citizens, with many reaching retirement age without the financial resources to handle shocks like a health emergency or the loss of a spouse, the NCOA study found.",
      "The difference in average mortality age by income could be due to a lack of preventative care for low-income seniors, an inability to pay for care as they age or the stress of financial instability, Johnston said.",
      "The poverty rate among U.S. seniors rose to 15% last year from 14% in 2023, the highest among all age groups, according to Census data.",
      "\"Older adults are placed into situations where they are going to have to make really difficult decisions: Am I going to go to the grocery store, am I going to pay rent or am I going to get my medication?\" Johnston told CBS News. \"It's not only about forgoing one of those things, but it's the added stress about those decisions.\"",
      "About 80% of people over 60 have few, or even zero, financial assets and would struggle to cope with a financial shock like the loss of a spouse or needing long-term care, according to the report. Most of those Americans will face financial insecurity in their later years, the researchers said.",
      "\"If older adults can't afford long-term care or can't afford medicine, family members are often picking up that cost,\" Johnston said. \"The lost economic productivity among Gen Xers and millennials will play out over the next one to two decades.\""

    "published": "Tue, 07 Oct 2025 14:06:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Thirty paintings by Bob Ross are set to be auctioned to support public television stations after federal funding cuts.",
    "story": [
      "Thirty paintings created by the bushy-haired, soft-spoken Bob Ross will soon be up for auction to defray the costs of programming for small and rural public television stations suffering under cuts in federal funding.",
      "Ross, a public television stalwart in the 1980s and '90s, \"dedicated his life to making art accessible to everyone,\" said Joan Kowalski, president of Bob Ross Inc. \"This auction ensures his legacy continues to support the very medium that brought his joy and creativity into American homes for decades.\"",
      "The 30 paintings to be auctioned span his career. Most were created on-air during single episodes of Ross' show, \"The Joy of Painting.\" Ross was known for his calm demeanor. During the show, he often spoke about painting happy little clouds and trees, and making no mistakes, only \"happy accidents.\" He died of cancer complications in 1995.",
      "Bonhams in Los Angeles will auction three of Ross' paintings on Nov. 11. Other auctions will follow in London, New York, Boston and online. Bonhams sold two early 1990s mountain-and-lake scenes of Ross in August for $114,800 and $95,750.",
      "The auctions of the 30 paintings soon to be sold have an estimated total value of $850,000 to $1.4 million, Bonhams said. All profits are pledged to stations that use content from distributor American Public Television.",
      "The idea is to help stations in need with licensing fees that allow them to show popular programs that include \"The Best of Joy of Painting,\" based on Ross' show, \"America's Test Kitchen,\" \"Julia Child's French Chef Classics\" and \"This Old House.\"",
      "As desired by President Donald Trump, Congress has eliminated $1.1 billion allocated to public broadcasting, leaving about 330 PBS and 246 NPR stations to find alternative funding sources.",
      "Many stations launched emergency fund drives. Some stations have received more help than they expected, CBS News previously reported. North Carolina public radio station WQHR raised more than $200,000 in just three days, surpassing the $174,000 they needed to fill. Hawaii Public Radio lost $525,000, but donations raised $650,000.",
      "NPR has also encouraged donors in wealthier areas to support stations in regions that are in greater need. PBS and NPR have also worked to reduce the annual dues stations pay for programming and other services to lower their costs. Some stations are working on collaborations to see if they can share services and reduce costs.",
      "Still, the federal cuts have had an impact. Not all stations have seen an outpouring of donors. PBS slashed its budget by 21% and laid off about 100 employees in September. Stations have also had to lay off staff and reduce programming, CBS News previously reported. No stations have shut down yet, but operators are worried about what happens if donor money dries up.",
      "\"I am a realist,\" PBS president Paula Kerger said in September. \"I have to believe that there are some vulnerable stations that are not going to make it.\"",
      "National Public Radio president and CEO Katherine Maher\u00a0told CBS News in July\u00a0that defunding public media services \"is a real risk to the public safety of the country.\"",
      "\"Public media, public radio, public television, are a critical part of the emergency response plans of nearly half of the states in this nation,\" Maher said in an interview with CBS News. \"If these types of emergency alerting go away, you will have fewer outlets to be able to respond in real time\" to future natural disasters."

    "story": [
      "The union representing the nation's air traffic controllers is directing its members to keep working during the U.S. government shutdown now stretching\u00a0into its second week, with the labor group warning that failure to report for duty could lead to termination.",
      "The National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA) told members Monday that it discourages federal employees from taking any actions that would compromise air safety. The group represents more than 20,000 air traffic controllers, engineers and professionals in aviation safety-related roles.",
      "\"Air traffic controllers and other aviation safety professionals take their responsibility to protect the safety of the flying public very seriously. Participating in a job action could result in removal from federal service,\" NATCA said in a message to members posted in part on the group's\u00a0website. \"It is not only illegal, but it also undermines NATCA's credibility and severely weakens our ability to effectively advocate for you and your families.\"",
      "Sick calls edge up",
      "The union's warning came as Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Monday at a news conference at Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey that TSA has seen a slight increase in air traffic controllers\u00a0calling in sick since the shutdown began last week.",
      "\"We're tracking sick calls, sick leave. And have we had a slight tick up in sick calls? Yes,\" he told reporters. \"You'll see delays come from that. ... Our priorities are safety, and so if we have additional calls, we will reduce the flow consistent with a rate that's safe for the American people.\"",
      "Duffy also acknowledged the potential effect on worker morale of being required to work without pay.",
      "\"They have bills,\" he said. \"So now they're thinking about that at the same time that they're controlling the airspace, which I don't like that. \u2026 We want them to leave their personal problems at the door when they go into a tower or into a facility.\"",
      "On Tuesday, Duffy told\u00a0CNBC that controllers are anxious both because the job itself is demanding and because \"they're concerned they may not get a paycheck.\"",
      "The \"shutdown is forcing them to work without the guarantee that their paychecks come in a timely manner. So they're stressed,\" he added.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration defines air traffic controllers as\u00a0essential workers, requiring them to stay on the job during government closures despite going unpaid. Essential employees required to continue working during a shutdown are guaranteed back pay once the stalemate ends and lawmakers restore government funding.",
      "\"We cannot stress enough that it is essential to avoid any actions that could reflect poorly on you, our Union, or our professions,\" NATCA said in the message to workers.\u00a0\"We urge you to stand in solidarity with your brothers and sisters by continuing to exhibit the same unwavering professionalism that the aviation community and the American people deserve.\"",
      "\"Uncertainty and hardships\"",
      "In a video message on TikTok, NATCA President Nick Daniels also noted that the government shutdown \"creates uncertainty and hardships for our members.\"",
      "NATCA didn't immediately reply to a request for comment.",
      "TSA officers are also deemed essential essential workers under federal rules and must continue reporting to work during the lapse in federal funding. During previous shutdowns, being forced to work without pay has led to a rise in worker absences\u00a0and some leaving government service, according to former TSA officials.",
      "During the 34-day government shutdown from December of 2018 to January of 2019, roughly 10% of TSA workers called in sick, according to the agency, leading to delays in security screenings at major airports across the U.S.",
      "More recently, a\u00a0nationwide shortage of air traffic controllers has led to delays at airports across the U.S. According to a CBS News review, more than 90% of air traffic control towers across the country are understaffed (Visit\u00a0fly.faa.gov\u00a0for real-time information on any flight impacts at U.S. airports because of staffing, weather or other factors.)",
      "As the impasse in Congress continues, the Senate is expected to hold procedural votes again on Monday night on dueling measures to fund the government and end the shutdown."

      "\"This is a GREAT Day for the Arab and Muslim World, Israel, all surrounding Nations, and the United States of America,\" the president wrote on Truth Social. \"BLESSED ARE THE PEACEMAKERS!\"",
      "Witkoff and Kushner then traveled to Cairo, and met with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi to tell him he was needed for the implementation phase. After the El-Sisi meeting, Witkoff and Kushner flew to Tel Aviv.",
      "6:30p, Tel Aviv, Thursday, Oct. 9: Witkoff, Kushner met with applause in Cabinet room",
      "Witkoff and Kushner arrive in Tel Aviv, though they never made it to their hotel. They immediately went to see President Isaac Herzog, to walk him through the plan, and then met with Netanyahu. They also spoke to the Israeli Cabinet, receiving a warm welcome.",
      "In the Cabinet room, \"everybody started clapping,\" a U.S. official said. \"There were plenty of differences of opinion that we heard there. There were hardliners, there were people who wanted to see the 20 hostages come home above all else, but we talked, and we explored different pathways to get to good compromises.\"",
      "Their reason for going to Israel was to ensure \"implementation occurs.\" Another senior U.S. official acknowledged, \"There's still just a lot of ways that this can go wrong.\"",
      "\"So, we're staying on top of the details to make sure everyone fulfills their obligations and that any misunderstandings are quickly discussed and adjudicated,\" the official said.",
      "A U.S. official suggested Mr. Trump may have succeeded in reaching a deal where other leaders failed because \"he's not trying to be a middle-of-the-roader.\"",
      "\"He's basically stood shoulder to shoulder with Israel 100%,\" the official said. This has meant Israel \"has a lot of trust in him that he's not going to ask them to do anything that would compromise their security. And because they know that if they agree together on what the end state should be, President Trump and his team were able to have much more frank and creative conversations with Israel on how to get there.\""

    "story": [
      "Pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca will offer U.S. patients discounted prices for some prescription drugs, President Trump announced Friday, the second major drug company to strike a deal with the Trump administration in recent weeks.",
      "Under the deal, AstraZeneca will offer its drugs to Medicaid patients at \"most-favored-nation\" prices, meaning the U.K.-based drugmaker will charge no more than the lowest rate offered in other high-income countries, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Mehmet Oz said in a Friday afternoon Oval Office event. AstraZeneca also promised to offer new prescription drugs at most-favored-nation rates, Oz said.",
      "AstraZeneca will also list \"all primary care medications\" on a government website called TrumpRx, and it will offer discounts for some drugs, including lung disease medication, according to Oz. The company said in a statement that it will offer drugs at up to an 80% discount for \"eligible patients with prescriptions for chronic diseases.\"",
      "TrumpRx \u2014 which is set to launch early next year \u2014 will not sell drugs directly, but will instead direct consumers to lower prices elsewhere, Oz said. AstraZeneca said the website will allow patients to buy drugs directly from the company at a \"reduced cash price.\"",
      "The AstraZeneca announcement came less than two weeks after Pfizer reached a similar deal to offer most-favored-nation rates to Medicaid patients and list drugs on TrumpRx.",
      "Policymakers have struggled with high prescription drug prices for decades. Members of both parties have floated proposals to tie drug prices to the typically much lower rates offered in other countries, but the idea faces legal impediments, and drugmakers have argued that price controls could make it harder for them to invest in research.",
      "Mr. Trump has pressed some of the largest pharmaceutical companies to voluntarily offer drugs to Medicaid patients and new drugs at most-favored-nation rates, floating tighter regulations if companies do not comply. Separately, Mr. Trump has threatened 100% tariffs on pharmaceuticals unless drugmakers are in the process of building U.S.-based plants. AstraZeneca on Friday announced plans to invest in U.S. manufacturing and research facilities.",
      "But questions remain about how the president's deals with drugmakers will work, and who will feel the difference at the pharmacy counter, some experts caution.",
      "Most-favored-nation pricing could have a muted impact on Medicaid patients, experts say, because the program already has a statutory \"best price\" protection that guarantees the lowest price offered to any U.S. commercial payer. Also, while it could save states money, Medicaid users typically don't pay out-of-pocket for their medication.",
      "\"Medicaid already enjoys 'best-price' protection in the sense that they receive the lowest prices charged to any commercial payer in the United States. Therefore, we are starting out at prices well below the averages seen in the U.S. market,\" Darius Lakdawalla, chief scientific officer at the University of Southern California's Schaeffer Center, told CBS News in reaction to the Pfizer deal.",
      "It's also unclear how many people would benefit from TrumpRx. For uninsured patients or those with high deductibles, such an option could matter, if their prescriptions are among those listed. But most people obtain their medications through insurance.",
      "\"The direct-to-patient stuff is, in my view, a sideshow and branding opportunity for Trump,\" Sean Sullivan, a health economist at the University of Washington, told CBS News following the Pfizer agreement. \"Most patients have drug coverage. \u2026 Very few are going to buy medications with cash, unless the drug is not a covered benefit, like weight loss or erectile dysfunction drugs.\""

      "The agreement, which Hegseth announced alongside Qatari Minister of Defense Sheikh Saoud bin Abdulrahman Al Thani at the Pentagon, will allow Qatari pilots to receive training alongside U.S. soldiers. There are no foreign military bases in the U.S., but some foreign militaries do maintain a presence for training. The Singaporean Air Force also has a presence at the Mountain Home base.",

However, to be clear, Qatar will not have their own base in the United States-nor anything like a base. We control the existing base, like we do with all partners.\"",
      "The move is another demonstration of the Trump administration's increasingly close relationship with Qatar.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump said Friday he will impose an additional 100% tariff on imports from China starting next month, citing new Chinese export controls \u2014 marking a significant escalation in the U.S.-China trade war.",
      "The new 100% tariffs will add on to any existing import taxes on Chinese goods, the president wrote in a Truth Social post. Tariffs on Chinese imports currently stand at 30%. Mr. Trump said the U.S. will also impose export controls on \"any and all critical software\" starting next month.",
      "The tariffs could be imposed on Nov. 1 or sooner, \"depending on any further actions or changes taken by China,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "The president's announcement came hours after he threatened steeper duties on China. He pointed to new Chinese rules that require companies to get special approval to export products containing even trace amounts of rare earths from China, even if they were manufactured outside of the country. China mines and processes most of the world's rare earth metals, which are\u00a0critical minerals used to manufacture products including semiconductors, electric car batteries, jet engines and defense weapons.",
      "\"It is impossible to believe that China would have taken such an action, but they have, and the rest is History,\" the president wrote in his Friday message announcing the tariffs, calling China's export controls \"extraordinarily aggressive\" and a \"moral disgrace.\"",
      "Separately on Friday, China\u00a0imposed port fees on U.S.-owned ships that dock in the country, retaliating against what Beijing called a \"discriminatory\" U.S. port fee on Chinese ships.",
      "Major stock indexes fell sharply on Friday after Mr. Trump's initial tariff threat. The S&P 500 dropped 2.7%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average 1.8% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite 3.6%.",
      "The new tariffs and export restrictions could inflame trade talks between China and the Trump administration. Mr. Trump is set to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping later this month, but the U.S. president said earlier Friday \"there seems to be no reason\" for the meeting to take place.",
      "China is the United States' third-largest trading partner after Mexico and Canada, with the U.S. importing $438.9 billion worth of Chinese goods and China buying $143.5 billion in U.S. goods last year, according to federal statistics.",
      "But China and the U.S. have had a rocky relationship on trade in recent months. Over the spring, American tariffs on Chinese goods spiked to 145% and Chinese tariffs on U.S. imports soared to 125%, following a set of tit-for-tat hikes that began with import duties unveiled by the Trump administration. In May, the U.S. and China agreed to slash their tariffs to 30% and 10%, respectively, while the two sides pursued a broader trade deal.",
      "The U.S.-China economic relationship has other complexities, too. The Trump administration needs Beijing's permission to close a deal to transfer ownership of TikTok's U.S. operations away from China-based parent company ByteDance. China has also chafed at some of the administration's restrictions on international students."

    "summary": "ICE's John Schultz said he's \"confident\" that once the administration receives approval from a third country to accept Abrego Garcia, he could be deported within 72 hours.",
    "story": [
      "Greenbelt, Maryland \u2014 A federal judge on Friday sharply questioned Justice Department lawyers about Trump administration plans to again deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Salvadoran man who was mistakenly deported to a prison in his home country earlier this year before he was brought back to the U.S. to face criminal charges.",
      "U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis questioned what is standing in the way of immigration authorities removing Abrego Garcia to Costa Rica, a country that he has said is his preferred place to go and which has indicated it is willing to accept him.",
      "Xinis also repeatedly expressed frustration with testimony from a U.S. immigration official, Jonathan Schultz, who appeared to answer questions about the administration's next steps regarding Abrego Garcia's potential removal to Eswatini, a small African nation formerly known as Swaziland, or other countries, including Costa Rica.",
      "Xinis told Drew Ensign, a Justice Department lawyer, that the government presented a witness who \"knows nothing, and I mean next to nothing, about Costa Rica.\" She said she gave specific directions about the scope of the testimony she was seeking, and said the Justice Department had again ignored those instructions, \"getting to the three strikes, you're out.\"",
      "The administration has attempted to deport Abrego Garcia while his criminal case on charges of\u00a0human smuggling\u00a0plays out in Tennessee, but Xinis issued an order in August preventing immigration officials from removing him from the U.S. Xinis is weighing whether to release Abrego Garcia from immigration custody while a challenge to his detention moves forward.",
      "Schultz, an official from Enforcement and Removal Operations at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told the court that government officials have had discussions with numerous foreign nations about accepting Abrego Garcia upon his removal from the U.S.",
      "Schultz said the U.S. reached an agreement with Eswatini to accept people deported from the U.S. and has made assurances they will be safe from torture and persecution. But he said Eswatini hasn't agreed to receive Abrego Garcia, specifically, and the Trump administration did not reach out to the African nation about him until Wednesday evening, according to Schultz.",
      "Administration officials do not appear to have undertaken efforts yet to evaluate whether Abrego Garcia would be tortured, detained or face persecution if deported to Eswatini, Schultz said.",
      "The immigration official told the court the Trump administration has also been discussing removing Abrego Garcia to Ghana, but a notice of his potential deportation to the country had been sent to Abrego Garcia prematurely.",
      "Ghana's foreign affairs minister, however, said on social media earlier Friday that his country \"is not accepting Abrego Garcia.\"",
      "\"He cannot be deported to Ghana. This has been directly and unambiguously conveyed to US authorities,\" Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa, the foreign affairs minister, wrote on Facebook. \"In my interactions with US officials, I made clear that our understanding to accept a limited number of non-criminal West Africans, purely on the grounds of African solidarity and humanitarian principles would not be expanded.\"",
      "Schultz said he is \"confident\" that once the Trump administration receives approval from a third country to accept Abrego Garcia, he could be deported within 72 hours.",
      "Ahead of the hearing, Xinis said she wanted\u00a0the witness to have answers on what steps the government has taken to deport Abrego Garcia to Eswatini or any other country, including Costa Rica, which he designated as his preferred country of removal. The judge also said the administration official should be prepared to testify about what additional steps the government could take \"in the reasonably foreseeable future\" to deport Abrego Garcia.",
      "Schultz revealed that he believes Eswatini entered into discussions about whether Abrego Garcia could be removed to the country after the government in Uganda declined to accept him. Abrego Garcia's lawyers received a notice from the Department of Homeland Security in late August informing them that he\u00a0might be deported to Uganda. Documents obtained by CBS News in August indicated that the Trump administration and Uganda reached a deal for the East African nation to accept deportees.",
      "Abrego Garcia's attorneys have moved to free their client from federal immigration detention as his immigration case plays out, citing a 2001 Supreme Court decision\u00a0that found federal law does not permit \"indefinite detention\" for those the government seeks to deport. Detention should be limited to a \"period reasonably necessary\" to bring about their removal from the U.S, the high court ruled.",
      "After being released from criminal custody on unrelated charges, Abrego Garcia was taken into immigration custody in late August, and his lawyers argue that his continued confinement is illegal. They wrote in a challenge to the legality of his detention that because the Trump administration has been relying on a \"purported\" final order of removal for Abrego Garcia from 2019, the \"presumptively reasonable period\" of detention would've expired in 2020.",
      "Andrew Rossman, a lawyer for Abrego Garcia, argued that his client has been in \"continuous confinement\" since March, when he was first arrested by immigration authorities and then deported to El Salvador, where he remained detained \u2014 with the exception of a brief weekend in August.",
      "The \"U.S. government held the keys\" to Abrego Garcia's confinement at a Salvadoran prison, he said.",
      "Rossman said the administration is \"0 for 3\" in finding a country that will accept Abrego Garcia for removal to. Abrego Garcia's lawyers also said they confirmed with him that if the U.S. moved to deport him to Costa Rica, he would go.",
      "The Costa Rican government said in an August letter to the top U.S. diplomat in the country that it intends to provide refugee status or residency to Abrego Garcia, and would accept him \"upon the conclusion of any criminal sentence he may serve in the United States of America.\"",
      "Rossman told the court that he doesn't believe the Trump administration is \"intending to remove [Abrego Garcia] in a lawful way.\"",
      "\"They have spun the globe and picked various places,\" he said, to effectively \"fail on purpose\" by selecting countries that would be \"completely unpalatable\" to Abrego Garcia and lead him to express reasonable fear of persecution or torture that then have to be adjudicated \u2014 during which he would remain detained.",
      "\"That shows the real aim of the government, the improper aim, is a punitive one, which is just to keep him incarcerated,\" Rossman said.",
      "Xinis questioned Ensign, the Justice Department lawyer, about whether the Trump administration has had any conversations with Abrego Garcia and his lawyers about potentially being removed to Costa Rica given his designation of the country as the place where he wanted to be removed.",
      "\"Why hasn't there been?\" she said of discussions.",
      "Abrego Garcia had been living in Maryland for more than a decade with his wife and children when he was first taken into immigration custody in March and deported to El Salvador. But an immigration judge in 2019 had granted Abrego Garcia a withholding of removal, a legal status that prohibited the Department of Homeland Security from removing him to his home country because of likely persecution by local gangs.",
      "Xinis ordered the Trump administration in April to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return to the U.S., though the Department of Homeland Security resisted doing so for weeks. But in early June, Abrego Garcia was brought back to the U.S. after a federal grand jury indicted him on two counts of human smuggling.",
      "He pleaded not guilty to both counts, and in July, a federal judge overseeing his criminal case ordered him to be released on bond while awaiting trial. But Abrego Garcia remained detained for several more weeks because of concerns that he would be swiftly taken into immigration custody following his release and deported.",
      "He had been held at a detention center in Virginia but was transferred to a facility in Pennsylvania last month.",
      "Earlier this month, an immigration judge in Maryland\u00a0rejected a request from Abrego Garcia's legal team to reopen his immigration case and allow him to seek asylum in the United States. While the bid was denied, Abrego Garcia can appeal the decision to the Board of Immigration Appeals.",
      "Last week, a federal judge in Tennessee said he believes the Justice Department's criminal case against Kilmar Abrego Garcia may have been \"vindictive,\" writing on Friday that \"The government had a significant stake in retaliating against Abrego's success.\" The judge has not made a final ruling on those claims, and will allow for discovery and a hearing on Abrego Garcia's claims.",
      "There are 62,000 people in immigration custody, Schultz, the immigration official said."

      "\"I trust that everyone who is going to work is doing their very best to keep us safe, but this is just not a functional way to govern,\" she told CBS News. \"We deserve better than this. We deserve that our essential systems, our transportation systems, stay open and that the folks who are responsible for keeping those safe are paid on time and that that doesn't become a football.\"",
      "Amid efforts in Congress to reform the nation's aviation system, Feres and other victims' family members have been meeting with lawmakers and Jennifer Homendy, chair of the National Transportation Safety Board. Feres' cousin Peter Livingston, his wife Donna and daughters Alydia and Everly died when an Army Black Hawk helicopter collided with an American Eagle flight over the Potomac River in January.",

    "summary": "Hillary Clinton and Condoleezza Rice joined CBS News' Norah O'Donnell for a discussion of the Israel-Hamas deal as the ceasefire begins in Gaza.",
    "story": [
      "Hillary Clinton and Condoleezza Rice on Friday praised the Trump administration's success in reaching a Middle East peace deal. Both of the former secretaries of state are still cautiously watching to see how the early phases play out but expressed some optimism about its prospects.",
      "Clinton and Rice joined CBS News 24/7 for a live interview with CBS News senior correspondent Norah O'Donnell to discuss the Israel-Hamas peace plan brokered by President Trump as the first stage of the deal takes shape.",
      "The conversation took place two days after the signing of a landmark deal in which Hamas agreed to release all remaining hostages taken on Oct. 7, 2023, and Israel pledged to withdraw its military from parts of the Gaza Strip. Mr. Trump has called the deal the \"first phase\" of a comprehensive 20-point plan to end the two-year-long Israel-Hamas war. The president plans to travel to the Middle East as soon as this weekend, and said he hopes to be present for the return of the hostages.",
      "\"I really commend President Trump and his administration, as well as Arab leaders in the region for making the commitment to the 20-point plan and seeing a path forward for what's often called the day after,\" Clinton told O'Donnell.",
      "O'Donnell asked Rice if she is confident this is the end of the war.",
      "\"No one can be completely confident, given the history of the Middle East,\" Rice replied, but she added that there are good reasons to be optimistic.",
      "Rice and Clinton both said the Israelis and Palestinians must get through this first phase of the deal \u2014 and that still isn't certain.",
      "\"That's not self-evident,\" Clinton said. It's going to take a lot of work. It's going to take a lot of coordination.\"",
      "One of the difficulties in achieving a lasting peace in the Middle East is getting various parties on board, but the fact that there's a broader coalition of Middle Eastern states involved in this agreement is a good sign, Rice said.",
      "\"The one piece that I'm most concerned about is, how do you get from a kind of transitional authority of some kind, a truly representative Palestinian authority?\" Rice asked. \"The Palestinian authority, which controls the West Bank, lost control of Gaza after 2006, has not really been reformed in a long time. And it needs reform. It needs younger blood.\"",
      "Clinton called Israel's attack on Hamas leaders in Qatar's capital of Doha in September \"ill-advised\" and a \"strategic error\" that gave Mr. Trump's negotiators an opening.",
      "\"That provided an opening for both President Trump and his representatives to marshal all of the regional powers, including, of course, Qatar, but also to make it clear to Israel, 'No, this is now enough. We cannot continue this. This conflict needs to end, and we've got to move on.'\"",
      "Clinton said of U.S. negotiators, \"They took advantage of an opening that was available and were able to be successful.\"",
      "Rice suggested a two-state solution isn't likely to be feasible right now, but she said there are things the Palestinians can do to prepare for a future state. Palestinians are going to need to insist on reforms themselves, she said.",
      "\"They've got to start to recognize that Israel is going to exist, and it's going to be a part of this Middle East,\" Rice said. \"And that means, change the lessons that you teach your kids about the state of Israel. Stop putting up maps that (say) the state of Israel doesn't exist. Don't create another generation of Palestinians who believe that somehow the resistance is the way to peace and security.\"",
      "Clinton said the Israeli settlement activity in the West Bank that has been encouraged by the Israeli government \"has to cease.\"",
      "She said the work of rebuilding Gaza will be arduous, laborious and intensive, and she called on the U.S. and international community to commit together to bring peace to the Middle East.",
      "\"Let's now support this process and bring it together, not just in a nonpartisan way in our own country, but literally internationally as a great global commitment to try to bring peace, security, stability and a better future to the Middle East,\" Clinton said.",
      "The deal is expected to allow dozens of hostages to return to their families on Monday or Tuesday, ending a two-year ordeal that began with Hamas' attack on southern Israel. It would also offer a reprieve to millions of residents of the Gaza Strip who have faced an intense and nearly uninterrupted two-year bombardment and ground invasion by Israel's military.",
      "Some questions remain, however. Mr. Trump's 20-point peace plan calls for Israel to withdraw from much of the Gaza Strip in phases, but the exact cadence of those withdrawals isn't clear. It also calls for control of Gaza to be handed over to a still-unformed \"technocratic\" committee that does not include Hamas and \u2014 at least for now \u2014 also leaves out the Palestinian Authority. The deal recognizes an independent Palestinian state as \"the aspiration of the Palestinian people,\" but it's unclear if or when discussions on statehood could take place.",
      "The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has vexed every U.S. administration in recent history \u2014 including the two that Friday's guests worked in. Clinton pressed for a two-state solution\u00a0 \u2014 but Obama struggled with a chilly relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a period that also saw two smaller wars in Gaza. Rice also championed a two-state solution and made extensive efforts in the last years of the Bush administration to help negotiate peace.",
      "But in part because then-Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and then-Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas were each short on the political support necessary to make a lasting deal, the conflict continued. One common critique of past administrations is that they have not made sufficient use of U.S. leverage over Israel, to pressure it to make concessions. Pressure on the Netanyahu government from President Trump appears to have been a critical factor in bringing about this peace deal now."

My representative has been working directly with President Putin's team to ensure the safe reunification of children with their families between Russia and Ukraine.\"",

    "story": [
      "Senators have launched an inquiry into companies paid billions in taxpayer dollars to build eligibility systems for Medicaid, expressing concern that error-riddled technology and looming work requirements \"will cause Americans to lose Medicaid coverage to this bureaucratic maze.\"",
      "The letters, dated Oct. 10, were sent to four companies and follow a KFF Health News investigation that exposed widespread issues in states using Deloitte-run systems to assess Medicaid eligibility for millions of people. Failures have resulted in the erroneous loss of health coverage and other vital safety-net benefits for low-income people. Malfunctions in those systems can cost millions and take years to fix.",
      "As most states prepare to institute work requirements mandated by the tax and domestic spending law President Trump signed in July, senators wrote it is each company's responsibility to build functioning systems, \"rather than to prioritize their bottom line.\"",
      "Democratic Sens. Ron Wyden of Oregon, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, and Raphael Warnock of Georgia, as well as Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), sent the letters to several companies the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services identified as eligibility system contractors: Deloitte, GDIT, Gainwell Technologies, and Conduent.",
      "\"They're essentially health care middlemen that are in the business of red tape, and they profit when Americans don't get health care,\" Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, which oversees Medicaid, said in an interview.",
      "\"They've got a history of poor performance when it comes to determining eligibility or in helping Americans enroll in Medicaid,\" Wyden said. \"Without stronger oversight and real accountability, these contractors are just going to get a jumbo windfall for creating systems that actually harm Americans trying to get health care.\"",
      "Spokespeople for the four companies did not provide comments for this article.",
      "As of June, 70.5 million people were enrolled in Medicaid, according to CMS.",
      "A handful of states operate their own Medicaid eligibility and enrollment systems, but most rely on contractors to build and run them. KFF Health News found that Deloitte, a global consultancy that generated $70.5 billion in revenue in fiscal year 2025, dominates this slice of government business. Twenty-five states have awarded Deloitte contracts for eligibility systems. The agreements, in which the company commits to design, develop, implement, or operate state-owned systems, are worth at least $6 billion, dwarfing any of its competitors.",
      "Kinda Serafi, a partner at Manatt Health, is advising states on how to reconfigure their systems to incorporate work requirements.",
      "States are in a \"major sprint\" to make changes by 2027, she said, and they're being \"inundated\" with pitches from vendors looking to secure contracts. It underscores the business opportunity these system changes represent for contractors.",
      "\"I think we have to really be vigilant to make sure that these vendors are implementing the requirements consistent with the law,\" Serafi said.",
      "Companies sign contracts with state governments, but the federal government pays the bulk of the cost. The federal government covers 90% of states' costs to develop and implement state Medicaid eligibility systems and 75% of ongoing maintenance and operations expenses, according to federal regulations.",
      "The Senate letters cite problems with Deloitte-run eligibility systems that KFF Health News identified. Among other issues, the Florida eligibility system erroneously cut benefits for new moms, and a problem in Kentucky prevented coverage applications from getting through online, which cost $522,455 and took 10 months to resolve.",
      "\"Unfortunately, these are just a few examples of third-party systems' failure to serve their very function: to reliably and accurately determine an individual's eligibility for Medicaid coverage and services,\" the senators wrote.",
      "The senators asked the companies to respond by Oct. 31 to their questions, such as whether companies' contracts with states include financial incentives tying payment to the removal of Medicaid enrollees and whether the companies are penalized for coverage terminations made in error. The senators also demanded an accounting of the company's lobbying expenditures for the past five years and protocols for making system changes.",
      "By 2027, the Congressional Budget Office projected, based on an early version of the bill, 18.5 million Medicaid beneficiaries will have to work or complete other qualifying activities for 80 hours a month to keep their benefits, unless they qualify for an exemption. The CBO estimates that 5.3 million enrollees will lose coverage by 2034.",
      "The new work requirements are just one of several federally mandated Medicaid changes that are forcing states to adapt their eligibility systems.",
      "Medicaid work requirements have been plagued with problems in the few states where they've been tested. Medicaid enrollees have been frustrated in trying to navigate byzantine rules and glitchy technology. Work requirements have also come at great cost.",
      "Georgia has not adopted the ACA Medicaid expansion, which has granted benefits to millions of adults earning up to 138% of the federal poverty level. Instead, the state offers benefits to some people earning up to the poverty line who can prove they're working or participating in similar activities for 80 hours a month. Nearly 110,000 Georgians had applied to the state's Georgia Pathways to Coverage program through May, but only 9,157 people were enrolled as of mid-August. Under typical ACA expansion rules, 336,000 adults would be eligible for coverage, according to KFF.",
      "The Georgia program has cost $109 million, with $34 million spent on health benefits and more than $20 million allocated to marketing contracts, according to a KFF Health News analysis of state reports. Deloitte built Georgia's eligibility system and is the primary consultant for the Pathways program.",
      "Before Medicaid work requirements became federal law, Arizona also submitted a request to federal regulators to launch its own version that would apply to roughly 190,000 people.",
      "The state's application provided insight into the types of system changes states may soon need to make to manage the new federal work requirement.",
      "Arizona Medicaid officials said they would gather information on enrollees' work hours, training, and education. The state's eligibility system, which is operated by Accenture, would also need to check whether someone is exempt.",

      "Tessa Outhyse, a spokesperson for the California Department of Health Care Services, said the state expects upgrades to be processed \"through the existing contractual change order process.\" State contracts with eligibility companies often set aside millions to cover the cost of changes, but systems may require upgrades beyond the agreed-upon work.",

      "The state has a contract with private company RedMane to handle some of its Medicaid eligibility processing. Missouri plans to hire an additional contractor to ensure it properly institutes Medicaid work requirements, according to Baylee Watts, a spokesperson for Missouri's Department of Social Services.",

That means airport screeners, air traffic controllers, federal air marshals, safety inspectors and other workers with the two agencies are expected to continue showing up on the job \u2014 without pay \u2014 even as lawmakers failed this week to strike a deal on federal funding.",
      "But things could get messy if a shutdown dragged on and government employees suddenly deprived of a paycheck come under financial pressure, Caleb Harmon-Marshall, a former TSA officer, told CBS News.",
      "\"TSA officers are expected to continue to report to work. But in the past, if a shutdown exceeds two weeks, officers start to get frantic, and they stop going to work,\" he said, adding that agency personnel may call in sick and even seek other job opportunities if a shutdown persists.",
      "Any ensuing labor shortages can lead to snarled lines at airport security. For example, roughly 10% of TSA workers called in sick during the 34-day government shutdown that started in December 2018 and extended into 2019, driving up screening times at major airports across the country.",
      "\"So if officers decide not to come to work, there is less personnel manning checkpoints, and wait times can potentially get longer,\" Harmon-Marshall said.",
      "A shutdown began at 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday, Oct. 1, after the Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded.

      "By contrast, train travel is unlikely to be disrupted if the government closes this week, according to the Rail Passengers Association, which represents the nation's rail travelers.

      "The SSA announces the annual COLA each October when the Labor Department releases its Consumer Price Index data that month, which this year is scheduled for Oct. 15. But there could be a hitch this year if federal agencies shut down, according to the Labor Department.",
      "\"A delay of the CPI release during October of each year might have an impact on the Cost of Living Adjustment announcement by the Social Security Administration,\" the Labor Department said in issuing a\u00a0contingency plan that covers the impact of a possible shutdown on its operations.",
      "When is the next Social Security payment?",
      "Social Security payments would continue to go out as usual during a shutdown, with recipients of Supplemental Security Income \u2014 a program for low-income and disabled people \u2014 scheduled to receive their next checks on Oct. 1.",
      "Social Security recipients will receive their checks on their usual schedule, which is based on their birth date. Those born between the 1st to 10th of their birth month will receive payment on Oct. 8, while those born between the 11th to 20th days will receive their payment on Oct. 15. People born between the 21st and the last day of their birth month will get their check on Oct. 22.",
      "\"If you're a Social Security recipient, you're going to get your check, and that's obviously a good thing,\" Wayne Winegarden, a senior fellow in business and economics at the Pacific Research Institute, a think tank focused on free trade, told CBS News."

    "published": "Fri, 10 Oct 2025 10:34:16 -0400",
    "summary": "The shutdown raises questions about what it would mean for lawmakers themselves \u2014 and their paychecks.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Hundreds of thousands of federal employees could soon go without pay or face potential layoffs, since a government shutdown went into effect on Wednesday, Oct. 1.",
      "The GOP-controlled House passed a bill earlier this month to extend government funding until Nov. 21, but the bill stalled in the Senate, where Democratic votes were needed to advance it. Democrats wanted an extension of health care subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, which Republicans opposed. With hours left before the midnight deadline Wednesday, the Senate voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded.",
      "Under the shutdown, federal employees in critical positions are required to stay on the job. Many others will be forced to stay home. Both groups will have their paychecks delayed until Congress approves more spending. Most federal contractors might not get paid at all.",
      "Here's what the shutdown means for lawmakers themselves \u2014 and their paychecks.",
      "Will members of Congress get paid during a government shutdown?",
      "The short answer is yes. Lawmakers will continue to draw a paycheck.",
      "The reason is because of how their pay is treated under the Constitution and federal law. Article I, Section 6 of the Constitution states: \"The Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States.\" Lawmakers' pay has been funded by a permanent appropriation since 1983, according to a recent Congressional Research Service\u00a0report, meaning funding for their pay doesn't need to be renewed annually.",
      "Members' pay rate is set by a process established by federal law, and the 27th Amendment says any law to change their pay can't take effect until after the next congressional election.",
      "Most members earn a salary of $174,000 per year, a rate that has not changed since 2009. The speaker of the House earns $223,500, while the president pro tempore of the Senate and the party leaders in both chambers make $193,400.",
      "When it comes to other federal entities, the law that governs how they must act during a lapse in funding is known as the Antideficiency Act. In short, it says that federal agencies generally can't spend more money than Congress has approved. This means many agencies must furlough employees \u2014 that is, tell them to stay home \u2014 if they haven't received funding.",
      "There are some exceptions. Some programs, like Social Security and Medicare, have permanent funding, and benefits continue to be paid out as normal. Employees whose jobs are necessary to protect life and property must also stay on the job. Those whose roles are authorized by other laws can keep working, as can officials with constitutional responsibilities.",
      "When it comes to congressional staffers, each office determines which employees are deemed essential and thus allowed to keep working during a shutdown. Most are expected to keep all or nearly all of their employees on board, though the staffers won't be paid until more funding is approved.",
      "Does the president get paid during a shutdown?",
      "Yes. The Constitution prohibits reducing the president's salary while in office, \"thus effectively guaranteeing the president of compensation regardless of any shutdown action,\" according to a Congressional Research Service report from 2018.",
      "The president earns $400,000 annually, an amount set by Congress in 2001.",
      "His aides and staffers, however, are subject to the furlough requirements under the Antideficiency Act, meaning those in nonessential positions could be told to stay home until Congress authorizes more funding. In past shutdowns, presidents have furloughed many executive branch employees to increase pressure on Congress to take action.",
      "Do other federal employees get paid during a shutdown?",
      "Federal employees, whether they remain on the job or are furloughed, won't get paid while the government is shut down.",
      "They also face the risk of being permanently laid off if there's a shutdown, according to a memo from the Office of Budget and Management. The reduction-in-force notices would be in addition to any furlough notices, according to a memo sent to the agencies.",
      "\"Programs that did not benefit from an infusion of mandatory appropriations will bear the brunt of a shutdown, and we must continue our planning efforts in the event Democrats decide to shut down the government,\" the memo said.",
      "Those who still have jobs will receive back pay once funding is restored to their agency. In prior shutdowns, Congress had to approve back pay for employees, but a 2019 law made it mandatory. Contractors \u2014 who were responsible for carrying out about $755 billion worth of government work in the last fiscal year \u2014 are not guaranteed back pay.",
      "Each agency determines which positions are considered essential and which are not. The Office of Management and Budget has directed agencies to notify employees no later than two business days before a lapse in funding about their work and pay status.",
      "Some members of Congress have previously pointed out the apparent hypocrisy of lawmakers continuing to be paid while other federal employees miss out on their checks. In 2023, members of both parties offered different proposals that would prevent Congress from getting paid during shutdowns, but none attracted widespread support, and the 27th Amendment forbids any immediate change."

      "Mr. Trump had said Sunday that a shutdown was likely, rejecting Democrats' push for Congress to permanently extend enhanced tax credits for Americans enrolled in health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, which expire at the end of the year. The president met with Senate Majority Leader John Thune, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Speaker Mike Johnson and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries at the White House on Monday, but the meeting ended without a breakthrough.",
      "The president canceled an earlier meeting with Republican and Democratic congressional leaders set for last week, calling their demands \"unserious and ridiculous,\" and House Republicans left Washington, D.C., earlier this month after approving a stopgap measure that kept the government funded until Nov. 21. But the proposal failed to garner the necessary support in the Senate. A Democrat-backed counter-plan to extend funding through Oct. 31, which included other party priorities, also failed in the upper chamber.",
      "In an effort to ramp up the pressure on Democrats to go along with Republicans' funding measure, the White House budget office sent a memo to federal agencies last week telling them to consider reduction-in-force plans for mass layoffs of certain federal workers during a shutdown.",
      "A government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to approve funding for federal agencies. Before 1980, agencies largely continued operating during a lapse in funding with the assumption that Congress would act quickly. But in 1980 and 1981, then-Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti authored a series of legal opinions that found government agencies didn't have the authority to continue running during a gap in funding.",
      "President Ronald Reagan oversaw eight shutdowns during his time in office, the longest of which lasted three days. There were three funding gaps between 1990 and 1995, then none until 2013.",
      "The threat of a government shutdown has become more frequent over the past decade, as Congress has found itself engaged in funding fights that are ultimately resolved with massive, yearlong spending packages. The most recent lapse in government funding, in late 2018, caused $3 billion in permanent losses, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Hundreds of thousands of federal workers are expected to feel the impacts of a shutdown if a deal isn't reached this time around.",

The bill differed from a version passed in the House and funding technically lapsed at midnight, but since Nov. 21 fell on a Saturday, the effects weren't felt immediately. House and Senate negotiators worked over the weekend to reconcile their differences and passed identical bills on Sunday.",
      "On Monday, Reagan vetoed the plan and ordered the government to shut down, placing 250,000 federal employees on furlough. Later in the day, lawmakers passed a stopgap bill to keep the government funded and allow more time for talks on a deal. Workers returned the next day.",

      "As the shutdown stretched to become the longest in history and Democrats took control of the House, the former president ended up signing a bill to reopen agencies for three weeks and did not include money for the border wall. Weeks later, Congress averted another shutdown by passing a measure that included $1.375 billion for the border wall, far less than the $5.7 billion Trump requested."

      "Here is what three federal workers \u2014 who shared their personal views with CBS News and were not speaking on behalf of their respective agencies \u2014 describe as their biggest concerns as the shutdown continues.",
      "\"No pay has me anxious\"",
      "James Kirwan, an attorney with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and the legislative affairs director for the agency's union, is currently furloughed and does not expect to be paid until lawmakers resolve the dispute and pass a government funding bill.",
      "\"No pay has me anxious because none of us have any idea how long the shutdown is going to go on for. It could be weeks, or it could be a short shutdown,\" Kirwan, who has been with the NLRB for three years, told CBS News. \"The longer it gets, the more debt people will have to incur to survive during the interim period.\"",
      "\"It's certainly scary, especially for federal workers making under $50,000 a year, and for federal contractors who have no guarantee of backpay whatsoever under the law,\" he added.",
      "Kirwan, 31, said that if the shutdown drags on for weeks or months, he would likely have to lean on credit cards to afford the basics, and perhaps take out a loan for any larger expenses.",
      "\"Like many Americans, I have very little in the way of emergency funds and savings, and I know I would not be able to hold on if it's a very long shutdown,\" he told CBS News.",

      "\"Everything is stopped, so workers who were illegally fired don't have any recourse because there is nowhere else to go beside the NLRB,\" Snyder, whose work involves investigating such complaints, told CBS News. \"So it's really frustrating that I am not able to do my job, and people aren't able to get justice.\"",

      "The NLRB did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In a\u00a0notice\u00a0posted on the agency's website on Sept. 30, before the shutdown began, the NLRB stated that unfair labor practice hearings scheduled for Oct. 1 or later would be postponed indefinitely.",
      "\"There is a moral injury\"",

      "Washington \u2014 Much of the federal government shut down Wednesday, after Congress failed to reach a deal to approve new funding.",
      "Republicans had proposed extending government funding at current levels until Nov. 21 to allow for members to continue working on full-year appropriations bills. Democrats made a counteroffer to keep the government open through October, but attached health care provisions and restrictions on President Trump's ability to withhold funding, both of which are nonstarters with most Republicans.",
      "The two sides were dug in on their positions, increasing the chances of a shutdown beginning Wednesday. Congressional leaders met with President Trump at the White House on Monday to search for a path forward, but walked away in the same position.",
      "A government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to pass funding for some or all agencies, which can't spend money that hasn't been approved by lawmakers. There have been 14 shutdowns since 1980, with the most recent coming in 2018. That shutdown lasted 34 days.",
      "Here's what to know about what happens during the government shutdown:",
      "What is a government shutdown?",
      "Most federal government agencies are funded annually by a dozen appropriations bills that need to be passed by Congress and signed by the president before the start of the new fiscal year on Oct. 1. These are often grouped together into one large piece of legislation known as an \"omnibus\" bill to speed up the process when Congress inevitably needs to pass a number of them at the last minute.",
      "If the funding deadline passes without Congress authorizing more spending, the government must fully or partially shut down, depending on which agencies are already funded. Ahead of this year's deadline, none of the 12 appropriations bills have been enacted. Some agencies got an infusion of money in the Republican-passed \"one big, beautiful bill\" earlier this year, meaning certain programs and functions in some departments will remain funded in the event of a shutdown, chiefly the Defense Department and Department of Homeland Security.",
      "Lawmakers regularly buy themselves more time to finish spending bills by passing what's known as a continuing resolution, which temporarily extends current funding levels to keep agencies functioning while they work to reach an agreement on new spending.",
      "The Constitution says the Treasury Department cannot spend money without a law authorizing it. Under a statute known as the Antideficiency Act, agencies are required to cease operations \u2014 with certain exceptions \u2014 in the absence of funding authorized by Congress. The act, a version of which first passed in 1870, with several significant updates since, also prohibits the government from entering into financial obligations without congressional sign-off.",
      "\"Treasury cannot pay out any money if there's not a law providing for who gets the money,\" said Matt Glassman, a senior fellow at the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown University. \"If those annual bills expire, then there is no law appropriating money for certain functions.\"",
      "What happens during a government shutdown, and who is affected?",
      "In a shutdown, the federal government must stop all non-essential functions until funding is approved by Congress and signed into law, except for programs that are funded by other means, like fees or other legislation. Each agency determines what work is essential and what is not. Members of Congress make that determination for their own staff, as well.",
      "\"No money can come out of Treasury whether you're essential or not essential. But who can keep working and incur obligations, even when there are no appropriations \u2014 there are three exceptions,\" Glassman said.",
      "Those exceptions are defined by the Antideficiency Act. They allow the government to fund operations to protect life and property, and keep officials involved in the constitutional process on the job, like the president, his staff and members of Congress.",
      "All active-duty military members, many federal law enforcement officers and employees at federally funded hospitals are considered essential, along with air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration officers. Each agency determines which of its employees can stay on the job.",
      "In a step that differs from previous shutdowns, the Office of Budget and Management last week told federal agencies to consider permanent mass layoffs for programs or projects that have discretionary funding that runs out on Oct. 1 or that don't have any alternative sources of funding. The reduction-in-force notices would be in addition to any furlough notices issued during a shutdown, according to a memo sent to the agencies.",
      "\"Programs that did not benefit from an infusion of mandatory appropriations will bear the brunt of a shutdown, and we must continue our planning efforts in the event Democrats decide to shut down the government,\" the memo said.",
      "Whether employees are essential or not, if their pay is dependent on annual appropriations, they won't get paid during a shutdown.",
      "Essential employees continue to work during the shutdown, but don't get paid until funding is restored to their agency. Employees in nonessential positions are typically furloughed until the government is funded again, although that could look different this time if there are widespread layoffs. Under a 2019 law, furloughed employees are guaranteed to receive back pay once the shutdown is over.",
      "A Senate report published in 2019 found that government shutdowns in 2013, 2018 and 2019 cost taxpayers nearly $4 billion, including at least $3.7 billion in back pay to furloughed workers who were not permitted to work.",
      "What is open and closed during a shutdown?",
      "Entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid continue to function during a shutdown because benefit payments are funded through permanent appropriations that don't require renewal. Entitlement payments keep going out, but the working budgets of the agencies that oversee the programs require approval by Congress. That means staff could be furloughed, causing delays in enrolling new beneficiaries or other service interruptions.",
      "\"Any type of interaction you're having at a customer service level with the federal government could definitely be affected,\" Glassman said.",
      "For example, travel plans could be disrupted if air traffic control and airport security, who are essential workers, do not show up to work in protest for not being paid immediately. Many national parks stayed open during the last shutdown in 2018 and 2019, but understaffing led to vandalism and cuts in visitor services. The parks largely closed during the 2013 shutdown. The U.S. Postal Service continues to operate, since it is self-funded.",
      "Maya MacGuineas, the president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said the public may not notice the effects if the shutdown is short-lived.",
      "\"The truth is, most people won't really feel much of a difference,\" MacGuineas said. \"If you've got a vacation planned to a National Park, you're going to be [upset] and disappointed. But most people will go on with their everyday lives and interact with the government the same way they do and not feel a big difference. That could get worse, the longer it lasts.\"",
      "The Senate report found the 2018-2019 shutdown had widespread impacts across a variety of government functions that ceased or were curtailed during the lapse in funding. It noted that furloughs in many agencies like the SEC, Federal Trade Commission and Consumer Product Safety Commission hampered enforcement and investigations. The report said the Justice Department canceled 60,000 immigration hearings.",
      "The effects could be even more pronounced this time around, given the possibility that the administration could use the shutdown to implement mass layoffs, furthering the president's aim of permanently reducing the federal workforce.",
      "When was the last government shutdown?",
      "The last government shutdown stretched from December 2018 until January 2019, when congressional funding for nine executive branch departments with roughly 800,000 employees lapsed.",
      "The five-week partial shutdown cost the economy $11 billion, according to a Congressional Budget Office report. The CBO said most of that would be recovered once the shutdown ended, but estimated a permanent loss of about $3 billion.",
      "Businesses across the country that relied on government customers reported a slowdown in business and some said they had to lay off employees. Tens of thousands of immigration court hearings were canceled. Government contractors struggled to feed their families and pay their bills.",
      "The shutdown stemmed from a standoff over Mr. Trump's demand for $5.7 billion to fund a wall along the border with Mexico. Mr. Trump had vowed to close the government if the funding wasn't included in spending legislation, but Democrats refused to give in.",
      "Mr. Trump conceded after insisting for weeks that he would not reopen the government without money for the wall, signing a bill to reopen the government for three weeks while Congress negotiated a spending deal.",
      "Three weeks later, Mr. Trump signed a compromise spending bill to avert another government shutdown, ultimately accepting a bill that did not meet his $5.7 billion demand for his long-promised border wall.",
      "When was the longest government shutdown?",
      "Before the early 1980s, the government would typically continue operating as usual even when funding bills hadn't been passed, but that changed after the attorney general issued opinions stating that it was illegal for the government to spend money without congressional approval.",
      "Since 1980, there have been 14 shutdowns, most of which lasted just a few days.",
      "The longest shutdown in U.S. history was the 2018-2019 lapse, which lasted 34 full days. Before that, the record was 21 days in 1995 and 1996, when President Bill Clinton held out against steep spending and tax cuts favored by Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich."

    "summary": "A federal judge on Thursday granted a partial restraining order to block the Trump administration's deployment of National Guard troops in Illinois, after state and local leaders objected to the deployment.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge on Thursday granted a restraining order temporarily blocking the Trump administration's deployment of National Guard troops in Illinois, after state and local leaders objected to the deployment.",
      "In a ruling from the bench, U.S. District Judge April Perry said no National Guard units may be deployed in Illinois for the next 14 days. A full written ruling will be published on Friday, and Perry said she expects her order will be appealed.",
      "The restraining order expires at 11:59 p.m. on Oct. 23, but Perry has scheduled a telephone hearing for 9 a.m. on Oct. 22 to determine if it should be extended for another 14 days.",
      "Perry's ruling means National Guard units already sent to the Chicago area cannot operate on the mission they were sent for \u2014 to protect federal agents and facilities in Illinois, including a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in Broadview, where 45 soldiers arrived overnight.",
      "While the restraining order remains in effect for 14 days, the Trump administration had moved to deploy troops in Illinois for at least 60 days, so it's very possible both sides will be back in court before the restraining order expires.",
      "Perry said her decision came down to a \"credibility determination,\" and she found the Department of Homeland Security's assessment of recent events in the Chicago area to be \"unreliable.\"",
      "The judge ruled there is no credible evidence of an organized rebellion in Illinois, despite multiple protests and some assaults against federal agents, nor was there any evidence that the federal government has been unable to enforce the law without bringing in troops amid an ongoing\u00a0immigration crackdown in the Chicago area.",
      "The judge said there is \"no doubt there have been acts of vandalism and assaults\" during the ICE operation in Chicago, but she could not agree that local law enforcement have been unable to handle the situation, calling the Trump administration's claims otherwise \"unreliable.\"",
      "She also noted that federal grand juries have refused to indict a number of protesters who were arrested outside the Broadview ICE facility, casting \"significant doubt\" on Homeland Security's credibility and assessment of what's happening on the streets in the Chicago area.",
      "The judge also said there is overwhelming evidence that deploying troops would lead to civil unrest, and said the provocative nature of ICE agents' actions, and in some cases constitutional violations, has led to an increase in protest activity already.",
      "\"I find that allowing the National Guard to deploy will only add fuel to the fire that the defendants have started,\" she said.",
      "Because the National Guard is not trained in law enforcement functions or de-escalation tactics, the judge said allowing troops at the Broadview ICE facility or anywhere else would not be responsible, noting state and local police have indicated they are able to provide protection and keep the peace.",
      "The judge said adding militarized and untrained troops to the situation would not be in the community's best interest.",
      "In a statement Thursday night, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said: \"Amidst ongoing violent riots and lawlessness, that local leaders like [JB] Pritzker have refused to step in to quell, President Trump has exercised his lawful authority to protect federal officers and assets. President Trump will not turn a blind eye to the lawlessness plaguing American cities and we expect to be vindicated by a higher court.\"",
      "Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul said he believes the judge \"did a very careful job of weighing the evidence\" and \"made the correct decision to enter a temporary restraining order.\"",
      "\"This is an important decision not just for the state of Illinois, but for the entire country. The question of states' sovereignty was addressed in this decision. The question of whether or not the President of the United States should have unfettered authority to militarize our cities was answered today,\" he said.",
      "In a statement, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson called the judge's ruling \"a win for the people of Chicago and the rule of law.\"",
      "\"Judge Perry echoed many of the points that we have made repeatedly: Trump's deployment is illegal, unconstitutional, dangerous, and unnecessary. There is no rebellion in Chicago. There are just good people standing up for what is right,\" Johnson said. \"The judge established that the Trump administration is unreliable. They lie, misrepresent, and put people in danger. We will continue to use all of the tools at our disposal to end the Trump administration's war on Chicago.\"",
      "Gov. JB Pritzker also praised the judge's ruling in a post on X.",
      "\"Donald Trump is not a king \u2014 and his administration is not above the law.  Today, the court confirmed what we all know: there is no credible evidence of a rebellion in the state of Illinois.  And no place for the National Guard in the streets of American cities like Chicago,\" Pritzker wrote.",
      "Lawsuit filed by Chicago and Illinois called Trump's deployment of troops \"patently unlawful\"",
      "In a lawsuit suit, filed Monday, the state of Illinois and city of Chicago claimed that the Trump administration's \"deployment of federalized troops to Illinois is patently unlawful.\"",
      "\"Plaintiffs ask this court to halt the illegal, dangerous, and unconstitutional federalization of members of the National Guard of the United States, including both the Illinois and\u00a0Texas National Guard,\" the lawsuit states.",
      "The federal government filed its response with moments to spare\u00a0before a midnight deadline Wednesday night, in a 59-page filing that argued President Trump has the legal authority to deploy the troops and that state objections should not block the operation.",
      "Attorneys for the federal government also argued the courts should be \"highly deferential\" when reviewing a president's judgment, saying it's within the scope of the authority the executive branch is given by the Constitution and statutes.",
      "Perry began hearing arguments in the case at the Dirksen Federal Courthouse in Chicago at 11 a.m., and noted at the start of proceedings that the hearing has taken on new urgency because in the time between the lawsuit being filed Monday and today's hearing, the government has already deployed 500 National Guard troops to Illinois and Chicago.",
      "The judge initially declined to grant an emergency temporary restraining order in the hours after the lawsuit was filed but warned the federal government they should \"take a pause\" on deployment amid the legal proceedings.",
      "READ MORE: U.S. District Court chief judge says National Guard not needed at Dirksen Federal Building",
      "Lawyers for the state of Illinois and the federal government gave opening statements before being questioned for hours by Judge Perry. Many of her questions focused on what exactly the National Guard would be authorized to do in their capacity of \"protecting\" federal property and federal agents.",
      "Judge Perry admitted the open-ended nature of the president's order is cause for concern.",
      "The federal government's attorneys argued repeatedly that the president's judgment in deciding to federalize the National Guard in Illinois is not reviewable by the courts, and declined to articulate clear parameters on the guard's orders because the situation is fluid. They said orders issued would be tailored to the needs of the moment.",
      "Would they be limited to protecting ICE? The attorney for the government said probably. When Judge Perry asked if the guard might go into neighborhoods, hospitals and schools, the attorney said there is a vetting process but didn't describe it.",
      "Could they help any federal agency? The government's attorney answered, \"I actually don't know the answer to that.\"",
      "And the big question: Will they be fighting crime in Chicago? \"Certainly to an extent,\" the Trump administration's attorney said. \"The mission, again, is a federal protection one.\"",
      "The attorneys repeatedly cited violence and \"riots\" in Illinois, particularly at the Broadview ICE facility, but the judge questioned whether the government was presenting an accurate representation of the violence on the ground, at one point pointing out the gulf between statements made on social media and reporting in Illinois.",
      "We do know 45 members of the Texas National Guard were at the Broadview ICE facility ahead of Thursday's hearing. In the state's opening argument, they mentioned internal communications from the person in charge at Broadview said \"the situation was under control.\"",
      "Perry also asked the government's lawyers about two temporary restraining orders issued against ICE in the past 48 hours for violations of the First and Fourth amendments \u2014 one in a lawsuit in Chicago filed against ICE by reporters and media members, the other filed by an immigration attorney to prevent ICE from searching his phone \u2014 which the government said they were not aware of.",
      "Perry questioned the government about its definition of the \"danger of rebellion,\" and what acts would comprise such a rebellion. At one point, when asking the government about threats made toward ICE and other federal agents, Perry noted, \"I agree with you about threats across the U.S. now. Mine started about 10 minutes after I got the case.\"",
      "Perry had fewer questions for the state, asking them about their definition of rebellion, the distinction between state and local law enforcement powers and military forces and their objections to using the military to protect federal property. Illinois attorneys argued the power to determine military conditions belongs to Congress, and they do not believe the president can summon troops to places where other law enforcement can be used effectively.",
      "Perry also asked about why they think a temporary restraining order is necessary. Attorneys for Illinois referenced statements made by Mr. Trump and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, particularly at the meeting of generals and other military leaders who were called to the Pentagon.",
      "In closing arguments, the state argued the president doesn't have the authority to send in troops to fight crime, and said the case is full of bad faith and abandonment of public virtues, and presents a \"risk of wanton tyranny.\"",
      "The federal government argued in return that there is coordinated and complex violence in Illinois, and the president has a right to respond. They argued that a temporary restraining order would interfere with the president's decision to protect personnel and property.",
      "Mr. Trump has claimed that Chicago is \"out of control\" as justification for sending in the National Guard, and his administration and the Department of Homeland Security have claimed that federal agents and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities need protection from protesters.",
      "The president once again spoke about Chicago on Thursday, thanking Texas Gov. Greg Abbott for his troops and \"doing what has to be done.\" Chicago Mayor Johnson reacted to his latest comments outside court, saying, \"We said that this deployment had nothing to do with public safety. We said that this has nothing to do with immigration. This is purely political.\""

    "story": [
      "A grand jury in Virginia indicted New York Attorney General Letitia James on Thursday, marking the second Trump foe to face federal prosecution in recent weeks.",
      "James was charged with one count of bank fraud and one count of making false statements to a financial institution. The indictment alleges that James bought a house in Norfolk, Virginia, in 2020 with a mortgage that required her to use it as a second home, but she ultimately rented it to a family and used it as an investment property. It accuses her of misrepresenting how the house was used to get a lower interest rate.",
      "The indictment says James purchased the home for $137,000 and borrowed $109,600 \u2014 and by getting more favorable lending terms and a larger seller credit, she allegedly saved herself $18,933 over the life of the loan.",
      "Lindsey Halligan, the acting U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, said in a statement: \"No one is above the law. The charges as alleged in this case represent intentional, criminal acts and tremendous breaches of the public's trust.\"",
      "James called the charges \"baseless\" in a video statement.",
      "\"This is nothing more than a continuation of the president's desperate weaponization of our justice system,\" she said.",
      "James's attorney, Abbe Lowell, said James \"flatly and forcefully denies these charges\" and said he is \"deeply concerned that this case is driven by President Trump's desire for revenge.\"",
      "James has drawn Mr. Trump's ire for years. Her office sued the president and the Trump Organization for fraud in 2022, leading a judge to issue a nine-figure judgment against the company. Mr. Trump has\u00a0referred to\u00a0James as \"scum,\" \"corrupt\" and \"racist.\"",
      "The indictment came exactly two weeks after a grand jury in the same Virginia courthouse voted to indict\u00a0another Trump adversary, former FBI Director James Comey, on charges of lying to Congress. James was indicted by a different grand jury than the one that indicted Comey, according to a source familiar with the matter.",
      "Last month, Mr. Trump publicly urged Attorney General Pam Bondi to look into Comey, James and a third longtime Trump antagonist, Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff of California.",
      "In May, CBS News reported that the Justice Department had launched a criminal probe into James around alleged mortgage fraud. Three months later, the Justice Department expanded its investigation into James for her office's handling of its Trump Organization probe.",
      "The mortgage fraud investigation began after William Pulte, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, wrote a letter to Bondi alleging that James \"has, in multiple instances, falsified bank documents and property records to acquire government backed assistance and loans and more favorable loan terms.\"",
      "Pulte claimed James received deals on mortgage terms by falsifying information related to several different properties over the course of decades \u2014 not including the 2020 purchase that led to Thursday's charges. Pulte's allegations include listing another home in Norfolk, Virginia, as her \"principal residence\" despite living and working in New York, buying a five-family property in Brooklyn with a loan that is only available for homes with four units or less, and an accusation that in 1983, James' father signed mortgage documents stating they were husband and wife.",
      "James denied the allegations at the time, calling them \"baseless.\"",
      "In April, Lowell \u2014 an attorney for James whose firm frequently represents clients that it believes have been unfairly targeted by the Trump administration \u2014 sent a letter to the Department of Justice refuting the allegations laid out in Pulte's letter.",
      "Lowell called the allegations \"long-disproven\" and referred to the investigation as \"the latest act of improper political retribution \u2014 this time directed at Ms. James \u2014 publicly instigated and endorsed by President Trump.\"",
      "DOJ charges another longtime Trump foe",
      "Mr. Trump has sparred with James since she was elected New York attorney general in 2018 and began pursuing cases against the president, his businesses and his administration.",
      "In the civil\u00a0lawsuit\u00a0against Mr. Trump and the Trump Organization, James' office accused the company of fraudulently inflating the value of its real estate assets to gain more favorable lending terms in what she called \"the art of the steal,\" a play on the name of Mr. Trump's book, \"The Art of the Deal.\" The president denied wrongdoing, and he and his attorneys lashed out at James, characterizing the case as politically motivated.",
      "After a trial that delved deeply into Mr. Trump's business empire, a judge ordered the president and his company to pay a judgment in excess of $350 million \u2014 which ballooned to over a half-billion dollars including interest. Judges on New York's appellate court later\u00a0tossed out the judgment over the summer, calling it \"excessive.\"",
      "Since returning to office, Mr. Trump has taken the unprecedented step of encouraging the Justice Department to look into people who he believes wronged him during his first term or his four years out of office \u2014 including Comey and James.",
      "The moves have been met with some internal backlash. The acting U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, Erik Siebert, resigned last month, amid concern from prosecutors in the office that the Trump administration could fire him for failing to prosecute James.",
      "Siebert was replaced as interim U.S. attorney by Lindsey Halligan, a former Trump attorney and White House aide. Just days after she was sworn in, the office asked a grand jury to indict Comey for allegedly lying during a Senate hearing five years ago.",
      "Meanwhile, Trump-aligned attorney Ed Martin \u2014 who leads the Justice Department's new Weaponization Working Group \u2014 pressed James to resign\u00a0as state attorney general in an August letter obtained by the Associated Press."

    "summary": "Republican Winsome Earle-Sears and Democrat Abigail Spanberger have faced off on the debate stage in Virginia's high-stakes governor's race.",
    "story": [
      "Republican Winsome Earle-Sears and Democrat Abigail Spanberger faced off for the first and only time on the debate stage Thursday night in Virginia's high-stakes gubernatorial race.",
      "It was a fiery affair in which Earle-Sears, who is trailing in the race, went on the offensive from the very beginning, repeatedly interrupting Spanberger and asking her several direct questions.",
      "Spanberger, who largely avoided addressing her Republican opponent directly, sought to cast a bipartisan tone at times. Over the course of the hourlong affair, the candidates sparred over violent rhetoric, the federal shutdown and transgender children. The economy was largely an afterthought.",
      "Virginia is one of just two states choosing governors this November, and its election is often seen as a bellwether for the party in power across the Potomac River ahead of midterm elections next year.",
      "Washington politics are especially relevant this year in Virginia, as President Trump's cuts to the federal workforce and Congress' current government shutdown have an outsize impact in a state filled with federal employees and military personnel.",
      "Here are some takeaways from the debate at Norfolk State University:",
      "Perhaps even more than policy differences, the candidates' personal styles shaped the hourlong debate.",
      "Earle-Sears, with her only chance to confront Spanberger before Election Day, was far more aggressive. She repeatedly turned toward Spanberger and addressed her by her first name, interrupting almost every answer, despite being admonished by the moderators over and over.",
      "The approach put the Democrat on the defensive after months of running the race largely on her own terms as the perceived frontrunner.",
      "Spanberger, while she criticized her opponent at times, faced forward throughout, avoided eye contact, and only rarely addressed Earle-Sears directly. She did not speak during Earle-Sears' answers, even when her opponent asked direct questions, which happened often.",
      "Earle-Sears also told Spanberger she \"should have stayed in Congress\" and frequently questioned her truthfulness.",
      "\"Don't lie like that, Abigail!\" she shouted at one point.",
      "The interruptions lasted up until the very final moments of the debate when the moderators cut off the microphones.",
      "A scandal shaped the very beginning of the debate, although it was not a scandal directly involving either candidate onstage.",
      "Instead, it was the Democratic candidate for attorney general, Jay Jones. He has been heavily criticized in recent days following last week's publication of text messages from 2022 in which he suggested that Virginia's former Republican House speaker get \"two bullets in the head.\"",
      "While Spanberger had previously shared \"disgust\" about Jones's words, heading into Thursday night's debate she had not called for him to drop out of the race, while Mr. Trump and Earle-Sears publicly pressed Jones to do so. Over and over again Thursday night, Earle-Sears pushed Spanberger on whether she would do the same.",
      "Earle-Sears, in her first comment of the debate, took an unrelated question about the state's vehicle tax and questioned Spanberger over the Jones issue. When asked by a moderator about Jones, Spanberger quickly denounced the text messages, as she had soon after they became public last week. But she was evasive when asked whether she continued to endorse Jones. After being pressed about the topic, Spanberger tried to distance herself from Jones and said it was up to voters to make an individual decision.",
      "\"Abigail, what if he said it about your three children? Is that when you would say it's time to get out of the race?\" Earle-Sears asked. She later added of Spanberger, \"She has no courage.\"",
      "Spanberger had largely avoided the issue in the days leading up to the debate, aside from issuing a public statement condemning the texts. But facing repeated questions from the moderators and her opponent, she was forced to weigh in. The Democratic congresswoman declined to say whether Jones should leave the race, saying it's up to voters to make their own decision.",
      "\"Are you saying political murder is OK?\" Earle-Sears charged.",
      "\"Once again, I have denounced political violence, political rhetoric, no matter who is leading the charge,\" Spanberger responded, pointing to violent rhetoric from Mr. Trump that Earle-Sears declined to denounce and trying to sound a bipartisan tone.",
      "\"You routinely refer to me as your enemy. I'm not your enemy. You are not my enemy. We are political opponents,\" Spanberger said.",
      "In the race to succeed Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who under state law cannot run for another term this year, Spanberger has been viewed as having a sizable advantage. But statewide races in Virginia can become surprisingly close by election day, and Jones' words have been met with bipartisan backlash and helped galvanize Republican momentum.",

      "The showdown over the shutdown flared Thursday night.",
      "The federal shutdown, which has been underway for more than a week, is especially prevalent in Virginia, home to roughly 315,000 federal workers. Even before much of the federal government closed its doors last week, many Virginians were already affected by Mr.\u00a0Trump's spring push to slash federal jobs and his ongoing threats to impose more mass firings.",
      "Earle-Sears, a vocal Trump supporter, had perhaps the more difficult challenge during the debate. She argued that she is best positioned to strengthen the state's economy, even as she was reluctant to criticize the Republican president's job cuts in the state.",
      "She declined to criticize Mr. Trump or call on him to end the shutdown when asked directly by the moderators Thursday.",
      "Instead, she blamed Democrats for the mess and called on Spanberger to push Virginia Sens. Tim Kaine and Mark Warner, both Democrats, to vote in favor of a spending bill that would end the impasse with the Republican-controlled Congress.",

      "\"I would encourage everyone, our Democratic senators, our Democratic House members, our Republican House members, to work and come back to the table,\" she said.",
      "Many voters say they're most concerned about the direction of the economy, but some of the most pointed moments of the debate were focused on cultural issues.",

      "Spanberger declined to say whether she would rescind the measure signed by Youngkin that would require students to go only to the restrooms of their birth gender.",

    "published": "Thu, 09 Oct 2025 14:40:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Photos of Jeffrey Epstein's cell show a scene of disarray that never underwent a proper inspection, according to experts.",
    "story": [
      "The federal investigation into the death of convicted sex-trafficker Jeffrey Epstein was marred by significant lapses, experts told CBS News, including the failure by investigators to interview potential witnesses, properly preserve certain evidence and run basic forensic tests.",
      "Nearly two years passed before investigators interviewed the two key corrections officers on duty the night Epstein died in his cell in the Metropolitan Correctional Center in downtown New York City, in what was later ruled a suicide, according to court documents. One of those officers was the only person to attest to seeing Epstein hanging by a bedsheet from his bunk.",
      "And details pulled from 90 photos of the cell and other evidence collected in the hours after Epstein's death \u2014 but before FBI agents arrived to process the scene \u2014 appear to show a succession of basic oversights, ranging from an absence of evidence markers to items being moved, experts told CBS News.",
      "\"The FBI literally has all of the best tools. I mean, spared no expense. They have every tool you can imagine. And they used none of it as far as we can tell,\" forensic analyst Nick Barreiro said after reviewing the photos, many of which have never been published. \"How are there not way more people pointing out the absurdity of this?\"",
      "The images were previously obtained by 60 Minutes. After the recent release of surveillance video from the night Epstein died, which appeared to show details that contradicted official reports, CBS News reviewed them and other documents with several forensic experts.",
      "The results of the federal investigation were made public in 2023, four years after Epstein's death, in a report by the Department of Justice Office of Inspector General. It concluded that the financier, who entered a guilty plea in 2008 on state-level charges of procuring a child for prostitution, died by suicide. That matched the findings shared by Attorney General William Barr, who told Congress in August he had no doubts that Epstein had taken his own life. But lingering questions, raised by individuals including Epstein's lawyers and brother, have fueled continued speculation and suspicion.",
      "\"I do not believe he died by suicide, no,\" Epstein's co-defendant, Ghislaine Maxwell, said this summer during her interview in August with the Deputy U.S. Attorney General Todd Blanche.",
      "Epstein's brother, Mark, told \"60 Minutes\" in 2020 that, in his view, the evidence he has seen to date points more to murder than suicide. Five years later, he still questions the investigation.",
      "\"This was never properly investigated as a proper homicide, it was never investigated,\" Mark Epstein told CBS News recently.",
      "Nothing about the CBS News review into the investigation of Epstein's death suggests foul play. But the review found that the federal probe did not follow typical investigative procedures into a suspicious death.",
      "\"Evidence photography 101\"",
      "Epstein's body was discovered at 6:30 a.m. on Aug. 10, 2019 by corrections officer Michael Thomas when he arrived at his cell to deliver breakfast. Thomas said he found the accused felon in a near-seated position, suspended from the top of the bunk by a homemade noose, with his legs straight out and his buttocks approximately 1 inch to 1 and a half inches off the floor, according to the inspector general's report. Internal corrections department memos obtained exclusively by CBS News described him as \"cold,\" with \"no palpable pulses.\"",
      "The first FBI agents arrived at the cell more than seven hours later, at 1:35 p.m., according to the 2023 report. But when they arrived, photos show they found a disorganized, rifled-through clutter. Crucially, Epstein's lifeless body had already been removed from the cell, eliminating a critical source of information investigators would need to determine how and when he died, forensic pathologist Michael Baden said.",
      "\"The fact that he was moved diminishes the ability to determine how long he was dead before he was found,\" Baden said.",
      "Emergency medical technicians wrote in their report on the incident, which was obtained by CBS News, that the staff they interacted with could not say when Epstein was last seen alive or describe how he \"was found in [the] jail cell other than to say 'we found him on the ground.'\"",
      "Inside the cell, piles of linens had been strewn about, mattresses were squeezed into a corner on the floor near his bunk bed and Epstein's personal items were rearranged or moved, photos from the scene show. Experts who reviewed photos of the scene for CBS News said there were also inconsistencies between the investigators' official reports and what the images show.",
      "\"In those photographs, it was obvious that things were moved around,\" said former New York Police Department detective Herman Weisberg, who is now managing director of Sage Intelligence. \"It definitely appeared to me that the scene was, for lack of a better term, staged a bit.\"",
      "Epstein's medications, a special mask for treating sleep apnea, and at least one piece of fabric tied into a noose appeared in different places over the course of 90 minutes, when a photographer from the medical examiner's office was documenting the scene.",
      "Weisberg and other experts emphasized that, regardless of whether Epstein's death was a suicide, the cell should have been treated as a crime scene using standard investigatory practices.",
      "\"It almost appears to me that whoever was investigating this just took it at face value that it was a suicide with no foul play whatsoever, suspected,\" Weisberg said. \"But in a situation as high-profile as this, I would always, as an investigator, consider that there might be foul play.\"",
      "While some experts questioned federal investigators' treatment of the scene, forensic pathologist Judy Melinek, who used to work at the New York City Medical Examiner's office, said her former employer appears to have handled the case by the book.",
      "\"It's just people doing what they normally do for any other case,\" Melinek said. \"The majority of [cases] if you weren't such a high profile decedent, the scrutiny would not apply. This is how they treat every other jail death of somebody who is not high profile.\"",
      "The sequence of evidence photos starts with a picture of the stairs leading up to Epstein's cellblock, Tier L. Underlying data from the photo shows it was taken at 9:34 a.m. \u2014 three hours after Epstein's body was found, and four hours before federal investigators arrived.",
      "Time went by even as the nation's top law enforcement officer sought a rapid investigation.",
      "\"I was obviously covering it very quickly and wanted to rule out anything other than suicide,\" Barr told Congress in August, adding that \"within an hour, or minutes of finding out about it, I directed the [inspector general] to have people in New York go to the scene and conduct an investigation.\"",
      "On the back wall, a surveillance camera is visible. It was streaming, but was not recording. This was due to a hard-drive malfunction that had previously been identified but not fixed, according to a Justice Department report.",
      "Next is a blurry image of the door to Epstein's cell, number 220. Running underneath the door was a cable that provided power to a CPAP machine. Epstein had initially been assigned to a cell in a different tier, but he was moved to cell 220 for easier access to an outlet, according to Bureau of Prisons records.",
      "The jail's computer systems were never updated to note that move, according to investigators. A source close to the investigation told CBS News that corrections staff rarely updated internal inmate moves, instead preferring to call out their names while in the tiers.",
      "Two documents on the door are shown in images after Epstein's death. One was a printout with Epstein's personal details and a booking photo. Above that was the ID card for Epstein's former roommate, Efrain Reyes.",
      "Cells typically hold two inmates, and following a suspected suicide attempt two weeks earlier, Epstein was mandated by correction officials to have a cellmate. The day before Epstein's death, however, Reyes was transferred out of the detention center. Investigators eventually concluded that Reyes' move allowed Epstein the solitude needed to kill himself.",
      "From the first photo to the last, it is clear the scene in the cell was chaotic \u2014 so much so that investigators never conclusively determined which strip of bedsheet was around Epstein's neck when he died.",
      "Photos of the bed also raise questions. One shows an orange string hanging from a bar. This picture was included in a 2023 report by the Department of Justice's Inspector General, alongside a description of how Epstein was found, suggesting investigators believed that was what he had used to hang himself.",
      "If that was the case, and the room hadn't been disturbed before the photographer arrived, Epstein's rear would have come to rest on a mattress, instead of hovering over the floor \u2014 complicating investigators' explanation of how he hanged himself.",
      "Some of the evidence was not photographed in Epstein's cell, but instead appeared to be in an entirely different room \u2014 one with floor tiles distinct from the bare concrete of Epstein's cell. These pictures show a defibrillator and another strip of orange cloth tied into a noose-like shape. It is visibly different from the one shown hanging from Epstein's bed frame.",
      "There is no indication in official reports where this noose was found, or which of several knotted strips of bed linen may have been removed from around Epstein's neck. A rendering of this noose was included in Epstein's official autopsy. But the Justice Department later revealed in its 2023 report that \"the noose depicted is not the ligature Epstein used to kill himself.\"",
      "By the time FBI agents arrived, it was clear their work would be scrutinized by the top brass inside the Justice Department.",
      "\"After the suicide, I told the headquarters to make sure that they flooded the zone,\" Barr told Congress in an August deposition.",
      "There is no indication in any official report that an FBI crime scene investigators, officially known as an Evidence Response Team, ever ran fingerprints or DNA tests on anything found in the cell.",
      "Epstein's autopsy report indicates medical examiners collected fingernail clippings, and swabs from his neck and hands. Epstein's brother Mark told CBS News that he still hasn't received any information about the results of DNA tests, if they were carried out, and Barr said in his deposition that he couldn't remember if they had been done.",
      "A 2024 report by Department of Justice researchers warned that investigators risk missing an important \"opportunity\" to gather evidence \"if DNA is not collected at the scene as needed or at the time of examination.\" They advised that \"body swabs should be considered both at the scene and during autopsy.\"",
      "Weisberg said investigators left too many stones unturned, missing the opportunity to close the case in a way that would feel conclusive to the public.",
      "\"In the back of any good investigator's mind, he's preparing this to be scrutinized by counsel. In this case, you're preparing it to be scrutinized by a lot of desktop detectives \u2026 so you better have all of your facts straight,\" Weisberg said.",
      "The FBI \"inspected the cell and retrieved what [they] believed to be relevant to its investigation into the cause of Epstein's death, which included one torn sheet, miscellaneous papers, and an MP3 player,\" inspector general investigators wrote in the 2023 report.",
      "Forensic analyst Barreiro said he considered the agency's treatment of the scene to be striking.",
      "\"Some really shoddy work here, if you can even call it that,\" Barreiro said. \"I mean there's an absence of work here.\"",
      "One basic procedure, which Barreiro referred to as \"evidence photography 101,\" is photographing scenes in a progression that goes from a wide shot to close-ups, with markers identifying evidence.",
      "\"There's no evidence markers in any of these photographs. Like, how do you keep track once you get the stuff back to the crime lab? This is essentially useless,\" said Barreiro, a former police detective and an FBI-trained member of the Digital Imaging and Video Recovery Team.",
      "Richard Esposito, a former New York Police Department deputy commissioner said, \"it appears there may have been several procedural, operational, and investigative missteps at this crime scene.\"",
      "\"Ultimately, determining the true facts and circumstances in a death investigation-and transparently communicating those findings to the public-helps dispel misinformation and reduce the spread of conspiracy theories,\" said Esposito, who is a CBS News law enforcement contributor.",
      "Interviews",
      "Federal investigators questioned 54 people before issuing their final report, including three inmates who had been housed on Epstein's tier, as well as jail staff, administrators, contractors and his brother. However, several other witnesses or their representatives told CBS News they were not interviewed. That included many other inmates housed in Epstein's tier the night of his death, at least one staffer who arrived at Epstein's cell shortly after his body was found and nearly all of the visitors he saw in the days leading up to his death.",
      "Two witnesses who did provide eyewitness accounts, with their lawyers present, were in the cell directly across from Epstein's the night he died. One described seeing Thomas, the first corrections officer on scene, enter Epstein's cell and begin performing CPR, only to emerge holding a rope and a defibrillator. The other said he saw Thomas enter and shake Epstein. He said Thomas tried to pick Epstein up, but fell over. He then began giving chest compressions, the inmate said.",
      "The accounts, which appear in the official report, do not explain what is seen in photos of the jail tier \u2014 their cell windows covered by papers that could have obscured any view outside.",
      "It's not clear if the cell window was papered over in the time after Epstein's death but before the first photos were snapped. The Bureau of Prisons declined to comment.",
      "Attempts to reach Thomas were unsuccessful. A lawyer for his former coworker, Tova Noel, said she would not comment. The former officers agreed to be interviewed by investigators in 2021, as part of a deal that saw prosecutors drop charges of falsifying records related to mandatory checks on Epstein and other inmates, after falling asleep on the job.",
      "Other staffers with first-hand knowledge of the scene and other events were never contacted by federal investigators, according to interviews with CBS News.",
      "Investigators also decided not to interview some of Epstein's visitors, several sources told CBS News. The inmate spent the bulk of his daylight hours with a large, rotating cast of attorneys \u2014 including on the day before his death. The younger lawyers were there not only to provide counsel, but also \"to basically hold his hand\" and \"babysit,\" according to one source. They kept Epstein company, chatting with him about life, politics, literature and any other topic that came to his mind.",
      "\"You'd think if the investigation was a priority, they'd want to take a run at the younger people who were working for him,\" one source told CBS News. \"Nothing.\"",
      "One lawyer who visited Epstein nine days before his death was David Schoen. He said Epstein told him he was actively planning to fight the criminal charges levied against him.",
      "\"And this is why I've said, that in my view \u2014 I don't have anything to base it on other than anecdotal \u2014 I don't think he committed suicide, because he was very engaged in the idea of fighting the case,\" Schoen said. \"He hired me. And to kill himself nine days later wouldn't have made a lot of sense.\"",
      "While many who were close to Epstein have publicly questioned that he died by suicide, Barr has said it was \u2014 and remains \u2014 the most logical conclusion. The alternative would've been too complicated, Barr said in his August deposition.",
      "\"This would've required coordination from probably two dozen people, maybe, within the prison. And all these people were in different groups,\" Barr said. \"You know, the people who were repairing the cameras, the people who, you know, were responsible for opening and closing the door, the people who were responsible for putting in a new cellmate, things like that. \""

    "story": [
      "Arctic seals are being pushed closer to extinction by climate change and more than half of bird species around the world are declining under pressure from deforestation and agricultural expansion, according to an annual assessment from the International Union for Conservation of Nature.",
      "One bright spot is green sea turtles, which have recovered substantially thanks to decades of conservation efforts, the IUCN said Friday as it released its latest Red List of Threatened Species.",
      "While many animals are increasingly at risk of disappearing forever, the updated list shows how species can come back from the brink with dedicated effort, Rima Jabado, deputy chair of the IUCN Species Survival Commission, told The Associated Press.",
      "\"Hope and concern go hand in hand in this work,\" Jabado wrote by email. \"The same persistence that brought back the green sea turtle can be mirrored in small, everyday actions \u2014 supporting sustainable choices, backing conservation initiatives, and urging leaders to follow through on their environmental promises.\"",
      "The list is updated every year by teams of scientists assessing data on creatures around the world. The scope of the work is enormous and important for science, said Andrew Farnsworth, a visiting scientist at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology who studies bird migration and wasn't involved with the IUCN report.",
      "\"Every time one is done and every time there's revision, there's more information, and there's more ability to answer questions\" on species, some of which are still largely a mystery to researchers, Farnsworth said.",
      "Sea ice loss",
      "Because all the marine mammals native to the Arctic \u2014 seals, whales and polar bears \u2014 rely on the habitat provided by sea ice, they're all at risk as it diminishes because of human-caused climate change, said Kit Kovacs, co-chair of IUCN's Species Survival Commission Pinniped Specialist Group, which focuses on seals.",
      "The three species highlighted in the latest IUCN report \u2014 harp, hooded and bearded seals \u2014 have been moved up to a designation of greater concern in the latest update, indicating they are increasingly threatened by extinction, Kovacs said.",
      "The same melting of glaciers and sea ice destroying seal habitats also \"generally will bring escalation in extreme weather events, which are already impacting people around the globe,\" wrote Kovacs.",
      "\"Acting to help seals is acting to help humanity when it comes to climate change,\" Kovacs said.",
      "Global bird decline",
      "The update also highlighted Madagascar, West Africa and Central America, where Schlegel's asity, the black-casqued hornbill and the tail-bobbing northern nightingale-wren were all moved to near-threatened status. Those are three specific birds in trouble, but numbers are dropping for around three-fifths of birds globally.",
      "\"That three in five of the world's bird species have declining populations shows how deep the biodiversity crisis has become and how urgent it is that governments take the actions they have committed to under multiple conventions and agreements,\" said Ian Burfield, global science coordinator at BirdLife International.",
      "Deforestation of tropical forests is one of a \"depressing litany of threats\" to birds, a list that includes agricultural expansion and intensification, competition from invasive species and climate change, said Stuart Butchart, chief scientist at BirdLife International.",
      "\"The fact that 61% of the world's birds are declining is an alarm bell that we can't afford to ignore,\" Butchart said.",
      "The annual U.N. climate summit will be held in November in Belem, Brazil, with much attention on the Amazon and the value of tropical forests to humans and animals. But Farnsworth, of Cornell, said he was \"not so confident\" that world's leaders would take decisive action to protect imperiled bird species.",
      "\"I would like to think things like birds are nonpartisan, and you can find common ground,\" he said. \"But it's not easy.\"",
      "Green sea turtles",
      "One success story is the rebound of green sea turtles in many parts of the world's oceans. Experts see that as a bright spot because it shows how effective human interventions, like legal protections and conservation programs, can be.",
      "Still, \"it's important to note that conservation efforts of sea turtles can take decades before you realize the fruits of that labor,\" said Justin Perrault, vice president of research at Loggerhead Marinelife Center in Juno Beach, Florida, who wasn't involved with the IUCN report.",
      "The overall success with green sea turtles should be celebrated and used as an example with other species, some of which, like hawksbills and leatherbacks, aren't doing nearly as well, said Nicolas Pilcher, executive director of the Marine Research Foundation.",
      "And even for green sea turtles, areas still remain where climate change and other factors like erosion are damaging habitats, Pilcher said, and some of those are poorer communities that receive less conservation funding.",

    "story": [
      "Tokyo \u2014 An agitated bear roamed the aisles of a grocery store in central Japan, injuring two men and frightening shoppers, officials said Wednesday, while Japanese media said a man was found dead after a separate suspected bear mauling.",
      "More and more wild bears have been spotted in Japan in recent years, even in residential areas, due to factors including a declining human population and climate change.",
      "A man was found dead on a mountain Wednesday in the northern Iwate region after a suspected bear attack, according to public broadcaster NHK, citing police.",
      "Separately, the 4.5-foot adult bear that entered the grocery store Tuesday evening in Numata, Gunma, north of Tokyo, lightly injured a man in his 70s and another in his 60s, regional police and fire officials said.",
      "The store is close to mountainous areas, but has never had bears come near before, Hiroshi Horikawa, a management planning official at the grocery store chain, told AFP.",
      "\"It entered from the main entrance and stayed inside for roughly four minutes,\" he said. \"It almost climbed onto the fish case and damaged glass. In the fruits section, it knocked over a pile of avocados and stamped on them.\"",
      "The store's manager told local media that around 30 to 40 customers were inside at the time, and that the bear became agitated as it struggled to find the exit.",
      "Also on Tuesday, a farmer in Iwate region was scratched and bitten by a bear, accompanied by a cub, just outside his house.",
      "A Spanish tourist on Sunday was attacked by a bear at a bus stop in scenic Shirakawa-go village in central Japan.",
      "Between April and September, 108 people nationwide suffered injuries caused by bears, including five deaths, according to the environment ministry. There were a record number of human encounters with bears in Japan last year, with 219 attacks including six deaths in the 12 months to April 2024.",
      "The impacts of climate change on the bears' food sources and hibernation cycles has been cited by experts as a key factor, but there are also implications as Japan's aging population shrinks and humans abandon more rural areas.",
      "That depopulation has left bears \"a chance to expand their range,\" biologist Koji Yamazaki, from Tokyo University of Agriculture,\u00a0told CBS News' Elizabeth Palmer in 2023.",
      "Japan is one of the few places in the world where a large mammal species has been reclaiming habitat \u2014 which is good news for the bears, but if, as biologists suspect, the bear population is growing, the country will have to figure out new ways to protect people and vital infrastructure from the animals."

    "story": [
      "Stockholm\u00a0\u2014 John Clarke, Michel H. Devoret and John M. Martinis won the Nobel Prize in Physics on Tuesday for research on seemingly obscure quantum tunneling that is advancing digital technology.",
      "Clarke, 83, conducted his research at the University of California, Berkeley; Martinis at the University of California, Santa Barbara; and Devoret at Yale and also at the University of California, Santa Barbara.",
      "\"To put it mildly, it was the surprise of my life,\" Clarke told reporters at the announcement by phone after being told of his win.",
      "He paid tribute to the other two laureates, saying that \"their contributions are just overwhelming.\"",

      "3 scientists win Nobel Prize in medicine for discoveries in immunology",
      "\"Our discovery in some ways is the basis of quantum computing. Exactly at this moment where this fits in is not entirely clear to me.\"",
      "However, speaking from his cellphone, Clarke added: \"One of the underlying reasons that cellphones work is because of all this work.''",
      "The Nobel committee said that the laureates' work in the 1980s continues to provide opportunities to develop \"the next generation of quantum technology, including quantum cryptography, quantum computers, and quantum sensors.\"",
      "\"It is wonderful to be able to celebrate the way that century-old quantum mechanics continually offers new surprises. It is also enormously useful, as quantum mechanics is the foundation of all digital technology,\" said Olle Eriksson, Chair of the Nobel Committee for Physics.",
      "The 100-year-old field of quantum mechanics deals with the seemingly impossible subatomic world where switches can be on and off at the same time and parts of atoms tunnel through what seems like impenetrable barriers. The prize winning trio's work helped take that into the larger world, where it has the potential to supercharge computing and communications.",
      "What the three physicists did \"is taking the scale of something that we can't see, we can't touch, we can't feel and bringing it up to the scale of something recognizable and make it something you can build upon,\" said Physics Today editor-in-chief Richard Fitzgerald, who in the 1990s worked in the field on a competitors' group.",
      "\"Quantum computers is one very sort of obvious use, but they're also can be used for quantum sensors, so to be able to make very sensitive measurements of, for example, magnetic fields, and perhaps also for cryptography, so to encode information so it cannot be easily listened to by a third party,\" Mark Pearce, a professor of astrophysics and Nobel Physics Committee member, told The Associated Press.",
      "It is the 119th time the prize has been awarded. Last year, artificial intelligence pioneers John Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton won the physics prize for helping create the building blocks of machine learning.",
      "On Monday, Mary E. Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell and Dr. Shimon Sakaguchi won the Nobel Prize in medicine on Monday for discoveries about how the immune system knows to attack germs and not our bodies.",
      "Nobel announcements continue with the chemistry prize on Wednesday and literature on Thursday. The Nobel Peace Prize will be announced Friday and the Nobel Memorial Prize in economics on Oct. 13.",
      "The award ceremony will be held Dec. 10, the anniversary of the 1896 death of Alfred Nobel, the wealthy Swedish industrialist and the inventor of dynamite who founded the prizes.",
      "The prizes carry priceless prestige and a cash award of 11 million Swedish kronor (nearly $1.2 million)."

In an interview on \"The Takeout\" following the protest, Nye argued NASA's budget is just \"a sliver of the pie\" of the nearly $1.7 trillion federal budget.",
      "\"It's barely the width of the pie cutter, it's less than 0.1% of the federal budget and the return is extraordinary,\" he told CBS News' Major Garrett.",
      "A White House budget proposal\u00a0issued\u00a0earlier this year would see NASA's funding cut by about 25% for fiscal year 2026, from about $24 billion to $18.8 billion.",
      "Nye, the CEO of Planetary Society and former host of \"Bill Nye the Science Guy,\" and around 300 space advocates said Monday\u00a0that dozens of missions would be at risk \u2014 including NASA's Perseverance Mars rover and the Artemis program, which aims to return humans to the moon for the first time in half a century \u2014 if the cuts are approved by Congress.",
      "Despite the proposed cuts, NASA's acting administrator, Sean Duffy, said last month as he introduced a new class of 10 NASA astronaut candidates that there's a possibility one of them could be among the first Americans to put their boots on Mars. However, flights are not yet on the drawing board, and most experts say no such NASA mission is likely to launch within the next decade, and probably longer.",
      "Duffy also said he was confident the U.S. would beat China and win the second space race back to the moon.",
      "Referring to the recent news of Mars rover Perseverance uncovering\u00a0rocks that may hold potential signs of ancient microscopic life, Nye said a NASA budget cut would put the U.S. behind as China plans to launch its sample-return mission in 2028, possibly bringing back samples in 2033.",
      "\"Everybody, understand that if we were to find evidence of life on another world, it would change the course of human history,\" he added. \"So you say, 'Well, how much does that cost?' We're not sure. We've never done it.\"",
      "The 69-year-old science advocate said investing in NASA is \"priceless,\" telling Garrett: \"NASA also, objectively, every dollar that goes into NASA Science comes back at least a factor of three times, so if you put $1 into NASA Science, you're going to get $3 back into the economy.\"",

      "Brunkow, 64, is a senior program manager at the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle. Ramsdell, 64, is a scientific adviser for Sonoma Biotherapeutics in San Francisco. Sakaguchi, 74, is a distinguished professor at the Immunology Frontier Research Center at Osaka University in Japan.",
      "Brunkow got the news of her prize from an AP photographer who came to her home in the early hours of the morning.",
      "She said she had ignored the earlier call from the Nobel committee. \"My phone rang and I saw a number from Sweden and thought: 'That's just, that's spam of some sort.'\"",
      "\"When I told Mary she won, she said, 'don't be ridiculous,'\" said her husband, Ross Colquhoun.",
      "\"It was a nice surprise,\" Sakaguchi told a news conference from the University of Osaka in western Japan. \"I hope researches into the area will further progress so that our findings can be used in treatment, and I hope we can contribute to that as well.\"",
      "The immune system has many overlapping systems to detect and fight bacteria, viruses and other bad actors. Key immune warriors such as T cells get trained on how to spot bad actors. If some instead go awry in a way that might trigger autoimmune diseases, they're supposed to be eliminated in the thymus \u2014 a process called central tolerance.",
      "The Nobel winners unraveled an additional way the body keeps the system in check.",
      "The Nobel Committee said it started with Sakaguchi's discovery in 1995 of a previously unknown T cell subtype now known as regulatory T cells or T-regs. Then in 2001, Brunkow and Ramsdell discovered a culprit mutation in a gene named Foxp3, a gene that also plays a role in a rare human autoimmune disease.",
      "The Nobel Committee said two years later, Sakaguchi linked the discoveries to show that the Foxp3 gene controls the development of those T-regs \u2014\u00a0which in turn act as a security guard to find and curb other forms of T cells that overreact.",
      "Brunkow said she and Ramsdell were working together at a small biotech company and they were investigating why a particular strain of mice had an over-active immune system. They had to work with brand new techniques to find the mouse gene behind the problem \u2014 but quickly realized it could be a major player in human health, too.",
      "\"From a DNA level, it was a really small alteration that caused this massive change to how the immune system works.\"",
      "The work opened a new field of immunology, said Karolinska Institute rheumatology professor Marie Wahren-Herlenius. Researchers around the world now are working to use regulatory T cells to develop treatments for autoimmune diseases and cancer.",
      "\"Their discoveries have been decisive for our understanding of how the immune system functions and why we do not all develop serious autoimmune diseases,\" said Olle K\u00e4mpe, chair of the Nobel Committee.",

    "summary": "The first supermoon of 2025 will arrive soon. Here's what to know about the phenomenon.",
    "story": [
      "The moon will appear slightly larger and brighter Monday night during what's known as a supermoon.",
      "October's supermoon is the first of three this year. It happens when a full moon is closer to Earth in its orbit. That makes the moon look up to 14% bigger and 30% brighter than the faintest moon of the year, according to NASA. The subtle difference happens a few times a year, sometimes coinciding with other astronomical events such as lunar eclipses.",
      "\"It's not really very unusual,\" said Derrick Pitts, chief astronomer with the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia.",
      "Everyone in the world can see a supermoon without special equipment, if the skies are clear. But the difference can be tough to discern, especially if people haven't observed the regular moon on the nights leading up.",
      "\"If you go out and just look at the moon when it's very high in the sky, there is nothing relative to it to give you an idea of how big it looks,\" Pitts said.",
      "In the latest viewing, the moon will pass within about 224,600 miles of Earth. The closest supermoon of the year is slated for November, followed by another in December.",
      "The spectacles continue in 2026 with two lunar eclipses: a total eclipse across much of North America, Asia and Australia in March, and a partial one in August across the Americas, Africa and Europe.",
      "Why does the moon appear bigger and brighter during a supermoon?",
      "Like Earth's orbit around the Sun, the moon's orbit around Earth is elliptical, or oval-shaped. This means it's positioned at different distances from the planet depending on the time of the month. The distances range from about 226,000 miles and 251,000 miles, according to NASA.",
      "When the moon is hovering around one of those closer distances along its path in orbit, and there's also a full moon, it becomes a supermoon. The proximity to Earth can make the moon appear bigger to skywatchers on the ground. Sunlight reflecting off the moon can also appear brighter, NASA says.",
      "Supermoons only happen three or four times a year, since the moon's closeness to Earth rarely coincides with monthly full moons. They aren't identical, either. Astronomers generally consider a full moon to be \"super\" if the moon's position in orbit is at least 90% of the distance from its farthest point to Earth in the ellipse to its closest. The absolute closest point\u00a0is called the perigee."

      "Since its discovery in July, comet 3I/ATLAS has been photographed several times. In early August, NASA and the European Space Agency shared images taken by the Hubble Space Telescope, which captured the comet from about 277 million miles away.",

According to Hinote, \"If we have to fight China, we're likely doing it in their front yard, and that means they can bring many, many more things to bear than we can, because it's so far away. You're having to achieve kill ratios of 10 to 1, 15 to 1, and 20 to 1 to even stay in the game.\"",
      "I asked, \"How do these war games come out when American pilots are going up against 20 to 1 odds?\"",
      "\"The war games don't turn out very well,\" Hinote replied. \"We lose.\"",
      "The Air Force is counting on AI drones to even the odds, by bringing to an aircraft what a human pilot doesn't. McMullen said, \"The big thing with artificial intelligence is the ability to handle large amounts of data. A human out in a complex air combat environment, there's just no way to absorb all of it. Artificial intelligence might be able to take all of the data information, and then process that very quickly, and then make real-time decisions.\"",
      "AI drones will be about half the length of a manned jet fighter, and one-quarter the cost \u2013 $20 to 30 million each. Hinote said, \"You could buy more airplanes, put them in the field, and still not break the bank. The key would be that you don't have to bring the human operator home; you actually can take more risk.\"",
      "Spain says the Air Force expects to have 150 AI-piloted aircraft by the end of the decade, and eventually up to 1,000.",
      "I asked, \"These drones aren't just going to sit in a hangar waiting for war with China. What are they going to do in peacetime?\"",
      "\"It's pretty wide open,\" Spain replied.",
      "\"Could you send up AI drones to intercept those Russian bombers that come down off the coast of Alaska?\"",
      "\"Yes, you could do that,\" he said.",
      "Those intercepts can turn nasty in an instant. Last year a Russian fighter rocked an American F-16, so AI drones would have to be prepared to shoot.",
      "So, is AI going to be making life-or-death decisions? \"Absolutely not,\" said Spain. \"Absolutely not. The human who's controlling the AI will make the life-and-death decisions.\"",
      "At least for now.",
      "Making life-or-death decisions",
      "Hinote said, \"Increasingly militaries around the world, including the United States military, are going to be pressured to give the machines more leeway in making those life-or-death decisions.\"",
      "Including the capability to fire on their own? \"The United States military is investing in the experimentation that you would need to be able to produce the types of platforms that could fire on their own if you gave them that option,\" Hinote said.",
      "If adversaries let AI make those decisions, what happens? \"I think they do so at their own peril,\" said Spain. \"Because the AI can be fooled, the AI can be overwhelmed. It can give you false outcomes. We've seen that AI can hallucinate. So, it's not a guarantee of success. What it guarantees is that it will do something quickly.\"",
      "\"Don't you at least have to give your pilots that option?\" I asked.",
      "\"To go full autonomy and just let it go? I don't think America is comfortable with that yet,\" Spain replied. \"I'm not saying that couldn't be a future world that we live in where we trust it. But I don't think we're there right now, certainly, and certainly not to start. We have to build that trust over time.\"",
      "At Top Gun AI, pilots keep putting in the reps, test flight after test flight, simulation after simulation, to build that trust.",
      "Asked whether he would rather go into combat with a human wingman or an AI wingman, McMullen replied, \"When we're talking about the threats of tomorrow, if I can send an uncrewed asset into a high-risk environment, I'd rather do that than send a human pilot.\"",

      "According to a memo obtained by CBS News Friday evening, written by the president's physician, Capt. Sean Barbabella, Mr. Trump \"successfully completed a scheduled follow-up evaluation.\"",
      "Barbabella stated that the president underwent \"advanced imaging, laboratory testing, and preventive health assessments,\" adding that \"comprehensive laboratory studies performed in conjunction with the visit were exceptional, including stable metabolic, hematologic, and cardiac parameters.\"",
      "The president also received his annual flu vaccination, and an updated COVID-19 booster vaccination.",
      "\"President Trump continues to demonstrate excellent overall health,\" Barbabella wrote. \"His cardiac age-a validated measure of cardiovascular vitality via ECG-was found to be approximately 14 years younger than his chronological age.\"",
      "The president spent several hours at the medical center Friday, meeting with troops while he was there.",
      "When previously asked, the White House declined to explain why the president was undergoing a second yearly checkup. Mr. Trump, 79, plans to travel to the Middle East as soon as this weekend, after he announced the first phase of a peace deal between Israel and Hamas.",
      "Ahead of the appointment, the president described his visit as a \"sort of semi-annual physical, which I do.\"",
      "\"I think I'm in great shape, but I'll let you know,\" the president told reporters Thursday. \"... Physically, I feel very good. Mentally, I feel very good.\"",
      "The president is able to receive basic medical care at the White House from the physician to the president, but presidents typically go to Walter Reed for more extensive examinations and procedures.",

His April records also say that he had a colonoscopy in July 2024 and was recommended to undergo another in 2027.",
      "After the president was seen with swollen ankles at the FIFA Club World Cup and a bruised hand on multiple occasions, Leavitt in July told the press that according to the readout from the president's April exam, his health was normal. The latest full exam by the White House Medical Unit, however, revealed the president has chronic venous insufficiency.",
      "According to Johns Hopkins and the Cleveland Clinic, chronic venous insufficiency occurs when veins in the legs do not function normally, leading to poor blood flow back up to the heart. Barbabella said that an examination revealed no evidence of a more serious condition such as deep vein thrombosis or arterial disease, and the president remains in \"excellent\" overall health. The White House has said the president's bruised hand is a result of the extensive handshaking that's part of his job."

    "summary": "ICE's John Schultz said he's \"confident\" that once the administration receives approval from a third country to accept Abrego Garcia, he could be deported within 72 hours.",
    "story": [
      "Greenbelt, Maryland \u2014 A federal judge on Friday sharply questioned Justice Department lawyers about Trump administration plans to again deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Salvadoran man who was mistakenly deported to a prison in his home country earlier this year before he was brought back to the U.S. to face criminal charges.",
      "U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis questioned what is standing in the way of immigration authorities removing Abrego Garcia to Costa Rica, a country that he has said is his preferred place to go and which has indicated it is willing to accept him.",
      "Xinis also repeatedly expressed frustration with testimony from a U.S. immigration official, Jonathan Schultz, who appeared to answer questions about the administration's next steps regarding Abrego Garcia's potential removal to Eswatini, a small African nation formerly known as Swaziland, or other countries, including Costa Rica.",
      "Xinis told Drew Ensign, a Justice Department lawyer, that the government presented a witness who \"knows nothing, and I mean next to nothing, about Costa Rica.\" She said she gave specific directions about the scope of the testimony she was seeking, and said the Justice Department had again ignored those instructions, \"getting to the three strikes, you're out.\"",
      "The administration has attempted to deport Abrego Garcia while his criminal case on charges of\u00a0human smuggling\u00a0plays out in Tennessee, but Xinis issued an order in August preventing immigration officials from removing him from the U.S. Xinis is weighing whether to release Abrego Garcia from immigration custody while a challenge to his detention moves forward.",
      "Schultz, an official from Enforcement and Removal Operations at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told the court that government officials have had discussions with numerous foreign nations about accepting Abrego Garcia upon his removal from the U.S.",
      "Schultz said the U.S. reached an agreement with Eswatini to accept people deported from the U.S. and has made assurances they will be safe from torture and persecution. But he said Eswatini hasn't agreed to receive Abrego Garcia, specifically, and the Trump administration did not reach out to the African nation about him until Wednesday evening, according to Schultz.",
      "Administration officials do not appear to have undertaken efforts yet to evaluate whether Abrego Garcia would be tortured, detained or face persecution if deported to Eswatini, Schultz said.",
      "The immigration official told the court the Trump administration has also been discussing removing Abrego Garcia to Ghana, but a notice of his potential deportation to the country had been sent to Abrego Garcia prematurely.",
      "Ghana's foreign affairs minister, however, said on social media earlier Friday that his country \"is not accepting Abrego Garcia.\"",
      "\"He cannot be deported to Ghana. This has been directly and unambiguously conveyed to US authorities,\" Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa, the foreign affairs minister, wrote on Facebook. \"In my interactions with US officials, I made clear that our understanding to accept a limited number of non-criminal West Africans, purely on the grounds of African solidarity and humanitarian principles would not be expanded.\"",
      "Schultz said he is \"confident\" that once the Trump administration receives approval from a third country to accept Abrego Garcia, he could be deported within 72 hours.",
      "Ahead of the hearing, Xinis said she wanted\u00a0the witness to have answers on what steps the government has taken to deport Abrego Garcia to Eswatini or any other country, including Costa Rica, which he designated as his preferred country of removal. The judge also said the administration official should be prepared to testify about what additional steps the government could take \"in the reasonably foreseeable future\" to deport Abrego Garcia.",
      "Schultz revealed that he believes Eswatini entered into discussions about whether Abrego Garcia could be removed to the country after the government in Uganda declined to accept him. Abrego Garcia's lawyers received a notice from the Department of Homeland Security in late August informing them that he\u00a0might be deported to Uganda. Documents obtained by CBS News in August indicated that the Trump administration and Uganda reached a deal for the East African nation to accept deportees.",
      "Abrego Garcia's attorneys have moved to free their client from federal immigration detention as his immigration case plays out, citing a 2001 Supreme Court decision\u00a0that found federal law does not permit \"indefinite detention\" for those the government seeks to deport. Detention should be limited to a \"period reasonably necessary\" to bring about their removal from the U.S, the high court ruled.",
      "After being released from criminal custody on unrelated charges, Abrego Garcia was taken into immigration custody in late August, and his lawyers argue that his continued confinement is illegal. They wrote in a challenge to the legality of his detention that because the Trump administration has been relying on a \"purported\" final order of removal for Abrego Garcia from 2019, the \"presumptively reasonable period\" of detention would've expired in 2020.",
      "Andrew Rossman, a lawyer for Abrego Garcia, argued that his client has been in \"continuous confinement\" since March, when he was first arrested by immigration authorities and then deported to El Salvador, where he remained detained \u2014 with the exception of a brief weekend in August.",
      "The \"U.S. government held the keys\" to Abrego Garcia's confinement at a Salvadoran prison, he said.",
      "Rossman said the administration is \"0 for 3\" in finding a country that will accept Abrego Garcia for removal to. Abrego Garcia's lawyers also said they confirmed with him that if the U.S. moved to deport him to Costa Rica, he would go.",
      "The Costa Rican government said in an August letter to the top U.S. diplomat in the country that it intends to provide refugee status or residency to Abrego Garcia, and would accept him \"upon the conclusion of any criminal sentence he may serve in the United States of America.\"",
      "Rossman told the court that he doesn't believe the Trump administration is \"intending to remove [Abrego Garcia] in a lawful way.\"",
      "\"They have spun the globe and picked various places,\" he said, to effectively \"fail on purpose\" by selecting countries that would be \"completely unpalatable\" to Abrego Garcia and lead him to express reasonable fear of persecution or torture that then have to be adjudicated \u2014 during which he would remain detained.",
      "\"That shows the real aim of the government, the improper aim, is a punitive one, which is just to keep him incarcerated,\" Rossman said.",
      "Xinis questioned Ensign, the Justice Department lawyer, about whether the Trump administration has had any conversations with Abrego Garcia and his lawyers about potentially being removed to Costa Rica given his designation of the country as the place where he wanted to be removed.",
      "\"Why hasn't there been?\" she said of discussions.",
      "Abrego Garcia had been living in Maryland for more than a decade with his wife and children when he was first taken into immigration custody in March and deported to El Salvador. But an immigration judge in 2019 had granted Abrego Garcia a withholding of removal, a legal status that prohibited the Department of Homeland Security from removing him to his home country because of likely persecution by local gangs.",
      "Xinis ordered the Trump administration in April to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return to the U.S., though the Department of Homeland Security resisted doing so for weeks. But in early June, Abrego Garcia was brought back to the U.S. after a federal grand jury indicted him on two counts of human smuggling.",
      "He pleaded not guilty to both counts, and in July, a federal judge overseeing his criminal case ordered him to be released on bond while awaiting trial. But Abrego Garcia remained detained for several more weeks because of concerns that he would be swiftly taken into immigration custody following his release and deported.",
      "He had been held at a detention center in Virginia but was transferred to a facility in Pennsylvania last month.",
      "Earlier this month, an immigration judge in Maryland\u00a0rejected a request from Abrego Garcia's legal team to reopen his immigration case and allow him to seek asylum in the United States. While the bid was denied, Abrego Garcia can appeal the decision to the Board of Immigration Appeals.",
      "Last week, a federal judge in Tennessee said he believes the Justice Department's criminal case against Kilmar Abrego Garcia may have been \"vindictive,\" writing on Friday that \"The government had a significant stake in retaliating against Abrego's success.\" The judge has not made a final ruling on those claims, and will allow for discovery and a hearing on Abrego Garcia's claims.",
      "There are 62,000 people in immigration custody, Schultz, the immigration official said."

    "summary": "Financial markets slumped Friday after President Trump threatened to raise tariffs on China over a dispute involving rare earths.",
    "story": [
      "Investors are shuddering on concerns of renewed trade tensions between the world's two biggest economies.",
      "Stocks fell sharply on Friday, with the S&P 500 shedding 183 points, or 2.7%, to close at 6,553 in what was the index's worst day since April. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 879 points, or 1.8%, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 3.6%.",
      "The selloff affected a wide range of stocks, from Big Tech companies like Nvidia and Apple to stocks of smaller companies looking to get past uncertainty about tariffs and trade.",
      "\"Investors still think the tit-for-tat between the U.S. and China these last few days is mostly posturing (the consensus view is that tariffs won't go up, and that Trump and Xi will still meet in South Korea), but trade-related risks have certainly risen after being dormant for the last several weeks,\" Wall Street analyst Adam Crisafulli, head of Vital Knowledge, said in a report.",
      "Stocks had been heading for a slight gain in the morning, until Mr. Trump said on his social media platform said he's considering \"a massive increase of tariffs\" on Chinese imports. He's upset at restrictions China has placed on exports of its rare earths, which are materials that are critical for the manufacturing of everything from consumer electronics to jet engines.",
      "\"We have been contacted by other Countries who are extremely angry at this great Trade hostility, which came out of nowhere,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"Our relationship with China over the past six months has been a very good one, thereby making this move on Trade an even more surprising one. I have always felt that they've been lying in wait, and now, as usual, I have been proven right!\"",
      "Mr. Trump also threatened to call off a planned meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea later this month.",
      "\"Threatening significantly increased tariffs on China is a hallmark of Trump's negotiating tactics, and all it took was a headline to entice investors to take some chips off the table,\" Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist for Allianz Investment Management, said in an email.",
      "Primed for a slide?",
      "The market may have been primed for a slide. U.S. stocks were already facing criticism that their prices had shot too high following a nearly relentless 35% run for the S&P 500 from a low in April to record heights.",
      "Critics say the market looks overpriced after prices rose much faster than corporate profits. Worries are particularly high about companies in the artificial-intelligence industry, where pessimists are making comparisons to to the 2000 dot-com bubble that ultimately imploded. For stocks to look less expensive, either their prices need to fall, or profits need to rise.",
      "Other factors also weighed on investor sentiment Friday, including the ongoing U.S. government shutdown and fresh data showing that consumers are anxious about the economy.",
      "The University of Michigan's preliminary October sentiment index,\u00a0released\u00a0Friday, shows consumer sentiment fell 0.1% on a monthly basis, from 55.1 points in September to 55. While the drop was nominal, it represents the third consecutive month the confidence measure, which is closely watched by investors, has declined.",
      "\"Pocketbook issues like high prices and weakening job prospects remain at the forefront of consumers' minds,\" Joanne Hsu, director of the Surveys of Consumers at the University of Michigan, said in a statement.",
      "The job market has slowed so much that the Federal Reserve cut its main interest rate last month for the first time this year. Fed officials have penciled in more cuts through next year to give the economy more breathing room. But Chair Jerome Powell has also said they may have to change course if inflation stays high. That's because lower interest rates can push inflation even higher."

    "summary": "Family members of victims in January's plane crash near Washington, D.C., have been advocating for reforms in the wake of the tragedy.",
    "story": [
      "Rachel Feres lost four members of her family in the deadly plane crash near Washington, D.C., earlier this year. She said that in the aftermath of the crash, flying will never be the same for her, and the government shutdown gave her pause when she came to Capitol Hill this week to advocate for safety reforms.",
      "\"I trust that everyone who is going to work is doing their very best to keep us safe, but this is just not a functional way to govern,\" she told CBS News. \"We deserve better than this. We deserve that our essential systems, our transportation systems, stay open and that the folks who are responsible for keeping those safe are paid on time and that that doesn't become a football.\"",
      "Amid efforts in Congress to reform the nation's aviation system, Feres and other victims' family members have been meeting with lawmakers and Jennifer Homendy, chair of the National Transportation Safety Board. Feres' cousin Peter Livingston, his wife Donna and daughters Alydia and Everly died when an Army Black Hawk helicopter collided with an American Eagle flight over the Potomac River in January.",
      "\"Our message has been that aviation safety reform matters,\" Feres said. \"It matters to the American people. This is a nonpartisan issue. This is an American issue, and we all deserve to know that when we or our loved ones get on a plane, we get off again on the other side.\"",
      "Feres and other victims' family members met with Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, chair of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, and the panel's top Democrat, Sen. Maria Cantwell of Washington state.",
      "\"I have a lot of confidence in the members on both sides of the aisle who are working hard to ensure that this stays a top priority, but I think anytime, obviously, the government is shut down, we know that infrastructure projects are delayed and we know that the members of the government who are on the job, who are TSA agents and air traffic controllers, may not be getting paid, and that's a concern for all of us.\"",
      "The NTSB's investigation into January's crash is ongoing.",
      "The Black Hawk helicopter was flying without a piece of equipment turned on that allows the aircraft to be tracked. The military has a waiver that essentially exempts it from having to use the equipment.",
      "In July, Cruz introduced legislation that would require all aircraft to use the equipment, known as Automatic Dependent Surveillance\u2013Broadcast, or ADS-B.",
      "A spokesperson for Cruz said in a statement to CBS News that he's been working with the victims' families on the bill since January.",
      "\"The Rotorcraft Operations Transparency and Reform Act represents an important step forward in aviation safety reform by requiring that all aircraft, military and civilian, use both ADS-B Out and ADS-B In and seeks to hold the Army accountable for failures that may have contributed to the crash,\" the spokesperson said. \"He is committed to ensuring another accident does not happen again.\""

    "story": [
      "President Trump on Friday threatened to raise U.S. tariffs on China over its new restrictions on rare-earth elements.",
      "\"They are becoming very hostile, and sending letters to Countries throughout the World, that they want to impose Export Controls on each and every element of production having to do with Rare Earths, and virtually anything else they can think of, even if it's not manufactured in China,\" Mr. Trump wrote in a social media post on Truth Social.",
      "Mr. Trump's threat follows a move by China this week to implement tighter restrictions on the country's exports of rare earths, critical minerals used to manufacture products including semiconductors, electric car batteries, jet engines and defense weapons.",
      "China produces as much as 95% of the world's rare earth magnets, according to energy research company Wood Mackenzie. Access to such materials has been a key sticking point in trade talks between Washington and Beijing.",
      "The new export controls outlined by the country's Ministry of Commerce, which took effect on Thursday, require companies to get special approval to export products containing even trace amounts of rare earths sourced from China, including if those products were manufactured abroad by non-Chinese companies.",
      "An English translation of the new rules released Thursday does not specify potential penalties if exporters fail to comply with the controls.",
      "Mr. Trump expressed surprise at the the new trade measures, describing the move by China's government as \"very hostile\" and vowing to retaliate if Beijing follows through in applying the rare-earth controls.",
      "\"One of the Policies that we are calculating at this moment is a massive increase of Tariffs on Chinese products coming into the United States of America,\" Mr. Trump said in his post. \"There are many other countermeasures that are, likewise, under serious consideration.\"",
      "Mr. Trump also threatened to call off a planned meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea later this month.",
      "In June, the U.S. and China announced they had agreed on a\u00a0framework deal aimed at defusing tensions over tariffs, rare earths and other issues.",
      "Stocks fell Friday amid concerns of a renewed trade conflict between the U.S. and China, with the S&P 500 slipping 131 points, or nearly 2%, to 6,664. The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 624 points, or 1.3%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropped nearly 600 points, or 2.6%.",
      "\"After a relatively calm few months and improving relations between the U.S. and China, this step-up in tensions has created a white-knuckle moment for the markets, with tech stocks under major pressure today,\" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note to investstors.",
      "Financial markets, which pushed deeper into record territory earlier this week, have also edged down in recent days as some investors warn of a potential pubble in stocks propelled by the growth in artificial intelligence."

    "summary": "Hillary Clinton and Condoleezza Rice joined CBS News' Norah O'Donnell for a discussion of the Israel-Hamas deal as the ceasefire begins in Gaza.",
    "story": [
      "Hillary Clinton and Condoleezza Rice on Friday praised the Trump administration's success in reaching a Middle East peace deal. Both of the former secretaries of state are still cautiously watching to see how the early phases play out but expressed some optimism about its prospects.",
      "Clinton and Rice joined CBS News 24/7 for a live interview with CBS News senior correspondent Norah O'Donnell to discuss the Israel-Hamas peace plan brokered by President Trump as the first stage of the deal takes shape.",
      "The conversation took place two days after the signing of a landmark deal in which Hamas agreed to release all remaining hostages taken on Oct. 7, 2023, and Israel pledged to withdraw its military from parts of the Gaza Strip. Mr. Trump has called the deal the \"first phase\" of a comprehensive 20-point plan to end the two-year-long Israel-Hamas war. The president plans to travel to the Middle East as soon as this weekend, and said he hopes to be present for the return of the hostages.",
      "\"I really commend President Trump and his administration, as well as Arab leaders in the region for making the commitment to the 20-point plan and seeing a path forward for what's often called the day after,\" Clinton told O'Donnell.",
      "O'Donnell asked Rice if she is confident this is the end of the war.",
      "\"No one can be completely confident, given the history of the Middle East,\" Rice replied, but she added that there are good reasons to be optimistic.",
      "Rice and Clinton both said the Israelis and Palestinians must get through this first phase of the deal \u2014 and that still isn't certain.",
      "\"That's not self-evident,\" Clinton said. It's going to take a lot of work. It's going to take a lot of coordination.\"",
      "One of the difficulties in achieving a lasting peace in the Middle East is getting various parties on board, but the fact that there's a broader coalition of Middle Eastern states involved in this agreement is a good sign, Rice said.",
      "\"The one piece that I'm most concerned about is, how do you get from a kind of transitional authority of some kind, a truly representative Palestinian authority?\" Rice asked. \"The Palestinian authority, which controls the West Bank, lost control of Gaza after 2006, has not really been reformed in a long time. And it needs reform. It needs younger blood.\"",
      "Clinton called Israel's attack on Hamas leaders in Qatar's capital of Doha in September \"ill-advised\" and a \"strategic error\" that gave Mr. Trump's negotiators an opening.",
      "\"That provided an opening for both President Trump and his representatives to marshal all of the regional powers, including, of course, Qatar, but also to make it clear to Israel, 'No, this is now enough. We cannot continue this. This conflict needs to end, and we've got to move on.'\"",
      "Clinton said of U.S. negotiators, \"They took advantage of an opening that was available and were able to be successful.\"",
      "Rice suggested a two-state solution isn't likely to be feasible right now, but she said there are things the Palestinians can do to prepare for a future state. Palestinians are going to need to insist on reforms themselves, she said.",
      "\"They've got to start to recognize that Israel is going to exist, and it's going to be a part of this Middle East,\" Rice said. \"And that means, change the lessons that you teach your kids about the state of Israel. Stop putting up maps that (say) the state of Israel doesn't exist. Don't create another generation of Palestinians who believe that somehow the resistance is the way to peace and security.\"",
      "Clinton said the Israeli settlement activity in the West Bank that has been encouraged by the Israeli government \"has to cease.\"",
      "She said the work of rebuilding Gaza will be arduous, laborious and intensive, and she called on the U.S. and international community to commit together to bring peace to the Middle East.",
      "\"Let's now support this process and bring it together, not just in a nonpartisan way in our own country, but literally internationally as a great global commitment to try to bring peace, security, stability and a better future to the Middle East,\" Clinton said.",
      "The deal is expected to allow dozens of hostages to return to their families on Monday or Tuesday, ending a two-year ordeal that began with Hamas' attack on southern Israel. It would also offer a reprieve to millions of residents of the Gaza Strip who have faced an intense and nearly uninterrupted two-year bombardment and ground invasion by Israel's military.",
      "Some questions remain, however. Mr. Trump's 20-point peace plan calls for Israel to withdraw from much of the Gaza Strip in phases, but the exact cadence of those withdrawals isn't clear. It also calls for control of Gaza to be handed over to a still-unformed \"technocratic\" committee that does not include Hamas and \u2014 at least for now \u2014 also leaves out the Palestinian Authority. The deal recognizes an independent Palestinian state as \"the aspiration of the Palestinian people,\" but it's unclear if or when discussions on statehood could take place.",
      "The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has vexed every U.S. administration in recent history \u2014 including the two that Friday's guests worked in. Clinton pressed for a two-state solution\u00a0 \u2014 but Obama struggled with a chilly relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a period that also saw two smaller wars in Gaza. Rice also championed a two-state solution and made extensive efforts in the last years of the Bush administration to help negotiate peace.",
      "But in part because then-Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and then-Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas were each short on the political support necessary to make a lasting deal, the conflict continued. One common critique of past administrations is that they have not made sufficient use of U.S. leverage over Israel, to pressure it to make concessions. Pressure on the Netanyahu government from President Trump appears to have been a critical factor in bringing about this peace deal now."

      "Hsu also said the ongoing U.S. government shutdown doesn't appear so far to have weighed on consumers' views of the economy. The survey's responses were gathered between Sept. 22 and Oct. 6, overlapping with the start of the shutdown on Oct. 1.",
      "The latest University of Michigan reading provides a sliver of insight into the economy at a time when other benchmarks are unavailable due to a data blackout tied to the shutdown. The Department of Labor was scheduled to release monthly September jobs numbers on Oct. 3, but that report remains on hold after the agency\u00a0said\u00a0it would suspend operations.",
      "At the same time, the fate of the next Consumer Price Index report, which is scheduled to be released on Oct. 15, remains unclear. Bloomberg reported Thursday that the Bureau of Labor Statistics is bringing back employees to ensure the report is released before month's end.",
      "While the University of Michigan index shows consumer sentiment was virtually unchanged from September, other data points to ongoing concerns about the economy. The percentage of people saying the economy is getting worse ticked up to 59% in October compared to 54% in July, according to a recent CBS News poll.",
      "Despite such concerns, other signals show the economy holding up. A Bank of America\u00a0report released Friday shows credit and debit card spending per household rose 2% in September from a year ago, up from 1.7% in August.",
      "Alexandra Brown, North America economist at Capital Economics, said in a research note that consumer spending growth is likely to remain healthy in the final three months of 2025."

    "summary": "Proposed class-action lawsuit accuses e-commerce giant of using \"fictional\" list prices to calculate Prime Day discounts.",
    "story": [
      "Two consumers allege that Amazon misled customers by promoting false discounts on its site during its summer Prime Day sale.",
      "In a proposed class-action lawsuit filed in September in a federal court in Washington state, plaintiffs Cathy Armstrong of California and Oluwa Fosudo of Maryland claim that Amazon used \"fictional\" list prices to calculate its recent Prime Day percentage discounts, making deals appear better than they actually were.",
      "The lawsuit details a number of examples of what plaintiffs alleged were \"fake sales\" during the four-day Prime Day event, which ran July 8-11.",
      "One such example is a pair of headphones advertised by Amazon on Prime Day as being on sale for 44% off the product's list price of $179.95, according to the complaint. Plaintiffs claim that the item's list price has always been in the range of \"$130 to $160\" and that the advertised 44% discount was misleading.",
      "\"Amazon uses these fake Prime Day Percentage Discounts, offered under the extreme time pressure of the brief Prime Day window, to lure consumers to purchase products,\" the complaint states.",
      "In another example, the lawsuit mentions an 8-inch Android tablet for kids listed as \"40% off,\" based on a strikethrough list price of $119.99. However, in the 90 days leading up to the sale, the tablet was being offered for between $50 and $85, with a median price of $72, according to the suit.",
      "That means the supposedly time-limited Prime Day Deal of $72.18 was actually higher than the tablet's $50 price Amazon was selling the item for in April, and about the same price the item usually goes for on Amazon, the lawsuit alleges.",
      "\"But for Amazon's false and misleading representations, Plaintiffs would also have shopped around for better prices in the marketplace or waited to purchase the items at a better price,\" according to the complaint.",
      "The lawyers who brought the suit on behalf of the plaintiffs declined to comment, citing the pending litigation. They filed the proposed class action after Popular Information, a Substack newsletter focused on corporate and political accountability, published a\u00a0story\u00a0calling out some of the allegedly deceptive tactics Amazon used during its Prime Day event.",
      "Amazon declined to comment.",
      "On its corporate website, the company\u00a0calls the recent four-day sale\u00a0its biggest Prime event to date and states that customers \"saved billions on deals.\" The retailer\u00a0held a separate Prime Day event this week from Oct. 7-8.",
      "Amazon in September\u00a0agreed to pay $2.5 billion to settle federal claims it misled customers into signing up for Prime and made it difficult for them to cancel their membership. As part of the settlement, Amazon must pay a $1 billion civil penalty \u2014 the largest ever in an FTC rule violation case."

    "summary": "Travelers within the U.S. could experience flight delays as weather problems, air traffic controller shortages persist.",
    "story": [
      "Travelers planning to fly into or out of U.S. airports could feel the impact of staffing issues, which continue to build as the government shutdown\u00a0reached its 10th day Friday.",
      "The \"national picture today looks a little messy,\" CBS News senior transportation correspondent Kris Van Cleave said from Los Angeles International Airport on Friday.",
      "Across the U.S., roughly 52,000 flights are scheduled ahead of the\u00a0Columbus Day\u00a0weekend, according to the Federal Aviation Administration.",
      "Tasked with keeping travelers safe on the ground and in the air, TSA officers and air traffic controllers are\u00a0deemed essential\u00a0by the government, requiring them\u00a0to keep working\u00a0during the shutdown without immediate pay.",
      "However, an uptick in workers calling out sick has led to sporadic flight delays and cancellations, raising concerns over staffing shortages. The scheduling irregularities come as\u00a0potential weather disruptions\u00a0are expected across the East Coast and in Phoenix.",
      "\"On top top that you have uncertainty that's been injected into basically everyone's travels because of the staffing situation that we're seeing pop up sporadically throughout the air traffic control system,\" Van Cleave said.",
      "Typically, air traffic controller shortages drive about 5% of all flight delays. That figure is currently 53%, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy told Fox Business.",
      "\"It doesn't look like its a coordinated or targeted sick out per se, but you're seeing more sick calls than you would normally see, and so, everyday, particularly as we get into the afternoon and evening hours, multiple FAA facilities have what are called staffing triggers, where they are short-staffed basically,\" Van Cleave said.",
      "\"And some of those don't result in a whole lot of disruption, and we've seen others that have been pretty disruptive,\" he added.",
      "For example, at Nashville International Airport in Tennessee on Thursday, roughly 40,000 flyers were inconvenienced by an air traffic controller shortage. \"So it's not nothing, even if the vast majority off air traffic controllers are working,\" Van Cleave said.",
      "Air traffic controllers who violate agency sick leave policies will face repercussions, Secretary Duffy said this week.",
      "The National Air Traffic Controllers Association, the union representing such workers, said in a statement on its\u00a0website\u00a0that it does not condone their members taking actions that would compromise the safety of the nation's airspace. The union also urged workers to keep showing up on the job, despite not being paid on schedule.",
      "\"At this critical juncture, it is more important than ever that we rise to the occasion and continue delivering the consistent, high-level of public service we provide every day,\" tNATCA stated.",
      "Still, the impact of staffing shortages on flights so far\u00a0has been minimal, reported Van Cleave, but delays could worsen as staffing shortages continue.",
      "\"While delays and cancellations have been within historic norms this week, and the vast majority of fights are leaving on time, the amount of delays because of air traffic controllers staffing is up,\" he said."

    "published": "Fri, 10 Oct 2025 12:46:14 -0400",
    "summary": "The IRS on Thursday announced adjustments to the federal income tax brackets and standard deductions for 2026.",
    "story": [
      "The IRS is adjusting the income limits for its federal income tax brackets to account for the impact of inflation, an annual reset that could provide relief for some Americans when they file their taxes next year.",
      "The IRS makes these adjustments, typically in October or November, to avoid what it known as \"bracket creep,\" which is when inflation pushes people into higher tax brackets, potentially forcing them to dole out more money come April.",
      "The upshot: Americans will have to earn more income next year before reaching a higher tax bracket. For example, the upper tax limit on a single filer making $50,000 will be 12% in 2026 versus 22% in 2025.",
      "See the updated tax brackets below.",
      "The IRS did not respond to a request for comment on the inflation rate it applied in adjusting its tax brackets for 2026. Bloomberg Tax forecasted last month that the agency would apply an inflation rate of 2.7%.",
      "In 2024, the IRS adjusted\u00a0its tax bracket thresholds by 5.4%\u00a0to account for the lingering inflation that erupted during the pandemic. That followed a\u00a0historically large adjustment\u00a0of 7% in 2023.",
      "The IRS uses the\u00a0\"Chained Consumer Price Index\"\u00a0data from the past 12 months to make adjustments for the 2026 tax year, as required by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.",
      "The IRS announced Wednesday that an agency-wide furlough would begin on Oct. 8 due to a lapse in federal appropriations as a result of the government shutdown. Taxpayers with an Oct. 15 extension deadline should plan on submitting their returns as planned, according to the agency.",
      "\"Taxpayers should continue to file, deposit, and pay federal income taxes as they normally would; the lapse in appropriations does not change Federal Income Tax responsibilities,\" a spokesperson told CBS News in an email.",
      "Standard Deduction",
      "In addition to setting the federal income tax brackets, the IRS also released changes to 2026 standard deductions on Thursday.",
      "Married couples filing jointly will have a standard deduction of $32,200Heads of households will have a standard deduction of $24,150Single taxpayers and married individuals will face a standard deduction of $16,100",
      "Married couples filing jointly will have a standard deduction of $32,200",
      "Heads of households will have a standard deduction of $24,150",
      "Single taxpayers and married individuals will face a standard deduction of $16,100",
      "Seniors could see additional relief due to a provision in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that provides a temporary tax deduction of up to $6,000 for people aged 65 and older. The tax break, which is set to expire at the end of 2028, is available to those with an adjusted gross income of $75,000 or less for single filers and $150,000 or less for couples filing jointly.",
      "Earned Income Tax Credit",
      "The maximum amount for households that claim the Earned Income Tax Credit will be $8,231 for families with at least three children, up from $8,046 for the current tax year, the IRS said.",
      "Estate tax limit",
      "The estates of wealthy Americans will see a bigger tax break in 2026 than they did this year. The IRS said Thursday that the estates of people who die in 2026 will have a basic exclusion amount of $15 million, up from nearly $14 million in the 2025 tax year.",
      "Health Flexible Spending",
      "U.S. workers can now voluntarily contribute up to $3,400 to their health flexible spending accounts, up $100 from prior year. These contributions, which are deducted pre-tax from employee paychecks, go toward an account that can be used to pay for out-of-pocket medical expenses.",
      "Understanding your tax bracket",
      "There's a misconception that Americans pay the top tax rate on every dollar of their income, but that isn't the case. Taxation in the U.S. is progressive, meaning that tax rates increase the more you earn. In other words, the seven income tax rate brackets \u2014 10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, 35% and 37% \u2014 represent the percentage you'll pay on portions of your income.",
      "For instance, a single taxpayer making $50,000 in taxable income in 2026, will pay 10% in federal taxes on the first $12,400 of their income (the top threshold for the 10% bracket) and then 12% on the remaining $37,600.",
      "To determine your marginal tax bracket, you must first figure out what your highest taxable income is. Take the example of a married couple with $150,000 in gross income. They would first subtract the 2026 standard deduction of $32,200 from that amount, leaving them with $117,800 in taxable income. That would put their top marginal tax rate at 22%.",
      "However, their effective tax rate \u2014 meaning the percentage of their annual income that they will pay to the IRS \u2014\u00a0is much lower, as follows:",
      "Their first $24,800 of income will be taxed at 10%, or $2,480 in taxesTheir earnings from $24,800 to $100,800 would be taxed at 12%, or $9,120 in taxes\u00a0Their income from $100,800 to $117,800 would be taxed at 22%, or $3,740 in taxes",
      "Their first $24,800 of income will be taxed at 10%, or $2,480 in taxes",
      "Their earnings from $24,800 to $100,800 would be taxed at 12%, or $9,120 in taxes",
      "Their income from $100,800 to $117,800 would be taxed at 22%, or $3,740 in taxes",
      "Combined, they would pay $15,340 in federal income taxes, giving them an effective tax rate of 13%.",
      "How the OBBBA will impact taxes",
      "The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed into law by President Trump in July, made most of the tax cuts from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act permanent, helping some American taxpayers avert a scheduled tax increase.",
      "As a result of the Republican spending bill, the typical filer could see an average tax cut of $3,752 in 2026, with benefits varying depending on the filer's geographic location, according to an\u00a0analysis\u00a0in August from the Tax Foundation.",
      "A taxpayer's income will also influence the tax cuts they see, with higher-income Americans more likely to see a bigger benefit from tax provisions in the legislation than lower-income households.",
      "A July\u00a0analysis\u00a0from the Tax Policy Center found that the typical household in the bottom quintile \u2014 those earning up to $34,600 per year \u2014 will save an average of about $150 in tax payments in 2026, or 0.8% of their income. By comparison, those in the top quintile \u2014 those who earn $217,101 or more \u2014 will save an average of $12,540 next year, or 2.5% of their income."

      "Prologue",
      "Sacramento is where my thinking began about equality, liberty, and freedom. My wife, Mary, was also born and raised in Sacramento. We share cherished memories of younger years, school days, our wedding in 1963, and raising our three children in the city we loved. Sacramento is the place where we stood, in both the real and symbolic sense, to find beginnings and discover perspectives beyond. It is where my father practiced law, and where I \u2014 far too soon \u2014 stepped into his place to take over his practice. It is where my time on the bench began, and where so many of my beliefs about our country, about the rule of law, and about the world were formed.",
      "The West, of course, was imperfect, and is imperfect. Neither the place nor the concept was anything close to idyllic. There were and are scorpions and snakes aplenty. On the frontier, just as in other places, racial, ideological, and gender prejudice were all too common and injurious. But perhaps more than elsewhere, the frontier contained the promise of something better, the promise of community, of tolerance, of growth and ambition, all tempered by the realms in which the reality fell short, many of which are discussed in the pages ahead. But it is in the West where I learned to see people as individuals, beyond their race or religion or gender, beyond whom they loved or how they chose to live their lives, beyond the elements that could have driven us apart. I began to try to understand the common beliefs that brought us together.",
      "Only 116 men and women in our nation's history have served as justices on the U.S. Supreme Court. Growing up, it was easy to think of these justices as beyond reproach. And the inequity that they were all white men at the time was slow to dawn upon me. But my image was of nine sages behind closed doors, ruling on some of the most central, and potentially divisive, issues in society. And then, one day, after years spent practicing law, teaching, and then judging on the Ninth Circuit bench, suddenly one of the nine was me.",
      "Reality set in: I hoped to still be the person I had always been. A husband, a father, a diligent reader. But still just a fallible person. For all my years on the bench \u2014 and it gives me pride to say that my service as a justice on the Court was the fifteenth longest in U.S. history \u2014 I took the responsibility seriously, as did each of my colleagues, no matter how much and how often we agreed or disagreed. In doing my best to interpret and apply the Constitution and the law to the cases that came before us, my hope was that my life in the West would help give me the perspective needed to be honest and fair.",
      "Growing up in the West taught me, for example, that the creative energies of a great people cannot be realized unless the realms of economic freedom and personal liberty are respected. It reminded me that central to an individual's claim to personal liberty is the right to fair treatment and to be protected from arbitrary government action. The West reminded me that the most successful businessperson and the lowest-paid worker are each entitled to this basic dignity, a dignity that helped Americans build the frontier and continues to help us today.",
      "The West is so central to my self-understanding that it seems an appropriate place to begin. This Western boy did later go East. But my hope was to stay always close to those Western ideas of liberty and justice. This memoir is my way of putting those ideas on paper, of explaining how a Western boy became a lawyer, a judge, and a justice, seeking always to honor our country's founding principles and to do so with civility, hard work, tolerance, and the ethical foundation our nation must preserve.",

    "published": "Thu, 09 Oct 2025 14:40:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Photos of Jeffrey Epstein's cell show a scene of disarray that never underwent a proper inspection, according to experts.",
    "story": [
      "The federal investigation into the death of convicted sex-trafficker Jeffrey Epstein was marred by significant lapses, experts told CBS News, including the failure by investigators to interview potential witnesses, properly preserve certain evidence and run basic forensic tests.",
      "Nearly two years passed before investigators interviewed the two key corrections officers on duty the night Epstein died in his cell in the Metropolitan Correctional Center in downtown New York City, in what was later ruled a suicide, according to court documents. One of those officers was the only person to attest to seeing Epstein hanging by a bedsheet from his bunk.",
      "And details pulled from 90 photos of the cell and other evidence collected in the hours after Epstein's death \u2014 but before FBI agents arrived to process the scene \u2014 appear to show a succession of basic oversights, ranging from an absence of evidence markers to items being moved, experts told CBS News.",
      "\"The FBI literally has all of the best tools. I mean, spared no expense. They have every tool you can imagine. And they used none of it as far as we can tell,\" forensic analyst Nick Barreiro said after reviewing the photos, many of which have never been published. \"How are there not way more people pointing out the absurdity of this?\"",
      "The images were previously obtained by 60 Minutes. After the recent release of surveillance video from the night Epstein died, which appeared to show details that contradicted official reports, CBS News reviewed them and other documents with several forensic experts.",
      "The results of the federal investigation were made public in 2023, four years after Epstein's death, in a report by the Department of Justice Office of Inspector General. It concluded that the financier, who entered a guilty plea in 2008 on state-level charges of procuring a child for prostitution, died by suicide. That matched the findings shared by Attorney General William Barr, who told Congress in August he had no doubts that Epstein had taken his own life. But lingering questions, raised by individuals including Epstein's lawyers and brother, have fueled continued speculation and suspicion.",
      "\"I do not believe he died by suicide, no,\" Epstein's co-defendant, Ghislaine Maxwell, said this summer during her interview in August with the Deputy U.S. Attorney General Todd Blanche.",
      "Epstein's brother, Mark, told \"60 Minutes\" in 2020 that, in his view, the evidence he has seen to date points more to murder than suicide. Five years later, he still questions the investigation.",
      "\"This was never properly investigated as a proper homicide, it was never investigated,\" Mark Epstein told CBS News recently.",
      "Nothing about the CBS News review into the investigation of Epstein's death suggests foul play. But the review found that the federal probe did not follow typical investigative procedures into a suspicious death.",
      "\"Evidence photography 101\"",
      "Epstein's body was discovered at 6:30 a.m. on Aug. 10, 2019 by corrections officer Michael Thomas when he arrived at his cell to deliver breakfast. Thomas said he found the accused felon in a near-seated position, suspended from the top of the bunk by a homemade noose, with his legs straight out and his buttocks approximately 1 inch to 1 and a half inches off the floor, according to the inspector general's report. Internal corrections department memos obtained exclusively by CBS News described him as \"cold,\" with \"no palpable pulses.\"",
      "The first FBI agents arrived at the cell more than seven hours later, at 1:35 p.m., according to the 2023 report. But when they arrived, photos show they found a disorganized, rifled-through clutter. Crucially, Epstein's lifeless body had already been removed from the cell, eliminating a critical source of information investigators would need to determine how and when he died, forensic pathologist Michael Baden said.",
      "\"The fact that he was moved diminishes the ability to determine how long he was dead before he was found,\" Baden said.",
      "Emergency medical technicians wrote in their report on the incident, which was obtained by CBS News, that the staff they interacted with could not say when Epstein was last seen alive or describe how he \"was found in [the] jail cell other than to say 'we found him on the ground.'\"",
      "Inside the cell, piles of linens had been strewn about, mattresses were squeezed into a corner on the floor near his bunk bed and Epstein's personal items were rearranged or moved, photos from the scene show. Experts who reviewed photos of the scene for CBS News said there were also inconsistencies between the investigators' official reports and what the images show.",
      "\"In those photographs, it was obvious that things were moved around,\" said former New York Police Department detective Herman Weisberg, who is now managing director of Sage Intelligence. \"It definitely appeared to me that the scene was, for lack of a better term, staged a bit.\"",
      "Epstein's medications, a special mask for treating sleep apnea, and at least one piece of fabric tied into a noose appeared in different places over the course of 90 minutes, when a photographer from the medical examiner's office was documenting the scene.",
      "Weisberg and other experts emphasized that, regardless of whether Epstein's death was a suicide, the cell should have been treated as a crime scene using standard investigatory practices.",
      "\"It almost appears to me that whoever was investigating this just took it at face value that it was a suicide with no foul play whatsoever, suspected,\" Weisberg said. \"But in a situation as high-profile as this, I would always, as an investigator, consider that there might be foul play.\"",
      "While some experts questioned federal investigators' treatment of the scene, forensic pathologist Judy Melinek, who used to work at the New York City Medical Examiner's office, said her former employer appears to have handled the case by the book.",
      "\"It's just people doing what they normally do for any other case,\" Melinek said. \"The majority of [cases] if you weren't such a high profile decedent, the scrutiny would not apply. This is how they treat every other jail death of somebody who is not high profile.\"",
      "The sequence of evidence photos starts with a picture of the stairs leading up to Epstein's cellblock, Tier L. Underlying data from the photo shows it was taken at 9:34 a.m. \u2014 three hours after Epstein's body was found, and four hours before federal investigators arrived.",
      "Time went by even as the nation's top law enforcement officer sought a rapid investigation.",
      "\"I was obviously covering it very quickly and wanted to rule out anything other than suicide,\" Barr told Congress in August, adding that \"within an hour, or minutes of finding out about it, I directed the [inspector general] to have people in New York go to the scene and conduct an investigation.\"",
      "On the back wall, a surveillance camera is visible. It was streaming, but was not recording. This was due to a hard-drive malfunction that had previously been identified but not fixed, according to a Justice Department report.",
      "Next is a blurry image of the door to Epstein's cell, number 220. Running underneath the door was a cable that provided power to a CPAP machine. Epstein had initially been assigned to a cell in a different tier, but he was moved to cell 220 for easier access to an outlet, according to Bureau of Prisons records.",
      "The jail's computer systems were never updated to note that move, according to investigators. A source close to the investigation told CBS News that corrections staff rarely updated internal inmate moves, instead preferring to call out their names while in the tiers.",
      "Two documents on the door are shown in images after Epstein's death. One was a printout with Epstein's personal details and a booking photo. Above that was the ID card for Epstein's former roommate, Efrain Reyes.",
      "Cells typically hold two inmates, and following a suspected suicide attempt two weeks earlier, Epstein was mandated by correction officials to have a cellmate. The day before Epstein's death, however, Reyes was transferred out of the detention center. Investigators eventually concluded that Reyes' move allowed Epstein the solitude needed to kill himself.",
      "From the first photo to the last, it is clear the scene in the cell was chaotic \u2014 so much so that investigators never conclusively determined which strip of bedsheet was around Epstein's neck when he died.",
      "Photos of the bed also raise questions. One shows an orange string hanging from a bar. This picture was included in a 2023 report by the Department of Justice's Inspector General, alongside a description of how Epstein was found, suggesting investigators believed that was what he had used to hang himself.",
      "If that was the case, and the room hadn't been disturbed before the photographer arrived, Epstein's rear would have come to rest on a mattress, instead of hovering over the floor \u2014 complicating investigators' explanation of how he hanged himself.",
      "Some of the evidence was not photographed in Epstein's cell, but instead appeared to be in an entirely different room \u2014 one with floor tiles distinct from the bare concrete of Epstein's cell. These pictures show a defibrillator and another strip of orange cloth tied into a noose-like shape. It is visibly different from the one shown hanging from Epstein's bed frame.",
      "There is no indication in official reports where this noose was found, or which of several knotted strips of bed linen may have been removed from around Epstein's neck. A rendering of this noose was included in Epstein's official autopsy. But the Justice Department later revealed in its 2023 report that \"the noose depicted is not the ligature Epstein used to kill himself.\"",
      "By the time FBI agents arrived, it was clear their work would be scrutinized by the top brass inside the Justice Department.",
      "\"After the suicide, I told the headquarters to make sure that they flooded the zone,\" Barr told Congress in an August deposition.",
      "There is no indication in any official report that an FBI crime scene investigators, officially known as an Evidence Response Team, ever ran fingerprints or DNA tests on anything found in the cell.",
      "Epstein's autopsy report indicates medical examiners collected fingernail clippings, and swabs from his neck and hands. Epstein's brother Mark told CBS News that he still hasn't received any information about the results of DNA tests, if they were carried out, and Barr said in his deposition that he couldn't remember if they had been done.",
      "A 2024 report by Department of Justice researchers warned that investigators risk missing an important \"opportunity\" to gather evidence \"if DNA is not collected at the scene as needed or at the time of examination.\" They advised that \"body swabs should be considered both at the scene and during autopsy.\"",
      "Weisberg said investigators left too many stones unturned, missing the opportunity to close the case in a way that would feel conclusive to the public.",
      "\"In the back of any good investigator's mind, he's preparing this to be scrutinized by counsel. In this case, you're preparing it to be scrutinized by a lot of desktop detectives \u2026 so you better have all of your facts straight,\" Weisberg said.",
      "The FBI \"inspected the cell and retrieved what [they] believed to be relevant to its investigation into the cause of Epstein's death, which included one torn sheet, miscellaneous papers, and an MP3 player,\" inspector general investigators wrote in the 2023 report.",
      "Forensic analyst Barreiro said he considered the agency's treatment of the scene to be striking.",
      "\"Some really shoddy work here, if you can even call it that,\" Barreiro said. \"I mean there's an absence of work here.\"",
      "One basic procedure, which Barreiro referred to as \"evidence photography 101,\" is photographing scenes in a progression that goes from a wide shot to close-ups, with markers identifying evidence.",
      "\"There's no evidence markers in any of these photographs. Like, how do you keep track once you get the stuff back to the crime lab? This is essentially useless,\" said Barreiro, a former police detective and an FBI-trained member of the Digital Imaging and Video Recovery Team.",
      "Richard Esposito, a former New York Police Department deputy commissioner said, \"it appears there may have been several procedural, operational, and investigative missteps at this crime scene.\"",
      "\"Ultimately, determining the true facts and circumstances in a death investigation-and transparently communicating those findings to the public-helps dispel misinformation and reduce the spread of conspiracy theories,\" said Esposito, who is a CBS News law enforcement contributor.",
      "Interviews",
      "Federal investigators questioned 54 people before issuing their final report, including three inmates who had been housed on Epstein's tier, as well as jail staff, administrators, contractors and his brother. However, several other witnesses or their representatives told CBS News they were not interviewed. That included many other inmates housed in Epstein's tier the night of his death, at least one staffer who arrived at Epstein's cell shortly after his body was found and nearly all of the visitors he saw in the days leading up to his death.",
      "Two witnesses who did provide eyewitness accounts, with their lawyers present, were in the cell directly across from Epstein's the night he died. One described seeing Thomas, the first corrections officer on scene, enter Epstein's cell and begin performing CPR, only to emerge holding a rope and a defibrillator. The other said he saw Thomas enter and shake Epstein. He said Thomas tried to pick Epstein up, but fell over. He then began giving chest compressions, the inmate said.",
      "The accounts, which appear in the official report, do not explain what is seen in photos of the jail tier \u2014 their cell windows covered by papers that could have obscured any view outside.",
      "It's not clear if the cell window was papered over in the time after Epstein's death but before the first photos were snapped. The Bureau of Prisons declined to comment.",
      "Attempts to reach Thomas were unsuccessful. A lawyer for his former coworker, Tova Noel, said she would not comment. The former officers agreed to be interviewed by investigators in 2021, as part of a deal that saw prosecutors drop charges of falsifying records related to mandatory checks on Epstein and other inmates, after falling asleep on the job.",
      "Other staffers with first-hand knowledge of the scene and other events were never contacted by federal investigators, according to interviews with CBS News.",
      "Investigators also decided not to interview some of Epstein's visitors, several sources told CBS News. The inmate spent the bulk of his daylight hours with a large, rotating cast of attorneys \u2014 including on the day before his death. The younger lawyers were there not only to provide counsel, but also \"to basically hold his hand\" and \"babysit,\" according to one source. They kept Epstein company, chatting with him about life, politics, literature and any other topic that came to his mind.",
      "\"You'd think if the investigation was a priority, they'd want to take a run at the younger people who were working for him,\" one source told CBS News. \"Nothing.\"",
      "One lawyer who visited Epstein nine days before his death was David Schoen. He said Epstein told him he was actively planning to fight the criminal charges levied against him.",
      "\"And this is why I've said, that in my view \u2014 I don't have anything to base it on other than anecdotal \u2014 I don't think he committed suicide, because he was very engaged in the idea of fighting the case,\" Schoen said. \"He hired me. And to kill himself nine days later wouldn't have made a lot of sense.\"",
      "While many who were close to Epstein have publicly questioned that he died by suicide, Barr has said it was \u2014 and remains \u2014 the most logical conclusion. The alternative would've been too complicated, Barr said in his August deposition.",
      "\"This would've required coordination from probably two dozen people, maybe, within the prison. And all these people were in different groups,\" Barr said. \"You know, the people who were repairing the cameras, the people who, you know, were responsible for opening and closing the door, the people who were responsible for putting in a new cellmate, things like that. \""

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ice-agents-new-york-city-immigration-courts-analysis/",
    "published": "Wed, 08 Oct 2025 12:49:00 -0400",
    "summary": "ICE has made nearly 2,400 arrests that likely took place in immigration courthouses around the country, and analysis of federal data finds.",
    "story": [
      "Tensions at Manhattan's immigration courts are reaching a boiling point.",
      "Last week, Immigration and Customs Enforcement reinstated the officer who was initially relieved of duties after shoving an Ecuadorian woman to the ground as he arrested her husband. The next day, ICE agents shoved journalists, sending one to the hospital.",
      "\"Every single week I would ask myself, is this when everything is going to fall apart and explode, and I'm still waiting for it, but we're getting closer,\" said Allison Cutler, an immigration attorney from New York Legal Assistance Group who is in court at 26 Federal Plaza almost every day.",
      "New York City has seen 460 ICE arrests this year through July that likely took place in immigration court, more than in any other city, a new analysis of federal data found. The estimates, by mathematician Joseph Gunther, are the first attempt to quantify arrests in immigration courts at a national level.",
      "Gunther identified nearly 2,400 ICE arrests likely made in immigration courts across the country, a total he said may still be an undercount. The analysis fills a gap left by the lack of DHS reporting on how many arrests ICE has made in or around courts.",
      "Those arrested very rarely had criminal records, the analysis found. Over 90% had only civil immigration charges, such as crossing the border illegally.",
      "ICE did not respond to a CBS News request for comment about the analysis, but Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a May news release that \"arrests of criminal illegal aliens in courthouses is common sense.\"",
      "\"It conserves valuable law enforcement resources because they already know where a target will be,\" she said. \"These illegal aliens have gone through security and been screened to not have any weapons.\"",
      "To quantify courthouse arrests, Gunther cross-referenced data on ICE arrests from the Deportation Data Project with data on immigration court hearings from the Executive Office for Immigration Review. ICE data does not have precise location information on arrests. But by comparing dates, places and demographic information between the two datasets, Gunther compiled a list of arrests that likely took place on the same day as a court hearing. The methodology was reviewed by two immigration experts.",
      "\"These are the first general estimates of something that shouldn't be secret in the first place,\" Gunther said. \"It shouldn't be necessary at all to do this drawn-out data analysis to know such basic facts.\"",
      "ICE began making arrests at immigration courts in late May, when DHS rescinded Biden-era guidance limiting them.",
      "DHS attorneys then began moving to dismiss cases and initiate expedited removal proceedings. Once immigrants face expedited removal, they are detained and are not entitled to any more hearings before a judge.",
      "Previously, expedited removal had been mostly limited to migrants encountered near the border. In January, the Trump administration expanded that to apply to undocumented immigrants anywhere in the U.S. who entered less than two years ago.",
      "On Aug. 30, a federal judge paused this expansion, blocking ICE's strategy of fast-tracking deportations of those with dismissed cases.",
      "ICE is also arresting immigrants in court with ongoing cases, immigration attorneys and court watchers said.",
      "\"A lot of immigration judges say, I'm going to give you another court date, but I don't know what will happen when you leave this court room,\" said Dee Ann Croucher, a volunteer who observes hearings in El Paso multiple times a week. \"I saw a lady just break down sobbing when they said that to her.\"",
      "The woman was detained in the hallway after the hearing, Croucher said.",
      "Immigrants arrested in court are often transferred far from home and family, limiting access to legal representation and sometimes placing them in a more conservative court system, immigration attorneys said.",
      "A CBS News analysis of the arrests Gunther identified found that nearly all were transferred to another facility, often hundreds of miles away. Those arrested in New York were moved an average of more than 1,000 miles away, often to Texas or Louisiana.",
      "Some have been released from detention after federal judges ruled their detainment was unlawful, but not everyone has the legal resources to file a petition, said Hasan Shafiqullah, immigration supervising attorney at the Legal Aid Society.",
      "\"Many people are languishing in detention,\" he said. \"Because detention is so terrible, people are often giving up and just saying, \"You know what? Just give me a deportation order.\"",
      "In Miami, some are choosing to self-deport after ICE arrested them in court, said Miami immigration attorney Antonio Ramos, whose office is in the same building as the court.",
      "Miami's immigration court sees the second-most hearings for non-detained immigrants, following New York. There have been about a third of estimated in-court arrests in Miami than in New York this year, according to the analysis.",
      "New York City's immigration courts see more non-detained hearings than any other city. Cutler, the New York immigration attorney, said that ICE agents have told her they are specifically targeting New York City because of its sanctuary policies.",
      "\"I've had officials tell me this to my face that they are punishing New York,\" she said. \"They would say, when New York stops being a sanctuary city, that is when we will leave.\"",
      "DHS has been clear that New York and other cities with sanctuary policies will be the target of increased enforcement, but did not respond to inquiries from CBS News about how they choose which courts to deploy ICE officers to.",
      "Following New York, Gunther's analysis found there were 190 ICE arrests in El Paso that likely took place in immigration court. Immigration courts in the Los Angeles area \u2014 within the city itself and in Van Nuys and Santa Ana \u2014 also had a high number of estimated arrests when combined, at 282.",
      "Immigration advocates who observed the arrests in El Paso's court described a less hostile atmosphere and no instances of excessive force. In one case, volunteers were able to negotiate with ICE agents to allow a noncitizen with a medical disorder to be electronically monitored instead of being detained, said Emily Miller, program manager at the Border Immigration Law and Justice Center in El Paso.",
      "\"We have developed a cordial relationship with ICE,\" said Miller, who helps coordinate a group of volunteer court watchers. \"Whether we agree with what [ICE is] doing or not, there is no yelling and filming taking place anymore. At the beginning, there was yelling and filming, we saw ICE be more forceful, that has stopped.\"",
      "Twenty-one of the arrests in El Paso were of children who were arrested with their family members, the analysis estimated. It identifies a total of 76 children arrested, almost all in Texas or the Los Angeles area, and none in New York.",
      "The Biden-era memo had prohibited courthouse arrests because it would \"disincentivize noncitizens from appearing for their hearings.\" When a noncitizen does not appear for their hearing, an immigration judge may order them removed \"in absentia.\"",
      "Immigrants face \"an impossible catch 22,\" said Amy Belsher, supervising attorney at the New York Civil Liberties Union: show up to court and risk arrest, or stay home and receive a deportation order.",
      "The rate of \"in absentia\" removal orders have ticked upward from 46% of non-detained case completions in May, when the arrests first started, to 52% in August.",
      "\"It's going to do lasting and irreparable harm to noncitizens' trust in government systems,\" Belsher said."

      "Hamas accepted a new Gaza ceasefire proposal presented by Egypt and Qatar. One U.S. official said this proposal drew upon principles from earlier negotiations and previous hostage releases.

      "The Israeli strike had caused \"a lot of angst within the Arab world\" and there was \"deep mistrust between the parties,\" a senior U.S. official said, adding that Netanyahu's apology to Qatar was well received, \"as something really, really strong and the sort of thing that mature people do.\"",
      "\"That got us some leverage,\" the official added.",

They spent \"a lot of time\" going over proposals and issues that had arisen over the previous days, such as the redeployment of the Israel Defense Forces and when the hostage releases would take place.",
      "During these talks, they also separated the peace deal into two phases. Phase one would be a hostage release, including the release of Palestinian prisoners in Israel.",
      "Then, phase two would begin. This was what one senior U.S. official called an \"almost permanent ceasefire\" that would be in place until other issues were negotiated: the decommissioning of arms, how a technocratic government would enter and run Gaza, how the Israeli army would redeploy and what the gating mechanisms for these steps would be.",
      "Before they left, Mr. Trump relayed multiple messages to Kushner and Witkoff.",

      "After settling what both sides saw as consequential issues that were discussed by both sides, and clearing up some \"misconceptions and miscommunications,\" Kushner and Witkoff made a call to the president and received some directions from him. Mr. Trump called into the talks at least three times on either Witkoff's or Kushner's iPhone, and spoke on speaker with multiple stakeholders.",
      "One of the key breakthroughs that evening was reaching consensus on the release of the 20 living Israeli hostages and the swap for the Palestinian prisoners.",
      "\"People became more malleable. You could see it as we were trust-building. Food was coming in. We were exchanging ideas,\" one U.S. official said. \"I can't stress enough how important this physical interaction was. We had multiple Arab leaders there who, I think, became very, bought into the fact that we really wanted to see a deal. We were committed to it, and we were going to stand behind it.\"",
      "At this time, Hamas began to realize \"they didn't need the hostages necessarily to enforce a view of theirs, that it was better for them to concede that a release was a positive thing, that better things would happen as a result of that decision on their part,\" a U.S. official said.",
      "\"It was so comprehensive, the engagement, so interactive. We just got ourselves to that place, and then everybody could see the line, and they wanted to cross it. Everybody. It really became a unanimous thing,\" this official added.",

      "6:30p, Tel Aviv, Thursday, Oct. 9: Witkoff, Kushner met with applause in Cabinet room",
      "Witkoff and Kushner arrive in Tel Aviv, though they never made it to their hotel. They immediately went to see President Isaac Herzog, to walk him through the plan, and then met with Netanyahu. They also spoke to the Israeli Cabinet, receiving a warm welcome.",
      "In the Cabinet room, \"everybody started clapping,\" a U.S. official said. \"There were plenty of differences of opinion that we heard there.

      "Their reason for going to Israel was to ensure \"implementation occurs.\" Another senior U.S. official acknowledged, \"There's still just a lot of ways that this can go wrong.\"",
      "\"So, we're staying on top of the details to make sure everyone fulfills their obligations and that any misunderstandings are quickly discussed and adjudicated,\" the official said.",
      "A U.S. official suggested Mr. Trump may have succeeded in reaching a deal where other leaders failed because \"he's not trying to be a middle-of-the-roader.\"",
      "\"He's basically stood shoulder to shoulder with Israel 100%,\" the official said. This has meant Israel \"has a lot of trust in him that he's not going to ask them to do anything that would compromise their security. And because they know that if they agree together on what the end state should be, President Trump and his team were able to have much more frank and creative conversations with Israel on how to get there.\""

      "First, she challenged former President Hugo Chavez, and now, his successor, President Nicolas Maduro, whose\u00a0disputed July 2024 reelection\u00a0was not recognized by the U.S.,\u00a0which instead declared\u00a0opposition leader Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez,\u00a0now exiled, as the winner.",

    "summary": "French President Emmanuel Macron on Friday reappointed Sebastien Lecornu as prime minister, just days after his resignation, to try again to form a government in a bid to end the country's political deadlock.",
    "story": [
      "French President Emmanuel Macron on Friday reappointed S\u00e9bastien Lecornu as prime minister, just days after his resignation, asking him to try again to form a government and produce a budget in a bid to end the country's political deadlock.",
      "Lecornu's reappointment followed days of intense negotiations and came less than a week after he resigned amid infighting in his freshly named government. France is struggling with mounting economic challenges and ballooning debt, and the political crisis is aggravating its troubles and raising alarm across the European Union.",
      "The appointment is widely seen as Macron's last chance to reinvigorate his second term, which runs until 2027. Lacking a majority in the National Assembly to push through his agenda, Macron faces mounting criticism \u2014 including from within his own ranks \u2014 and has little room to maneuver.",
      "Macron's office released a one-sentence statement late Friday night announcing the appointment, one month after the statement issued a month ago when Lecornu was initially named and four days after he resigned.",
      "Lecornu said in a statement on social networks that he accepted the new job offer out of \"duty.\" He said he was given a mission \"to do everything to give France a budget by the end of the year and respond to the daily problems of our compatriots.\"",
      "All those who join his new government will have to renounce ambitions to run for president in 2027, Lecornu said, adding that the new Cabinet will \"incarnate renewal and a diversity of skills.\"",
      "\"We must put an end to this political crisis that exasperates the French, and to this bad instability for France's image and its interests,\" he wrote.",
      "Lecornu abruptly resigned on Monday, only hours after unveiling a new Cabinet that drew opposition from a key coalition partner. The shock resignation prompted calls for Macron to step down or dissolve parliament again, as he did in June 2024. But they remained unanswered, with the president instead announcing on Wednesday that he would name a successor to Lecornu within 48 hours.",
      "Political party leaders met for more than two hours on Friday with Macron, at his request. Some cautioned that another prime minister picked from the ranks of Macron's fragile centrist camp would risk being disavowed by Parliament's powerful lower house, prolonging the crisis.",
      "\"How can one expect that all this will end well?\" said Marine Tondelier, leader of The Ecologists party. \"The impression we get is that the more alone he is, the more rigid he becomes.\"",
      "Over the past year, Macron's successive minority governments have collapsed in quick succession, leaving the European Union's second-largest economy mired in political paralysis as France is faced with a debt crisis. At the end of the first quarter of 2025, France's public debt stood at 3.346 trillion euros ($3.9 trillion), or 114% of gross domestic product.",
      "France's poverty rate also reached 15.4% in 2023, its highest level since records began in 1996, according to the latest data available from the national statistics institute.",
      "The economic and political struggles are worrying financial markets, ratings agencies and the European Commission, which has been pushing France to comply with EU rules limiting debt.",
      "The two biggest opposition parties in the National Assembly \u2014 the far-right National Rally and the far-left France Unbowed party \u2014 weren't invited to the discussions on Friday. The National Rally wants Macron to hold fresh legislative elections, and France Unbowed wants him to resign.",
      "Lecornu argued earlier this week that Macron's centrist bloc, its allies and parts of the opposition could still clump together into a working government. \"There's a majority that can govern,\" he said. \"I feel that a path is still possible. It is difficult.\"",
      "Lecornu will now have to seek compromises to avoid an immediate vote of no confidence and may even be forced to abandon an extremely unpopular pension reform that was one of Macron's signature policies in his second presidential term. Rammed through parliament without a vote in 2023 despite mass protests, it gradually raises the retirement age from 62 to 64. Opposition parties want it to be scrapped.",
      "The political deadlock stems from Macron's shock decision in June 2024 to dissolve the National Assembly. The snap elections produced a hung parliament, with no bloc able to command a majority in the 577-seat chamber. The gridlock has unnerved investors, infuriated voters, and stalled efforts to curb France's spiraling deficit and public debt.",
      "Without stable support, Macron's governments have stumbled from one crisis to the next, collapsing as they sought backing for unpopular spending cuts. Lecornu's resignation, just 14 hours after announcing his Cabinet, underscored the fragility of the president's coalition amid deep political and personal rivalries."

    "story": [
      "China has hit U.S.-owned vessels docking in the country with tit-for-tat port fees, in response to the American government's planned port fees on Chinese ships, expanding a string of retaliatory measures before trade talks between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping.",
      "Vessels owned or operated by American companies or individuals, and ships built in the U.S. or flying the American flag, would be subjected to a 400 yuan ($56) per net ton fee per voyage if they dock in China, China's Ministry of Transport said on Friday.",
      "The fees would be applied on the same ship for a maximum of five voyages each year, and would rise every year until 2028, when it would hike to 1,120 yuan ($157) per net ton, the ministry said. They would take effect on Oct. 14, the same day when the United States is due to start imposing port fees on Chinese vessels.",
      "China's Ministry of Transport said on Friday in a statement that its special fees on American vessels are \"countermeasures\" in response to \"wrongful\" U.S. practices, referring to the planned U.S. port fees on Chinese vessels.",
      "The ministry also slammed the United States' port fees as \"discriminatory\" that would \"severely damage the legitimate interests of China's shipping industry\" and \"seriously undermine\" international economic and trade order.",
      "China has announced a string of trade measures and restrictions before an expected meeting between Trump and Xi on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in South Korea that begins at the end of October. On Thursday, Beijing unveiled new curbs on exports of rare earths and related technologies, as well as new restrictions on the export of some lithium battery and related production equipment.",
      "The port fees announced by Beijing on Friday mirrors many aspects of the U.S. port fees on Chinese ships docking in American ports. Under Washington's plans, Chinese-owned or -operated ships will be charged $50 per net ton for each voyage to the U.S., which would then rise by $30 per net ton each year until 2028. Each vessel would be charged no more than five times per year.",
      "China's new port fee is \"not just a symbolic move,\" said Kun Cao, deputy chief executive at consulting firm Reddal. \"It explicitly targets any ship with meaningful U.S. links \u2014 ownership, operation, flag, or build \u2014 and scales steeply with ship size.\"",
      "The \"real bite is on U.S.-owned and operated vessels,\" he said, adding that North America accounts for roughly 5% of the world fleet by beneficial ownership, which is still a meaningful figure although not as huge as compared to Greek, Chinese and Japanese ship owners.",
      "However, the United States has only about 0.1% of global commercial shipbuilding market share in recent years and built fewer than 10 commercial ships last year, Reddal added.",
      "While shipping analysts have said that the U.S. port fees on Chinese vessels would likely have limited impact on trade and freight rates as some shipping companies have been redeploying their fleets to avoid the extra charge, shipping data provider Alphaliner warned last month in a report that the U.S. port fees could still cost up to $3.2 billion next year for the world's top 10 carriers.",

    "story": [
      "Hillary Clinton and Condoleezza Rice on Friday praised the Trump administration's success in reaching a Middle East peace deal. Both of the former secretaries of state are still cautiously watching to see how the early phases play out but expressed some optimism about its prospects.",
      "Clinton and Rice joined CBS News 24/7 for a live interview with CBS News senior correspondent Norah O'Donnell to discuss the Israel-Hamas peace plan brokered by President Trump as the first stage of the deal takes shape.",
      "The conversation took place two days after the signing of a landmark deal in which Hamas agreed to release all remaining hostages taken on Oct. 7, 2023, and Israel pledged to withdraw its military from parts of the Gaza Strip. Mr. Trump has called the deal the \"first phase\" of a comprehensive 20-point plan to end the two-year-long Israel-Hamas war. The president plans to travel to the Middle East as soon as this weekend, and said he hopes to be present for the return of the hostages.",
      "\"I really commend President Trump and his administration, as well as Arab leaders in the region for making the commitment to the 20-point plan and seeing a path forward for what's often called the day after,\" Clinton told O'Donnell.",
      "O'Donnell asked Rice if she is confident this is the end of the war.",
      "\"No one can be completely confident, given the history of the Middle East,\" Rice replied, but she added that there are good reasons to be optimistic.",
      "Rice and Clinton both said the Israelis and Palestinians must get through this first phase of the deal \u2014 and that still isn't certain.",
      "\"That's not self-evident,\" Clinton said. It's going to take a lot of work. It's going to take a lot of coordination.\"",
      "One of the difficulties in achieving a lasting peace in the Middle East is getting various parties on board, but the fact that there's a broader coalition of Middle Eastern states involved in this agreement is a good sign, Rice said.",
      "\"The one piece that I'm most concerned about is, how do you get from a kind of transitional authority of some kind, a truly representative Palestinian authority?\" Rice asked. \"The Palestinian authority, which controls the West Bank, lost control of Gaza after 2006, has not really been reformed in a long time. And it needs reform. It needs younger blood.\"",
      "Clinton called Israel's attack on Hamas leaders in Qatar's capital of Doha in September \"ill-advised\" and a \"strategic error\" that gave Mr. Trump's negotiators an opening.",
      "\"That provided an opening for both President Trump and his representatives to marshal all of the regional powers, including, of course, Qatar, but also to make it clear to Israel, 'No, this is now enough. We cannot continue this. This conflict needs to end, and we've got to move on.'\"",
      "Clinton said of U.S. negotiators, \"They took advantage of an opening that was available and were able to be successful.\"",
      "Rice suggested a two-state solution isn't likely to be feasible right now, but she said there are things the Palestinians can do to prepare for a future state. Palestinians are going to need to insist on reforms themselves, she said.",
      "\"They've got to start to recognize that Israel is going to exist, and it's going to be a part of this Middle East,\" Rice said. \"And that means, change the lessons that you teach your kids about the state of Israel. Stop putting up maps that (say) the state of Israel doesn't exist. Don't create another generation of Palestinians who believe that somehow the resistance is the way to peace and security.\"",
      "Clinton said the Israeli settlement activity in the West Bank that has been encouraged by the Israeli government \"has to cease.\"",
      "She said the work of rebuilding Gaza will be arduous, laborious and intensive, and she called on the U.S. and international community to commit together to bring peace to the Middle East.",
      "\"Let's now support this process and bring it together, not just in a nonpartisan way in our own country, but literally internationally as a great global commitment to try to bring peace, security, stability and a better future to the Middle East,\" Clinton said.",
      "The deal is expected to allow dozens of hostages to return to their families on Monday or Tuesday, ending a two-year ordeal that began with Hamas' attack on southern Israel. It would also offer a reprieve to millions of residents of the Gaza Strip who have faced an intense and nearly uninterrupted two-year bombardment and ground invasion by Israel's military.",
      "Some questions remain, however. Mr. Trump's 20-point peace plan calls for Israel to withdraw from much of the Gaza Strip in phases, but the exact cadence of those withdrawals isn't clear. It also calls for control of Gaza to be handed over to a still-unformed \"technocratic\" committee that does not include Hamas and \u2014 at least for now \u2014 also leaves out the Palestinian Authority. The deal recognizes an independent Palestinian state as \"the aspiration of the Palestinian people,\" but it's unclear if or when discussions on statehood could take place.",
      "The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has vexed every U.S. administration in recent history \u2014 including the two that Friday's guests worked in. Clinton pressed for a two-state solution\u00a0 \u2014 but Obama struggled with a chilly relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a period that also saw two smaller wars in Gaza. Rice also championed a two-state solution and made extensive efforts in the last years of the Bush administration to help negotiate peace.",
      "But in part because then-Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and then-Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas were each short on the political support necessary to make a lasting deal, the conflict continued. One common critique of past administrations is that they have not made sufficient use of U.S. leverage over Israel, to pressure it to make concessions. Pressure on the Netanyahu government from President Trump appears to have been a critical factor in bringing about this peace deal now."

    "summary": "With the countdown underway for the release of Israeli hostages under President Trump's peace plan, Yehuda Cohen reflected on his son's years in captivity.",
    "story": [
      "As a 72-hour countdown began Friday for the release of Israeli hostages held in Gaza, Yehuda Cohen is preparing for a reunion with his 21-year-old son, Nimrod.",
      "Cohen's son, an Israeli soldier, was captured by Hamas and taken hostage near the Gaza border on Oct. 7, 2023, when he was just 19 years old. Now, with the formal approval of the first phase of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire and hostage release deal, Cohen is hopeful he'll see his son again soon.",
      "\"We started the count, the 72 hours, we are on the third hour and we are waiting, probably will take another two days but we're waiting for getting the exact time and where to come and meet Nimrod finally,\" Cohen said Friday on \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "The Israeli military said a ceasefire went into effect at noon local time as part of\u00a0President Trump's peace plan\u00a0to end the war in Gaza. U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff said Friday that Israeli troops had finished their initial withdrawal from parts of Gaza under the first phase of the plan, starting the countdown for Hamas to release all remaining Israeli hostages.",
      "An Israeli official told CBS News that Hamas would release all of the remaining hostages by noon local time Monday. Israeli officials say 48 hostages are still in Gaza, including 20 who are believed to be alive.",
      "It's too early to celebrate, said Cohen, adding: \"But the champagne time will come.\"",
      "Cohen said Israeli officials have provided no information about his son's condition after two years in captivity. Instead, families are being briefed on logistics, where the hostages will be taken, which hospitals will receive them and who will be allowed nearby in the first hours and days.",
      "\"We don't know exactly in what condition, after two years, he will come out,\" Cohen said. \"This is a big void. We want to get to that point and start rehabilitation.\"",
      "Cohen said his wife, Vicky, will be the first to embrace their son. Beyond that moment, he said, there is no script.",
      "\"It's not something you are rehearsing to. It's not a play. It's not show. This is reality. And we're waiting for that moment of reality. Of course, it's going to be an intimate one,\" Cohen said.",
      "When asked about his son, Cohen described him as an ordinary young man.",
      "\"The best thing about my son is that he's my son,\" Cohen said. \"He's a normal boy like every other boy. For me, he's special like his brother, sister. We are a normal family. We are a warm, normal family, and we want to get back to being a warm, normal family.\"",
      "For two years, Cohen said, he and his family have advocated for Nimrod's release across Israel and abroad. Cohen directed sharp criticism at Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, calling him \"the main obstacle\" to securing hostage releases.",
      "\"Once President Trump put the heel on him and forced him to accept the 22-point plan, it went through,\" Cohen said. \"Netanyahu was sabotaging the deals all along the way.\"",
      "But Netanyahu has denied that any other full hostage release plans were ever available, saying in a televised address on Friday that the recent peace deal only came together after pressure was put on Hamas. \"Anyone who claims that this hostage deal was always on the table is simply not telling the truth. Hamas never agreed to release all the hostages while we remained deep inside the Strip. It agreed only when the sword was on its neck, and that sword is still there.\"",
      "Cohen accused Netanyahu of ignoring warnings before Hamas carried out its Oct. 7 attack and then using the subsequent war to avoid responsibility. Even with his son's return imminent, Cohen said Israelis must hold their leader accountable.",
      "\"People will ask now that your son is being released, why are you dealing with Netanyahu? Well, because first of all, he's the one to blame, and second, if we don't want this thing happening again, we, the Israeli nation, has to do everything to get rid of this horrible man,\" Cohen said.",
      "Netanyahu has repeatedly defied his critics,\u00a0claiming in March 2024 remarks\u00a0that a majority of Israelis \"support the action that we're taking to destroy the remaining terrorist battalions of Hamas.\"",
      "As part of the deal outlined by Trump, Israel will release dozens of Palestinian prisoners in exchange for the Israeli hostages and allow the immediate provision of aid to Gaza, which has faced severe food shortages and has fallen into famine in some regions, according to the world's leading authority on food crises."

    "summary": "One bright spot is green sea turtles, which have recovered substantially, the IUCN said as it released its latest Red List of Threatened Species.",
    "story": [
      "Arctic seals are being pushed closer to extinction by climate change and more than half of bird species around the world are declining under pressure from deforestation and agricultural expansion, according to an annual assessment from the International Union for Conservation of Nature.",
      "One bright spot is green sea turtles, which have recovered substantially thanks to decades of conservation efforts, the IUCN said Friday as it released its latest Red List of Threatened Species.",
      "While many animals are increasingly at risk of disappearing forever, the updated list shows how species can come back from the brink with dedicated effort, Rima Jabado, deputy chair of the IUCN Species Survival Commission, told The Associated Press.",
      "\"Hope and concern go hand in hand in this work,\" Jabado wrote by email. \"The same persistence that brought back the green sea turtle can be mirrored in small, everyday actions \u2014 supporting sustainable choices, backing conservation initiatives, and urging leaders to follow through on their environmental promises.\"",
      "The list is updated every year by teams of scientists assessing data on creatures around the world. The scope of the work is enormous and important for science, said Andrew Farnsworth, a visiting scientist at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology who studies bird migration and wasn't involved with the IUCN report.",
      "\"Every time one is done and every time there's revision, there's more information, and there's more ability to answer questions\" on species, some of which are still largely a mystery to researchers, Farnsworth said.",
      "Sea ice loss",
      "Because all the marine mammals native to the Arctic \u2014 seals, whales and polar bears \u2014 rely on the habitat provided by sea ice, they're all at risk as it diminishes because of human-caused climate change, said Kit Kovacs, co-chair of IUCN's Species Survival Commission Pinniped Specialist Group, which focuses on seals.",
      "The three species highlighted in the latest IUCN report \u2014 harp, hooded and bearded seals \u2014 have been moved up to a designation of greater concern in the latest update, indicating they are increasingly threatened by extinction, Kovacs said.",
      "The same melting of glaciers and sea ice destroying seal habitats also \"generally will bring escalation in extreme weather events, which are already impacting people around the globe,\" wrote Kovacs.",
      "\"Acting to help seals is acting to help humanity when it comes to climate change,\" Kovacs said.",
      "Global bird decline",
      "The update also highlighted Madagascar, West Africa and Central America, where Schlegel's asity, the black-casqued hornbill and the tail-bobbing northern nightingale-wren were all moved to near-threatened status. Those are three specific birds in trouble, but numbers are dropping for around three-fifths of birds globally.",
      "\"That three in five of the world's bird species have declining populations shows how deep the biodiversity crisis has become and how urgent it is that governments take the actions they have committed to under multiple conventions and agreements,\" said Ian Burfield, global science coordinator at BirdLife International.",
      "Deforestation of tropical forests is one of a \"depressing litany of threats\" to birds, a list that includes agricultural expansion and intensification, competition from invasive species and climate change, said Stuart Butchart, chief scientist at BirdLife International.",
      "\"The fact that 61% of the world's birds are declining is an alarm bell that we can't afford to ignore,\" Butchart said.",
      "The annual U.N. climate summit will be held in November in Belem, Brazil, with much attention on the Amazon and the value of tropical forests to humans and animals. But Farnsworth, of Cornell, said he was \"not so confident\" that world's leaders would take decisive action to protect imperiled bird species.",
      "\"I would like to think things like birds are nonpartisan, and you can find common ground,\" he said. \"But it's not easy.\"",
      "Green sea turtles",
      "One success story is the rebound of green sea turtles in many parts of the world's oceans. Experts see that as a bright spot because it shows how effective human interventions, like legal protections and conservation programs, can be.",
      "Still, \"it's important to note that conservation efforts of sea turtles can take decades before you realize the fruits of that labor,\" said Justin Perrault, vice president of research at Loggerhead Marinelife Center in Juno Beach, Florida, who wasn't involved with the IUCN report.",
      "The overall success with green sea turtles should be celebrated and used as an example with other species, some of which, like hawksbills and leatherbacks, aren't doing nearly as well, said Nicolas Pilcher, executive director of the Marine Research Foundation.",
      "And even for green sea turtles, areas still remain where climate change and other factors like erosion are damaging habitats, Pilcher said, and some of those are poorer communities that receive less conservation funding.",
      "But in the places where they have recovered, it's \"a great story of, actually, we can do something about this,\" Pilcher said. \"We can. We can make a difference.\"",
      "Extinct species",
      "The latest Red List notes that six species have moved to the extinct category. The IUCN says those species include the Christmas Island shrew and the slender-billed curlew, a migratory shorebird.",

      "In the 2016 op-ed, Aniston slammed the media for defining \"a woman\u2019s value based on her marital and maternal status,\" saying she and her husband at the time, Justin Theroux, were being \"harassed by dozens of aggressive photographers staked outside our home\" trying to snap a photo of her and \"uncover whether or not I am pregnant (for the bajillionth time... but who\u2019s counting).\"",

      "Certain portions of the day went far less smoothly. Xinis upbraided the Trump administration for its failure to produce a witness for the court to testify about what steps it had taken to facilitate Abrego Garcia's deportation to a third country, describing the official who appeared on the stand as a witness \"who knows less than nothing\" about the case, and the countries they are considering removing him to.",

      "Still, the hearing was much more notable for what it failed to produce than what it did. Judge Xinis struggled to clarify seemingly contradictory statements and testimony from Trump officials, including what countries agreed or did not agree to accept Abrego Garcia, and when.",

      "But they mistakenly represented the positions of both Ghana and Eswatini. As of this writing, none of the three governments mentioned agreed to accept Abrego Garcia.",

      "Democratic leaders have responded with outrage and indignation to Trump's attempts to send federal troops to their jurisdictions. Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson established \"ICE-free zones\" across Chicago to prevent federal agents from using any city-owned property in their ongoing operations. Conservative critics have compared this action and similar opposition to the Trump administration from Democratic leaders to attempts to nullify federal law, hearkening back to the 19th century.",

      "Joshua Blackman, South Texas College of Law professor, said the federal government does not need permission from states to defend federal facilities. The Trump administration's position is that it needs to deploy the National Guard to protect federal personnel and Immigration and Customs Enforcement buildings.",
      "\"This is a principle that goes back to the beginning of the Republic,\" Blackman told Fox News Digital, pointing to the landmark case McCulloch v. Maryland, which found that Maryland could not tax a national bank created by Congress.",

      "During one set of oral arguments this week before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, a Trump administration lawyer argued that unrest in Portland, prompted by ICE activity, justified the deployment of about 200 National Guard soldiers.",
      "\"For months, the ICE facility in Portland and the federal law enforcement officers who work there have faced a steady stream of violence, threats of violence and harassment from violent agitators bent on impeding federal immigration enforcement,\" said Eric McArthur, arguing for the Justice Department.",

      "\"The statute lets the president make the judgment over the need. It's not clear to me that a court can second-guess it,\" Blackman said.",
      "In court papers, the Trump administration has also cited a case from 1890, Neagle v. Cunningham, which established that the president has authority under the Constitution\u2019s take care clause to \"take care\" that federal laws be carried out, including by doing what is necessary to protect those executing immigration laws.",

      "The lawsuits, which could rise to the Supreme Court, especially if the circuit courts were to rule against Trump in the coming days, could help to sharpen the dividing line between state and federal authority over law enforcement.",

      "\"Gov. Youngkin had reached out to the captains and I personally and asked how we were and how things kind of played out. And that was such a huge thing, because not even the president of my school was able to do so,\" Mullens told Fox News Digital. \"Seeing somebody who's the leader of an entire state do that and then not have my school president, who's only overseeing 2,000 people \u2026 it's hard to describe. I was so shocked, and I was grateful at the same time.\"",
      "The state of Virginia is gearing up for several consequential statewide elections later this year, including a race for the governor's seat and for attorney general. Incumbent Gov. Glenn Youngkin has reached his term limit, so Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears was handed the baton to keep the governor's mansion Republican.",

It was a finding the college subsequently contested, calling the allegations \"unsubstantiated\" in a press release the school put out at the time and sent to Fox News Digital.",
      "The issue stemmed from a transgender student who previously swam on the school's all-male swim team but wanted to switch to the all-female team following hormone therapy and other transitioning measures in the fall of 2023.",

And on-campus mental health professionals were never notified about the situation until after Mullens and others went public with the matter in a press conference. Following the press conference, Mullens and her teammates were denied opportunities to study abroad in locations of their choice despite good academic performance and a history of extensive extracurricular activities, according to Miyares' findings.",
      "Mullens told Fox News Digital the explanations she and other swimmers got for their denials only added confusion to the whole matter even further.",

      "In an interview with Fox News Digital, McBride discussed his role working with both Republican and Democratic governors to lead the 117-year-old organization through some of the most tumultuous periods in recent U.S. history, including the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Under his leadership, the NGA achieved record participation from all 50 states and the five inhabited U.S. territories. He has led the NGA alongside four different governors who served as chairmen: New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat; Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, a Republican; Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat; and Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, a Republican. He has advanced several bipartisan policy initiatives that have had a national impact.",

      "He explained that while politicians in Congress can get mired in political games \u2013 as evidenced by the government shutdown \u2013 governors are under tremendous pressure to get things done. The pressure to perform often helps them to focus on solutions rather than politics.",
      "\"Executives have to produce, and you have to make rapid decisions, because if you don't, things just don't get done.\"",
      "According to McBride, the NGA has thrived in some of the most difficult circumstances. He said that the pandemic was a real turning point for bringing governors of both parties to the table to discuss difficult problems. During that time, the NGA convened governors weekly to coordinate strategy, share data, and engage directly with federal agencies.",
      "\"I think we did something like 67 weeks of those calls. And we get 40 to 45 governors on those calls. And looking back on it, we covered everything. You know, it started with what is the pandemic? You know what caused this virus? Then we talked about vaccines and getting vaccines and testing equipment and supplies and just all the challenges that the governors were facing,\" he said. \"It really brought the group very close together. And it wasn't just the weekly calls we were having, because then they started calling each other individually and trading information. So, it was a huge resource for the governors.\"",

      "McBride lamented that this type of bipartisanship has become increasingly rare outside of groups like the NGA.",
      "\"I think we've gotten to a point where people are locked in different camps and they're not willing to reach across the aisle and to talk to somebody else, because maybe out of fear, maybe out stubbornness, but I think you can actually learn a lot from reaching across the aisle and getting different opinions from different people before you form your own opinions,\" he explained.",
      "The NGA was founded as the Conference of Governors in 1908 at the call of President Theodore Roosevelt. McBride explained that by staying out of politics, the NGA has been able to keep its focus on helping governors find practical policy solutions to problems that every state experiences.",
      "\"Governors are executives and have to get things done,\" he explained.\u00a0\"We deal with everything from energy, education, infrastructure, homeland security, cyber security. I could go on and on. And we have teams that work on those policy issues and work with governors' offices to help them create policy solutions.\"",
      "\"We\u2019re really a policy-driven organization, but another thing that's very important is we're bipartisan, we're not a political organization. We don\u2019t get involved in political campaigns,\" he went on.",

      "Over the past few years, data breaches targeting schools, healthcare providers, and childcare services have been making headlines, exposing sensitive personal information and leaving families vulnerable. Now, a new breach has come to light that targets a nursery chain. Kido, which operates in the U.S., U.K., China and India, has reportedly had sensitive data stolen from thousands of children. Names, photos, addresses, birthdates, parental details and even safeguarding notes and medical records were allegedly accessed by a hacker group called Radiant.",

      "The incident highlights how stolen data threatens not just privacy but also long-term child safety. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you need to know about nursery breach",
      "According to reports, the hacker group Radiant claims to have stolen data related to around 8,000 children. To prove possession, they posted samples, including pictures and profiles of ten children, on a darknet website. They then issued a ransom demand, threatening to release more sensitive information unless Kido paid. In addition to targeting the nursery chain directly, Radiant reportedly called some of the children's parents, pressuring them to push Kido into paying the ransom.",
      "FBI WARNS ABOUT NEW EXTORTION SCAM TARGETING SENSITIVE DATA",
      "When questioned about their actions, the group defended their tactics as a form of \"penetration testing\" for which they supposedly deserved compensation. This defense is misleading, as such testing requires explicit permission from the organization being targeted or participation in an official bug bounty program. Without that consent, these actions are illegal and deeply unethical.",
      "Hackers exploited children\u2019s data in the Kido breach, exposing families to serious risks. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why is this attack so disturbing?",
      "The Kido breach is alarming for multiple reasons. First, it involves children's data, which is particularly sensitive and legally protected in most countries. Second, the attackers combined traditional data theft with intimidation tactics, reaching out to parents directly. History suggests that once criminals gain access to such information, the attacks can escalate.",
      "Breaches like this highlight how personal and digital security are intertwined. The potential misuse of data extends beyond simple identity theft. It can impact children's safety, family privacy and long-term well-being. With attackers leveraging both the stolen data and psychological pressure on parents, the threat is particularly potent and long-lasting.",

      "7 steps parents can take to protect their child's data",
      "Even though the investigation into the Kido breach is ongoing, parents and schools can take immediate action to protect children's data and reduce the risk of further exploitation. Here's a detailed guide:",
      "Log in to email, school portals and cloud storage accounts linked to your child. Look for unusual activity such as unrecognized logins, changes to passwords or new connected devices. Set up notifications for account activity whenever possible so you are alerted instantly if something suspicious happens.",
      "Adding\u00a02FA creates an extra layer of security. Even if a hacker has a password, they won't be able to access the account without the second verification step. Most email providers, school portals and messaging platforms support this, and it's a simple step that dramatically improves security.",
      "Data broker sites often collect names, addresses and other personal details that hackers can use. Services that remove your child's information from these databases can make it harder for attackers to find and exploit sensitive data.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.

      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices.

      "Kurt 'The CyberGuy' Knutsson shares practical ways to avoid falling victim to AI-generated phishing scams and discusses a report that North Korean agents are posing as I.T. workers to funnel money into the country's nuclear program.",
      "Cybercriminals are getting smarter every day, and one of their most convincing tricks is disguising phishing emails to look like they're coming from people you trust. Work emails are particularly dangerous because they lower your guard. After all, if the sender is your boss or IT department, why would you suspect anything? Unfortunately, scammers know this and use it to their advantage. I recently received an email from Krysti from Rockwall, Texas, who highlighted a similar issue.",
      "\"I received a spam email from my employer's email. It had a document attached to it. I tried to open it and could not. I contacted my employer and they told me they hadn't sent me anything. I changed my password and ran a virus scan. I also have been checking on the dark web for anything coming up on me. So far everything is okay. I did sign up for antivirus software based on your recommendation and we are signed up for identity theft protection. Is there anything else I should do?\"",
      "Incidents like this are more common than many realize, Krysti. And while it sounds like you took the right first steps by changing your password, scanning for malware and monitoring for identity misuse, there are a few additional precautions worth taking. A close call is often a warning sign that your digital habits might need tightening. Let's break down why these attacks are so dangerous and what everyone should do to make sure they're fully protected.",

      "Phishing emails often look like they come from someone you know, making them harder to spot. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why work email scams are so dangerous",
      "Phishing attempts that impersonate coworkers or employers are particularly effective because they rely on trust and urgency. You're more likely to open an attachment or click a link if you believe it's tied to your job. Scammers often spoof legitimate email addresses or use addresses that look almost identical to the real ones, hoping you won't notice the subtle difference.",
      "Once you interact with these emails, the risks multiply. Opening a malicious attachment could install spyware or ransomware. Clicking a fake link might lead to a login page designed to harvest your credentials. Even if nothing obvious happens right away, attackers could still be collecting background information to use in a future attack.",
      "These scams are becoming harder to spot, too. Some are powered by artificial intelligence-generated text, making them free of the usual grammar mistakes that used to be obvious red flags. Others use stolen email threads to insert themselves into ongoing conversations. That's why even seasoned professionals fall for them.",

      "Opening a fake attachment can secretly install malware or spyware on your device. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What to do immediately after a close call",
      "Changing your password or running a malware scan is often not enough to stop attackers. It's worth going a little further to make sure nothing slipped through. Start by checking your login history to see if there are any unauthorized sign-ins on your email or work accounts.",
      "Most platforms allow you to review recent activity, including device type and location, and if anything looks suspicious, sign out of all sessions immediately and change your password again. Next, enable\u00a0two-factor authentication on your email and any other critical accounts. Even if attackers manage to steal your password, they won't be able to gain access without the second verification step.",
      "It's also important to alert your IT team, especially if the email appears to come from your employer's address. This could mean the company's email system has been compromised, and notifying them will allow them to investigate and secure other accounts if necessary. Finally, make sure all your software is up to date. Malware often exploits vulnerabilities in outdated systems, so regularly updating your operating system, antivirus and productivity tools adds another layer of protection against future attacks.",

      "Work email scams are rising, and even experienced professionals can get fooled. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "7 ways to check if your device or data is compromised",
      "Some cyber threats don't reveal themselves immediately. Scammers often collect small bits of data over time or wait weeks before trying to use what they've stolen. The following steps are actions anyone can take to make sure their device and personal data remain secure, and to catch any signs of compromise before they turn into serious problems.",
      "1) Consider a personal data removal service",
      "The more personal information about you that's publicly available, the easier it is for scammers to target you. Data removal services can help by scanning hundreds of data broker websites and removing your details from them. Reducing this digital footprint not only makes it harder for attackers to build profiles on you but also limits how easily phishing attempts can be tailored to your life.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0 These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "HOW FAKE MICROSOFT ALERTS TRICK YOU INTO PHISHING SCAMS",
      "Your information could already be circulating in breach dumps and underground markets without you realizing it. Identity protection services monitor known dark-web sources, forums and leak sites for your email, phone, SSN and other sensitive details. If they find a match, they alert you so you can act quickly: change passwords, turn on two-factor authentication, and place fraud alerts or credit freezes with the credit bureaus.",
      "Your information might already be circulating in dark web marketplaces without you realizing it. Identity theft protection services can help by continuously scanning those underground sites for your email, passwords or other sensitive details. If your data does show up, these services notify you right away so you can reset credentials, freeze accounts or take other protective actions before the information is misused.",
      "See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Even if you never shared payment details, attackers may attempt account takeovers or fraudulent transactions using any information they have. Review your bank, credit card and online account statements frequently for unusual activity. Pairing this habit with identity theft protection tools gives you an added safety net, as they often include financial monitoring and fraud alerts to catch problems quickly.",
      "Email accounts are often the central hub for many other services. If your inbox is compromised, attackers might try to break into linked accounts such as cloud storage, messaging apps or collaboration tools. Check each of these services for unfamiliar logins, permission changes or device activity, and secure them by changing passwords and enabling two-factor authentication.",
      "Weak or reused passwords are one of the easiest ways for attackers to break into accounts after a breach. A password manager solves this by generating and storing strong, unique passwords for every site you use. It also acts as a passive phishing detector. If the tool doesn't autofill a login form, that's a sign the page could be fake. Over time, this significantly reduces your risk of falling victim to credential-based attacks.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Modern cyber threats go beyond viruses. A strong antivirus solution now acts as a full security layer, blocking phishing websites, detecting malicious scripts and stopping suspicious activity before it can compromise your device. If you've interacted with a suspicious attachment or link, a reputable antivirus tool can catch malware that might still be hiding in the background.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",

      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Close calls like this are unsettling, but they are also valuable wake-up calls. Cybercriminals are constantly refining their tactics, and phishing emails that once looked laughably fake can now be nearly indistinguishable from the real thing. The key is to build layers of defense, not just reactive steps after an incident, but proactive habits that make you a harder target in the first place.",

      "Paradromics is shifting from research to clinical trials.",
      "When someone stops breathing, the clock starts ticking. First responders often need to get air into the lungs fast, and one of the most reliable ways is to slide a tube into the windpipe. This process, called intubation, keeps the airway open so that oxygen can flow again.",
      "Here's the catch: intubation is incredibly hard. Even trained doctors can struggle, and every extra second puts the patient at greater risk. Now, researchers at UC Santa Barbara have designed a soft robotic device that could change how first responders handle these emergencies.

      "Why breathing tubes are so tough to place",
      "Our bodies are built to keep food and foreign objects out of the lungs. A small flap called the epiglottis blocks the windpipe during swallowing, and the path into the trachea is narrow and curved. To get around these obstacles, current tools are rigid. Medics have to lift the epiglottis with a metal scope and carefully angle the tube forward. If it slips into the esophagus instead, oxygen goes to the stomach instead of the lungs.\u00a0\"Traditional tools must be stiff so you can push them, and they only turn by pressing on sensitive tissue,\" explained Elliot Hawkes, professor of mechanical engineering at UCSB.",

      "How the soft robot works",
      "The new system, called the soft robotic intubation system (SRIS), takes a gentler approach. First, a curved guide sits at the back of the throat. Then a soft inflatable tube slowly unrolls from the inside out as it advances. Instead of being forced in, it naturally follows the right path into the windpipe. This reduces friction, lowers the risk of injury and adapts to different body shapes automatically.\u00a0\"This growing paradigm naturally accounts for minor variations in anatomy,\" said lead author David Haggerty, a recent UCSB Ph.D. graduate.",

Fraudsters pose as attorneys, debt collectors and estate service providers, each demanding the immediate payment of made-up fees.

      "There are four common types of inheritance traps that use probate records as sources for their fraudulent claims:",
      "The fake fee scam: Just like the\u00a0DMV notice scam that claims the recipient has unpaid toll fees, scammers use probate data to pose as attorneys or court officials, claiming heirs owe fees to release inheritance funds. They create urgency with threats of legal action or frozen assets, demanding payment via wire transfer or gift cards.",
      "The fake debt collector: Fraudsters send texts or make AI-generated voice calls, claiming that the deceased person owed debts that have to be settled immediately. They often have enough information from probate records to sound legitimate, pressuring families to pay non-existent debts.",
      "The fake estate service: Scams that offer seemingly helpful services like \"property appraisals,\" \"finding hidden assets,\" or \"estate clean-out services\" can look like they offer reasonable deals. Some take payment and disappear\u2014others perform unnecessary services that families never requested.",
      "Cyberguy lays out ways to avoid inheritance scams. (Cyberguy.com)",
      "The \"advanced fee\" gift: Anyone who promises to expedite probate proceedings or secure larger inheritances for an upfront fee is probably in it to win it (for themselves). Some cases even involve disgruntled family members acting out of greed. These are not your run-of-the-mill remote scammers from a foreign country; these can be local \"facilitators\" who have no actual authority and simply pocket the money. If someone claims you have an inheritance coming, but they need \"a fee to unlock it\" or they promise to \"handle your probate case\" for a small upfront fee, you guessed it \u2014 nothing ever comes from it.",
      "Why probate scams work",
      "Grief is a beacon for fraudsters. With grief comes diminished critical thinking from even the hardiest of privacy diehards. Scammers deliberately strike during this window when defenses are low. A scammer who can reference your personal information, family information or property details doesn't sound like a criminal, they sound like a legitimate professional. Scams often use the weapon of urgency \u2014 you have to purportedly act fast to avoid asset seizures, legal penalties or missed deadlines. When something demands immediate action, victims feel compelled to respond before verifying claims or consulting attorneys, which is exactly what fraudsters count on.",

      "How to protect yourself against the inheritance trap",
      "The good news is that with awareness and a few smart steps, you can lower your risk of falling victim to inheritance scams.",
      "Never send money or give information to an unsolicited contact about an estate. If someone claims you owe fees or have obligations, independently verify their identity or company. Contact the probate court directly using publicly listed numbers, not information provided by the caller. Ask your estate attorney about any claims before making payments.",
      "In most jurisdictions, you can't prevent a probate filing from going public. But you can minimize additional data exposure by not sharing anything on social media and limiting contact to only key parties that you trust with financial information.",
      "Data removal services specialize in removing personal information from data broker sites that scammers use to supplement probate data. Personal information combined with probate records create the perfect setup for inheritance traps\u2014scammers can make super-convincing, alarmist content that can bypass your intuition about scams, especially during times of grief.",

      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0 By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Ensure elderly relatives or those less familiar with scam tactics understand these risks. Scammers often target multiple heirs, seeking the most vulnerable respondent.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "The probate system creates a privacy trade-off. You can't prevent much of this information from entering the public record, but you can control how you respond, and how much personal data is out there. Any probate topics should come through official court channels, and never an unsolicited phone call, email or text message. When in doubt, verify with your probate court, and always consult your estate attorney. With a little vigilance and a bit of data cleanup, you can ensure that the probate process doesn't put you in harm's way, during the time when you're at your most vulnerable.",

      "Automotive giant Stellantis has just revealed that it suffered a data breach, exposing customer contact details, after attackers infiltrated a third-party platform used for North American customer services. The announcement comes at a time when large-scale attacks on cloud CRM systems have already shaken tech and retail sectors alike, with Salesforce clients such as Google, Allianz and Dior reporting similar intrusions. These earlier incidents exposed names, emails and phone numbers, which were sufficient for attackers to launch phishing campaigns or extortion attempts.",

      "What you need to know about the Stellantis breach",
      "Stellantis was formed in 2021 through the merger of the PSA Group and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. Today, it ranks among the world's largest automakers by revenue and is fifth in volume globally. The company houses 14 well-known brands, including Jeep and Dodge, as well as Peugeot, Maserati and Vauxhall, and operates manufacturing infrastructure across more than 130 countries. That global scale naturally makes it a tempting target for cyber adversaries.",
      "Stellantis confirmed hackers stole customer contact details in a recent breach. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "In its public statement, Stellantis clarified that only contact information was taken. Since the compromised third-party platform does not host financial or deeply sensitive personal data, Stellantis asserts that Social Security numbers, payment details and health records were out of reach of the attackers. In response, the company activated its incident response protocols, launched a full investigation, contained the breach, notified authorities and began alerting affected customers. It also issued warnings about phishing and urged customers not to click suspicious links.",
      "Stellantis has not revealed how many customers the breach affected. The company also has not specified which contact fields, such as email, phone, or address, attackers accessed.",
      "The alleged culprit, ShinyHunters, and Salesforce breaches",
      "While Stellantis has not explicitly named the hacker group behind the breach, multiple sources tie this incident to the ShinyHunters extortion campaign, which has spearheaded a wave of data thefts targeting Salesforce this year.",
      "ShinyHunters claims to have stolen over 18 million records from Stellantis' Salesforce instance, which includes names and contact details, according to Bleeping Computer. These attacks form part of a broader campaign aimed at Salesforce customers. In recent months, ShinyHunters has often worked in concert with groups like Scattered Spider and targeted companies including Google, Cisco, Adidas, Allianz Life, Qantas and brands under LVMH such as Dior and Tiffany & Co.",

      "The attack is linked to a wider wave of Salesforce data thefts this year. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Their reported method is fairly ingenious. Attackers exploit OAuth tokens tied to integrations like Salesloft's Drift AI chat tool to pivot into Salesforce environments. Once inside, they can harvest valuable metadata, credentials, AWS keys, Snowflake tokens and more.",
      "In fact, the FBI recently issued a Flash alert that surfaced numerous indicators of compromise linked to these Salesforce environment attacks and warned organizations to harden defenses. The cumulative toll is staggering. ShinyHunters asserts it has stolen over 1.5 billion Salesforce records across some 760 companies.",
      "7 ways to protect yourself from breaches like Stellantis",
      "Even if only contact details were exposed, that's enough for attackers to target you. Here's how to stay protected.",
      "Even basic contact details can be scraped from breaches and sold on data broker platforms, where they are used for spam, scams and targeted attacks.

      "Stolen emails and phone numbers could fuel phishing campaigns. (REUTERS /Rebecca Cook)",
      "The most immediate risk after a breach like this is targeted phishing. Attackers now have legitimate contact details, so their emails and texts can look convincingly real. Be skeptical of any message claiming to be from Stellantis, your car brand or a related service, especially if it urges you to click a link, download an attachment or share personal details.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "If attackers get your contact information, they may try the same password on other sites. This is called credential stuffing. A password manager can create strong, unique passwords for every account. That way, one breach will not put your other accounts at risk. It also helps you quickly update credentials in case you suspect a compromise.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",

      "2FA adds an extra step to your logins by requiring a temporary code or approval in addition to your password. Even if attackers manage to steal your password, they will need that second factor to gain access. This significantly reduces the chances of account takeover attempts succeeding.",
      "Attackers often combine exposed contact information with other data to build complete identity profiles. Identity theft protection services monitor for suspicious activity, such as unauthorized credit applications or changes to official records, and alert you early so you can act before serious damage occurs. Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number (SSN), phone number and email address, and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.\u00a0They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at CyberGuy.com.",
      "After a breach, it is worth auditing your accounts, not just with Stellantis but also with related services such as financing portals, insurance accounts or loyalty programs. Look for unusual sign-ins, unfamiliar devices, or changes to your personal details. Most services offer tools to review login history and security events, making checking these a routine habit.",

      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Even giants in manufacturing are vulnerable when cloud platforms and third-party systems are part of their customer workflow. The same patterns seen in attacks on Google, LVMH and others have now reached the auto industry in a serious way. As Stellantis confronts the fallout, the broader lesson is clear. Organizations must treat the surfaces exposed by their service providers and SaaS integrations with as much vigilance as their own core systems.",

      "WHY IPHONE USERS ARE THE NEW PRIME SCAM TARGETS",
      "Mac malware often hides in the background, making it hard to spot at first. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Signs your Mac might be infected",
      "Spotting malware on macOS is not always straightforward. Many threats are designed to stay hidden, running quietly in the background while collecting data or opening a backdoor for attackers. Still, there are a few red flags that usually signal something is wrong.",
      "One of the first signs is slower performance or frequent overheating. If your Mac suddenly takes a long time to boot, runs hot during light tasks or lags when performing simple actions, it might be doing more behind the scenes than you realize. Apps that crash or freeze more often than usual are another warning sign. Occasional app failures are normal, but if built-in tools like Safari, Notes or Mail begin acting unstable, it may point to malicious interference.",
      "It is also worth paying attention to what is happening under the hood. Checking Activity Monitor for unknown processes or unusually high CPU or memory usage can reveal malware that tries to hide itself with random or unfamiliar names. Redirected web traffic is another classic symptom. If your browser takes you to strange websites, shows pop-ups, or installs new extensions you never approved, adware or spyware might already be present.",
      "Finally, unexplained changes to your security settings should always raise suspicion. If you notice your firewall turned off, privacy permissions modified, or login items appearing without your knowledge, something could have gained unauthorized control of your system.",
      "SHAMOS MALWARE TRICKS MAC USERS WITH FAKE FIXES",
      "Strange app behavior, pop-ups or overheating may signal something\u2019s wrong. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How macOS protects you by default",
      "Apple has built several layers of defense into macOS, many of which run silently in the background to keep your system secure. Knowing how they work can help you understand what protections are already in place and where you might still need to add more safeguards.",
      "Gatekeeper is one of the most important built-in security tools. It checks every app before it runs to make sure it comes from a verified developer, warning or blocking you if the app is not trusted. Another layer of defense is XProtect, Apple's built-in malware scanner. It updates automatically and can stop many known threats from running, although it is not as thorough as specialized antivirus software.",
      "System Integrity Protection, or SIP, is another important safeguard. It locks down critical system files and processes so that malware cannot tamper with them even if it gains access. macOS also uses sandboxing and strict permission controls to contain threats. Apps run in isolated environments and must explicitly request permission to access sensitive data such as your camera, files, or location.",
      "Together, these features make it significantly harder for malicious software to infect your Mac or cause serious damage. However, they are not perfect. Attackers are constantly developing new techniques to bypass these protections, and many threats rely on human error rather than technical exploits. That is why taking additional precautions is still essential, even on a Mac.",
      "10 WAYS TO SECURE YOUR OLDER MAC FROM THREATS AND MALWARE",
      "Even Apple\u2019s built-in protections can miss new or advanced threats. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What to do if your Mac is already infected",
      "If you find yourself dealing with a Mac that's already compromised, these steps can help you get back in control:",
      "Unplug Ethernet or turn off Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. This prevents malware from sending more data out or pulling in additional malicious code.",
      "Use an external drive or cloud service you trust. Avoid copying entire system folders \u2013 just grab personal documents, photos and files you can't replace. You don't want to back up the malware along with them.",
      "Restart your Mac and hold the Shift key. Safe Mode prevents some malware from launching and makes it easier to run cleanup tools.",
      "While macOS includes XProtect, you may need something more powerful. A strong antivirus program can detect and remove infections. Run a full system scan to catch hidden threats.",
      "5 PHONE SETTINGS TO CHANGE RIGHT NOW FOR A SAFER SMARTPHONE",
      "Review what apps are set to launch at startup and remove anything you don't recognize. If you spot unfamiliar processes hogging resources, don't just guess. Use our guides at\u00a0Cyberguy.com/LockUpYourTech to compare what's safe and learn how to shut down anything suspicious before it causes more trouble.",
      "If malware persists, wiping your system may be the only option. Erase your Mac's drive and reinstall macOS from scratch. Restore only the clean files you backed up earlier.",
      "If your iPhone, iPad or other personal devices are showing strange behavior, run security scans, update their software and reset key passwords. Malware can sometimes spread through shared Wi-Fi networks, cloud accounts or files.",
      "Even after cleanup, assume some of your data may have been exposed. Update your Apple ID, email, banking and work accounts with strong, unique passwords. Turn on\u00a02FA\u00a0wherever possible.",
      "If you're overwhelmed, you can bring your Mac to an Apple Store for in-person help at the Genius Bar, or schedule a free appointment with Apple Support.",
      "Simple steps like scanning, updating and using strong passwords can keep your data safe. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "7 ways to keep your Mac from getting infected",
      "Some cyber threats do not reveal themselves immediately. Scammers often collect small bits of data over time or wait weeks before trying to use what they have stolen. These steps can help you strengthen your defenses and reduce the chances of future infections.",
      "macOS's built-in protections are useful but basic. A strong antivirus adds an extra layer by detecting threats in real time, blocking malicious downloads and even identifying new types of malware before they spread. A strong antivirus also scans email attachments and browser activity, areas where many Mac users are most vulnerable.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com/LockUpYourTech",
      "Many cyberattacks begin with information freely available online. A data removal service scrubs your personal details from broker sites, reducing the chances of targeted attacks or identity theft. While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "GOOGLE FIXES ANOTHER CHROME SECURITY FLAW BEING ACTIVELY EXPLOITED",
      "Many malware attacks rely on stolen credentials rather than technical exploits. A password manager stores unique, complex passwords for every account and can automatically flag weak or reused ones. It also helps protect you from phishing attempts because it will only autofill passwords on legitimate websites.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager (see\u00a0Cyberguy.com/Passwords) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com/Passwords",
      "Even if someone steals your password,\u00a0two-factor authentication (2FA) makes it much harder for them to access your accounts. It adds an extra step to the login process, requiring a code from your phone or a security key.",
      "Outdated software is a common entry point for malware. Updates often patch vulnerabilities that attackers could exploit, so turning on automatic updates for both macOS and third-party apps is an easy but effective defense.",
      "Malware often tries to run at startup so it can operate undetected. Regularly check System Settings to make sure only trusted apps are launching automatically, and use Activity Monitor to investigate anything suspicious.",
      "If your personal data has already been exposed, an identity theft protection service can monitor for suspicious activity, alert you to breaches and help you recover quickly if something does go wrong. Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number (SSN), phone number and email address, and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.\u00a0They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",

      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Macs have a reputation for being safer than other computers, but that does not mean they are untouchable. Malware has evolved to target macOS more aggressively than ever and many attacks now rely on tricking users rather than breaking through security software. If your device is behaving strangely, taking action early is the best way to prevent deeper damage.",

      "\"When the government issues a digital ID, they're issuing it to the individual. That means, just like your paper ID sits in your physical wallet, your digital ID sits in your digital wallet, it's not stored at a central location,\" Eric Starr, founder and CEO of\u00a0Ultrapass Identity Corp, told Fox News Digital.",

      "When pressed about concerns relating to a government\u2019s ability to enforce mass surveillance through the ease that the technology could offer, even if that is not the original intent, Starr said it comes down to establishing those protections for personal privacy from the get-go.",

      "Starr explained that some are concerned that any time a digital ID is used, it will then alert or \"phone home\" a government tracking system \u2013 a concern that privacy advocates like the\u00a0Electronic Frontier Foundation\u00a0and the\u00a0ACLU have flagged.",
      "\"It's not about the technology, but managing fear and managing what actually gets deployed,\" he added, noting that safeguards can be put in place to counter these concerns.",
      "Even though there is no federal version of a digital ID, more than a dozen states have already begun issuing mobile driver\u2019s licenses.",
      "A federal version of a digital ID would, in theory, just include an individual\u2019s information that the government already has access to, including details like passport information.",
      "But there\u2019s another major concern people flag when it comes to digital IDs \u2013 how to ensure personal information is protected from identity theft, which has become a major concern in recent years amid mass cyber breaches.",

    "published": "Fri, 10 Oct 2025 16:36:05 GMT",
    "summary": "As the government shutdown continues, federal workers will begin to miss their paychecks, airports could see longer delays and frustration over rising insurance premiums may grow.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The government shutdown is entering its 10th day, with both Republicans and Democrats dug in and refusing to give any ground to their political foes.",
      "But the coming days and weeks will bring some key pressure points that could potentially end the partisan impasse.",
      "Until now, the impacts of the shutdown have been fairly muted, with Smithsonian museums shuttered and some government services interrupted. But Friday, hundreds of thousands of civilian federal workers will get their first paycheck since the shutdown began, reflecting zero pay for October. On Wednesday, service members will see the same.",
      "With air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration agents not getting paid, staffing shortages will likely grow worse, exacerbating flight delays and cancellations that have already frustrated travelers.",
      "On top of that, Democrats' focus on health care in the shutdown fight is starting to resonate with the public, as millions of Americans on Obamacare begin to receive notices that their insurance premiums are about to go up substantially.",
      "We\u2019d like to hear from you about how you\u2019re experiencing the government shutdown, whether you\u2019re a federal employee who can\u2019t work right now or someone who is feeling the effects of shuttered services in your everyday life.  Please contact us at tips@nbcuni.com or reach out to us here.",
      "Missed paychecks",
      "It\u2019s one thing when Americans can't access national park facilities and museums. It\u2019s another thing when millions of American families from around the country start missing paychecks and can\u2019t pay their bills.",
      "Friday marks the first time when civilian federal workers will miss getting some pay because of the shutdown that began Oct. 1. While they will receive a partial paycheck for work performed from Sept. 21-30, they will not receive any pay for the opening days of October.",
      "That includes Capitol Police officers, Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and Federal Emergency Management Agency workers.",
      "After some confusion created by the White House, congressional leaders in both parties said this week that federal workers will receive back pay once the shutdown ends. But that still doesn't help families right now who have to pay their rents or mortgages and put food on the table. Once they miss getting paid, workers are likely to amp up the pressure on lawmakers and the president, who for days has been threatening mass firings of federal employees.",
      "\u201cThat tells you everything you need to know about them. We don\u2019t share the same values,\u201d said Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., a key member of the Democratic Caucus. \u201cI mean, they want to punish workers.\u201d",
      "Asked about the threat of layoffs Thursday, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., told NBC News' \"Top Story\" that \"there is too much inefficiency in the federal government.\"",
      "\u201cThere are programs that probably should be eliminated, but we want federal employees to be protected,\u201d he said.",
      "The two sides could feel an even greater sense of urgency Oct. 15, when the 1.3 million active duty service members will miss their first full paycheck of the shutdown. Lawmakers in both parties \u2014 especially those who represent military-heavy districts \u2014 are already feeling the heat.",
      "A bill authored by Rep. Jen Kiggans, R-Va., would ensure that troops are paid during the shutdown, and has almost 150 co-sponsors, including more than 100 Republicans. But Johnson has argued that such a bill isn't needed because the stopgap bill the House passed Sept. 19 includes funding for troops.",
      "During a call-in show on C-SPAN on Thursday, a woman identified as Samantha from Fort Belvoir, Virginia, made a personal plea to Johnson, telling the speaker that if her active duty husband doesn't get paid on the 15th, \u201cmy kids could die\u201d because her family won't be able to afford their medication.",
      "Speaking at the White House on Wednesday, Trump told reporters that Democrats are to blame for the shutdown and workers missing paychecks, but he predicted that paying the troops \u201cprobably will happen.\u201d",
      "Johnson on Friday again insisted that the House will not vote on a standalone measure to pay the military. \"The Republican Party stands for paying the troops,\" he said. \"The Democrats are the ones that are demonstrating over and over and over, now eight times, that they don\u2019t want troops to be paid.\u201d",
      "Air traffic controller shortages",
      "Travelers this week got a glimpse of how air traffic controller and TSA employee shortages could wreak havoc on the nation's airports.",
      "Airports from Washington and Miami to Denver and Las Vegas were snarled by flight delays as officials said they were dealing with a slight uptick in the number of air traffic controllers calling in sick. The Hollywood Burbank Airport in the Los Angeles area operated for several hours Monday with no air traffic controllers because of staffing issues.",
      "As federal airport workers miss pay for the first time in the shutdown Friday, the number of them calling in sick could increase. Delays could get worse in the coming days, further straining the nation's air system, the economy and the patience of already frustrated travelers.",
      "Trump officials are paying close attention to the staffing issues. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy on Thursday threatened to fire \"problem children\" air traffic controllers if they don't show up for work without a good reason.",
      "But lawmakers said widespread flight delays and cancellations could force Trump and the Republicans to the negotiating table that they've avoided during the shutdown fight. Air traffic controller shortages and the travel interruptions they caused helped end the 34-day shutdown during Trump's first term \u2014 the longest in the nation's history.",
      "\"Of any of the factors that led President Trump in 2019 [to say] we got to solve this, it was the air traffic control issue,\" Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said. Reagan National Airport in his home state experienced staffing shortages and delays this week; it's one of three major airports in the area that members of Congress use to commute between Washington and home.",
      "Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said he's been watching television coverage of the flight delays and long lines at airports this week. He believes Trump has been watching the same compelling visuals, and could be motivated to do a deal if things get worse.",
      "\"Here\u2019s a guy who watches TV nonstop ... the visuals. People doing video of those long lines,\" Blumenthal explained. \u201cIt\u2019s a black eye for the country. ... It should get them to the table.\"",
      "Rising health care premiums",
      "The central demand by Democrats in the standoff is to extend expiring tax credits under Obamacare that have helped make premiums more affordable for families. And while the money technically expires Dec. 31, voters are starting to feel the sticker shock.",
      "This month, insurers are sending out notices of sharp premium hikes ahead of open enrollment beginning Nov. 1, now a little more than three weeks away.",
      "Democrats are betting that pressure will soften the GOP resistance to extending that money as part of a bill to reopen the government.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been important to raise the issue with both our colleagues and with the American public, and also to point out the urgency of the issue,\u201d Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., the author of a bill to permanently extend the Obamacare money, told NBC News.",
      "\u201cA number of people thought, well, it doesn\u2019t expire until the end of December, so it\u2019s not an issue. And didn\u2019t realize that insurance companies are setting rates right now. ... It\u2019s one more thing on top of the cost of food and electricity and rent and child care and all the other expenses that people are incurring,\u201d Shaheen continued.",
      "Johnson, however, maintained that the health care funding issue can be \u201cdiscussed and deliberated and contemplated and debated in October and November,\u201d after the government reopens. But he faces a divided conference and hasn\u2019t made any promises to hold a vote on the matter.",
      "\"I support the speaker,\" conservative Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., said.",
      "Moderate Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., said he backed the speaker's strategy, as well.",
      "\"A short, clean CR was always good in the past and should be good now,\" Bacon told NBC News. \"Most of the GOP are willing to negotiate on the tax credits as part of the appropriations process.\"",
      "But far-right Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., is publicly bashing Johnson and her party for not having a plan to address the looming premium hikes that she says will harm her own family members.",
      "\u201cWhen it comes to the point where families are spending anywhere from $1,500 to $2,000 a month and looking at hikes coming on their insurance premiums,\" Greene said, \"I think that\u2019s unforgivable.\""

      "In late September, Laurel Vincenty got a letter from Blue Cross Blue Shield informing her that the subsidies that covered a big chunk of her health insurance would be expiring at the end of the year, sending her monthly premiums soaring.",
      "Vincenty, 64, and her husband Philip Vincenty, 62, of North Carolina, are covered through the Affordable Care Act. They currently pay about $400 each month in premiums. An additional $1,700 is covered through the soon-expiring subsidies.",
      "Both Vincenty and her husband are self-employed. In 2020, she was diagnosed with breast cancer, and in 2024, Philip had a heart attack \u2014 health issues that left them with thousands of dollars in medical debt they\u2019re still paying off. Their monthly medications cost hundreds of dollars.",
      "Vincenty picked up a second job this month in anticipation of their premiums going up next year, but she said she doesn\u2019t know if it\u2019ll be enough.",
      "\u201cIt was frustrating receiving the letter,\u201d she said, \u201cknowing that we may lose our subsidies, that we don\u2019t know how we\u2019ll be able to afford our health insurance.\u201d",
      "The enhanced ACA subsidies the Vincentys are set to lose are a key sticking point in the ongoing government shutdown: Democrats in Congress say that in order to secure their votes to reopen the government, the subsidies \u2014 first included under the 2021 American Rescue Plan and later extended through 2025 in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act \u2014 must be extended.",
      "Open enrollment for ACA plans begins Nov. 1 in most states, and people already enrolled in plans are starting to get notices about next year\u2019s rates. According to an analysis from the health policy research group KFF, without the subsidies, average out-of-pocket premium payments are expected to double, from $888 a year to $1,904.",
      "Lawrence Gostin, director of the O\u2019Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown University, said the damage is already starting.",

      "The notices typically include information about the next year\u2019s coverage and premiums, though some provide more specifics than others.",
      "\u201cThat means we should expect a lot of marketplace enrollees to be receiving unpleasant news about their premiums in mid- and late-October,\u201d McIntyre said.",
      "People may have the option to switch to a plan  with lower premiums \u2014 going from a silver-tier plan to a bronze-tier plan, for example \u2014 but those switches often come with a large increase in deductibles, she said.",
      "Navigators who help people enroll in ACA plans might have been well-situated to help people work through their options, McIntyre added, but earlier this year the Trump administration cut their funding by 90% in states that use the federal HealthCare.gov platform, the online marketplace for ACA plans.",
      "More than 24 million people are enrolled in ACA plans this year, and about 9 out of 10 \u2014 22.3 million people \u2014 get enhanced subsidies, according to KFF. If the subsidies expire, almost 4 million people are expected to drop their coverage for 2026, according to an analysis from the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "Jeff Feldman, a 60-year-old musician in Phoenix, is considering dropping his coverage next year.",

      "\u201cOur records show you qualified for financial help in 2025,\u201d the letter read. \u201cIf you qualify for financial help in 2026, you\u2019ll likely pay more for your Marketplace plan premium.\u201d",
      "Feldman estimates his monthly premiums will triple \u2014 from $300 to $900, while his $9,000 yearly deductible will likely go unchanged.",
      "\u201cThey just priced me right out of the market,\u201d he said. \u201cI have two jobs, and I\u2019m going to start driving for Uber and Lyft just to get some extra money. And even with that, I can\u2019t afford $900 a month.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 John Bolton, a former national security adviser to President Donald Trump turned prominent Trump critic, is expected to be charged with federal crimes soon, according to two federal officials with knowledge of the investigation.",
      "One of the officials said Bolton could be indicted next week. The other said he could be indicted soon.",
      "The charges would be brought by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in Maryland, where Bolton lives, the officials said. The development was first reported by MSNBC.",
      "Bolton\u2019s lawyer, Abbe Lowell, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "A spokesman for the Department of Justice declined to discuss matters related to a grand jury.",
      "\u201cAs a matter of law, we will not discuss any grand jury matters with the media, but this Justice Department is united as one team in our mission to make America safe again,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cAnd the Attorney General, Deputy Attorney General, along with the entire team at Main Justice continue to empower our US Attorneys to pursue justice in every case.\u201d",
      "The FBI conducted searches of Bolton\u2019s Maryland home and his Washington, D.C., office in August. A source familiar with the matter told NBC News at the time that the searches were part of a \u201cnational security investigation in search of classified records.\u201d",
      "Lowell, Bolton\u2019s lawyer, has repeatedly said that documents with classified markings kept by Bolton dated back to the George W. Bush administration, when Bolton served as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, and would be typical of those kept by a long-time government employee.",
      "CIA information prompted searches",
      "CIA Director John Ratcliffe provided intelligence to FBI Director Kash Patel that was the basis for the search warrant, the source said. Bolton served as one of Trump\u2019s national security advisers in his first term before a contentious exit.",
      "The searches were focused on Bolton\u2019s handling of classified materials and potential instances of such documents being used in leaks to news media, the source said at the time. They added that it was related to a criminal investigation that began during the Biden administration.",
      "Search warrant affidavits related to the searches released last month referenced potential violations of the Espionage Act, including gathering or sharing national defense information without permission, and unauthorized possession of classified materials.",
      "Trump publicly called for Bolton to be prosecuted in June 2020 after the then-former national security adviser wrote an unflattering book about his experience working for Trump.",
      "\u201cHe released massive amounts of classified, and confidential, but classified information. That\u2019s illegal and you go to jail for that,\u201d Trump told Fox News in an interview then.",
      "Bolton maintained that he had fulfilled his legal obligations and obtained a letter from a National Security Council official in 2020 which said the book contained no classified material.",
      "Trump was indicted in 2023 on charges of mishandling top-secret documents and obstructing efforts to recover them after he left office. But federal judge Aileen Cannon, a Trump appointee, threw out the charges in 2024.",
      "Leading Trump critic",
      "Bolton has been an outspoken critic of Trump\u2019s, particularly on foreign policy involving Russia, in the years since. Bolton also continued criticizing Trump\u2019s foreign policy after the searches.",
      "Trump has repeatedly criticized Bolton as well, calling him a \u201clowlife\u201d and \u201cdumb,\u201d among other things.",
      "Days into Trump\u2019s second term, the president canceled Bolton\u2019s Secret Service detail, even though he was the target of an alleged murder-for-hire scheme by a member of Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.",
      "Bolton would be the third Trump critic to face criminal charges since late September.",
      "Former FBI Director James Comey was indicted in late September on charges of making a false statement to Congress and obstruction. New York Attorney General Letitia James was indicted on a bank fraud charge on Thursday.",
      "Both of those indictments came after a Sept. 20 post on Truth Social, where Trump urged Attorney General Pam Bondi to take action against the pair, as well as Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re all guilty as hell, but nothing is going to be done,\u201d the post said. \u201cWe can\u2019t delay any longer.\u201d",
      "An administration official told NBC News the public posting was meant to be sent to Bondi as a direct message.",
      "Comey has pleaded not guilty to the charges and James has denied wrongdoing."

These critical minerals are needed in a broad range of products, from jet engines, radar systems and electric vehicles to consumer electronics including laptops and phones.",
      "China and the U.S. have held more than three rounds of trade talks this year, with rare earths, TikTok and tariffs featuring in the discussions. After talks in Geneva in May, the administration said China had decided to ease up on rare earth export controls.",
      "In June, the two sides met again in London, where they announced yet another agreement on the issue. After those talks, the U.S. said it expected the issue to be \u201cresolved.\u201d",

      "A full-fledged trade deal with China remains elusive despite the extensive negotiations.",
      "Just as with rare earths, U.S. officials said in September that China had struck a \u201cframework for a TikTok deal.\u201d However, in the following weeks, China has not confirmed that such a deal was agreed to.",

    "story": [
      "Andy Richter is calling out online trolls who targeted his fellow Season 34 \"Dancing with the Stars\" competitor Hilaria Baldwin.",
      "Richter shared a selfie video Oct. 8 on Instagram that showed him sitting in the driver's seat of a car. At first, the 58-year-old comedian thanked fans for the \"love and good will\" they've shown him and his pro dance partner, Emma Slater, and added he was looking forward to performing the pair's salsa next week.",
      "Richter then went on to call out haters who've posted \"awful, brutal things\" about Baldwin, 41, who was eliminated on the show's Oct. 7 episode after being ranked in the bottom three contestants alongside Richter and former \"Boy Meets World\" star Danielle Fishel.",
      "\"She went home last night and that sucks. You know, nobody on that show wants anybody to go home,\" Richter said. \"Everybody there works just as hard as everybody else and they all deserve to be there.\"",
      "\"I just don't know why people have to be so mean,\" he went on, adding that he'd been on social media \"a long time\" and he knew \"what the internet is like.\"",
      "In the past, Richter admitted, he'd \"been involved in some of those pile-ons\" of negativity. \"Sometimes it's fun to say terrible s---,\" he reasoned.",
      "\"But these are people. With families and kids,\" he said. \"And these awful things that get said, they're heard by real people and they hurt real people.\"",
      "Richter laughed in disbelief while reminding fans, \"This is a dance contest.\"",
      "\"It doesn't make it satisfying to move on (to the next week round of he competition) when you see your fellow contestants being treated so sh----,\" he said.",
      "\"So, just please don't be mean,\" he concluded. \"There's enough meanness in the world and we don't need it in a ballroom dance competition.\"",
      "Baldwin, who is the wife of actor Alec Baldwin, responded to Richter's video in the comments of his post by writing, \"Love you Andy.\"",
      "She also posted a message to her Instagram story about the video, thanking Richter directly.",
      "\"It means a lot that you are standing with me against bullies. It is a brave thing to do. I am grateful for your kindness and friendship. I can't wait to cheer you all this coming Tuesday,\" she wrote.",
      "She also addressed behavior she characterized as \"bullying\" on the \"Dancing with the Stars\" podcast after her elimination.",
      "\u201cThis has nothing to do with me and the dance competition, cause I love all the women who are on this and get to continue to dance tomorrow,\u201d the yoga instructor said. \u201cIt has to do with what I\u2019ve seen this past week with my name, with what people have done to me, and they don\u2019t know me.\u201d",
      "Also this week, \"Dancing with the Stars\" pro Ezra Sosa came to the defense of his partner Jordan Chiles as she faced accusations of being a \"mean girl.\"",
      "\u201cHonestly, it couldn\u2019t be further from the truth,\u201d he said, in part."

      "Jeffrey Manchester escaped from prison while serving a 45-year sentence for robbery, and lived in a Charlotte, North Carolina, Toys-R-Us for several months before he was apprehended.",
      "Manchester's story is recounted in the new film \"Roofman,\" and Channing Tatum, who plays Manchester in the movie, admitted the real-life story of the robber is stranger than fiction in an interview on TODAY on Oct. 6.",
      "Repeating a line the film's director Derek Cianfrance would tell the cast and crew, Tatum recalled, \u201cHe always says, \u2018If this was a fiction, we\u2019d be the worst screenwriters on the face of the Earth.\u2019\u201d",
      "Tatum added that his reaction after reading the script was: \u201cThis can\u2019t all be true.\u201d",
      "Cianfrance, along with Kirt Gunn, wrote the screenplay for the film after researching Manchester's story and talking with him on the phone for about 400 hours, Cianfrance said in an interview on Morning Joe on Oct. 8.",
      "Tatum said on TODAY he also spoke with Manchester from Central Prison in Raleigh, North Carolina, in preparation for the film, which was shot on location in Charlotte.",
      "\u201cI had all these lists of questions and things that I wanted to know,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd as soon as you get on the phone with him, he\u2019s just the most warm. I mean, he spent nine years in solitary confinement ... but you talk to this guy, and he like, kind of takes care of you on the phone. He really does. He\u2019s optimistic, he has all these dreams and plans when he gets out.\u201d",
      "Here's what to know about the true story behind \"Roofman,\" which premieres in theaters on Oct. 10, including Manchester's crimes and where he is now.",
      "Is \"Roofman\" Based on a True Story?",
      "\"Roofman\" is based on Manchester's life, starting with a robbery at a McDonald's in May 2000, according to the Charlotte Observer, which obtained newspaper archives, court documents and interviews with those close to the case.",
      "Manchester carved a hole in the roof of the McDonald's in Belmont, North Carolina, and ordered the workers to lie on the ground as he told another to open the safe \u2014 while holding a .22 caliber rifle.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m so sorry. You\u2019re the good people,\u201d Manchester reportedly told the employees, according to the Observer. \u201cI\u2019m the bad guy. I\u2019m sorry for doing this to you.\u201d",
      "In addition to a robbery he committed the night before at another McDonald's in Gastonia, North Carolina, Manchester made out with more than $8,000 in cash.",
      "Manchester locked the workers in the freezer, though they\u2019d later break down the door and call police.",
      "As police headed to the McDonald's, one officer noticed a car in an empty church parking lot, and minutes later, Manchester approached the vehicle.",
      "The officer turned on his lights, called for backup and eventually police apprehended him after a brief chase. And about two hours later, Manchester confessed.",
      "The Observer reported Manchester, who had recently divorced from the mother of his three children, told police he did it for the money, \u201cto pay bills and buy things for my kids.\u201d",
      "\u201cI will do everything I can do to fix the situation. I still have a lot to give the community and the Army,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought it was going to be quick cash, and I ended up scaring people and wasted the police\u2019s time as well, and I am sorry for that.\u201d",
      "Authorities in California suspected Manchester was behind more than 40 other robberies in the state and others, as his military assignments would put him near the locations.",
      "Manchester told police in North Carolina he \u201cgot the idea from news of similar circumstances\u201d in California, and that he had \u201cnever done anything like this before, and I won\u2019t do it again.\u201d",
      "Manchester was charged with robbery with a dangerous weapon, breaking and entering and eight counts of first-degree kidnapping, and he was held him on a $1 million bond, according to the Observer.",
      "He turned down a plea deal that would have let him serve 15 to 22 years in prison, and was later convicted of the charges, the Observer reported. He was sentenced to 35 years in prison.",
      "But after serving just four years in prison, he escaped in June 2004 by hiding underneath a truck that took him beyond the prison walls, the Observer reported.",
      "Manchester then hitched rides to bring him to Charlotte, where he would make a home inside of a Toys R Us, per the Observer. An employee eventually found his makeshift home behind a false wall in the store, though Manchester would later just move into a different part of the store.",
      "Manchester also started frequenting Crossroads Church under the guise of the name John Zorn. There, he would meet Leigh Wainscott, a mother of three who was separated from her husband, played by Kirsten Dunst in \"Roofman.\"",
      "The pair began dating, with Wainscott under the impression that John was unmarried with no kids, per the Observer. He would later buy her a car and bring gifts for her kids when they'd meet up, the Observer reported.",
      "But on Dec. 26, 2004, he robbed the Toys R Us he had been living in, and when officers started investigating, they found a secret passageway that led them to the abandoned Circuit City next door, where they found a living space similar to the ones they found in the toy store, according to the Observer.",
      "Investigators found a fingerprint in the space, which was a match for Manchester, who had escaped from the state prison months before, per the Observer. They started showing Manchester's mugshot to people in the area, and on Jan. 5, 2005, they showed his photo at Crossroads Church to Wainscott.",
      "\u201cMiss Wainscott, the man that you\u2019ve been dating is not who you think he is,\u201d investigators told her, according to the Observer. \u201cHe\u2019s an escaped convict. He\u2019s considered extremely dangerous.\u201d",
      "They showed her Manchester's mug shot on America's Most Wanted, and she later helped investigators catch him.",
      "Manchester was set to take Wainscott out for dinner that night, as it was her birthday, and she called him to confirm he was picking her up, per the Observer. As investigators tailed his car, he stopped at a Bi-Lo grocery store to pick up flowers.",
      "Once he was at Wainscott's door, the tactical unit swarmed, and Manchester surrendered, according to the Observer.",
      "Authorities said they were able to connect him with other prior robberies at Toys R Us, as well as a break-in at a pawn shop and an arson at a dentist's office, according to the Observer.",
      "\u201cKnowing what we know now about him, how crafty and skilled (he was), I think he enjoyed the chase,\u201d Leigh told the Observer. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t about the money. ... I think he enjoyed eluding the police and being sneaky and seeing what he could get away with.\u201d",
      "Where is Jeffrey Manchester Now?",
      "Manchester is currently imprisoned at Central Prison in Raleigh, North Carolina, according to the North Carolina Department of Adult Correction, where he's serving time for kidnapping and other counts.",
      "He's serving the rest of his 35-year sentence for his crimes in Gaston County, and more than 25 years for his crimes in Charlotte concurrently, according to the Observer.",
      "His projected release date is Dec. 4, 2036, according to the North Carolina Department of Adult Correction."

      "\"Survivor\" contestant Jake Latimer is sharing behind-the-scenes details about the snake bite he received that caused a medical emergency on the Oct. 8 episode of the reality series",
      "In one of the most terrifying moments in the show\u2019s history, Latimer was bitten by a venomous banded sea krait snake while sitting at the beach close to his tribe camp.",
      "\"I opened my eyes, and the snake is latched onto the bottom of my foot, mouth wide open,\" Latimer told Entertainment Weekly. \"But it didn\u2019t hurt at the time. I just felt a tingling kind of sensation. And that\u2019s when I yelled to Alex. I\u2019m like, 'Guys, I think this thing just bit me!'\"",
      "Latimer recalled that \"cameras hauled it up the beach\" to film the  scene as it grew increasingly \u201cchaotic.\u201d",
      "The 36-year-old Canadian was rushed to the show\u2019s base camp where he was put on a stretcher and given an oxygen mask as the show\u2019s medical staff treated him.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s when it gets real, man. Because I don\u2019t remember who, but somebody did tell me that that was a very venomous snake and I need to get care, like, now,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd when I was lying on that stretcher, man, you saw me say, \u2018I\u2019m going to be a dad\u2026\u2019\u201d",
      "Latimer recalled thinking in that moment, \u201cAm I ever going to get off this island? Am I again going to see my child? Ever am I going to meet my child? And that\u2019s when it sunk in, because I had tubes coming out of me. I had oxygen masks on.\u201d",
      "He added, \u201cThat has been the most scared I\u2019ve ever been in my entire life. When you think that you\u2019re dying, it\u2019s a feeling that I\u2019m never going to forget.\u201d",
      "The show's medical professionals were able to determine that the Latimer had sustained  a \u201cdry bite,\u201d which meant the snake released no venom into him.",
      "Still, the decision was made to remove Latimer from the game to allow him time to rest and recover.",
      "\"I can\u2019t even explain that feeling of I\u2019m not going to die. I\u2019m not going to die. And then it\u2019s like, 'OK, now I got to get back in this game. I got to go help my tribe with a challenge,'\" he recalled, adding, \"I did not think I was going to get pulled.\"",
      "Latimer told EW he reluctantly followed \"doctor's orders,\" and could \"respect\" their decision.",
      "\"But I have unfinished business out there, and it was a tough way to go,\" he added.",
      "The silver lining? Latimer made it home in time to see the birth of his son, Jax \u2014 that is, after he was airlifted to a hospital Brisbane, Australia, where additional doctors could examine him.",
      "\"I was there not for very long, and I have a couple of sisters who live there,\" he shared. \"I was able to be with them for an afternoon, and I flew home. I got home just under 48 hours before my kid was born.\"",
      "\"God works in mysterious ways. I think that God put that snake there for a reason, just to get me home,\" he said. \"And I hate saying that because I wanted that game so bad, but I also got to see the birth of Jax, and that\u2019s worth a million dollars. And I was there for my wife.\"",
      "\"So it\u2019s a blessing in disguise. I\u2019m (otherwise) never going to get that experience back of seeing my kid be born,\" he said, adding, \"Even though, like I said, I have unfinished business out there.\"",
      "Latimer previously opened up about his decision to go on the show and miss the birth of his firstborn child in an interview with EW.",
      "\u201cI gave her the option for me to bow out,\u201d Latimer said at the time. \u201cI said, \u2018This is our child. You\u2019re here alone.\u2019 She\u2019s Australian, so she doesn\u2019t have anyone up in Canada. But she says, \u2018No, you go out. This is your dream, go do it, and whatever money you make is mine.\u2019\u201d"

      "\u201cYou can talk your negative stuff about me and I can handle it like a champ but when it comes to my partner, I\u2019m going to feel a certain way about it,\u201d he said. \u201cHonestly the thing that hurts me the most is knowing the person that she is and knowing the time that we have together.\u201d",

      "Lowell previously wrote about her family in her 2010 memoir \u201cWhy Not Say What Happened?\u201d then teamed up with Knight to bring \u201cHouse of Guinness\u201d to life.",
      "Ultimately, Lowell said the show turned out to be a more \u201cgritty\u201d version of \u201cDownton Abbey.\u201d Though she said she was \u201cnervous\u201d about what her family would say, she said she knew that they had a \u201cgood sense of humor.\u201d",
      "Then, other Guinness members publicly weighed in. In a first-person essay for The Times, Molly Guinness, great-great-great-granddaughter of Sir Benjamin Lee Guinness, said she laughed when she saw the show\u2019s first two episodes with her cousin, who has a \u201cfirmer grip\u201d on what happened long ago.",
      "She explained that she was amused by the character\u2019s personalities, which \u201ccome straight from a bingo card of modern clich\u00e9s about rich people.\u201d",
      "Molly Guinness noted that the series will definitely become a \u201cuseful GIF\u201d on her sibling\u2019s WhatsApp group.",
      "However, she said she wasn\u2019t pleased with how the drama portrayed Sir Benjamin Lee Guinness and Arthur Guinness as \u201cknaves and fools.\u201d",
      "\u201cBenjamin was a loving father and a great philanthropist,\u201d she said.",
      "She also approved of how the show displayed her family\u2019s charity work, although \"every charitable project is filmed through a lens of shame or self-preservation.\u201d",
      "Despite the show provoking \"righteous fury,\" Molly Guinness did say she was looking forward to watching it with her brother and cousins. \"The prospect of the laughter of all my brothers and cousins once they get their hands on it is a real joy,\" she said."

      "Maya Rudolph is weighing in on the recent \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d cast shakeups and why they don't surprise her.",
      "Prior to the Oct. 4 Season 51 premiere of the late-night sketch comedy series, a slew of cast members announced their departure from the show, with some sharing their candid thoughts on their seemingly abrupt exit.",
      "Among those leaving ahead of the new season are Heidi Gardner, who made her debut in 2017; Michael Longfellow, who joined the show in 2022; Devon Walker, who had a three-year run; and Emil Wakim, who only served as featured player on the program for one year.",
      "Following those departures, \u201cSNL\u201d shared in a Sept. 2 update that Please Don\u2019t Destroy group comedian Ben Marshall, as well as Veronika Slowikowska, Jeremy Culhane, Kam Patterson and Tommy Brennan, would join the show as this season as featured players.",
      "Less than two week laters, a shock came to fans when Ego Nwodim, who many thought was already confirmed for the new season, announced she would officially be leaving \u201cSNL\u201d after seven seasons.",
      "\u201cThe hardest part of a great party is knowing when to say goodnight,\u201d she wrote in part in an Instagram post Sept. 12.",
      "Nwodim, who began as a featured player on \u201cSNL\u201d in 2018 and then joined the main cast two years later, was one of the mainstays of the series, and notably one of the only eight Black women to have served as cast members in the series\u2019 50-year history.",
      "With Nwodim's departure, \"SNL\" now has no Black women cast members. After Rudolph left \"SNL\" in 2007, the show went seven years without a Black woman cast member, a streak that ended when Sasheer Zamata joined in 2014.",
      "When asked about the aforementioned cast shakeups and departures, Rudolph, who was an \u201cSNL\u201d cast member from 2000 to 2007, tells TODAY.com \u201cit was inevitable.\u201d",
      "\u201cI feel like every few years there\u2019s definitely a change. And I felt like it was inevitable. I mean, some people have been there for a really long time,\u201d she says before clarifying that she was not referencing Kenan Thompson, who\u2019s been a cast member for 22 years, making him the longest-tenured cast member in the show\u2019s history.",
      "\u201cBut yeah, I\u2019m never surprised,\u201d she continues while also noting that she\u2019s a little out of the loop. \u201cI don\u2019t know what goes on behind closed doors anymore. Obviously, when you work there, you have the ins and outs. But I just find out about it like everybody else.\u201d",
      "While Rudolph later quips that she has to get the scoop from Nwodim about her departure, she acknowledges that much has \u201cchanged\u201d over the years.",
      "\u201cWhen I was starting out, I was doing improv and sketch comedy at The Groundlings, which is still a wonderful theater and such a great place to start, because it\u2019s a place where you can get on stage and actually create characters and work, work, work,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was just like such an important training ground.\u201d",
      "Rudolph says it was a different time then, before the advent of social media and people putting their content on the internet. \u201cI didn\u2019t have that ability then,\u201d she explains.",
      "But the amount of effort and the work is still the same. \u201cI feel like practicing and doing and doing and doing and constantly doing and finding other funny people is the key,\u201d she continues, \u201cand just writing and performing and creating your own body of work.\u201d",
      "As far as who makes it on the show and how to land that coveted spot? The \"Loot\" star says it\u2019s really a mixed bag.",
      "\u201cThere are so many different types of people at 'SNL.' I\u2019m a sketch performer. Some people come to it as stand ups \u2014 just stand ups and \u2014 that\u2019s a whole other being that thrives there and then some people are just impersonators,\u201d she tells TODAY.com. \u201cThere are so many different paths to get there. But I think creating and creating and creating and being a part of something, whether you\u2019re a stand up or whether you\u2019re a part of a group, I think is so important to just stay active and be seen as much as possible.\u201d",
      "Though Rudolph has not divulged whether fans will see her again on the new season, it\u2019s safe to say the door remains open for the award-winning performer who nabbed an Emmy in 2020 for her portrayal of Vice President Kamala Harris on \u201cSNL.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn the case of Kamala, there was nothing to do but do it,\u201d she says.",
      "But there are some people she\u2019s just not interested in impersonating.",
      "\u201cThere have been other people, I think, definitely in the past, where I thought, \u2018Oh, God, I don\u2019t want to dress up like that lady' ... I feel like, if someone\u2019s a monster in real life, I definitely don\u2019t want to play them because I think somehow I don\u2019t want to totally be associated,\u201d she explains.",
      "As Rudolph gears up for her own projects, including the third season of her hit Apple TV+ series \u201cLoot,\u201d the comedian says she\u2019ll always have a soft spot for \u201cSNL.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s sometimes strange not being on the show, because you feel like, \u201cOh, if I were there, I would really, I would really have fun doing that,\u201d she says.",

    "story": [
      "The setting for the horrors perpetrated by killer Ed Gein was a dilapidated farmhouse on an isolated plot of land in rural Wisconsin.",
      "Authorities made a grisly discovery there in the small town of Plainfield in 1957, when the body of a local missing woman was found along with human remains and objects like lampshades and masks made out of human skin.",
      "Charlie Hunnam plays the murderer in the hit Netflix series \"Monster: The Ed Gein Story,\" which dramatizes the horrific events of his crimes and their reverberation through pop culture. Elements of Gein's story have inspired horror classics like \"Psycho\" and \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.\"",
      "Gein became known as \"The Butcher of Plainfield,\" making the town of about 700 people at the time a curiosity after his crimes made national headlines. The fate of his home then later became the subject of speculation about its destruction.",
      "Here's what to know about the farmhouse in Plainfield.",
      "What Was Found in Ed Gein's House?",
      "A local sheriff and a captain from a nearby sheriff department searched the house in 1957 and discovered a scene that left them reeling.",
      "The home was littered with garbage and had roaches and rodents scurrying about in a filthy kitchen.",
      "They then discovered the decapitated and gutted body of a missing local woman, Bernice Worden, hanging in the home, which they initially thought was a deer carcass, according to the book \"Unhinged: The Shocking True Story of Ed Gein,\" by Robert Keller. Gein later confessed to killing Worden.",
      "They also found a soup bowl that was made out of the top half of a human skull, as well as skulls hanging from the posts of Gein's bed. Gein later told investigators he exhumed the corpses of women from a local cemetery.",
      "Another horrifying discovering was a chair upholstered with human skin, as well as items like lampshades, a drum and a knife sheath made from human skin. They also found a collection of female genitalia, a box of human noses and death masks of skin pulled from victims' skulls and stuffed with paper and sawdust. One of them belonged to local innkeeper Mary Hogan, whom Gein confessed to killing after she had gone missing three years earlier.",
      "There also were odd discoveries like a coffee can filled with used chewing gum, a collection of old dentures and a washbasin filled with sand, according to Keller's book.",
      "Gein kept one area of the house sealed off and pristine \u2014 the bedroom of his late mother, Augusta Gein. His deep attachment to the severe and domineering Augusta, who died in 1945, is a persistent theme in \"Monster\" and Gein's life.",
      "Her room was filled with dust but otherwise was perfectly neat because it was left in the same state as the day she died from a stroke.",
      "Where Was Ed Gein's House?",
      "The isolated farmhouse was located on a 195-acre plot of land in Plainfield, Wisconsin, which was six miles from the nearest village via a dirt road.",
      "Plainfield's population at the time of his arrest was about 700 people. The town is located 155 miles northwest of Milwaukee and about 90 miles north of Madison.",
      "How Long Did Ed Gein Live in the Farmhouse?",
      "The Gein family initially lived in La Crosse, Wisconsin, before moving to a small dairy farm.",
      "In 1914, they purchased the 195-acre farmland that included a modest, two-story house that became more dilapidated as time went by due to the family's struggles with money.",
      "Ed and his older brother, Henry Gein, lived there with Augusta and their father, George Gein. George struggled with alcohol and was routinely berated and belittled by Augusta.",
      "George died in 1940 and then Ed's brother, Henry, died in 1944 under mysterious circumstances surrounding a wildfire on property near their home. There was suspicion that Henry Gein was Ed Gein's first victim.",
      "Gein continued to live in the Plainfield house with his mother, nursing her to health after she had a stroke following his brother's death. She then had another stroke and died in 1945.",
      "Gein then lived in the farmhouse alone, descending into madness while working odd jobs for money, until he was arrested in 1957. He was 51 years old at the time and had lived in the home for nearly his entire life.",
      "What Happened to the Home after Ed Gein Was Arrested?",
      "Following the news reports about Gein's crimes, the home became a tourist attraction. Morbidly curious people were driving from all over Wisconsin to see the crumbling old home, according to \"Unhinged.\"",
      "After Gein was found to be insane and committed to the former Central State Hospital for the Criminally Insane in Wisconsin, an auction was scheduled to sell his belongings as well as the farm.",
      "Before the auction took place, the Plainfield fire department was called to the site of the farmhouse on March 20, 1958, to find it burning.",
      "\"The firemen stood impassively by as the building burned to the ground,\" Keller wrote in \"Unhinged.\"",
      "It was believed to be arson, but the fire warden, who was the son of Gein's victim Bernice Worden, did not launch an inquiry.",
      "Gein was told while in the hospital about the destruction of a home that his family had owned for 44 years.",
      "\"Just as well,\" he said with little emotion, according to \"Unhinged.\"",
      "The property containing the destroyed home was sold for $3,000, and the 1949 Ford he used to transport bodies he had exhumed from the cemetery sold for $760 to a sideshow operator named Bunny Gibbons. He toured the Midwest with the vehicle, charging 25 cents for people to sit in the \"ghoul car,\" according to Keller."

    "story": [
      "Each season of \"Love Is Blind\" comes with at least one major controversy, but Season 9 is filled with many viral moments that have viewers talking.",
      "After watching the first nine episodes of this season, fans of the Netflix series have strong thoughts on several cast members' behavior and the conversations they had both in and out of the dating pods.",
      "As we wait to see how the rest of the season pans out, we're recapping the biggest controversial moments so far.",
      "Patrick and Kacie's Awkward Breakup Conversation",
      "After connecting in the dating pods, Kacie McIntosh and Patrick Suzuki got engaged and met in person for the first time.",
      "Although they'd never seen each other until that moment, they had spoken at length about the topic of ethnicity, with Patrick opening up about his insecurities about being the only Asian person in his friend group while growing up and being judged for his looks. Kacie reassured him that his ethnicity didn't matter and said her siblings also date people of other races.",
      "Kacie and Patrick's first meeting went well, but Kacie soon spoke with producers and decided she needed to go home. In an awkward conversation that left both Patrick and viewers wondering if Kacie was breaking up with him, the duo sat down to talk.",
      "Kacie seemed to give Patrick false hope that she still wanted to date him, just without the cameras around. However, she told producers she didn't think her attraction to Patrick was \"going to grow that much.\"",
      "After the show premiered, Kacie told Netflix's Tudum that Patrick felt \"like a stranger\" when they met, but she had intended to date him \"slowly at our own pace at home in Denver.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Patrick told the Los Angeles Times that he was \"so confused\" about how Kacie approached the conversation. Still, he said the experience on the show was \"transformative.\"",
      "Multiple Participants Leaving the Dating Experiment Early",
      "Finding your soulmate without ever seeing them in person can feel like an intense experience. In Season 9, the dating experiment proved to be too much for two participants, who eventually decided to leave early.",
      "While dating in the pods, Anna Yuan connected with Patrick Suzuki and Blake Anderson. One day, she never showed up to her date with Patrick, leaving him to wonder what went wrong. Producers took Blake aside when he was also stood up by Anna. He then learned that she had gone home without saying goodbye to either of her connections.",
      "Anna spoke with Tudum about her decision to go home early and explained why she didn't tell Blake or Patrick that she was leaving.",
      "\"I was a wreck,\" she said. \"My eyes were almost swollen shut from crying. I was embarrassed.\"",
      "When producers offered Anna the opportunity to go on camera and talk with her dates, she didn't want to given her current state.",
      "Anna also admitted that she was \"scared\" as the experiment continued and she became more \"vulnerable\" in her dates.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not that I\u2019m just sharing it with whoever I\u2019m dating or the other women \u2014 this is going to be broadcast for people,\u201d she said.",
      "Anna's parents were also confused about the experiment and worried that she was being \"kidnapped\" since producers were going to take away her phone. All of this added up to Anna feeling conflicted about continuing with the experiment.",
      "Blake Anderson developed feelings for Megan Walerius and Anna Yuan in the dating pods. One day, he got stood up when Anna decided to go home early. When he later decided to leave, he stood up Walerius on one of their dates.",
      "While speaking with TODAY.com, Anderson said his decision not to speak to Walerius before he left was \"clumsy\"",
      "\u201c(I) certainly didn\u2019t intend to leave anyone hanging,\u201d he said. \u201cThe departure was maybe a little bit clumsy on my part. I didn\u2019t think it through, but I truly thought in the moment I was doing the right thing.\u201d",
      "Anderson also explained why he chose to go home.",
      "\u201cI think I was more so kind of concerned with how I was feeling. The timeline was just a hurdle that I couldn\u2019t get over. I think at that point you only have so many days left before you\u2019re kind of faced with that, \u2018Hey, should I propose? Should I not?\u2019 I felt like I was nowhere close to that with any of my connections,\u201d he said.",
      "Nick and Annie's Controversial Comments About Raising LGBTQ+ Children",
      "When Nick Amato and Annie Lancaster brought up the topic of having children one day, they had a conversation that alienated some viewers. Nick asked what Annie would do if she learned that her child was a member of the LGBTQ+ community.",
      "While Annie said she would love her child \"no matter what,\" she did say she wouldn't be thrilled to hear the news.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll support my kids, but (would be) making sure that they\u2019re informed. Like, \u2018Do you know what you\u2019re doing? Do you know what you\u2019re getting into? Do you know what you\u2019re signing up for?\u201d she said.",
      "When Nick asked if Annie thought some subsets of the LGBTQ+ community were \"a fad,\" she said yes. Nick then explained why he holds that opinion and said he'd be concerned if his child's friend suggested they could be a member of the LGBTQ+ community.",
      "\u201cWhen kids start having those thoughts too young \u2014 and maybe I am old fashioned \u2014 but it\u2019s like a concern for me because who\u2019s telling you that?\u201d he said.",
      "Many viewers were disappointed with how the couple handled the conversation, with one X user calling it \"sickening beyond belief\" and another saying they would be \"fast forwarding through all of Annie and Nick scenes after that gross homophobic conversation.\u201d",
      "After the show premiered, Nick took to Instagram to share a video response to the backlash.",
      "\"I will LOVE and support my future children unconditionally, no matter how they identify. I take full accountability for how my words came across but I am glad it provoked this discussion and my learning,\" he captioned the post.",
      "\"I was born in a traditional Midwestern environment, and I now recognize how that shaped certain blind spots (I\u2019m thankful for the support of my friends recently for helping me learn this). That\u2019s not an excuse, just part of the work I\u2019m doing to grow and be better.\"",
      "In his video, Nick admitted \u201cthere\u2019s a lot that I didn\u2019t understand\u201d and said he used the word \"fad\" to refer to \u201cover-introducing sexual content material to kids\u2019 shows at a young age or the idea of gay identity.\u201d",
      "Joe's Comments About Madison's Body",
      "While dating Joe Ferrucci in the \"Love Is Blind\" pods, Madison Maidenberg opened up about an eye condition she has that could possibly make her go blind. After he reassured her that he would support her in good and bad times, Madison felt closer to Joe.",
      "After getting engaged, the couple met in person. Both Joe and Madison said they were attracted to each other. Madison asked if she was Joe's typical type and he said he had dated a \"variety\" of women. He called her \"gorgeous\" and she said she was \"pleasantly surprised\" with him.",
      "During the engaged couple's romantic getaway, Madison gushed about her physical attraction to her fianc\u00e9 in a confessional interview, saying, \"I'm totally into Joe. He's such a babe.\"",
      "However, Joe admitted that Madison wasn't his typical type, physically speaking.",
      "\u201cI am into thinner women, I would say, usually. That\u2019s just a preference, but not saying I wouldn\u2019t be interested in somebody that\u2019s kind of more, you know, larger physique,\u201d he said, adding that he knew that sounded \u201cterrible.\u201d",
      "Joe went on to say that \"physical attraction can grow\" since they had already established an emotional connection. \"There's a lot of attraction between the both of us,\" he said.",
      "While discussing the topic together, Madison asked Joe what he thought of her when they first met. \"It just felt like a stranger honestly,\" he said.",
      "Joe described how he took a moment to connect the person he'd been talking with in the pods with this person he met in person.",
      "Madison was curious to know if he thought she was \"hot\" and Joe said he did. She said she was also still connecting the physical and emotional elements. \"I'm not taking it personally, I promise,\" she said.",
      "Madison asked Joe if he felt like she was his \"person\" and he said yes. \"I was not at peace at first, but I'm at peace now. That's all that matters,\" he explained.",
      "Madison was \"super attracted\" to Joe, and he said he was \"attracted\" to her too. The next day, the couple agreed that they were having great sex, but Madison expressed concern that she was more into Joe than he was into her.",
      "\"I've always felt like I'm not enough. I just want somebody to think I'm enough,\" she said.",
      "Joe reassured Madison that he finds her \"beautiful,\" \"sexy\" and \"attractive.\" He also said he simply had a physical type in the past. \"I find your body attractive. I find everything about you attractive and that's only growing as well,\" he said.",
      "In an interview with Glamour, Madison said she experienced disordered eating after she returned from the trip to Mexico and appeared on the show.",
      "\u201cThe things that he said kind of carelessly really did impact me, you know?\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s really important to be aware that words carry weight.\u201d",
      "Joe clarified his comments, saying, \u201cI never want to contribute to anyone feeling that way. She always came across as confident and comfortable in her own skin. Mind you, in our conversation, I was not shaming her. Just being truthful of who I went for in the past. I found her attractive, both in how she looked and how she carried herself.\u201d",
      "These days, Madison said she is \"healthy\" hopes Joe will \"be far more mindful\" while speaking about women's bodies.",
      "Mike's Comments About Diabetes",
      "Megan Walerius formed three main connections in the dating pods. Over time, she narrowed down her options to Jordan Keltner, a service manager and single father to a 5-year-old son, and Mike Brockway, an entrepreneur.",
      "Mike drew controversy for seeming to assume that Jordan\u2019s child\u2019s diet led to a diabetes diagnosis. While diet can increase risk on Type 2 diabetes, Jordan's son has Type 1 diabetes, the exact cause of which is not clear, per the Mayo Clinic.",
      "Mike approached the conversation by saying he was happy that he and Megan had spoken about the role nutrition will play in the way they parent their future children. He then mentioned that one of the other male participants has a son with diabetes.",
      "\"It's just like so crazy to me that that can be the case. I have a friend that was pre-diabetic and he just totally changed up his diet. And now he's good,\" Mike said.",
      "\"Wow,\" Megan said, seemingly uncomfortable with the conversation. Megan had previously shared that her father also had Type 1 diabetes.",
      "\"And so maybe it's not that easy for everyone, but I just think health and nutrition has to be top of mind,\" Mike continued.",
      "\"Right,\" Megan replied.",
      "Mike then quickly changed the subject, but opened up a much larger conversation for viewers. One took to X to comment, \"Sorry, who is this guy who literally doesn\u2019t understand diabetes? And does Megan agree with him, or is she just staying quiet cause she can\u2019t be bothered to educate?\"",
      "\"Why isn\u2019t anyone talking about how Mike is questions the nutrition of Jordon\u2019s son because he has type 1 diabetes???? Does he know the difference of type 1 and 2?\" another said."

    "story": [
      "Jewel has long been an advocate for mental health through her Inspiring Children Foundation and, in recent years, the #NotAloneChallenge campaign. The campaign, which kicks off its fourth year on Friday, Oct. 10 \u2014 World Mental Health Day \u2014 promotes mental health resources to those who need them.",
      "\u201cThe motivation was to go a step beyond raising awareness \u2014 to be able to put tools into people\u2019s hands that are usable and free,\u201d the Grammy-nominated singer-songwriter, whose full name is Jewel Kilcher, tells TODAY.com. \u201cI think a lot of people don\u2019t realize how many modalities there are. And so if one isn\u2019t working for you, it\u2019s not that you\u2019re broken, it\u2019s that you may not have the right tool.\u201d",
      "The tools on the website for the #NotAloneChallenge range from mood-boosting activities to information for help lines and in-person support.",
      "Jewel, 51, honed her own tools, which she has described in numerous interviews, at a young age. Raised by an abusive father, she left home at 15 and would later struggle with panic attacks.",
      "\u201cHappiness wasn\u2019t really taught in my household, and I wondered if it was a learnable skill or a teachable skill, or do kids like me just fall through the cracks, and you don\u2019t have hope the rest of your life?\u201d she recalls to TODAY.com. \u201cSo I set out on kind of this mission to see if it was a language that I could figure out how to speak, and I started writing as a side effect of that. It was sort of, you know, songs like \u2018Who Will Save Your Soul\u2019 or \u2018Angel Standing By\u2019 were sort of my medicine for myself.\u201d",
      "She has said other coping mechanisms, such as journaling and meditation, have helped her in her mental health journey. Reframing her relationship with anxiety has also been useful to her.",
      "She says she \u201cstopped thinking that anxiety meant something was wrong with me, and maybe it meant something was right with me, that my anxiety was my body\u2019s way of telling me I was consuming something that didn\u2019t agree with me. That there was a thought, a feeling or an action that I was consuming that made me anxious.",
      "\u201cAnd when I could start to bring awareness around those and then start curating which thoughts, feelings and actions I was participating in, it really made a big difference in my health,\u201d she continues.",
      "Regulating Her Fame",
      "After she released her debut album, \u201cPieces of You,\u201d featuring lead single \u201cWho Will Save Your Soul,\u201d in 1995, she faced a different sort of struggle in her life as she became a household name.",
      "Jewel says she can look back at that time now with \u201cmore appreciation,\u201d but in the moment she \u201cdidn\u2019t really enjoy being that famous.\u201d",
      "\u201cBy the time I did \u2018Spirit,\u2019 my second album (released in 1998), I started to regulate how famous I got. I started to take years between albums to kill my momentum. My mental health just didn\u2019t do good with being that level of fame,\u201d she says, remembering how people followed her and simple tasks like grocery shopping became difficult.",
      "\u201cI was like, wait, I don\u2019t actually have to be that famous. I can be less famous, and it\u2019s not that hard to do. You take time between albums, and you go under the radar really quickly,\u201d she adds. \u201cAnd so how I\u2019ve been able to manage my career now, the level that I have, is comfortable for me. It\u2019s manageable for me. I\u2019m able to do the things I want.",
      "I was like, wait, I don\u2019t actually have to be that famous. I can be less famous, and it\u2019s not that hard to do. You take time between albums, and you go under the radar really quickly.",
      "Jewel",
      "\u201cSo when I look back on that time I think of a lot of tiredness and exhaustion, but also exhilaration and wonder, because, you know, I had a dream come true.\u201d",
      "She refers to \u201cPieces of You\u201d as a \u201csincere album\u201d that hit record stores at the \u201cheight of coolness and cynicism and grunge\u201d in the music world. It spawned multiple Billboard Hot 100 hits \u2014 \u201cWho Will Save Your Soul,\u201d \u201cYou Were Meant For Me\u201d and \u201cFoolish Games\u201d \u2014 and went 12-times platinum.",
      "\u201cThe trajectory of my life was altered because people invested in that album and invested in me as a person, invested in my writing and my heart. \u2026 I sometimes don\u2019t know if people realize what a dynamic, real relationship it is,\u201d she explains. \u201cThe reason I can do this 30 years later is because people supported me as I\u2019ve gone into poetry or different genres or into mental health.\u201d",
      "Flexing Her Muscles (Literally) on Instagram",
      "Jewel helped establish the Inspiring Children Foundation, a nonprofit that describes its mission as helping at-risk youth with physical, emotional, social and mental health, over 20 years ago. Its #NotAloneChallenge not only provides mental health tools, but also encourages people to join the movement by recording a video to express who they\u2019re grateful for and to remind others that they are not alone. The initiative has been expanded this year to include a Not Alone award event and wellness summit to be held in Las Vegas in November.",
      "The musician, who is mom to 14-year-old son Kase with ex-husband Ty Murray, has also put an emphasis on her physical health. She says she likes to practice yoga, do weight training, hike and embrace nature. The latter was evident in an Oct. 5 Instagram post in which she wrote, \u201cNature is so healing.\u201d",
      "A separate Instagram post a few weeks earlier received much more attention. On Sept. 16, she shared a selfie of her displaying her toned arms and legs.",
      "\u201cSummer recap: more travel, more lifting (because, 51 and gotta keep that muscle and bone up) more time with family and loved ones, more painting \u2026 more adventure, more joy,\u201d she wrote.",
      "Many of the comments on the post, which received nearly 68,000 likes, focused on her physique, but she doesn\u2019t quite get what the fuss is about.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t think it was going to be that big of a deal. It really got picked up,\u201d she laughs. \u201cYeah, it was pretty funny to me.\u201d"

      "While showing up to school in costume may not have earned her a lot of points in the popularity department, it did help lay the foundation for McKinnon's madcap adventure, \u201cThe Millicent Quibb School of Etiquette for Young Ladies of Mad Science.\u201d",
      "Released in 2024, the fantasy novel tells the eccentric tale of sisters Gertrude, Eugenia, and Dee-Dee Porch, outcasts in the persnickety town of Antiquarium, a place where residents are only allowed to own bichon fris\u00e9 dogs and all young women must attend etiquette school.",
      "Full of clever footnotes and detailed illustrations, the book became a New York Times bestseller and spawned the latest installment in the series, \"Secrets of the Purple Pearl,\" released on Sept. 30.",
      "\u201cThis genre is certainly my favorite literary genre because (of the) magic, fantasy, fun characters, but also it is the genre that deals most directly with questions of identity and coming into one\u2019s own discovering who you are, who you were born to be,\u201d she explains.",
      "According to McKinnon, all the characters in the \u201cMillicent Quibb\u201d series are based on her in one way or another, but the one  she sees herself in the most is the protagonist, Gertrude Porch.",
      "\u201cI definitely identify with her strong desire to help, her empathy, and, often, her plans to assist go awry because she tells weird jokes and she makes little weird comments and she\u2019s just odd and she can\u2019t really help it,\u201d she says.",
      "\u201cSo often in my own life, the thing that seemed like, \u2018Oh, I can\u2019t do that, that\u2019s too much,\u2019 or, \u2018They\u2019ll think that\u2019s weird,\u2019 that ends up being the thing that people respond to the most. So, that\u2019s sort of the journey Gertrude is on. She\u2019s learning to trust that even though her thoughts are very out of the box, that\u2019s exactly what the world needs of her,\u201d says McKinnon.",
      "The daughter of a social worker and an architect, McKinnon grew up on Long Island and says that while her community was largely \u201cartsy,\u201d she, like Gertrude, still felt somewhat stifled.",
      "\u201cNo matter what community you grow up in, you get messages to tone it down, shave off the hard edges of who you are, fit yourself into a box,\u201d McKinnon says.",
      "The \u201cMillicent Quibb\u201d series is intentionally written for an older-elementary and middle-school-aged audience.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what people in this age group are learning how to deal with, and the question becomes, are you going to listen to that, and then spend a lifetime trying to figure out who you actually are? Or are you going to stay the course?\u201d",
      "\u2018I Took Apart VCRs to Look at Circuit Boards\u2019",
      "Much like her character, McKinnon decided to be true to herself, even if it meant not quite fitting in.",
      "\u201cI was so weird,\u201d says McKinnon. \u201cI had a little group of weird friends, and we loved science. We looked for aliens in the sky, and we ate honeysuckle in the schoolyard to try to figure out whether there was a correlation between the color of the honeysuckle and the sweetness of the nectar.",
      "I was so in love with the natural world as I was discovering it. And I was also lonely because I knew I was weird.",
      "Kate McKinnon",
      "\u201cI took apart VCRs to look at circuit boards. There was a ghost hunters club. I was so in love with the natural world as I was discovering it. And I was also lonely because I knew I was weird.\u201d",
      "What made her \u201cweird,\u201d however, also proved to be the catalyst for her success.",
      "While a student at Columbia University in 2006, McKinnon scored a role on the comedy series \u201cThe Big Gay Sketch Show,\u201d followed by a string of minor TV appearances, a trajectory that eventually led her to audition for \"SNL\" in 2012.",
      "After nabbing a coveted spot on the cast, McKinnon quickly rose through the ranks, becoming well-known for her celebrity impressions of Hillary Clinton, Martha Stewart, Ellen DeGeneres and others, eventually winning back-to-back Emmys in 2016 and 2017.",
      "After 11 seasons on the show, McKinnon stepped down, but not without leaving the world with a variety of memorable characters, including Colleen Rafferty (aka Ms. Rafferty), the raunchy, cigarette-smoking alien abductee in one of the show\u2019s most legendary sketches: \u201cClose Encounters.\u201d",
      "Since leaving, she returned to host the show in 2023 and again in 2025, resurrecting Ms. Rafferty for the \"SNL\" 50th anniversary special in February.",
      "\u201cI truly love people and connecting with a live audience is the greatest thing,\u201d she says.",
      "Introvert vs. Extrovert",
      "Between being an author and a performer, is there one McKinnon prefers over the other?",
      "\u201cI\u2019m a real introvert and so the lifestyle of just getting up and going to my computer by myself, it suits me very well. But I also love to collaborate with other funny people,\u201d she says.",
      "Currently, McKinnon is busy pickling the produce she grows on her farm, hanging out with a woodchuck in her yard that she\u2019s dubbed Bonnie and working on the third installment of \u201cMillicent Quibb,\u201d which is well underway.",
      "\u201cOne of the greatest dreams of my life would be to see the world that\u2019s in my head realized on a screen,\u201d she says.",
      "Are there plans for a movie?",
      "\u201cMake the phone call!\u201d she laughs."

      "A ceasefire in Gaza came into effect Friday at 12 p.m. local time (5 a.m. ET) and troops have pulled back to agreed lines, the Israeli military said, after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government approved the first phase of the deal intended to bring the war to an end.",
      "A 72-hour window is now open in which Hamas would release the remaining hostages. The White House has said it expected hostages to be released Monday. Forty-eight hostages remain to be returned, of whom Israel says it believes 20 are alive.",
      "An Israeli official briefed on the matter told NBC News that all living hostages would be released at one time.",
      "In exchange, Israel is to release 250 prisoners serving life sentences and 1,700 Palestinians detained after Oct. 7, 2023. A final list of prisoners has not yet been made public, but an Israeli government spokeswoman said Thursday it would not include the prominent Palestinian political leader Marwan Barghouti, seen by many as a potential unifying figure.",

      "The agreement comes just more than two years to the day after the Hamas-led terrorist attacks on Israel that killed 1,200 people and around 250 kidnapped.

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s personal touch \u2014 both as a heavy hand and a gentle guide \u2014 played a pivotal role at key moments in the development of a Middle East peace deal that promises to bring an end to Israel\u2019s two-year war in Gaza, current and former officials in the United States and other nations told NBC News.",
      "Trump announced on Wednesday that the \u201cfirst phase\u201d of the plan to end the conflict in Gaza had been agreed to, with a pause in fighting and the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners.",
      "Trump called it \u201ca great deal\u201d in a brief interview with NBC News on Thursday morning. \u201cEverybody is happy,\u201d he said.",
      "The deal accelerated over several crucial moments \u2014 Israel\u2019s strike on Qatar, discussions on the sidelines of the recent United Nations General Assembly in New York City and Jared Kushner\u2019s conversations with his father-in-law, these sources said.",
      "Also helpful, though, was an old-fashioned deadline. In recent weeks, Trump told advisers he wanted to announce a deal by Oct. 7, the second anniversary of the Hamas terrorist attack on Israel that precipitated the war, according to two people familiar with his instructions.",
      "The president, one of the people said, was fixated on the date both for its symbolic significance and because he saw it as a way to herald a new step forward in Israel\u2019s relationship with Saudi Arabia when Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman visits Washington next month.",
      "This account of the Trump administration\u2019s role in the ceasefire deal is based on interviews with a dozen sources in three countries.",
      "As the war in Gaza ground on \u2014 with more than 67,000 dead, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry, declarations of famine and images of wounded children across social media \u2014 it threatened Trump\u2019s vision for a more interconnected Middle East that he began to implement in his first term with the Abraham Accords, which established relationships between Israel and several Arab nations.",
      "The war\u2019s intensity also presented an opportunity for Trump to coalesce regional powers around a peace plan to disarm Hamas, preclude Israel from seizing the West Bank and provide for the redevelopment of Gaza.",
      "Israel and Hamas agreed Wednesday to the first phase of that proposal \u2014 a ceasefire and an Israeli military pullback to a \u201cyellow line\u201d within Gaza that leaves more of the strip under the control of Palestinians. That is to be followed by Hamas\u2019 returning as many as 20 Israeli hostages and the remains of as many as 28 hostages and Israel\u2019s releasing nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and the remains of 15 dead Gazans.",
      "Trump was able to announce the pact just one day after his target.",
      "To do that, Trump had to maintain the trust of Israel and of a series of Arab- and Muslim-majority nations that could influence Hamas and Palestinian civilians. At the same time, he had to apply pressure. His ability to walk that tightrope was tested repeatedly.",
      "And, at times, the darkest hours yielded the biggest breakthroughs.",
      "Qatar strikes",
      "After months of negotiations with no result, a turning point came in September in the form of a surprise attack.",
      "Israeli forces launched airstrikes on the Qatari capital, Doha, in an attempt to kill the leaders of Hamas. Six people were killed, including a member of Qatar\u2019s internal security force.",
      "Over the course of the war, Israel has struck in Iran, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen, in addition to Gaza.",
      "But this was different. Qatar is a U.S. ally that hosts a strategic air base with 10,000 American troops. Trump and his team had come to view the Persian Gulf nation as a trusted partner in the negotiations between Israel and Hamas. The parents of an Israeli hostage had been in Doha that very morning, meeting Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al-Thani.",
      "The bombing blindsided and angered the White House, as well as the Arab world.",
      "Asked about the strikes at the time, Trump told reporters: \u201cI was very unhappy about it. Very unhappy about every aspect.\u201d",
      "But instead of killing the prospect of a deal, the Israeli attack prompted Trump and his team to ratchet up pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to bring the war to an end.",
      "\u201cIt was the moment that Trump said, \u2018Enough,\u2019\u201d said a former Israeli official, adding: \u201cThis deal, almost identical, has been on the table for over a year now. Netanyahu didn\u2019t want to do it, but Trump left him no choice.\u201d",
      "\u201cBoth Netanyahu and Hamas tried to say \u2018yes, but\u2019 to stall, but Trump decided to hear only \u2018yes\u2019 and pushed them into the corner,\u201d the former official said.",
      "Shortly after the strikes, Trump issued a warning to Israel: He would not support the annexation of the West Bank, as some far-right members of Netanyahu\u2019s Cabinet had proposed.",
      "The Americans, the Qataris and other Arab governments saw the surprise strikes as an opportunity to exert leverage, according to an Arab official and former Israeli officials with knowledge of the diplomatic talks.",
      "\u201cIt was a catalyst to bring pressure on the Israeli government, which had been the main obstacle to a deal,\u201d the Arab official said.",
      "U.N. General Assembly sidelines",
      "Weeks after the strikes on Doha, the U.N. General Assembly met along the bank of the East River in New York City.",
      "It was on the sidelines \u2014 where, historically, deals are often solidified with face-to-face interactions and handshakes \u2014 that the discussions \u201creally took a turn,\u201d Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Thursday during a Cabinet meeting at the White House.",
      "Trump convened a meeting at the General Assembly with Arab- and Muslim-majority nations to sell his 20-point peace plan. Rubio said that is where Trump \u201ccreated this coalition\u201d before he presented the proposal to Netanyahu at the White House at the end of last month.",
      "Crucially, during that visit, Trump persuaded Netanyahu to call Al-Thani, the Qatari prime minister, to apologize for the Israeli strikes in Qatar. That allowed Qatar to remain engaged as a key intermediary in peace talks.",
      "\u201cIt is my understanding that the Qatari government viewed the apology as a way to move forward, and it saw its role, that it had invested in for quite a long time, as still vital to achieving a ceasefire and hopefully peace in the future,\u201d Nawaf Al-Thani, a former Qatari defense attach\u00e9 to the United States, told NBC News.",
      "Trump\u2019s handling of that episode was reminiscent for many observers of the way he reacted to Israel\u2019s and Iran\u2019s striking each other during a ceasefire agreement following American bombing raids on Iranian nuclear facilities in June.",
      "\u201cWe basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that they don\u2019t know what the f--- they\u2019re doing,\u201d Trump, clearly frustrated, said at the time. His rebuke of Israel, along with Iran, reassured Arab countries with ties to Shia-majority Iran. In that way, a former senior White House official said, Trump\u2019s messages to Israel after its strikes in Iran and in Qatar were similar.",
      "\u201cBoth showed the president\u2019s commitment to Israel, but also his commitment to the Arab countries,\u201d the former official said.",
      "Seeing the United States pushing Israel over the strike in Doha helped persuade Qatar, Turkey and other Arab governments to press Hamas, making it clear that the time for delays and foot-dragging was over, the officials said.",
      "As the negotiations advanced, both the U.S. and Arab negotiators chose to convey a united and optimistic front, placing Netanyahu at risk of potentially insulting Trump if he questioned the 20-point proposal Trump put on the table, the former Israeli official said.",
      "\u201cThe Trump people and Arab world just briefed total confidence and optimism before anything was finalized to make it seem like a done deal, which made saying \u2018no\u2019 a public affront to Trump, and Netanyahu can\u2019t do that,\u201d the former official said. \u201cIt was a show of very effective statecraft and use of leverage.\u201d",
      "Kushner\u2019s role",
      "During Trump\u2019s first term, Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law, became his chief envoy to the Middle East. There he was delivering a speech at the opening of the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem. There he was building relationships with Arab leaders, focusing on economic relations.",
      "Years later, Kushner became deeply involved in the negotiations between Israel and Hamas. He emerged, former Israeli officials said, because he carries important influence with regional governments and the president.",
      "\u201cKushner was the architect,\u201d a former Israeli official said.",
      "Kushner was able to convey to Trump that the conflict in Gaza threatened the future of his biggest diplomatic success the last time he was in office \u2014 the Abraham Accords.",
      "That deal produced peace agreements between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco. Trump has aimed to extend it to normalize relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel.",
      "\u201cThe entire legacy was in jeopardy,\u201d the former Israeli official said.",
      "Kushner and Trump\u2019s special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, traveled to Egypt on Tuesday to hammer out details of the deal, according to senior U.S. officials.",
      "They went over various aspects of the proposal, including how Israeli military forces would be redeployed and the order of hostage and prisoner releases, the officials said, with one adding that an important feature of their work was the decision to \u201cseparate the peace deal into two clear phases.\u201d That allowed for an agreement on the exchange of people, while the deal\u2019s other points are negotiated in a second phase.",
      "The U.S. negotiators called Trump on Wednesday evening to get his final guidance before he announced that a deal was in place, the officials said. Israel\u2019s government approved the exchange Thursday evening.",
      "\u201cIt came together quick in a good way,\u201d Witkoff told NBC News in a brief telephone interview Thursday morning as he waited to board a flight to Israel.",
      "Kushner and Witkoff had about \u201cfive hours of sleep in the last three days,\u201d senior U.S. officials said.",
      "American negotiators expect the next phase to be \u201calmost a permanent ceasefire until all the other issues we have to deal with are negotiated and considered,\u201d one of the officials said, pointing to outstanding topics as thorny as how Gaza will be governed.",
      "U.S. officials cautioned Thursday that there is still a lot of work to do to ensure the ceasefire holds and the rest of the plans can be finalized and implemented.",
      "\u201cThis is a very delicate time,\u201d one of them said.",
      "Trump said he plans to travel to Egypt to put his signature on the Middle East agreement in the coming days.",
      "And the U.S. military is preparing options to deploy as many as 200 U.S. troops to Israel to support the International Stabilization Force for the long-term internal security solution for Gaza and to support the flow of humanitarian aid and security assistance into Gaza, according to two U.S. officials familiar with the planning.",
      "\u201cThey will not be in Gaza. No U.S. boots on the ground in Gaza,\u201d one of the officials said.",
      "The effort will be called the Civil-Military Coordination Cell, and U.S. troops could begin arriving in Israel immediately, the officials said.",
      "In addition to supporting moving aid and assistance into Gaza, they are expected to support the deconfliction mechanism between the two sides \u2014 basically making sure that both sides are upholding their part of the security agreements.",
      "\u201cI think right now,\u201d a senior U.S. official said, \u201cwe\u2019re just focused on making sure any gaps are patched up in the agreement.\u201d",
      "Trump allies say the agreement between Israel and Hamas, forged under immense pressure on both sides \u2014 including Trump\u2019s broad support for Israel\u2019s war in Gaza, the limits he placed on Netanyahu and a threat to let Israel destroy Hamas if it did not agree to the pact \u2014 is a testament to the validity of his peace-through-strength approach to foreign policy.",
      "\u201cHe understands that sometimes you have to use force to set the structure for peace,\u201d former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., who is close to Trump, said in an interview last week."

      "\u201cI\u2019m terrified, not just for the NHS, but for the whole of our society,\u201d Michael Sheen, who starred as Aneurin \u201cNye\u201d Bevan, the founder of the NHS, told NBC News in an interview. \u201cOnce it\u2019s torn down, then I guess people will think about what they\u2019ve lost.\u201d",
      "Sheen, 56, better known to international audiences as Tony Blair in \u201cThe Queen,\u201d David Frost in \u201cFrost/Nixon\u201d and the angel Aziraphale in the Amazon Prime series \u201cGood Omens,\u201d has spent much of the last two years honing his portrayal of Bevan, the socialist politician who dragged himself out of Wales\u2019 coal mines to will the NHS into existence.",
      "Though second nature to Brits, the ideal of the NHS is unfamiliar to many Americans: British people have universally free health care at the point of access \u2014 from ambulances attending car accidents to insulin for diabetes to cancer care to childbirth. Though some people do have private insurance, the idea of having to choose between illness and financial ruin is shocking in the U.K.",
      "Now, the Labour Party, which created the then-radical NHS in 1948, is battling its own economic constraints and record-setting unpopularity. It has a colossal task if it is to fix the crumbling hospitals replete with overworked doctors and bed-lined corridors.",
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer must turn around a behemoth whose budget of 200 billion English pounds ($269 billion) represents some 40% of all government spending, and whose 1.4 million employees are the world\u2019s seventh-largest workforce. In the United States, only the Department of Defense, Walmart and Amazon employ more people.",
      "Through all this, the core NHS ideal endures. Everyone in the U.K. has a story of a relative, or themselves, receiving the type of world-class care that puts a terrifying financial strain on millions of Americans. (In the past six years, this reporter\u2019s mother has had a single mastectomy and reconstruction, as well as three titanium plates in a shattered ankle, without having to pay a pound for the care.)",
      "But just as common are the tales of maddening, hourslong waits in overstretched emergency rooms, or weeklong delays just to see a community general practitioner. Many critics blame the sprawling crisis on years of underfunding by the now-ousted Conservative government of 2010-24, whose response to the 2008 financial crisis was to make drastic cuts to public services.",
      "It\u2019s perhaps unsurprising that a largely liberal London-theatergoing audience responded with applause and tears at the hagiography of Bevan at the National Theater. Though relatively unknown in wider society, admirers see Bevan as a founding father of modern Britain; his ideal of the NHS today is not just popular, it defines the country itself.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s far from perfect,\u201d said Alison Ferris, 40, a nurse at a hospital in Canterbury, in southeast England. \u201cBut I do the best that I can for anyone that comes in front of me. I treat every patient like I would treat my loved ones.\u201d",
      "Though the concept remains revered, public satisfaction in the NHS in practice cratered to 52% in 2023 from a high of 70% in 2010, according to the King\u2019s Fund, a top think tank tracking British health care.",
      "\u201cWe have to fight for the NHS, the same as the NHS was fought for when it was created,\u201d said Ferris\u2019 mother, Caroline Heggie, 70, a hospital union representative, who like her daughter had come to see the last night of \u201cNye\u201d at the National Theater last month. \u201cWe can\u2019t go the way of privatization, we can\u2019t go the way of America. That\u2019s what we\u2019re up against.\u201d",
      "Like Bevan, Sheen is a Welsh firebrand unafraid to wear his leftist politics. But he also lived for 14 years in Los Angeles, so knows too well what life is like without socialized health care.",
      "\u201cThe idea of this health care system that we have here, just seemed so alien to them over there,\u201d Sheen, who now lives back in his Welsh hometown of Port Talbot, says of his former American hosts. He says that \u201cseeing people go into hospitals with serious injuries or illnesses, and being asked to produce their checkbook before they can be treated\u201d would shock most Britons.",
      "The crisis at the NHS coincides with an uptick in hostility toward immigrants \u2014 even though they are often people\u2019s doctors, nurses and hospital cleaners. Almost 20% of NHS staff have a non-British nationality, with Indians, Filipinos, Nigerians, Irish and Poles making up most of their number.",
      "Nigel Farage, the leader of the hard-right Reform U.K. party and an ally and friend of President Donald Trump, is leading some polls to become Britain\u2019s next prime minister. He has become the first prospective leader to question the funding model of using taxes to fund the NHS \u2014 historically taboo.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t work \u2014 it\u2019s not working,\u201d Farage told NBC News\u2019 British partner Sky News in May. \u201cWe\u2019re getting worse bang for the buck than any other country, particularly out of those European neighbors.\u201d",
      "Opposing Farage\u2019s proposal, however, leaves open the specter of privatization, which many say has been creeping up even before the Health and Social Care Act 2012 opened up the NHS to bids from private contractors.",
      "Farage isn\u2019t the only person dissatisfied. Indeed, the NHS has slipped from being a world leader on many metrics.",
      "\u201cCorridor care\u201d is now a year-round crisis, and the number of people waiting 12 hours or more to be admitted into an emergency room rose from 47 in summer 2015 to 74,150 this summer. Targets have lagged for years in everything from ambulance attendance times to cancer diagnoses. Meanwhile, a 7 million-strong waiting list means many people feel abandoned for months, in pain, before getting hip or knee replacement and other types of surgery.",
      "There is ample evidence to suggest that economic austerity policies imposed during 14 years of Conservative Party rule are at least partly to blame, according to Max Warner, a senior research economist at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, a London research group.",
      "\u201cIt is true that a lot of NHS performance measures over the 2010s were broadly getting worse, having started off relatively well,\u201d he said. \u201cAlthough it\u2019s worth saying that productivity did grow, so it\u2019s a nuanced picture and causality is difficult.\u201d",
      "The Conservatives argued that they kept NHS spending up, protecting it from the brutal cuts that crushed almost every other government department at the time. But this 2% yearly growth still fell well short of the 3.8% yearly average since the 1980s, and, according to critics, was insufficient to cope with an aging population and the rising prices of cutting-edge drugs.",
      "Far from the envy of the world, Britain has been scrimping by spending 37 billion pounds ($53 billion) on the health services each year, well below Germany, France and Australia, a landmark review found last year.",
      "The current Labour government has outlined plans to raise spending to around 3% \u2014 an improvement but still short of what many advocates had hoped. At his annual Labour Party conference this week, Starmer announced that a digital overhaul named NHS Online would launch in 2027, describing it as \u201ca new chapter in the story of our NHS.\u201d",
      "Ultimately, whatever the model, cash is key, according to Roy Lilley, who ran an NHS hospital in the 1990s as chairman of Homewood NHS Trust in Surrey, west of London.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how you pay for your health care,\u201d said Lilley, today a consultant whose newsletter hits 300,000 inboxes. \u201cWhether you take it out of your pocket marked \u2018insurance,\u2019 or you take it out of your pocket marked \u2018taxes,\u2019 it\u2019s still your trousers.\u201d",
      "He remains optimistic, however, pointing to some waiting metrics improving and a general recovery from the hammerblow of the pandemic, which drained resources and mentally scarred doctors.",
      "Still, Sheen \u2014 never shy to mix acting with activism \u2014 believes it\u2019s no coincidence that the NHS is in crisis just when its origin story begins to vanish from living memory.",
      "\u201cThe crisis that we seem to be experiencing makes it all the more important to go back to the beginning and to look at what was behind the founding of the NHS, and what the principles were,\u201d he said. \u201cIt becomes incredibly important to tell the story of it and to remind people of what it was actually like, so that we don\u2019t forget.\u201d"

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Wait 'til next year.",
      "The public push to make Donald Trump the winner of the 2026 Nobel Peace Prize began within hours of the committee\u2019s announcement Friday that the honoree this year is Maria Corina Machado, the Venezuelan opposition leader.",
      "Snubbed by the Nobel selection committee, Trump should be the clear front-runner for the prize next year, given the breakthrough he reached toward ending the war in Gaza, his supporters said.",
      "Rep. Buddy Carter, R-Ga., said Friday he would introduce a resolution in Congress saying Trump deserves the honor.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019ll be a strong candidate next year, and he should have been a slam dunk this year, but unfortunately, the committee got it wrong,\u201d Carter said in an interview. \u201cBut they made their decision. So, next year they\u2019ll have an opportunity to make up for it.\u201d",
      "Jason Miller, a former senior Trump campaign official, told NBC News: \u201cThe legacy of the Nobel Peace Prize will be irreparably damaged if it isn\u2019t awarded to President Trump in 2026. The voices calling for President Trump to win the Nobel Peace Prize in 2026 are only going to get louder.\u201d",
      "Few voices were louder than Trump\u2019s in making the case that he\u2019d earned the award this year. The president mounted a rare public campaign to win it based on seven peace deals he says he reached in global hotspots.",
      "He is inching closer to an eighth. A whirlwind bout of U.S.-led diplomacy has culminated in a ceasefire in Gaza. Hamas militants may release the remaining hostages early next week. And Trump plans to fly to the region this weekend to sign the accord and deliver a speech to the Israeli parliament.",
      "Trump has long said he didn\u2019t expect the five-member Norwegian selection committee to give him the award. The betting markets saw it the same way. Early this week, Polymarket, a prediction betting site, had put his odds of winning at 2%.",
      "The deadline for nominating people for the Nobel Prize was Jan. 31 \u2014 11 days into Trump\u2019s new term. Still, the committee was free to consider accomplishments that came later in the year as it winnowed down the candidates, said Nina Graeger, director of the Peace Research Institute Oslo, who handicaps the top candidates for the prize.",
      "\u201cWill you get the Nobel Prize? Absolutely not,\u201d Trump told an audience of generals and admirals last week. \u201cThey\u2019ll give it to some guy that didn\u2019t do a damn thing.\u201d",
      "But he believed it would be advantageous to strike the Middle East peace deal before the committee revealed the winner, a person who has been in meetings with him said. That way, Trump could make the argument that the committee process was \u201crigged\u201d; a president who ended so many conflicts rightly should have gotten the award that celebrates peace, this person said.",
      "Shortly after the winner was announced, Steven Cheung, the White House communications director, posted on social media that \u201cThe Nobel Committee proved they place politics over peace.\u201d",
      "Much can happen in a year\u2019s time. If the peace deal in Gaza doesn\u2019t hold \u2014 if the fighting resumes and more Gazans die in the crossfire \u2014 Trump isn\u2019t likely to get credit for raising false hopes that peace was at hand, foreign policy analysts say.",
      "The committee will want to see if the peace deal that Trump describes as an historic triumph is real or ephemeral.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t know if the peace plan will be sustainable and lasting,\u201d Graeger said. \u201cHe definitely should get credit for his efforts to end the war and really engaging with this process. But there are a lot of hurdles in the implementation of the plan.\u201d",
      "A second issue is whether the \u201cAmerica First\u201d president chooses to work more collaboratively with other nations over the coming year. In creating the prize, Swedish inventor and entrepreneur Alfred Nobel held that the winner should be someone who has \u201cdone the most or the best work for fraternity between nations,\u201d among other criteria.",
      "It doesn\u2019t help Trump\u2019s chances that he threatened to acquire Canada, Greenland and the Panama Canal, analysts said. Nor is the committee likely to reward him for pulling out of such cross-border endeavors as the Paris climate agreement or the World Health Organization, they said.",
      "K\u00e5re Aas, Norway\u2019s former ambassador to the U.S., said that Trump would be a \u201cstrong contender\u201d for the prize if he ends the Russia-Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas wars. Still, the president wouldn\u2019t be a shoo-in, he added.",
      "Trump\u2019s statements about absorbing Greenland and Canada \u201cwould also be considered by the committee,\u201d Aas said. \u201cThe committee doesn\u2019t necessarily give him the Nobel Peace Prize if there\u2019s peace in Gaza and Ukraine next year.\u201d"

      "\"I hope you understand that this is a movement; this is the achievement of a whole society. I'm just one person. I certainly do not deserve this,\" she said, learning of her accolade just minutes before it was made public. \"I'm honored, humbled and very grateful and behalf of the Venezuelan people.

      "William, 43, was speaking to campaigner Rhian Mannings at her home in south Wales. Mannings lost her one-year-old son, George suddenly in 2012 to an undiagnosed illness. Five days later, her husband Paul died by suicide. Mannings said Paul blamed himself for their son's death.",

      "\u201cI will forever go over those last few days with him wondering what I missed,\" Mannings says about her Paul's suicide. \"We were just so happy and I think this just shows it really can happen to anyone.\u201d",

      "Trump's announcement on Wednesday that Israel and Hamas have agreed to the first phase of a ceasefire deal was widely welcomed Thursday by world leaders, the families of hostages and Palestinians who have endured more than two years of war.",

      "A spokesperson for Netanyahu's office said Thursday that a ceasefire would take effect 24 hours after the Cabinet had agreed on the deal and hostages would be released after 72 hours.",
      "Separately, the United States military is preparing options to deploy as many as 200 U.S. troops to Israel to support stabilization in Gaza and the flow of humanitarian aid and security assistance into the enclave, two U.S. officials familiar with the planning said.",

      "\u201cThey will not be in Gaza. No U.S. boots on the ground in Gaza,\u201d one of the officials said.",

      "While many governments defended Israel's initial right to respond to the attack, the scale of civilian death and suffering wrought by its war have drawn increasing international condemnation and isolation for the Jewish state. Last month, the United Kingdom became the latest Western nation to recognize Palestine as a state, joining a majority of countries that now do so worldwide.",
      "Much of Gaza is now a rubble-strewn wasteland, with most of its buildings damaged or destroyed, according to the U.N. And the world's leading body on hunger, Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, has declared that a famine is now playing out inside the cramped territory.",
      "Israel's military operation has been deemed a genocide by a U.N. commission of inquiry, the world-leading International Association of Genocide Scholars, and human rights groups such as Amnesty International. Israel denies the charge, saying it is only attempting to destroy Hamas, which it blames for putting Palestinians in harm's way.",
      "After news arrived that the first ceasefire phase had been agreed to, some Palestinians on the ground inside Gaza were celebrating \u2014 cheering, dancing and singing, video showed.",

      "Ruby Chen, father of hostage Itay Chen, a U.S.-Israeli dual citizen, said on \"Stay Tuned NOW\" that while he shared this cautious hope, the captors had not \u201cprovided any sign of life\" for his son.",
      "Lasting agreement unclear",
      "While Hamas has agreed to participate in the hostage and prisoner exchange, it has not said it will disarm and disband \u2014 a key stipulation of Trump's proposal.",

      "The Israel Defense Forces said it was moving to \"adjusted deployment lines soon\" but warned that parts of Gaza were \"still considered a dangerous combat zone\" and that its troops were \"deployed and operating anywhere in the Strip.\"",
      "Israel shattered the previous ceasefire \u2014 which lasted from Jan. 19 to March 18 \u2014 by launching a barrage of deadly airstrikes that killed hundreds of Palestinians across the Gaza Strip, ending two months of relative calm and plunging Gaza into a renewed humanitarian crisis.",
      "Israel blamed Hamas for the resumption of hostilities, citing the militant group\u2019s refusal to meet Israel\u2019s demand to release more hostages."

    "summary": "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that ongoing negotiations between Hamas and Israel are not yet the end of the war",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Sunday on NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that ongoing negotiations between Hamas and Israel are not yet the end of the war and that setting up a group to govern Gaza would take \u201csome time,\u201d but emphasized that there was a plan to do so.",
      "It comes as Israel and Hamas appear to be inching closer to implementing a 20-point peace plan proposed by President Donald Trump.",
      "Asked by moderator Kristen Welker whether the peace negotiations mark the end of the war in Gaza, Rubio said, \u201cNot yet.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s some work that remains to be done,\u201d he said, pointing to ongoing meetings to determine the logistics of implementing a peace plan.",
      "\u201cEveryone has agreed, including Israel, that eventually, at some point here as this process plays out, Gaza will be governed by a Palestinian technocratic group that\u2019s not Hamas, that are not terrorists, with the help and the assistance and the guidance of an international consortium like the board of peace,\u201d Rubio said, echoing the language of the proposed peace plan.",
      "At the same time, Rubio said, \u201cYou can\u2019t set up a governance structure in Gaza that\u2019s not Hamas in three days.\u201d",
      "\u201cI mean, it takes some time,\u201d he said.",
      "The peace plan stipulates that Gaza would \u201cbe governed under the temporary transitional governance of a technocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee.\u201d The plan also provides that Hamas, which currently governs Gaza, would not have any role in governing in the future.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu publicly backed the peace plan, which includes the release of all Israeli hostages by Hamas, during a visit to the White House last week.",
      "Hamas has expressed a willingness to release all hostages, alive or dead, and plans to send a team on Sunday to Cairo, where more in-depth negotiations are slated to begin on Monday. Trump administration special envoy Steve Witkoff and the president\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner plan to attend on behalf of the U.S.",
      "The parties now need to determine, first, how hostages are released, and, second, how to create new Palestinian leadership.",
      "\u201cHow do you create this Palestinian technocratic leadership that\u2019s not Hamas, that\u2019s not terrorists, and with the help of the international community?\u201d Rubio said, laying out ongoing issues. \u201cHow do you disarm any sort of terrorist groups that are going to be building tunnels and conducting attacks against Israel?\u201d",
      "There are ongoing talks to determine logistically how hostages could be released, he said.",
      "\u201cYou have to make sure the Red Cross can get there, what time they\u2019re going to be there, where they\u2019re going to be,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cAll that has to be worked through.\u201d",
      "Asked whether hostages could be released as early as this week, Rubio said, \u201cWe want it to be as soon as possible.\u201d",
      "Trump has said that Israel agreed to withdraw to an initial line cutting through Gaza in order for the hostage deal to move forward. The initial withdrawal line, marked by a yellow line in a graphic posted by Trump, would withdraw the Israeli military to the outskirts of several major cities.",
      "Before Israel withdraws further, Rubio noted that the parties had to determine who would take control of the territory.",
      "\u201cWhen we ask Israel, \u2018OK, you\u2019re at the yellow line, now everything behind it you have to turn it over,\u2019 You have to have somebody to turn it over to,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cSo, I mean, let\u2019s be realistic here. You can\u2019t just set up a sort of new governance structure inside of Gaza in 72 hours.\u201d"
