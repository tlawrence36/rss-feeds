    "story": [
      "\"Downton Abbey: The Grand Finale\" brings change to the Crawley family as they face the 1930s",
      "Change comes slowly to the Downton Abbey universe and its Crawley family. Just watch Robert Crawley go flat-hunting in London.",
      "Wait, what? FLAT-HUNTING? The Earl of Grantham? Well, yes, and it\u2019s the most amusing scene in \u201cDownton Abbey: The Grand Finale\u201d (a self-announcing title if there ever was one).",
      "Just look at proud and starched Robert (Hugh Bonneville), trying to be open-minded but utterly flummoxed by this \u201cflat\u201d in which you cannot go \u201cup\u201d to bed because there is no \u201cup.\u201d Well, you can go \u201calong\u201d to bed, suggests daughter Mary (Michelle Dockery, as always the sensible center of things) trying to make it all sound manageable.",
      "But the prospect of flat-living \u2014 rather than maintaining a mansion in London \u2014 is a thing the Crawleys must consider as they move into the 1930s, with financial and social instability always around the corner. \u201cFamilies like us need to keep moving to survive,\u201d says Mary, with the weight of Downton Abbey\u2019s future itself resting on her shoulders.",
      "A note to those coming in cold to the franchise here: Well, it\u2019s going to be quite hard. Writer Julian Fellowes and director Simon Curtis do not engage in hand-holding when it comes to mastering the Crawley family tree or the broader family of servants that Downton fans know and love. Even those who saw the first two films \u2013 the last in 2022 \u2013 might feel the need for a refresher.",
      "We begin in London\u2019s West End, at a show by Noel Coward, attended by Downton inhabitants from all levels. They\u2019re all there to watch dashing actor Guy Dexter (Dominic West), who in the last movie asked former butler Thomas Barrow to become his dresser, and more. It\u2019s nice to see Barrow is happy now, able to live life as a gay man \u2014 even if Robert can\u2019t quite grasp their relationship (change is slow, remember).",
      "Meanwhile Mary is shopping in London with sister Edith, and the importance of this scene is perhaps to remind us that the real star of the \u201cDownton\u201d universe, after that stupendous house of course, are the costumes. Mary finds a sleek red satin gown that is quite possibly the most smashing outfit we\u2019ve seen yet.",
      "But when she puts it on for a society ball, trouble erupts. As the family arrives we learn that Mary\u2019s divorce decree has come through \u2014 and this means, alas, that she will become a pariah. The newspaper screams news of \u201cdivorce in high places,\u201d and indeed, the ball\u2019s hostess actually kicks Mary out of the party because royalty is coming. Mary\u2019s concerned parents are outraged \u2014 but they stay, and their daughter heads out, quipping that she hopes a taxi will agree to take her.",
      "Soon enough we\u2019re back at Downton, and there is one very big difference: no longer does Violet Crawley, aka Maggie Smith, with her inimitable style and those hilarious quips, rule the halls. She died in the last film \u2014 and Smith died in 2024. But the film is dedicated to her in more ways than one.",

      "Harold arrives from America with some unfortunate news \u2013 he\u2019s wasted away much of their family fortune. Accompanying him is friend Gus, a handsome and clever type \u2014 or so it seems \u2014 who has been advising Harold on his finances. Gus (Alessandro Nivola) worms his way into Mary\u2019s good graces, and more \u2014 but he may not be nearly as clever as he first appears.",
      "Then there\u2019s Simon Russell Beale as the pompous Hector, who tries to hold onto local tradition but runs up against Isobel (Penelope Wilton), and a charming Arty Froushan as Noel Coward himself. The playwright is the closest thing in Downton world to a modern celebrity \u2014 everyone wants to be with him, no matter station nor gender, and he winds up helping Mary overcome her social shunning.",
      "Nowhere to be seen is dashing Hugh Dancy, who played a film director (besotted with Mary) in the last movie. But the character that director anointed as a screenwriter, Joseph Moseley (Kevin Doyle), is back, and Fellowes must have enjoyed writing this line for him: \u201cIn many ways the writers are the stars of cinema.\u201d",
      "To be honest, the script veers from clever to extremely sappy, or to filler lines like \u201cI think I\u2019ll go get another cup.\u201d But kudos for moment a befuddled Robert describes the newfound phenomenon of an apartment building as \u201ca layer cake of strangers.\u201d",
      "\u201cSometimes I feel that the past is a more comfortable place than the future,\u201d someone says in a poignant moment. But this final movie will give loyal Downton fans what they want: a satisfying bit of closure and the sense that the future, though a bit scary, may look kindly on Downton Abbey as long as Mary is in charge. And as long as Smith\u2019s Violet, imposing in a front-hall portrait, is looking down from above.",
      "\u201cDownton Abbey: The Grand Finale,\u201d a Focus Features release, has been rated PG by the Motion Picture Association \u201c for suggestive material, smoking and some thematic elements.\u201c Running time: 123 minutes. Two and half stars out of four.",

      "Tantalizing details of those abandoned and unfinished ideas are revealed in Bowie\u2019s archive, which opens to the public this week.",
      "The 90,000 items acquired from Bowie\u2019s estate by London\u2019s Victoria and Albert Museum include handwritten notes for a movie in which Major Tom, the fictional astronaut \u201cfloating in a tin can far above the world\u201d in Bowie\u2019s song \u201cSpace Oddity,\u201d is sent to \u201ca disgruntled America.\u201d",
      "Curator Madeleine Haddon said the never-made film \u2014 titled \u201cYoung Americans,\u201d like Bowie\u2019s 1975 album of the same name \u2014 is \u201creflective on what it\u2019s like to be a Brit in the U.S., and thinking about international politics and their place in the world.\u201d",
      "Other might-have-beens include \u201cThe Spectator,\u201d a stage musical about an 18th-century London outlaw that Bowie was working on shortly before his death from cancer in January 2016 at the age of 69.",
      "It\u2019s about \u201cthe relationship between art and politics in London at the cusp of modernity,\u201d Haddon said Wednesday at a preview of V&A's David Bowie Centre. \u201cI would love to see where he was going with that.\u201d",
      "The center, which opens Saturday, is a treasure chest for Bowie fans and researchers, holding everything from stage outfits and musical instruments \u2013 a stringed Japanese koto, Ziggy Stardust\u2019s acoustic guitar \u2013 to letters, lyrics, photos, to-do lists and idea-filled sticky notes.",
      "The archive chronicles decades of restless creativity by the shape-shifting musician, who was born plain old David Jones in the London suburbs in 1947.",
      "Bowie donned and shed personas as he moved through musical styles, from glam rock to soul, electronica and collaborations with British jungle and drum \u2018n\u2019 bass musicians, including A Guy Called Gerald and Goldie. He also acted in movies and on Broadway, collaborated on stage shows, painted and embraced technology, setting up a 1990s internet service provider called BowieNet.",
      "\u201cHe was such a world-builder,\u201d Haddon said. \u201cMusic was (just) one angle into the worlds he wanted to build.\u201d",
      "The archive occupies part of the V&A East Storehouse, a hybrid warehouse-museum that opened in June in east London\u2019s Olympic Park.

      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to say when you look over all of history that there haven\u2019t been times in which that disagreement has been even more acute,\u201d she said, listing the Civil War, Vietnam war protests and the Great Depression.",
      "The book is being published Tuesday by Sentinel, a conservative imprint of Penguin Random House.",
      "Barrett wrote clearly on two topics that suggest some disagreement with the president. Trump signed an executive order last month requiring the Justice Department to investigate and prosecute people for burning the American flag, despite a 1989 high court decision protecting the act as political speech.",
      "Barrett wrote admiringly of the free-speech votes of Justices Anthony Kennedy and Antonin Scalia, for whom she once worked, despite their personal distaste for burning the flag.",
      "Without reference to Trump and his musings about seeking a third presidential term, Barrett also noted the clarity of the two-term limit added to the Constitution in 1951.",

      "\u201cIt's an ensemble of musicians who come somehow from making chamber music,\u201d Dohn\u00e1nyi said in a 2011 interview for the Cleveland Orchestra Musicians. \u201cThe real, very special (characteristic) about the Cleveland Orchestra is that people, musicians, are used to listen to each other very much.

      "From a record-breaking standing ovation to the ever-present Campari spritzes to even on-screen subtitles, the 2025 Venice Film Festival was a bounty of interesting numbers",
      "VENICE, Italy -- After 10 days and dozens of red carpet premieres, the 82nd edition of the Venice Film Festival came to a close Saturday. While cinema is focused on the qualitative, a quantitative look can tell a story of its own. There are, after all, plenty of fascinating figures \u2014 beyond the celebrity kind \u2014 to be found on the Lido.",
      "Here's a look at this year's Venice Film Festival, by the numbers.",
      "That figure includes 1,936 feature films, which cost 200 euros ($234) apiece to submit. To be eligible for selection, a film must have been completed after Sept. 7, 2024, and must be making its world premiere at Venice. The festival decides what section a selected film goes in.",
      "It amounts to slightly over 1% of the feature films submitted. The 21 movies were the ones eligible for awards like the Golden Lion, which was won this year by Jim Jarmusch's \u201cFather Mother Sister Bother.\u201d There were also 30 films making their world premieres at Venice, but out of competition, like Luca Guadagnino's \u201cAfter the Hunt.\u201d Nineteen films played in the Horizons (Orizzonti) sidebar, which has its own awards. The Venice Classics sidebar featured 18 restorations.",
      "Led by American director Alexander Payne, the jury included French director St\u00e9phane Briz\u00e9, Italian director Maura Delpero, Romanian director Cristian Mungiu, Iranian director Mohammad Rasoulof (he lives in exile in Germany), Brazilian actor Fernanda Torres and Chinese actor Zhao Tao. They decide the winners among the main competition.",
      "The applause meter at film festivals is notoriously faulty, calibrated differently outlet by outlet, but it was clear that the ovation for \u201cThe Voice of Hind Rajab\u201d was record-breaking and definitely over 20 minutes. Variety reported 22 and BBC had it at 23. Kaouther Ben Hania's movie easily surpassed last year's Golden Lion winner, Pedro Almod\u00f3var\u2019s \u201cThe Room Next Door,\u201d which had people on their feet for 18 minutes.",
      "Doing the math, that's definitely more than 82 years ago. The festival has been suspended or periodically taken different forms over the years, including during World War II \u2014 though it did go forward in 2020 amid the coronavirus pandemic.",
      "Selections hailed from far and wide, from the U.S., France and, of course, Italy, to Ecuador, Slovakia and Taipei.",
      "There's space for short films \u2014 20 minutes and under \u2014 and feature films \u2014 longer than 60 minutes \u2014 but woe betide the filmmaker who makes anything in between.",
      "That distinction belongs to Olivier Assayas\u2019 \u201cThe Wizard of the Kremlin,\u201d an adaptation of Giuliano da Empoli\u2019s bestselling book of the same name, in which Jude Law transforms into Vladimir Putin.",
      "The longest ovation went to the shortest film in competition, \u201cThe Voice of Hind Rajab.\u201d Ben Hania's film combines real audio from Hind Rajab, the Palestinian 6-year-old girl who was found dead days after her desperate call for rescue in Gaza, with actors portraying volunteers at the Red Crescent, where the movie is set.",
      "Israel's war in Gaza reverberated through the festival, with high-profile calls to disinvite Gerard Butler and Gal Gadot over the war and questions to filmmakers and actors about an indie film company\u2019s funding ties to the Israeli military. The Aug. 30 march in Venice aimed to turn the spotlight from the stars to the war, and organizers estimate that over 10,000 people turned out.",
      "Those Golden Lions went to Kim Novak, the 92-year-old legendary actor who starred in Alfred Hitchcock's \u201cVertigo,\u201d and Werner Herzog, the prolific 83-year-old German filmmaker whose works range from lauded documentaries like \u201cLittle Dieter Needs to Fly\u201d to the Nicolas Cage-starrer \u201cBad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans.\u201d (He also acts, as viewers of \u201cThe Mandalorian\u201d can attest.)",

      "The Venice Film Festival doesn't take place in the heart of the city, which would be the Piazza San Marco. Instead, it's on the Lido, a barrier island across the Venetian Lagoon. The Palazzo del Cinema, featuring three movie theaters, is the main headquarters of the festival. It takes 32 minutes to make the journey, by vaporetto, the public water bus. (For good measure, pun somewhat intended, 4.5 kilometers is just under 3 miles.)",
      "Over the decades, few tableaux are as glamorous as movies stars arriving, stylishly disheveled, by launch to the festival. Ferried to and from the Lido, celebrities, journalists and members of the public with passes cross the Venetian Lagoon. Should they fall overboard, they would contend with a depth of up to 71 feet (21 meters).",
      "The historic theater is home to the biggest screenings at the festival, as well as the awards ceremonies. It includes four additional spaces for people in wheelchairs.",

(All films are shown with English subtitles projected off-screen.) The festival's detailed subtitling guidelines suggest opting for white on-screen subtitles. And, yes, the festival has a preferred font. Much like the Microsoft Office of yore, it's Arial.",

      "NEW YORK -- Artificial intelligence company Anthropic has agreed to pay $1.5 billion to settle a class-action lawsuit by book authors who say the company took pirated copies of their works to train its chatbot.",
      "The landmark settlement, if approved by a judge as soon as Monday, could mark a turning point in legal battles between AI companies and the writers, visual artists and other creative professionals who accuse them of copyright infringement.",
      "The company has agreed to pay authors or publishers about $3,000 for each of an estimated 500,000 books covered by the settlement.",
      "\u201cAs best as we can tell, it\u2019s the largest copyright recovery ever,\u201d said Justin Nelson, a lawyer for the authors. \u201cIt is the first of its kind in the AI era.\u201d",
      "A trio of authors \u2014 thriller novelist Andrea Bartz and nonfiction writers Charles Graeber and Kirk Wallace Johnson \u2014 sued last year and now represent a broader group of writers and publishers whose books Anthropic downloaded to train its chatbot Claude.",
      "A federal judge dealt the case a mixed ruling in June, finding that training AI chatbots on copyrighted books wasn\u2019t illegal but that Anthropic wrongfully acquired millions of books through pirate websites.",
      "If Anthropic had not settled, experts say losing the case after a scheduled December trial could have cost the San Francisco-based company even more money.",
      "\u201cWe were looking at a strong possibility of multiple billions of dollars, enough to potentially cripple or even put Anthropic out of business,\u201d said William Long, a legal analyst for Wolters Kluwer.",
      "U.S. District Judge William Alsup of San Francisco has scheduled a Monday hearing to review the settlement terms.",
      "Anthropic said in a statement Friday that the settlement, if approved, \u201cwill resolve the plaintiffs\u2019 remaining legacy claims.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe remain committed to developing safe AI systems that help people and organizations extend their capabilities, advance scientific discovery, and solve complex problems,\u201d said Aparna Sridhar, the company's deputy general counsel.",
      "As part of the settlement, the company has also agreed to destroy the original book files it downloaded.",

      "Alsup\u2019s June ruling found that Anthropic had downloaded more than 7 million digitized books that it \u201cknew had been pirated.\u201d It started with nearly 200,000 from an online library called Books3, assembled by AI researchers outside of OpenAI to match the vast collections on which ChatGPT was trained.",
      "Debut thriller novel \u201cThe Lost Night\u201d by Bartz, a lead plaintiff in the case, was among those found in the dataset.",

The settlement's higher award \u2014 approximately $3,000 per work \u2014 likely reflects a smaller pool of affected books, after taking out duplicates and those without copyright.",
      "On Friday, Mary Rasenberger, CEO of the Authors Guild, called the settlement \u201can excellent result for authors, publishers, and rightsholders generally, sending a strong message to the AI industry that there are serious consequences when they pirate authors\u2019 works to train their AI, robbing those least able to afford it.\u201d",

      "The privately held Anthropic, founded by ex-OpenAI leaders in 2021, earlier this week put its value at $183 billion after raising another $13 billion in investments.",
      "Anthropic also said it expects to make $5 billion in sales this year, but, like OpenAI and many other AI startups, it has never reported making a profit, relying instead on investors to back the high costs of developing AI technology for the expectation of future payoffs.",
      "The settlement could influence other disputes, including an ongoing lawsuit by authors and newspapers against OpenAI and its business partner Microsoft, and cases against Metaand Midjourney. And just as the Anthropic settlement terms were filed, another group of authors sued Apple on Friday in the same San Francisco federal court.",
      "\u201cThis indicates that maybe for other cases, it\u2019s possible for creators and AI companies to reach settlements without having to essentially go for broke in court,\u201d said Long, the legal analyst.",
      "The industry, including Anthropic, had largely praised Alsup\u2019s June ruling because he found that training AI systems on copyrighted works so chatbots can produce their own passages of text qualified as \u201cfair use\u201d under U.S. copyright law because it was \u201cquintessentially transformative.\u201d",
      "Comparing the AI model to \u201cany reader aspiring to be a writer,\u201d Alsup wrote that Anthropic \"trained upon works not to race ahead and replicate or supplant them \u2014 but to turn a hard corner and create something different.\"",
      "But documents disclosed in court showed Anthropic employees\u2019 internal concerns about the legality of their use of pirate sites. The company later shifted its approach and hired Tom Turvey, the former Google executive in charge of Google Books, a searchable library of digitized books that successfully weathered years of copyright battles.",
      "With his help, Anthropic began buying books in bulk, tearing off the bindings and scanning each page before feeding the digitized versions into its AI model, according to court documents. That was legal but didn\u2019t undo the earlier piracy, according to the judge.",

      "SAO PAULO -- Taylor Swift is very likely not aware of it, but she's considered a good luck charm for the Brazilian soccer team hosting Friday's game between the Kansas City Chiefs and Los Angeles Chargers.",
      "The unlikely connection between the pop superstar \u2014 whose fianc\u00e9 is Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce \u2014 and one of the most popular clubs in soccer-mad Brazil lies in the release date of her albums dating to 2006. Corinthians has gone unbeaten in all but one game played right before each album release since then and all but one right after.",
      "It all started as a joke about five years ago, but it has developed into a superstition for local fans.",
      "Until last year, Corinthians won 13 matches and drew seven in such instances. Some were against bitter rival Palmeiras and Brazilian social media was flooded with memes and montages of Swift wearing black and white \u2014 Corinthians' colors.",
      "Many Corinthians fans could have tossed their expectations after their team lost both the match prior to the release of \u201cThe Tortured Poets Department\u201d and the one following. But the NFL game in Sao Paulo, which could draw Swift to NeoQuimica Arena, has kept the Swiftie vibe alive among many local supporters.",
      "\u201cI laughed at first, but there\u2019s more coincidences. Taylor\u2019s first contract was signed on Sept. 1, that\u2019s the same day Corinthians was founded in 1910,\u201d said Rebeca Gois, 32, a marketing writer who lives near the stadium and is a Swift fan. \u201cIt has become a thing. Whenever there\u2019s a new album, we have a double joy; new Taylor songs and Corinthians unbeaten before and after that.\u201d",
      "That long run has encouraged Corinthians fans to think of the singer as an honorary supporter. Some have worn Swift costumes during games.",
      "Gavioes da Fiel, a Corinthians-linked samba school that parades in Sao Paulo's Carnival, jokingly invited Swift to join them in the festivities in 2022.",
      "Swift was in Brazil in 2012 to promote her album \u201cRed\u201d and then in 2023 with six concerts in Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo during the Eras Tour. She has yet to appear at Corinthians stadium.",
      "Nataly Nascimento, a hardcore Corinthians Swiftie, said the trend got a boost after Swift had all her three concerts in Sao Paulo at the Allianz Parque, the stadium of their archrival Palmeiras.",
      "\u201cPeople started to look for that connection to tease Palmeiras fans. And then Corinthians fans started finding those links,\u201d said Nascimento, a 25-year-old teacher who lives in Brazil's Northeast and won't attend. \u201cBut there's something bigger. In the same way that Corinthians fans are much more passionate about their club, Swifties feel that about Taylor. It is mystical.\u201d",

      "While other fashion empires make their money on handbags and footwear, Armani\u2019s appeal has always been in the apparel, the core of his $10 billion empire.",
      "After his death Thursday at the age of 91, Armani has been remembered for softening the 1980s power suit, decades of fruitful Hollywood collaborations and as a defining figure of Italian luxury ready-to-wear.",
      "But he was also a keen business owner who maintained his independence in an era of consolidation, an innovative communicator and a boss who was in charge of every aspect of his business.",
      "\u201cI have to say, King George is the first in everything. The first but not the only,\u2019\u2019 said Mario Boselli, who was president of the Italian fashion chamber from 1999-2015. \u201cHe was the master of luxury ready-to-wear.\u201d",
      "The deconstructed, soft-shouldered Armani jacket catapulted Armani to fashion stardom, first with Richard Gere in the 1980 film \u201cAmerican Gigolo,\u2019\u2019 and then as the centerpiece of a women\u2019s wardrobe.",
      "\u201cI would say that the famous Armani jacket was a discovery that allowed women to live every day with an Armani garment that could go from work to dates. Armani could dress a woman from morning to evening, I would say with great precision, for every occasion,\u2019\u2019 Boselli said.",
      "Armani himself said in his 2015 memoir he wanted to create \u201ca new kind of femininity that forced men to look at women with new eyes.\u2019\u2019",
      "\u201cI have great esteem for women. I think they know how to be seductive without resorting to an exhibitionism that easily slips into vulgarity and excess,\u2019\u2019 Armani wrote. He credited American women as \u201cthe first to appreciate my work \u2014 and my audacity.\u2019\u2019",
      "Jackets remained the core of his collections through the decades. But with time he introduced more couture elements into his ready-to-wear in part to counter his image as the power suit designer, said Scott Schuman, the Milan-based photographer behind The Sartorialist fashion blog and the creator of the Armani tribute Instagram account @armaniarchive.",
      "Every collection started with a cascade of textiles on a huge table, which Armani himself would examine after his team made a first selection.",
      "\u201cThe collection, and the mood and the vibe started from the fabrics,\u2019\u2019 said Milan-based Austrian designer Arthur Arbesser, who was on the Armani design team for seven years until leaving in 2013 to launch his own brand.",
      "\u201cThat was unique, I learned from him what it was to touch the fabrics, then to come in with another fabric and with another shade to form a gradient of colors,\u2019\u2019 Arbesser said.",
      "Boselli first met Armani 45 years ago, arriving at his Borgnonuovo offices with a satchel of jersey knit samples as a sales rep for his family\u2019s textile company.",
      "\u201cHe saw the entire collection of fabrics, and chose them personally,\u2019\u2019 Boselli recalled. \u201cThat is not something everyone does. It takes time, it takes care. He had great respect for the work of others.\u2019\u2019",
      "Shuman said the fabric choices made going into Armani's stores \u201ca sensory overload.\u201d",

But Armani always had a following, from Hollywood stars who could count on him for stunning looks without too much risk, to everyday people who sought well-made, tailored looks to project them from morning to evening.",
      "\u201cArmani was a beautiful river of design. You could pop in and out, and there was some kind of continuity,\u2019\u2019 Schuman said.",
      "Kenneth Richard, founder of The Impression, an influential fashion newsletter, called Armani \"the original game-changer,'' for the scale of a fashion empire he built himself, and for extending his brand into areas like home decor and hotels while maintaining his famed attention to detail.",
      "\u201cYou can check into an Armani hotel, get fitted downstairs and go to a red carpet event. Where else can you do this? You are sleeping on Armani sheets, in an Armani bed, with an Armani couch,'' Richard said. And all of it is owned by Armani, not licensed as many brands do.",
      "On the runway, Armani \u201cstuck to a singular voice through 50 years.\u201d",
      "\u201cHis aesthetic was refined, and approachable. You cannot become a $10 billion brand when you are consistently doing the same thing over and over again, without being approachable. He sells. People want to wear his clothing.\u201d",
      "Giorgio Armani's final collection will be previewed during Milan Fashion Week later this month during an event marking 50 years of his signature fashion house.",
      "Armani set up a foundation as a succession tool to avoid his businesses being split up. A rarity in the Italian fashion world, he never sold even a part of his company to an outsider.",
      "He also indicated the creative succession would go to longtime collaborator Leo Dell\u2019Orco and his niece Silvana Armani, who have headed the menswear and womenswear collections, respectively, for all Armani collections: Giorgio Armani, Emporio Armani and Armani Exchange.",
      "The question of generational succession has always been a fraught one in Italy's largely family run fashion industry. Armani's attention to every detail in the empire he launched 50 years ago will make him a tough act to follow.",
      "\u201cHe was involved in very step of the process from the very beginning to the end. Every photograph, every font, everything,'' Arbesser said. \"That is what makes a difference. These days, there is no boss, no creative director, who has so much control over everything. That is where the magic is. And that is where it is hard to see what is going to happen now.\u201d",

      "The Justice Department said the information was needed to investigate possible fraud or unlawful off-label promotion of drugs, but the information requested \u2014 including actual patient records \u2014 seemed to be unrelated, the judge said.

      "\u201cThe Administration has been explicit about its disapproval of the transgender community and its aim to end GAC,\u201d Joun wrote, referring to gender-affirming care. The judge later continued, \u201cIt is abundantly clear that the true purpose of issuing the subpoena is to interfere with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts' right to protect GAC within its borders, to harass and intimidate BCH to stop providing such care, and to dissuade patients from seeking such care.\u201d",
      "Just eight days after taking office, President Donald Trump issued an executive order aimed at restricting access to medical care for transgender youth. In June, the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Division announced the division would use \u201call available resources to prioritize investigations of doctors, hospitals, pharmaceutical companies, and other appropriate entities,\u201d in an effort to investigate what it called \u201cradical gender experimentation.\u201d",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi announced in a statement July 9 that the Justice Department had sent more than 20 subpoenas to doctors and clinics that provide care to transgender patients under 18. Bondi said the requests were part of investigations into \u201chealthcare fraud, false statements, and more.\u201d But the requests did not just seek information on policies or billing practices \u2014 they also demanded information about individual patients who had been prescribed puberty blockers or hormone therapy.",
      "Boston Children's Hospital asked the federal court to quash the subpoena on July 8, saying the Justice Department was seeking practically every document related to the provision of gender-affirming care over the past five and a half years, including highly sensitive and personally identifiable information about young patients.",

The church was full of students from the affiliated Annunciation Catholic School who had gathered for their first Mass of the academic year. Two students were killed, and 21 people were injured.",
      "The shooter died by suicide, police said.",
      "Sophia remains in intensive care at Hennepin Healthcare, a trauma hospital that has treated many of the victims. Her neurosurgeon, Dr. Walt Galicich, said at a news conference that a bullet, which remains lodged in her brain, caused severe damage, including to a major blood vessel. Surgeons had to remove the left half of her skull to relieve the pressure inside her head.",
      "\u201cIf you had told me at this juncture, 10 days later, that we\u2019d be standing here with any ray of hope, I would have said it would take a miracle,\u201d Galicich told reporters. He said they are banking on the ability of young brains to heal and make up for the damage.",
      "Sophia is still being kept in a medically induced coma most of the time to control the swelling, Galicich said. She is opening her eyes and showing some level of awareness of her surroundings, and has some slight movement in her right leg, but she\u2019s still not responding to commands, he said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s day by day, and I can\u2019t tell you how this is going to end,\" the doctor said. \"I know she\u2019s had a stroke from that injury to that blood vessel. I don\u2019t know what her permanent deficits are going to be. But we\u2019re a little bit more optimistic that she\u2019s going to survive.\u201d",
      "The girl's father, Tom Forchas, called her \u201cmy precious angel.\u201d",

      "Forchas said Sophia's 9-year-old brother was also in the church but wasn't hit.

      "International officials say contaminated metal at an industrial site in Indonesia could be the source of radioactive material behind recalls of imported shrimp",
      "Contaminated metal at an industrial site in Indonesia may be the source of radioactive material that led to massive recalls of imported frozen shrimp, international nuclear safety officials say, as efforts are underway to halt more U.S.-bound shipments.",
      "The International Atomic Energy Agency said Friday that officials are in \u201cconstant contact\u201d with Indonesian nuclear regulators who have detected Cesium-137, a radioactive isotope, at a processing plant that sent millions of pounds of shrimp to the U.S.",
      "\u201cPreliminary information suggests that it may have originated from activities at a metal melting facility at the same industrial site or from the disposal of scrap metal junk to other areas of the site,\u201d IAEA spokesperson Fredrik Dahl said in an email.",
      "No U.S. investigators have been sent to the site in Serang, west of Jakarta, federal officials said.",
      "Meanwhile, the company that exported the shrimp, PT Bahari Makmur Sejati, also known as BMS Foods, has recalled more than 300 shipping containers that were already on their way to the U.S., Dahl said.",
      "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration warned last month that Cesium-137 was detected in shipping containers sent to four U.S. ports, and in a sample of imported frozen shrimp. That spurred multiple recalls of shrimp sold at Walmart, Kroger and other stores.",
      "This week, additional recalls were issued by Tampa Maid Foods LLC, of Florida, for breaded butterfly shrimp sold under Admiral of the Fleet, Portico Seafood Classic and other labels.",
      "None of the shrimp that triggered alerts or tested positive for Cesium-137 was released for sale, the FDA said. But other shipments sent to stores may have been manufactured under conditions that allowed the products to become contaminated, the agency said.",
      "The risk appears to be small, but the shrimp could pose a \u201cpotential health concern\u201d for people exposed to low levels of Cesium-137 over time, FDA officials said.",
      "The FDA issued an import alert for shrimp from BMS Foods to stop the products from coming into the U.S.",
      "The company sent about 12 million pounds of shrimp to U.S. ports in Los Angeles, Houston, Miami and Savannah, Georgia, in July and August, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection records obtained by Import Genius, a trade data analysis company.",

      "The level of Cesium-137 detected in the frozen shrimp was about 68 becquerels per kilogram, a measure of radioactivity. That is far below the FDA\u2019s level of 1,200 becquerels per kilogram that could trigger the need for health protections.",
      "Still, it is unusual to see that concentration of Cesium-137 in shrimp, said Steve Biegalski, a nuclear medicine expert at the Georgia Institute of Technology.",
      "It\u2019s possible that the contamination could have come from recycling old medical equipment that contained Cesium-137, Biegalski said. The material has been used in medical devices to reduce blood contamination and to treat cancer, for instance.",
      "When such equipment is no longer useful, it can be recycled. But if the Cesium-137 isn\u2019t properly removed, radioactive material can be released into the environment.",

      "HONG KONG -- Hong Kong lawmakers on Wednesday voted down a bill that would have granted recognition to same-sex partnerships in the Chinese city, despite the rights offered being limited, in a major setback to the LGBTQ+ movement.",
      "The Registration of Same-Sex Partnerships Bill, unveiled in July, stemmed from one of the legal victories that pushed the government to offer more equal rights to gays and lesbians. However, the bill met fierce opposition from lawmakers, even though it followed the top court\u2019s 2023 ruling that the government should provide a framework for recognizing such relationships.",
      "The staunch opposition from lawmakers was a rare sight since the government overhauled its electoral rules that effectively filled the legislature with Beijing loyalists. It was the first government bill to be voted down since the overhaul.",
      "The bill proposed to allow residents who have already formed unions overseas to register their partnerships locally and grant them rights in handling medical and after-death matters for their loved ones. That includes the ability to access their partners\u2019 medical information and participate in medical decisions with consent, and claim their deceased partners\u2019 remains.",
      "Some lawmakers suggested using individual policies or administrative measures to resolve the challenges facing same-sex couples, instead of through such legislation. Others insisted voting down would not amount to a constitutional crisis and would instead show the legislature is not a rubber stamp.",
      "Lawmaker Holden Chow from the city's biggest pro-establishment party said that the bill's passage would mean opening \u201ca Pandora's box,\u201d and \u201csubverting Hong Kong\u2019s marriage system between one man and one woman.\u201d",
      "Another legislator, Junius Ho, said the bill would cause the entire society to become restless for the sake of a small group of people.",
      "Outside government headquarters near the legislature, two women laid out a banner promoting the traditional marriage system.",
      "Many gay rights advocates were unhappy that the rights would only be available to those who registered their unions overseas, and would be limited. But some pragmatically supported and rallied for its passage.",
      "Last Friday, Hong Kong Marriage Equality, a nongovernmental organization, warned in a statement that rejecting the bill would undermine the city\u2019s commitment to fairness and inclusivity. It would also send a wrong signal to the international community, it said.",
      "It argued that the results of public opinion submissions \u2014 which the government previously reported as 80% opposing the bill \u2014 did not accurately reflect public sentiment. It noted that about half of the publicly viewable submissions against the bill used standardized templates, which suggested \u201cstrong mobilization by specific groups.\u201d",

      "The growing acceptance came as multiple legal challenges won more equal rights for same-sex couples, ranging from dependent visas to subsidized housing benefits. On Tuesday, the Court of First Instance ruled in favor of a lesbian couple\u2019s parental recognition of their son born through reciprocal in vitro fertilization.",
      "In a previous legislative debate, Solicitor General Llewellyn Mui stated that even if the bill is rejected, the court ruling would remain valid in principle, and the government would be duty-bound to fulfill its obligations to the best of its ability.",
      "The government previously said its proposal represents the \u201cgreatest common denominator\u201d deemed acceptable to the public and that the framework would not be equal to marriage. It argued that requiring overseas registration would provide an objective way to verify committed partnerships.",

      "An agreement between Tehran and the U.N. nuclear watchdog provides for U.N. inspectors to access all of Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities",
      "VIENNA -- An agreement between Tehran and the United Nations' atomic watchdog will provide the U.N. agency access to all of Iran's nuclear facilities and require Iran to report on the whereabouts of material that was at sites attacked by Israel earlier this year, the head of the agency said Wednesday.",
      "The accord was announced Tuesday after a meeting between International Atomic Energy Agency Director General Rafael Grossi, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty.",
      "Details of the agreement were not immediately released. In an address Wednesday to his agency's board of governors in Vienna, Grossi said the document \u201cprovides for a clear understanding for the procedures of inspection notifications and their implementation.\u201d",
      "The agreement \u201cincludes all facilities and installations in Iran and it also contemplates the required reporting on all the attacked facilities including the nuclear material present at those,\" Grossi added, noting it will \"open the way for the respective inspections and access\u201d without specifying when that would happen.",
      "\"The technical nature of this document does not diminish its profound significance. Iran and the agency will now resume cooperation in a respective and comprehensive way. These practical steps, allow me to state the obvious, need to be implemented now,\" Grossi told the board of governors.",
      "President Masoud Pezeshkian on July 2 signed a law adopted by Iran's Parliament suspending all cooperation with the U.N. nuclear watchdog. That followed Israel\u2019s 12-day war with Iran in June, during which Israel and the U.S. struck Iranian nuclear sites.",
      "IAEA inspectors have been unable to verify Iran\u2019s near bomb-grade stockpile since the start of the war, which the U.N. nuclear watchdog has described as \u201ca matter of serious concern.\u201d A confidential report by the Vienna-based IAEA said that as of June 13, Iran had 440.9 kilograms (972 pounds) of uranium enriched up to 60%.",
      "If enriched to 90%, the uranium would be enough to make 10 nuclear weapons, according to an IAEA yardstick, though creating an actual weapon would require other expertise such as adding a detonation device.",
      "The only site inspected by the IAEA since the war has been the Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant, which operates with Russian technical assistance. Inspectors watched a fuel replacement procedure at the plant over two days starting Aug. 27.",
      "Araghchi said Tuesday that the agreement addresses his country\u2019s concerns and security challenges and lays out technical requirements for cooperation with the IAEA. But he warned that in the event of \u201cany hostile act\u201d against Iran, including the reimposition of U.N. sanctions, Tehran would regard the agreement with the IAEA as terminated.",
      "The meeting came at a sensitive time as France, Germany and the United Kingdom on Aug. 28 began the process of reimposing sanctions on Iran over what they have deemed non-compliance with a 2015 agreement aimed at preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons.",

      "LONDON -- British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Wednesday that he has \u201cconfidence\u201d in the country's ambassador to the United States, who faces mounting criticism of his links to the convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "Starmer's defense of Peter Mandelson came after Democrats on the House Oversight Committee released a 50th birthday album compiled in 2003 for Epstein, who at the time was a wealthy and well-connected financier. In that album, Mandelson \u2014 in a handwritten note \u2014 called Epstein \u201cmy best pal.\u201d",
      "Other alleged contributors to the album that was compiled by British convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell were President Donald Trump, former President Bill Clinton and attorney Alan Dershowitz in a \u201cfriends\u201d section, and included other letters with sexually provocative language.",
      "Mandelson, who took on the prestigious diplomatic role earlier this year in the wake of the Labour Party's election victory in July 2024, has admitted knowing Epstein well and told The Sun newspaper that the comments he wrote were \u201cvery embarrassing to see and to read.\u201d",
      "Insisting that he has a \u201ctremendous sense, a profound sense of sympathy\" for Epstein's victims, Mandelson said his comments were written before Epstein was indicted and that he did not have a business relationship with him.",
      "Epstein took his own life in prison in August 2019 while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges, more than a decade after his conviction for soliciting prostitution from a minor.",
      "\u201cI never saw any evidence of criminal activity,\u201d he said. \u201cPerhaps it\u2019s because I\u2019m a gay man, perhaps when I knew him, perhaps when I was associated with him those years ago, as I did with my then partner and now husband, we never, ever saw any evidence or sign of this activity, which has since come to light.\"",
      "The revelations about Mandelson's links with Epstein prompted Kemi Badenoch, leader of the main opposition Conservative Party, to ask Starmer whether the position of the U.S. ambassador was \"tenable.\"",
      "Starmer said Mandelson, 71, has \u201crepeatedly expressed his deep regret\u201d for his association with Epstein.",

      "Nevertheless, groups of protesters repeatedly tried to block Paris' beltway during the morning rush hour on Wednesday. They erected barricades and hurled objects at police officers, blocked and slowed traffic and carried out other protest actions.

      "Kramatorsk, by contrast, still shows signs of life. Just 25 kilometers (15 miles) to the north, the prewar population of 147,000 has thinned, but restaurants and cafes remain open.

Just look at Kostiantynivka \u2014 not long ago, life there was normal. And now ...\u201d",

      "Thaksin Shinawatra, the billionaire former prime minister of Thailand, remains one of the country\u2019s most influential and controversial figures nearly two decades after being ousted in a 2006 military coup",
      "BANGKOK -- BANGKOK (AP) \u2014 Thaksin Shinawatra, the billionaire former prime minister of Thailand, remains one of the country\u2019s most influential and controversial figures nearly two decades after being ousted in a 2006 military coup. His political journey, marked by unprecedented popularity, a dramatic fall from power, years in self-imposed exile and a high-profile return, continues to shape Thailand\u2019s political landscape.",
      "Thaksin's dramatic path took another turn Tuesday when the Supreme Court ruled that he must serve a one-year prison term for previous convictions on graft and abuse of power charges, after investigating whether officials had mishandled his return to Thailand in 2023 to begin serving the sentences.",
      "Last month, he defied expectations when a court that has historically leaned against him and his political machine acquitted him of royal defamation, an offense that could have sent him to prison for up to 15 years.",
      "Despite powerful enemies in the Thai establishment and criminal convictions for corruption, he had avoided prison by going into exile after his ouster. His return had seemed to signal an accommodation with his opponents.",
      "He was insistent on maintaining a high public profile and was seen as the real power directing the government that was formed as he returned, especially when his daughter, Paetongtarn Shinawatra, became prime minister last year. It appeared to keep his old enmities alive and embroiled him in legal challenges from those wishing to curb his influence.",
      "The Shinawatra family is prominent in the northern city of Chiang Mai, where Thaksin was born to a mercantile family in 1949. After a career in public service as a police colonel, Thaksin became a business entrepreneur in the late 1970s. He built a telecommunications empire starting with Advanced Info Systems, an early mobile phone service provider and the primary source of his fortune.",
      "He entered politics in 1994, holding Cabinet posts before establishing the Thai Rak Thai Party in 1998. Using his fortune to build a nationwide political machine, he promoted populist policies that resonated with lower-income citizens, especially in the countryside.",
      "His platform promised to spread economic growth and bridge the wealth gap, with signature policies including universal healthcare and village development funds. This led to landslide victories for his party in 2001 and 2005, making him the first elected Thai prime minister to complete a four-year term and the country\u2019s longest-serving democratically elected leader.",
      "However, Thaksin\u2019s massive popularity and electoral support rocked Thailand\u2019s established political order. This earned him powerful enemies among conservative forces, including the army and the courts, which saw him as a threat to the monarchy, the bedrock of Thai identity, as well as to their own influence.",
      "He also faced criticism for his imperious CEO-style governance, intolerance of criticism, especially from the media, and failure to distance his business interests from government policy. His administration was also blamed for setting off a persistent Muslim insurgency in Thailand's southern provinces and for what human rights advocates said were more than 2,000 extrajudicial killings during his war on drugs.",
      "His second term was cut short by a military coup in 2006 while he was abroad. Opponents accused him of corruption, abuse of power, and disrespecting then-King Bhumibol Adulyadej, and hounded him with legal cases that he characterized as politically motivated.",
      "Thaksin\u2019s ouster triggered nearly two decades of deep political polarization, pitting his supporters against opponents, including better-off urban dwellers, ardent royalists and the military. He briefly returned in 2008 to face charges but skipped bail and fled abroad again, commencing a self-imposed exile lasting over a decade.",

      "His supporters, the \u201cRed Shirts,\u201d engaged in militant street actions, countering \u201cYellow Shirt\u201d royalists, with both sides responsible for street violence.",
      "His sister, Yingluck Shinawatra, continued the family\u2019s legacy, leading the Pheu Thai Party to victory in 2011 and becoming Thailand\u2019s first female prime minister. Her government\u2019s proposed amnesty for Thaksin triggered protests, leading to another military coup in 2014 \u2014 and driving Yingluck into exile as well.",
      "While in exile, Thaksin, who had his Thai passport revoked, obtained another from Montenegro through investment and spent significant time in Dubai. He also purchased and sold the Manchester City Football Club and invested in mining in Africa.",
      "Thaksin\u2019s return became possible after the progressive Move Forward Party\u2019s victory in 2023 rattled the establishment that had so abhorred him. This led to what many called a \u201cself-serving deal\u201d between Thaksin and his former conservative foes, a move that alienated many supporters even as it returned Pheu Thai to power while keeping Move Forward out of government.",
      "His dramatic return to Bangkok in August 2023 occurred on the same day Pheu Thai formed a new coalition government, after royalist Senators refused to endorse Move Forward's mandate from the voters.",
      "Upon his return, Thaksin was sentenced to an eight-year prison term for corruption but was immediately transferred to a fancy hospital suite due to ill health, a diagnosis regarded with skepticism by many. His sentence was reduced to a single year by King Maha Vajiralongkorn, and he was released on parole in February 2024 after six months.",
      "Critics questioned his illness, viewing his abbreviated stay as a \u201cspecial privilege.\u201d Tuesday's Supreme Court ruling said his transfer to the hospital did not follow proper procedures and that his health condition could not justify his extended stay there.",
      "Since his release from hospital, Thaksin has maintained a high public profile, traveling around the country and offering political observations. He is widely considered the de facto leader of Pheu Thai and the power behind its government.",
      "However, his daughter Paetongtarn was ousted as prime minister last month after a court found her guilty of an ethics violation for a politically compromising phone call with Cambodian Senate President Hun Sen.",
      "Pheu Thai exited its two years in power after Parliament last week confirmed a candidate from a rival party as the new prime minister. Many see this as a major blow to the political influence Thaksin has wielded for more than two decades.",

      "Nepal\u2019s government has faced violent protests over a ban on popular social media platforms, leading to police use of deadly force and the resignation of the prime minister",
      "KATHMANDU, Nepal -- KATHMANDU, Nepal (AP) \u2014 Nepal\u2019s government responded to escalating violent protests over a ban on popular social media platforms with deadly force. The public outrage over the ban and the deaths of 19 protesters on Monday led to the resignation of the prime minister and exposed deep discontent over corruption.",
      "Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli also rolled backed the short-lived ban after protesters turned their anger on politicians by setting fire to homes of some of the country\u2019s top leaders.",
      "Led by mostly teenagers and young adults, the protests revealed a broader resentment in Nepal, where many people have increasingly become angry with the government over a range of issues, mostly to do with corruption and frustration over nepotism in the country\u2019s politics.",
      "\u201cProtests over the social media ban were just a catalyst. Frustrations over how the country is being run have long been simmering under the surface. People are very angry and Nepal finds itself in a very precarious situation,\u201d said Prateek Pradhan, editor of Baahrakhari, a Nepalese independent news website.",
      "Demonstrations in Nepal have been called the protest of Gen Z, which generally refers to people born between 1995 and 2010. They were largely in response to the ban that went into effect last week and government\u2019s larger attempt to regulate social media through a bill that requires platforms to register and submit to local oversight and regulations.",
      "The bill, which has not yet been fully debated in parliament, has been widely criticized as a tool for censorship and punishing opponents who voice their protests online. Rights groups have called it an attempt by the government to curb freedom of expression and violate fundamental rights.",
      "At the same time, the protests were also a tipping point of a longstanding sentiment against politicians, their families and concerns over corruption.",
      "In the weeks before the ban, a social media campaign \u2014 particularly on video-sharing platform TikTok \u2014 spotlighted the lavish lifestyles of politicians\u2019 children, highlighting disparities between Nepal\u2019s rich and poor. Protesters criticized them of flaunting their luxury possessions in a country where the per capita income is $1,400 a year.",
      "Widespread criticism over government\u2019s failure to pursue some major corruption cases and create more economic opportunities for the youth also added to the anger. The youth unemployment rate in Nepal was 20% last year, according to the World Bank.",
      "\u201cAll these issues have made the youth of Nepal dissatisfied. They saw no other option but to take to the streets,\u201d said Pradhan.",
      "The unrest is the worst in decades in the Himalayan nation that is wedged between India and China. It is also far violent than the one in 2006, when an uprising forced Nepal\u2019s former king to give up his authoritarian rule. At least 18 people were killed in the violence. Two years later the parliament voted to abolish the monarchy.",

      "British horse racing has gone ahead with its unprecedented one-day strike to protest a feared rise in taxes on race betting",
      "LONDON -- British horse racing went ahead Wednesday with its unprecedented one-day strike to protest a feared rise in taxes on race betting, with a top official in the sport urging the industry to \u201cstand together\u201d and \u201cmake their voices heard.\u201d",
      "Four scheduled meetings \u2014 at Carlisle, Uttoxeter, Lingfield and Kempton \u2014 have been canceled and rescheduled after agreements between the owners of the courses and the British Horseracing Authority, making it the first time the sport in Britain has voluntarily refused to race in modern history.",
      "The BHA set up the \u201cAxe the Racing Tax\u201d campaign in response to proposals to replace the existing three-tax structure of online gambling duties with a single tax, with fears the current 15% duty on racing could be increased to the 21% levied on games of chance.",
      "Economic analysis commissioned by the BHA says such a rise could cost the sport at least 66 million pounds ($90 million) and put around 2,750 jobs at risk in the first year, in what BHA chairman Charles Allen described as \u201cnothing short of an existential threat for our sport.\u201d",

      "The audit will focus on the agency's reports on inflation and employment, a Wednesday letter to BLS acting commissioner William Wiatrowski said. Both reports are considered definitive measures of those two key aspects of the U.S. economy. The letter was from Laura Nicolosi, assistant inspector general for audit at the Labor Department's inspector general.",
      "The audit is the latest example of increasing scrutiny of the BLS as its recent jobs reports have shown a sharp slowdown in hiring over the summer. The agency has also made steep downward revisions in previously-published estimates of jobs and hiring, causing President Donald Trump to denounce the agency and to fire its commissioner last month.",
      "On Tuesday, the BLS released annual revisions to its employment figures that showed there were 911,000 fewer jobs created in the year ending in March 2025, a deep reduction that suggested the job market was much weaker in 2024 and earlier this year than previously thought.",
      "The initial data is compiled based on surveys of about 120,000 companies, and the revisions are then made based on actual job rolls employers then submit quarterly to state unemployment tax offices.",

      "Russia's state gas company Gazprom says it has a deal to build a pipeline to China called Power of Siberia 2",
      "FRANKFURT, Germany -- The head of Russia's state-owned gas company Gazprom says it has a deal to build a pipeline to China, but there are many unanswered questions about the details of the agreement.",
      "On paper, the project \u2014 known as the Power of Siberia 2 \u2014 would give Russia a way to replace some of the revenue from its decades of selling natural gas to Europe that was lost over its invasion of Ukraine. The pipeline would carry gas from reserves in western Siberia through Mongolia to China.",
      "And what Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller called a \u201clegally binding\u201d memorandum to build the pipeline with the China National Petroleum Co. is a chance for Moscow and Beijing to underline their deepening ties against the United States.",
      "Here are key issues surrounding the Power of Siberia 2 and why it can't completely replace Russia's lost revenue from Europe:",
      "The pipeline would run 6,700 kilometers (4,163 miles) from gas fields in the Yamal Peninsula in western Siberia, past Lake Baikal in eastern Siberia, and then across Mongolia into China. For more than 50 years, Russia earned fat profits sending Yamal gas to Europe through pipelines leading west.",
      "But Russia cut off most pipeline gas to Europe over the war in Ukraine, and the European Union wants to end the remaining trickle of supplies by 2027.",
      "So the new pipeline would be a way to shift those lost gas sales to a big new customer.",
      "Power of Siberia 2 would carry 50 billion cubic meters a year to China, compared with the up to 180 billion cubic meters a year that went to Europe \u2014 meaning the new pipeline could only make up part of the lost business. It would supplement a previous, smaller Power of Siberia line that carries gas from different fields in eastern Siberia with a capacity of 38 billion cubic meters per year.",
      "Miller's announcement, which came during a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping, left out key details. There was no agreement on gas prices or even who would finance the pipeline's construction.",
      "Analysts say the announcement was primarily a chance for Russia and China to underline their closer relationship, and for China to snub supplies of U.S. liquefied natural gas that comes by ship.",
      "India is buying Russian oil despite U.S. President Donald Trump retaliating with 25% tariffs on imports, and China's purchases of U.S. liquefied natural gas are blocked by tariffs imposed as part of China's trade dispute with the Trump administration trade. Meanwhile China has started taking LNG shipments from Russia's Arctic-2 terminal, which has been the target of U.S. and EU sanctions.",
      "So the theatrics of the deal are clear.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve got this show of Russia, India, China saying, \u2018you know what, we don\u2019t care about your sanctions, we don\u2019t care about your LNG,\u2019\" said Michal Meidan, head of China energy research at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies.",
      "The announcement was \u201can absolutely perfect way ... to say: \u2018Look, we\u2019re not all talk, here\u2019s an actual measure,\u2019\u201d said Annette Bohr, associate fellow in the Russia and Eurasia program at Chatham House in London.",
      "But while the deal is \u201ca step forward for Gazprom, it\u2019s not a done deal. There\u2019s no confirmed timeline, no definitive pricing agreement,\u201d she said.",
      "Discussions on the pipeline have moved slowly, largely because China has held out for low prices.",

      "She added that \"China is definitely in the driver\u2019s seat\u201d when it comes to energy deals.",
      "The announcement underlines that China is the dominant partner, said Alexander Gabuev, director of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center.",

And it\u2019s telling you that China has tremendous leverage, and has, in a way, the seniority in this relationship.\u201d",
      "Given the global effort to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels, one good question is whether China needs another gas supplier, says the Oxford Energy Institute's Meidan.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not clear that it really does need Power of Siberia 2,\u201d she said, adding that there is \u201chuge uncertainty about just how much demand China will have in the 2030s, even from Chinese analysts and Chinese institutions.\u201d",
      "China's future demand is part of a complex equation involving a shift away from coal, which emits more carbon dioxide, as the swing fuel used to cover peaks in electricity demand that can't be met by renewables such as wind or hydro power.",
      "A faster move away from coal means more gas use over the short term, while a slower coal exit could increase gas consumption. Battery storage to cover demand peaks and nuclear power could also play a role.",
      "\u201cThey might not necessarily use more gas if they do renewables and storage faster than anyone else, or if they find other ways where ... they use their hydro and their nuclear,\" Meidan said.",

      "SUVs are undoubtedly practical, but they can often be a bore. What if you also want sporty performance from your family-hauler? Surprisingly, your best bet might just be an electric SUV. Thanks in part to the inherent advantages of EV powertrain design, hair-raising acceleration is no longer exclusive to low-slung exotics. Plus, many automakers are now making well-rounded performance SUVs that also provide improved handling, stronger braking and sportier aesthetics. Edmunds\u2019 auto experts have rounded up four of their favorites. The vehicles are listed in ascending order of price, which includes destination fees.",
      "The Ford Mustang Mach-E GT model packs more than enough performance to do its iconic name justice. The standard GT dishes out 480 horsepower and 600 lb-ft of torque, while an optional Performance upgrade elevates the latter figure to a hearty 700 lb-ft. In Edmunds\u2019 testing, it helped the Mach-E GT sprint from zero to 60 mph in just 3.7 seconds.",
      "To ensure that the rest of the vehicle can keep up with the powertrain, Ford has also outfitted the Mach-E GT with a sport-tuned adaptive suspension, high-performance brakes, and sport seats up front, all of which are standard. Its hunkered-down stance also makes the Mach-E GT both look and handle more like a long hatchback rather than a towering SUV. The Mach-E GT\u2019s EPA-estimated 280 miles of range should also be enough for most folks\u2019 needs.",

      "With up to 615 horsepower available in Wide Open Watts (or WOW) launch control mode, the Blazer EV SS claims the title of the most powerful SS-badged vehicle ever produced by Chevrolet. It isn\u2019t as track-focused as some other performance-tuned electric SUVs, but the SS does win some points back for its comfortable ride and seriously zippy 3.4-second 0-60 mph time.

It starts with an increase in power, which is now a maximum output of 641 horsepower. That brings its power level up to par with the Hyundai Ioniq 5 N \u2014 the EV6 GT\u2019s corporate cousin \u2013 and yields an estimated 3.3-second sprint to 60 mph. The 2025 EV6 GT also offers a mode that emulates the sound and shifting experience of a gas-powered engine. A taunt adaptive suspension and bigger brakes add to the EV6 GT\u2019s performance-oriented vibe.",

      "Fifty-five heat waves over the past quarter-century would not have happened without human-caused climate change, according to a study published Wednesday.",
      "Planet-warming emissions from 180 major cement, oil and gas producers contributed significantly to all of the heat events considered in the study, which was published in the journal Nature and examined a set of 213 heat waves from 2000 to 2023. The polluters examined in the study include publicly traded and state-owned companies, as well several countries where fossil fuel production data was available at the national level.",
      "Collectively, these producers are responsible for 57% of all the carbon dioxide that was emitted from 1850 to 2023, the study found.",
      "\u201cIt just shows that it\u2019s not that many actors \u2026 who are responsible for a very strong fraction of all emissions,\u201d said Sonia Seneviratne, a climate professor at the Swiss university ETH Zurich who was one of the study's contributors.",
      "The set of heat waves in the study came from the EM-DAT International Disaster Database, which the researchers described as the most widely used global disaster repository. The Nature study examined all of the heat waves in the database from 2000 to 2023 except for a few that weren\u2019t suitable for their analysis.",
      "Global warming made all 213 of the heat waves examined more likely, the study found. Out of those, 55 were 10,000 times more likely to have happened than they would have been before industrialization began accelerating in the 1800s. The calculation is equivalent to saying those 55 heat waves \u201cwould have been virtually impossible\u201d without human-caused climate change, the authors wrote.",
      "\u201cMany of these heat waves had very strong consequences,\u201d said Seneviratne. She said the series of heat waves that struck Europe in 2022 that was linked to tens of thousands of deaths sticks out in her mind as one of the events with particularly grave consequences.",
      "Climate scientists can use complex computer programs and historic weather data to calculate the connection between extreme weather events and the planet-warming pollutants humans emit. Climate change attribution studies often focus on how climate change influenced a specific weather event, but the scientists say this new Nature study is unique because it focused on the extent to which cement and fossil fuel producers have contributed to heat waves.",
      "\u201cThey are drawing on a pretty well-established field of attribution science now, which has existed for about 20 years,\u201d said Chris Callahan, a climate scientist at Indiana University who was not involved in the study. Callahan has used similar attribution methodologies in his research and said the new study is appropriate and high-quality.",

    "summary": "France&rsquo;s finances and politics are in turmoil",
    "story": [
      "France\u2019s finances and politics are in turmoil",
      "France's finances and politics are in turmoil. President Emmanuel Macron has just appointed his fourth prime minister in 12 months, the deficit is out of control, borrowing costs are rising and parliament can\u2019t muster a majority to tackle spending.",
      "It's a serious comedown for a major industrial power that has the second-largest economy in Europe.",
      "Here's how France found itself in this state of affairs:",
      "France last balanced its budget in 1973, and maintained a generous welfare state with strong worker protections. That worked for years so long as solid economic growth swept tax revenue into government coffers and kept deficits from getting out of hand. First as economy minister and then from 2017 as president, Macron took steps to improve growth and state finances, cutting taxes and spending and raising the retirement age from 62 to 64.",
      "Accumulated debt was high \u2014 over 90% of annual gross domestic product from 2008 on \u2014 but manageable due to steady growth, near-zero interest rates for much of the past decade, and France\u2019s solid credit rating that let it borrow on favorable terms.",
      "Then came the pandemic, followed by an energy crisis after Russia cut off most natural gas supplies over its 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The government spent heavily on subsidies to keep businesses afloat and shield consumers from higher gas and electric bills. At the same time, a global shift occurred in interest rates, sending them suddenly higher.",
      "Almost overnight, the pile of accumulated debt jumped: from 98% of GDP in pre-pandemic year 2019 to 114% in 2020, where it has stayed. The annual deficit last year ballooned beyond forecasts to 5.8%, well above the 3% limit under European Union rules.",
      "France is hardly alone in loading up on debt in recent years. Its debt pile is smaller than Greece's, which is 152% of GDP, and Italy's, which is 138%. It's also lower than the U.S.'s 119%. France, however, lacks the U.S. advantage of having the world's dominant reserve currency which supports Washington's ability to borrow, while Greece has been running budget surpluses after being bailed out and Italy reduced its deficit last year. Greek 10-year bonds now yield 3.3%, indicating the market views them as less risky than France's.",
      "Macron called new elections last year after his pro-European party took a beating in elections for the European parliament from Marine Le Pen's anti-immigration, nationalist party. The new French parliament wound up sharply divided, with a leftist coalition facing off against Le Pen's party and with centrists in between. There\u2019s been no functioning majority \u2014 except to say \u201cno\u201d to austerity and topple Prime Ministers Gabriel Attal, Michel Barnier and Francois Bayrou in quick succession.",
      "Taxes in France are 43.8% of GDP, the highest in the EU. Spending is also high. The money goes for pensions, civil servant salaries, and recently increased defense spending due to the perceived threat from an increasingly aggressive Russia.",
      "With interest rates much higher these days, interest costs have reached 67 billion euros a year, money that is not available for spending on schools, pensions or heath care. And high taxes leave less room for increases without hurting growth.",
      "With a deficit that big, France will have to enact some mix of tax increases and spending cuts equal to around 5% of gross domestic product over the next several years, according to economist Zsolt Darvas, senior fellow at the Bruegel think tank in Brussels. That\u2019s doable \u2014 Greece did even more after its debt crisis in 2010-2015 \u2014 but a heavy lift for any government.",

      "And it's not happening yet. The National Assembly balked at Bayrou\u2019s plan to start putting finances on a sustainable path by eliminating two public holidays and cutting 44 billion euros ($55.4 billion) in spending, toppling him in a confidence vote and leaving investors wondering when exactly legislators would confront the deficit. Macron named Sebastien Lecornu as Bayrou's successor on Tuesday.",
      "When governments spend more than they take in in taxes, they fill the gap, or annual deficit, by selling bonds to investors. When the debts come due, governments pay them off by selling new bonds, which usually works fine \u2014 so long as bond investors are confident that the government is managing its finances well.",
      "That confidence has been eroded by the deadlock in parliament. As a result, markets are demanding higher interest rates on French borrowing to compensate them for the additional risk that the political logjam will continue, the deficit will remain high, and the bonds will fall in value or \u2014 still very unlikely \u2014 that France might not pay at all.",
      "The outside scenario France must avoid is a death spiral in which investor doubts push borrowing costs higher, and high borrowing costs increase the deficit and fuel more investor doubts in a self-reinforcing doom loop, like the one that sank Greece and threatened Italy in the early 2010s.",
      "\u201cA genuine financial crisis with a self-reinforcing doom loop ... remains quite unlikely for the time being,\u201d said Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg bank. \u201cOf course, we cannot rule it out completely.\u201d",
      "If legislators \u201ccontinue to reject common sense and insist on unfinanceable demands, the risk could rise,\u201d he said.",
      "His base case is: France \u201ccontinues to muddle through\u201d with mediocre growth, somewhat higher borrowing costs and a small deficit reduction.",
      "In a case of extreme and unwarranted market panic that threatens France's ability to borrow, the European Central Bank could intervene by buying French bonds and driving down the government\u2019s borrowing costs to sustainable levels. But the ECB reserves such aid for countries pursuing \u201csound and sustainable\u201d policies, meaning the central bank won\u2019t bail out politicians who refuse to act.",
      "The same applies to the eurozone bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism, and the International Monetary Fund. Help from them imposes even stricter conditions on spending and policy, and France would still have to make the fiscal adjustment anyway.",
      "Economist Darvas said there\u2019s no rescue program that would spare France having to bite the bullet. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to imagine that France, such a big and proud country, would go cap in hand to the ESM and possibly the IMF,\u201d Darvas said. \u201cSo again we come back to the same position... that in whatever world, France will have to do the fiscal adjustment.\"",

      "Some lawmakers even called for the government to retaliate by investigating Americans who are alleged to work illegally in South Korea.",

      "But South Korean officials and experts have expressed frustration over what they call the United States\u2019 strict limits on H-1B or H-2B visas for high-skilled foreign workers to protect its domestic workforce, and its inaction on Seoul\u2019s calls to expand work visas for skilled South Korean nationals. As a result, South Korean companies have been relying on short-term visitor visas or the Electronic System for Travel Authorization to send workers needed to launch manufacturing facilities or handle other setup tasks.",
      "\u201cThe incident will inevitably exacerbate shortages of skilled workers with legal work authorization and create pressure for increases in labor costs, potentially disrupting operations and rising costs across major business projects in the United States,\u201d South Korea\u2019s Eugene Investment and Securities said in a report Monday.",
      "Daishin Securities in a report said the Georgia raid could delay operations at the targeted battery plant, which was slated to begin production early next year, potentially affecting Hyundai\u2019s EV business in America.",
      "During Monday's legislative hearing, Cho, the foreign minister, told lawmakers that the U.S. had \u201cnot responded adequately\u201d to South Korea's requests to expand visas for its workers, and that Seoul plans to use the Georgia raid as an opportunity to move related negotiations forward.",
      "Cho said that some of the people detained in Georgia may need to return to the site to complete work at the factory, and that South Korean officials are negotiating with American authorities to ensure that those detained can reenter the United States.",
      "\u201cI will clearly point out to them that a delay in (the factory\u2019s) completion would also cause significant losses for the United States,\u201d Cho said.",

      "The Procore Championship has a 144-man field to start the Fall portion of the PGA Tour schedule",
      "Scottie Scheffler was on the tee with three other Ryder Cup teammates during a practice round at the Procore Championship, a rare sight at a regular PGA Tour event in September.",
      "His caddie, Ted Scott, was offering options on which club to hit and the best lines, along with information on the shape of the fairway and best place to miss. This happens all the time.",
      "It can be easy to forget a tournament is at stake at Silverado Resort, now with 10 players from the U.S. Ryder Cup team, all of them within the top 25 in the world ranking, some of them having never been to the Procore Championship.",
      "\u201cI didn't show up to Napa to talk about the Ryder Cup for four days,\u201d Scheffler said Wednesday after his pro-am. \u201cI'm here to play a golf tournament.\u201d",
      "But there is a reason to play, and that's the Ryder Cup.",
      "Xander Schauffele, who is home with a newborn son, suggested two months ago it was Scheffler who first began pushing for Ryder Cup players to avoid a mistake from two years ago when they went a month without competing before showing up outside Rome.",
      "The Procore Championship fell two weeks after the Tour Championship and two weeks before the Sept. 26-28 matches at Bethpage Black. There wasn't a lot of arm-twisting.",
      "\u201cI think the players knew it was important. This Ryder Cup means everything to them,\u201d said U.S. captain Keegan Bradley, who will be at Silverado into the weekend without having brought his clubs. He said he was 13 the last time he went to a PGA Tour event that he didn't play.",
      "\u201cWe talk a lot behind the scenes of how much this means to us and they are willing to do whatever it takes to be prepared,\" Bradley said. \"This is something that we wanted. When I was named captain, this was something that I wanted, but like they wanted it more than I did. This made it really easy.",
      "\u201cWhen the players take accountability for their team, good things happen.\u201d",
      "The practice round featured two big groups of Ryder Cup players \u2014 Harris English and Collin Morikawa played earlier, Ben Griffin was a late arrival from a previous commitment \u2014 while the rest of the 144-man field was scattered about Silverado.",
      "That apparently included one interloper. Turns out a local with a staff golf bag showed up on the edge of the resort, walked on and began playing. It wasn't until he caught up with Seamus Power on the par-3 17th and shanked one toward the houses that the gig was up and he was asked to leave.",

      "The pro-am had all 10 players \u2014 and three assistant captains \u2014 on the same side of the draw. The starting times for the opening two rounds have Ryder Cup players in the same group, which was not an accident.",
      "It even has a Ryder Cup theme off the course, as the PGA of America has taken over an enormous house that serves as a team gathering place. They all met for dinner Tuesday night and it will serve as their haven for the week.",
      "This is a chance to build team unity \u2014 never mind these guys hang out quite a bit already during the season \u2014 and get in the mood.",
      "\u201cIt's great to have pretty much everyone here this week. A lot of great vibes throughout the meetings and the dinners we\u2019ve had. That\u2019s what you ask for,\u201d Collin Morikawa said.",
      "Mostly it's about staying sharp, and no one has been sharper than Scheffler. He has not finished out of the top eight since The Players Championship in March.",
      "Scheffler often talks about staying in the present, not spending much thought about what just happened or what's on the horizon. This is a little different, to a point.",
      "\u201cThis is the easiest way for me to explain it,\u201d Scheffler said. \"When I prepare and practice at home, I\u2019m always focused on the next stop and the next tournament. But during the offseason and when you\u2019re preparing and practicing, the majors are always in the back of your head.",
      "\u201cI think the majors are always on the back of your mind just because they\u2019re the greatest challenges. I think the Ryder Cup is a great challenge as well just because of the pressure that you feel not only playing for yourself but playing for your country, playing for your partner,\u201d he said. \u201cI'm present. I'm ready to play this week.\u201d",

      "SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- San Francisco 49ers quarterback Brock Purdy is a \u201clong shot\u201d to play on Sunday against the New Orleans Saints and could miss multiple weeks because of a toe injury.",
      "Coach Kyle Shanahan said Wednesday that Purdy was unable to practice and could miss some time after getting hurt in a season-opening win at Seattle. Mac Jones would start for the 49ers on Sunday at New Orleans if Purdy can't play.",
      "Purdy played through the injuries to his toe and left shoulder, leading a game-winning touchdown drive capped by a 4-yard pass to Jake Tonges. Purdy went 26 for 35 for 277 yards with two TDs and two interceptions against Seattle.",
      "Purdy missed two games last season with injuries, sitting out one game with a right shoulder injury and another with a right elbow injury. Those are the only games he has missed because of injuries since taking over as starter late in the 2022 season. He did have a significant injury to his right elbow in the 2022 NFC title game that required surgery but he made it back for the opener the following season.",
      "Jones, the former first-round pick by New England in 2021, signed with San Francisco as a free agent in March.",
      "\u201cMac knows how to play the position,\u201d Shanahan said. \u201cHe can play well in the pocket, distributes the ball well, sees coverages well, can play fast in there. He\u2019s got a lot of good film from the NFL with his experience and obviously college. Tough guy who\u2019ll hang in there and deliver the ball where it needs to go.\u201d",
      "Jones and San Francisco were closely linked leading up to the 2021 draft after the Niners traded three first-round picks to get the No. 3 overall selection. Shanahan was looking to draft a franchise quarterback and was debating between Jones and Trey Lance before San Francisco finally opted for Lance.",
      "The move backfired as Lance struggled to stay healthy and adjust to Shanahan\u2019s system. He made only four starts in two seasons before being traded to Dallas for a fourth-round pick in August 2023, having lost the starting job to Purdy, the last pick in the 2022 draft.",
      "Jones had a fast start to his career, helping New England make the playoffs in his rookie season. But Jones regressed the next year after offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels left for Las Vegas, and he was replaced as the starter in 2023.",

      "NASA's Mars rover Perseverance has uncovered rocks in a dry river channel that may hold potential signs of ancient microscopic life",
      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- NASA\u2019s Mars rover Perseverance has uncovered rocks in a dry river channel that may hold potential signs of ancient microscopic life, scientists reported Wednesday.",
      "They stressed that in-depth analysis is needed of the sample gathered there by Perseverance \u2014 ideally in labs on Earth \u2014 before reaching any conclusions.",
      "Roaming Mars since 2021, the rover cannot directly detect life. Instead, it carries a drill to penetrate rocks and tubes to hold the samples gathered from places judged most suitable for hosting life billions of years ago. The samples are awaiting retrieval to Earth \u2014 an ambitious plan that's on hold as NASA seeks cheaper, quicker options.",
      "Calling it an \u201cexciting discovery,\u201d a pair of scientists who were not involved in the study \u2014 SETI Institute\u2019s Janice Bishop and the University of Massachusetts Amherst\u2019s Mario Parente \u2014 were quick to point out that non-biological processes could be responsible.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s part of the reason why we can\u2019t go so far as to say, \u2018A-ha, this is proof positive of life,'\u2019\u2019 lead researcher Joel Hurowitz of Stony Brook University told The Associated Press. \u201cAll we can say is one of the possible explanations is microbial life, but there could be other ways to make this set of features that we see.\u201d",
      "Either way, Hurowitz said it\u2019s the best, most compelling candidate yet in the rover\u2019s search for potential signs of long-ago life. It was the 25th sample gathered; the tally is now up to 30, with six more to go.",
      "\u201cIt would be amazing to be able to demonstrate conclusively that these features were formed by something that was alive on another planet billions of years ago, right?\" Hurowitz said. But even if that's not the case, it's \"a valuable lesson in all of the ways that nature can conspire to fool us.\u201d",
      "Collected last summer, the sample is from reddish, clay-rich mudstones in Neretva Vallis, a river channel that once carried water into Jezero Crater. This outcrop of sedimentary rock, known as the Bright Angel formation, was surveyed by Perseverance\u2019s science instruments before the drill came out.",
      "Along with organic carbon, a building block of life, Hurowitz and his team found minuscule specks, dubbed poppy seeds and leopard spots, that were enriched with iron phosphate and iron sulfide. On Earth, these chemical compounds are the byproducts when microorganisms chomp down on organic matter.",
      "The findings appeared in the journal Nature.",
      "Ten of the titanium sample tubes were placed on the Martian surface a few years ago as a backup to the rest aboard the rover, the main target in NASA\u2019s still fuzzy return mission.",

      "A new study finds that climate change is increasing sugar consumption in the United States",
      "WASHINGTON -- Global warming in the United States is amping up the country's sweet tooth, a new study found.",
      "When the temperature rises, Americans \u2014 especially those with less money and education \u2014 drink lots more sugary beverages and a bit more frozen desserts. That amounts to more than 100 million pounds of added sugar (358 million kilograms) consumed in the nation a year, compared to 15 years earlier, according to a team of researchers in the U.S. and United Kingdom.",
      "When temperatures go between 54 and 86 degrees (12 and 30 degrees Celsius), the amount of sugar the average American consumes goes up by about 0.4 grams per degree Fahrenheit (0.7 grams per degree Celsius) per day, based on researchers tracking of weather conditions and consumers' purchases. At 54 degrees, the amount of added sugar for the average American is a little more than 2 grams. At 86 degrees, it\u2019s more than 15 grams.",
      "Beyond that, appetites lessen and added sugar falls off, according to the study in Monday's Nature Climate Change.",
      "\u201cClimate change is shaping what you eat and how you eat and that might have a bad effect on your health,\u201d said study co-author Duo Chan, a climate scientist at the University of Southampton.",
      "\u201cPeople tend to take in more sweetened beverages as the temperature is getting higher and higher,\u201d Chan said. \u201cObviously under a warming climate that would cause you to drink more or take in more sugar. And that is going to be a severe problem when it comes to health.\u201d",
      "The daily difference from higher temperatures doesn't amount to even a single candy bar for the average person. But it adds up over time and has a big effect, said University of California San Francisco endocrinology professor Dr. Robert Lustig, a specialist in pediatrics and obesity who wasn't part of the study.",
      "Lustig wrote in an email that among poorer Americans, just one added can of sugary soft drink per day increases diabetes risk by 29% \u2014 and temperature-related thirst plays a big part in America\u2019s obesity epidemic.",
      "The United States\u2019 average annual temperature has gone up about 2.2 degrees (1.2 degrees Celsius) since 1895, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
      "To chart the impact on sugar consumption, researchers compared it to the American Heart Association recommendations: limiting daily intake to 36 grams for men and 25 grams for women.",
      "The team then compared wind, precipitation and humidity records to the detailed purchase records of 40,000 to 60,000 American households from 2004 to 2019, not using any data after the pandemic hit. Then they looked at the nutritional information of the items bought. That allowed them to eliminate other factors to make a causal link and come up with a calculation for how much extra sugar is consumed per person per degree, said lead author Pan He, an environmental scientist at Cardiff University.",

      "The researchers found that men consumed more sugary soft drinks, and that the amount of added sugar consumed during hot weather was several times higher for low- and very low-income families than for the wealthiest, the study found.",
      "People who work outside drank more sugary drinks than those who work inside, and the same went for families where the head of the household was less educated. White people have the highest added sugar effect, while Asians showed no significant change in added sugar in the heat.",
      "Lustig said sugary drinks are marketed and priced in a way to attract the poor, and in many disadvantaged communities the water tastes funny because of chemicals in them. Poor people are also less likely to have air conditioning and are more likely to work outside and need more hydration, Lustig and He said.",

      "Initial reporting suggested the cut happened off the coast of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, something authorities in the kingdom have not acknowledged, nor have the companies managing the cables.",
      "\u201cEarly independent analysis indicates that the probable cause of damage is commercial shipping activity in the region,\u201d John Wrottesley, the committee's operations manager, told the AP. \u201cDamage to submarine cables from dragged anchors account for approximately 30% of incidents each year representing around 60 faults.\u201d",

      "LOS ANGELES -- On a recent sunny morning in a channel at the Port of Los Angeles, seven blue steel structures that look like small boats are lowered into the ocean one by one. Attached to an unused wharf on a site that once housed oil tanks, they gently bob up and down with the waves to generate renewable power. Nearby, a sea lion peeks from the water and pelicans and sea gulls soar overhead.",
      "This is the nation\u2019s first onshore wave energy site, and on Tuesday, Eco Wave Power will officially unveil the pilot installation and begin operating. The pilot will generate just a small amount of electricity that can be used locally, but the larger goal is to prove the technology works well enough to expand along 8 miles of breakwater at the port \u2014 enough to power up to 60,000 homes.",
      "Co-founder and CEO Inna Braverman said that much power could be a \u201cgame changer in terms of clean energy production\u201d for the port and the communities around it. America\u2019s shipping ports have long struggled with dirty air that harms the health of people living nearby.",

      "Wave energy is an emerging industry that\u2019s largely still focused on research, demonstration and pilot projects. But the potential is big.",
      "Waves off the coasts of the United States generate enough power to meet roughly one-third of America\u2019s energy needs, according to Department of Energy estimates. Even if only a portion is harnessed, wave energy technologies could help meet the growing demand for electricity being driven in large part by the artificial intelligence race. Wave energy could also complement wind and solar to stabilize the electric grid.",
      "Eco Wave Power installed its technology at the port\u2019s AltaSea ocean institute, a nonprofit that is working in part to advance ocean-based solutions to climate change. Half this pilot project was funded by the oil and gas company Shell.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the first U.S. project on breakwater, so it opens up the possibility to do that on multiple other ports in the U.S.,\u201d said R\u00e9mi Gruet, CEO of the trade association Ocean Energy Europe. \u201cIt\u2019s a moment where wave power is starting to turn from innovation projects to actual pilot projects that go toward industrialization and commercialization.\u201d",
      "A key advantage for wave energy is it produces electricity at different times than wind and solar, Gruet said. For example, when the wind stops blowing, wind turbines will stop generating electricity. But waves will carry on for hours and electricity can still be generated that way, he said.",
      "But the cost needs to come down with the help of subsidies, like it has for solar and wind, Gruet added.",
      "The first commercial wave power plant in Europe started operating in 2011 from a breakwater at Mutriku harbor in Spain. An offshore wave energy system came online off the coast of Hawaii in 2016.",

      "As the small blue floats bob up and down, each pushes a cylinder that sends a biodegradable hydraulic fluid through a system of pipes into storage tanks. Pressure in the tanks builds up. That pressure turns a motor, which turns a generator, producing clean electricity.",

      "\u201cThe world has waves, 70% percent of the world is covered by ocean,\u201d Terry Tamminen, president and CEO of AltaSea and former secretary of the California Environmental Protection Agency, said at the site of the project.",
      "\u201cAnd we can harness all of that clean energy now, thanks to things like Eco Wave,\u201d he said.",
      "Braverman said there are dozens of sites along the U.S. coastline, identified through a study paid for by Shell, where her company could harness wave energy to add clean electricity to the grid. She said the technology is easy to adopt because unlike other renewables, this system doesn\u2019t require any land acquisition, it involves repurposing existing structures rather than altering coastlines and it can generate electricity around the clock.",
      "The Eco Wave pilot did require licensing from the Army Corps of Engineers and from the port, but that came in a relatively quick two years, Braverman said.",
      "Eco Wave Power is also working on projects abroad, including Taiwan, India and Portugal, and operating a grid-connected project in Israel. In New Jersey, where legislation is advancing to promote ocean energy development in the state, the company is looking for a site to install a pilot project, with help from elected officials.",
      "Andrea Copping, an expert in marine renewable energy development, thinks Eco Wave Power\u2019s technology can be scaled up successfully. These small marine energy projects are not yet economically competitive with solar or wind, but there are places where they may be a better fit or a solution in cooperation with other energy sources, such as remote coastal communities and islands where diesel deliveries can be very expensive, she said.",
      "\u201cWe consider every successful deployment an important milestone in creating this industry,\u201d said Copping, a distinguished faculty fellow in the School of Marine and Environmental Affairs at the University of Washington.",

      "A prosecutor has recommended five years of probation and restitution payments for former CEO Carl Ferrer and sales director Dan Hyer, both of whom pleaded guilty to conspiracy in 2018. The prosecutor said both men acknowledged their crimes and cooperated with authorities by testifying against a company founder during the 2023 trial.",
      "Backpage founder Michael Lacey was convicted of a single count of international concealment money laundering and sentenced to five years in prison and fined $3 million, though he remains free while he pursues an appeal. Chief financial officer John Brunst and executive vice president Scott Spear are each serving 10-year sentences for conspiracy and money laundering convictions.",
      "Prosecutors had argued that Backpage\u2019s operators ignored warnings to stop running prostitution ads, some involving children. The operators were accused of giving free ads to sex workers and cultivating arrangements with others who worked in the industry to get them to post ads with the company.",
      "Backpage\u2019s operators said they never allowed ads for sex and made an effort to try to delete such ads by assigning employees to remove them and creating automated tools. Their legal team maintained the content on the site was protected by the First Amendment.",
      "In pleading guilty, Ferrer acknowledged knowing a majority of Backpage\u2019s revenues came from escort ads, conspiring to sanitize ads by removing photos and words that were indicative of prostitution and publishing a revised version of the notices.",

      "Lacey and Larkin held ownership interests in other weeklies such as The Village Voice and ultimately sold their newspapers in 2013. But they held onto Backpage, which authorities say generated $500 million in prostitution-related revenue from its inception in 2004 until 2018, when the government shut it down.",
      "A U.S. Government Accountability Office report released in June 2021 said the FBI\u2019s ability to identify victims and sex traffickers had decreased significantly after Backpage was seized by the government, because law enforcement was familiar with the site and Backpage was generally responsive to requests for information.",

      "The Himalayan country\u2019s government said last week it was blocking several social media platforms including Facebook, X and YouTube because the companies failed to comply with a requirement that they register with the government. The ban was lifted Tuesday a day after the deadly protests.",
      "What's happening in Nepal mirrors \u201cthis broader pattern of controlling the narrative and controlling of stories emerging from the ground,\u201d said Aditya Vashistha, an assistant professor of information science at Cornell University. \u201cThis has happened several times in the neighboring countries India, Pakistan, Bangladesh. So this is nothing new \u2014 in fact, I would say this is taken from the playbook, which is now very established, of trying to control social media narratives.\u201d",

Officials are calling for laws to to monitor social media and ensure both the users and operators are responsible and accountable for what they share. But the move has been criticized as a tool for censorship and punishing opponents who voice their protests online.",
      "\u201cGovernments absolutely have a valid interest in seeking to regulate social media platforms. This is such a daily part of our lives and in our business. And it is certainly reasonable for authorities to sit down and say we want to develop rules for the road,\u201d said Kian Vesteinsson, senior research analyst for technology and democracy at the Washington-based nonprofit Freedom House.",
      "\u201cBut what we see in Nepal is that wholesale blocks as a means of enforcing a set of rules for social media companies results in wildly disproportionate harms. These measures that were put in place in Nepal (cut) tens of millions of people off from platforms that they used to express themselves, to conduct daily business, to speak with their families, to go to school, to get healthcare information.\u201d",
      "It's not just Nepal. Freedom House has found that global internet freedom has declined for the 14th consecutive year in 2024, as governments crack down on dissent and people face arrest for expressing political, social or religious views online. While China consistently tops the list as the \u201cworld's worst environment\u201d for internet freedom, last year Myanmar shared this designation as well. The organization did not track Nepal.",
      "India passed a telecommunications law in 2023 that gave its government \u201cbroad powers to restrict online communications and intercept communications,\" according to Freedom House. Three years earlier, a sweeping internet law put digital platforms like Facebook under direct government oversight. Officials say the rules are needed to quell misinformation and hate speech and to give users more power to flag objectionable content. But critics cautioned it would lead to censorship in a country where digital freedoms have already been shrinking.",
      "In January, meanwhile, Pakistan\u2019s lower house of parliament passed a bill that gives the government sweeping controls on social media, including sending users to prison for spreading disinformation.",

      "The Committee to Protect Journalists said Monday that the protests \u201cunderscore the widespread concerns over Nepal\u2019s ban on social media and the pressing need for the government to drop its order. Such a sweeping ban not only restricts freedom of expression, it also severely hinders journalists\u2019 work and the public\u2019s right to know.\u201d",
      "The crackdown appears to have spurred a surge in use of virtual private networks, or VPNs, according to Proton, which provides encrypted services. Signups for Proton\u2019s VPN service in Nepal have jumped by 8,000% since Sept. 3, according to data the company posted online. A VPN is a service that allows users to mask their location in order to circumvent censorship or geography-based online viewing restrictions.",
      "But experts caution that VPNs are not an end-all solution to government internet blocks. They can be expensive and out of reach for many people, Vashistha noted, and they can be slow and lead to lower-quality experiences when people try to access blocked social platforms.",

      "KATHMANDU, Nepal -- KATHMANDU, Nepal (AP) \u2014 Nepal\u2019s government responded to escalating violent protests over a ban on popular social media platforms with deadly force. The public outrage over the ban and the deaths of 19 protesters on Monday led to the resignation of the prime minister and exposed deep discontent over corruption.",
      "Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli also rolled backed the short-lived ban after protesters turned their anger on politicians by setting fire to homes of some of the country\u2019s top leaders.",
      "Led by mostly teenagers and young adults, the protests revealed a broader resentment in Nepal, where many people have increasingly become angry with the government over a range of issues, mostly to do with corruption and frustration over nepotism in the country\u2019s politics.",
      "\u201cProtests over the social media ban were just a catalyst. Frustrations over how the country is being run have long been simmering under the surface. People are very angry and Nepal finds itself in a very precarious situation,\u201d said Prateek Pradhan, editor of Baahrakhari, a Nepalese independent news website.",
      "Demonstrations in Nepal have been called the protest of Gen Z, which generally refers to people born between 1995 and 2010. They were largely in response to the ban that went into effect last week and government\u2019s larger attempt to regulate social media through a bill that requires platforms to register and submit to local oversight and regulations.",
      "The bill, which has not yet been fully debated in parliament, has been widely criticized as a tool for censorship and punishing opponents who voice their protests online. Rights groups have called it an attempt by the government to curb freedom of expression and violate fundamental rights.",
      "At the same time, the protests were also a tipping point of a longstanding sentiment against politicians, their families and concerns over corruption.",
      "In the weeks before the ban, a social media campaign \u2014 particularly on video-sharing platform TikTok \u2014 spotlighted the lavish lifestyles of politicians\u2019 children, highlighting disparities between Nepal\u2019s rich and poor. Protesters criticized them of flaunting their luxury possessions in a country where the per capita income is $1,400 a year.",
      "Widespread criticism over government\u2019s failure to pursue some major corruption cases and create more economic opportunities for the youth also added to the anger. The youth unemployment rate in Nepal was 20% last year, according to the World Bank.",

      "The unrest is the worst in decades in the Himalayan nation that is wedged between India and China. It is also far violent than the one in 2006, when an uprising forced Nepal\u2019s former king to give up his authoritarian rule. At least 18 people were killed in the violence. Two years later the parliament voted to abolish the monarchy.",

      "New research suggests that a tiny phytoplankton that is an essential part of the marine food web may decline sharply as oceans warm",
      "SEATTLE -- For decades, scientists believed Prochlorococcus, the smallest and most abundant phytoplankton on Earth, would thrive in a warmer world. But new research suggests the microscopic bacterium, which forms the foundation of the marine food web and helps regulate the planet\u2019s climate, will decline sharply as seas heat up.",
      "A study published Monday in the journal Nature Microbiology found Prochlorococcus populations could shrink by as much as half in tropical oceans over the next 75 years if surface waters exceed about 82 degrees Fahrenheit (27.8 Celsius). Many tropical and subtropical sea surface temperatures are already trending above average and are projected to regularly surpass 86 degrees Fahrenheit (30 Celsius) over that same period.",
      "\u201cThese are keystone species \u2014 very important ones,\u201d said Fran\u00e7ois Ribalet, a research associate professor at the University of Washington\u2019s School of Oceanography and the study\u2019s lead author. \u201cAnd when a keystone species decreases in abundance, it always has consequences on ecology and biodiversity. The food web is going to change.\u201d",
      "Prochlorococcus inhabit up to 75% of Earth\u2019s sunlit surface waters and produce about one-fifth of the planet\u2019s oxygen through photosynthesis. More crucially, Ribalet said, they convert sunlight and carbon dioxide into food at the base of the marine ecosystem.",
      "\u201cIn the tropical ocean, nearly half of the food is produced by Prochlorococcus,\u201d he said. \u201cHundreds of species rely on these guys.\u201d",
      "Though other forms of phytoplankton may move in and help compensate for the loss of oxygen and food, Ribalet cautioned they are not perfect substitutes. \u201cEvolution has made this very specific interaction,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously, this is going to have an impact on this very unique system that has been established.\u201d",
      "The findings challenge decades of assumptions that Prochlorococcus would thrive as waters warmed. Those predictions, however, were based on limited data from lab cultures. For this study, Ribalet and his team tested water samples while traversing the Pacific over the course of a decade.",
      "Over 100 research cruises \u2014 the equivalent of six trips around the globe \u2014 they counted some 800 billion individual cells taken from samples at every kilometer. In his lab at the University of Washington, Ribalet demonstrated the SeaFlow, a box filled with tubes, wires and a piercing blue laser. The custom-built device continuously pulls in seawater, which allowed the team to count the microbes in real time. \u201cWe have counted more Prochlorococcus than there are stars in the Milky Way,\u201d Ribalet said.",
      "Paul Berube, a research scientist at Massachusetts Institute of Technology who studies Prochlorococcus but was not involved in the work, said the breadth of data is \u201cgroundbreaking.\u201d And he said the results fit with what is known about the microbe\u2019s streamlined genome, which makes it less adaptable to rapid environmental changes.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re at the very base of the food web, and they feed everything else \u2014 the fish eat the things that eat the phytoplankton and we eat the fish,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen changes are being made to the planet that influence these particular organisms that are essentially feeding us, that\u2019s going to have big consequences.\u201d",
      "To test whether Prochlorococcus might evolve to withstand hotter conditions, Ribalet\u2019s team modeled a hypothetical heat-tolerant strain but found that even those would \u201cnot be enough to fully resist the warmest temperature if greenhouse emissions keep rising,\u201d Ribalet said.",
      "He stressed that the study\u2019s projections are conservative and don\u2019t account for the impacts of plastic pollution or other ecological stressors. \u201cWe actually tried to put forth the best-case scenario,\u201d Ribalet said. \u201cIn reality, things may be worse.\u201d",

      "ABOARD LIFTBOAT ROBERT, North Atlantic -- Deep in Earth's past, an icy landscape became a seascape as the ice melted and the oceans rose off what is now the northeastern United States. Nearly 50 years ago, a U.S. government ship searching for minerals and hydrocarbons in the area drilled into the seafloor to see what it could find.",
      "It found, of all things, drops to drink under the briny deeps \u2014 fresh water.",
      "This summer, a first-of-its-kind global research expedition followed up on that surprise. Drilling for fresh water under the salt water off Cape Cod, Expedition 501 extracted thousands of samples from what is now thought to be a massive, hidden aquifer stretching from New Jersey as far north as Maine.",
      "It's just one of many depositories of \u201csecret fresh water\u201d known to exist in shallow salt waters around the world that might some day be tapped to slake the planet\u2019s intensifying thirst, said Brandon Dugan, the expedition's co-chief scientist.",
      "\u201cWe need to look for every possibility we have to find more water for society,\u201d Dugan, a geophysicist and hydrologist at the Colorado School of Mines, told Associated Press journalists who recently spent 12 hours on the drilling platform. The research teams looked in \u201cone of the last places you would probably look for fresh water on Earth.\u201d",
      "They found it, and will be analyzing nearly 50,000 liters (13,209 gallons) of it back in their labs around the world in the coming months. They're out to solve the mystery of its origins \u2014 whether the water is from glaciers, connected groundwater systems on land or some combination.",
      "The potential is enormous. So are the hurdles of getting the water out and puzzling over who owns it, who uses it and how to extract it without undue harm to nature. It's bound to take years to bring that water ashore for public use in a big way, if it's even feasible.",
      "Why try? In just five years, the U.N. says, the global demand for fresh water will exceed supplies by 40%. Rising sea levels from the warming climate are souring coastal freshwater sources while data centers that power AI and cloud computing are consuming water at an insatiable rate.",
      "The fabled Ancient Mariner\u2019s lament, \u201cWater, water, every where, nor any drop to drink,\u201d looms as a warning to landlubbers as well as to sailors on salty seas.",
      "In Virginia alone, a quarter of all power produced in the state goes to data centers, a share expected to nearly double in five years. By some estimates, each midsize data center consumes as much water as 1,000 households. Each of the Great Lakes states has experienced groundwater shortages.",
      "Cape Town, South Africa, came perilously close to running out of fresh water for its nearly 5 million people in 2018 during an epic, three-year drought. South Africa is thought to have a coastal undersea freshwater bonanza, too, and there is at least anecdotal evidence that every continent may have the same.",
      "Canada's Prince Edward Island, Hawaii and Jakarta, Indonesia, are among places where stressed freshwater supplies coexist with prospective aquifers under the ocean.",
      "Enter Expedition 501, a $25 million scientific collaboration of more than a dozen countries backed by the U.S. government's National Science Foundation and the European Consortium for Ocean Research Drilling (U.S. money for it was secured before budget cuts sought by the Trump administration).",
      "Scientists went into the project believing the undersea aquifer they were sampling might be sufficient to meet the needs of a metropolis the size of New York City for 800 years. They found fresh or nearly fresh water at both higher and lower depths below the seafloor than they anticipated, suggesting a larger supply even than that.",
      "Their work at sea unfolded over three months from Liftboat Robert, an oceangoing vessel that, once on site, lowers three enormous pillars to the seafloor and squats above the waves. Normally it services offshore petroleum sites and wind farms. This drill-baby-drill mission was different.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s known that this phenomena exists both here and elsewhere around the world,\u201d Expedition 501 project manager Jez Everest, a scientist who came from the British Geological Survey in Edinburgh, Scotland, said of undersea water. \u201cBut it\u2019s a subject that\u2019s never been directly investigated by any research project in the past.\u201d",
      "By that, he means no one globally had drilled systematically into the seabed on a mission to find freshwater. Expedition 501 was quite literally groundbreaking \u2014 it penetrated Earth below the sea by as many as 1,289 feet or nearly 400 meters.",
      "But it followed a 2015 research project that mapped contours of an aquifer remotely, using electromagnetic technology, and roughly estimated salinity of the water underneath.",

      "\u201cFour parts per thousand was a eureka moment,\" Dugan said, because the finding suggested that the water must have been connected to a terrestrial system in the past, or still is.",
      "As the weeks wore on and Robert moved from site to site 20 to 30 miles (30 to 50 kilometers) off the coast, the process of drilling into the waterlogged subsea sediment yielded a collection of samples down to 1 part per thousand salt content. Some were even lower.",
      "Bingo. That's what you find in many bodies of fresh water on land. That's water you can drink, in theory. No one did.",
      "In months of analysis ahead, the scientists will investigate a range of properties of the water, including what microbes were living in the depths, what they used for nutrients and energy sources and what byproducts they might generate; in other words, whether the water is safe to consume or otherwise use.",
      "\u201cThis is a new environment that has never been studied before,\u201d said Jocelyne DiRuggiero, a Johns Hopkins University biologist in Baltimore who studies the microbial ecology of extreme environments and is not involved in the expedition.",
      "\u201cThe water may contain minerals detrimental to human health since it percolated through layers of sediments,\u201d she said. \u201cHowever, a similar process forms the terrestrial aquifers that we use for freshwater, and those typically have very high quality.\u201d",
      "By sequencing DNA extracted from their samples, she said, the researchers can determine which microorganisms are there and \u201clearn how they potentially make a living.\u201d",
      "Techniques will also be used to determine whether it came from glacial ice melt thousands of years ago or is still coming via labyrinthian geologic formations from land.",
      "Researchers will date the water back in the lab, and that will be key in determining whether it is a renewable resource that could be used responsibly. Primordial water is trapped and finite; newer water suggests the aquifer is still connected to a terrestrial source and being refreshed, however slowly.",
      "\u201cYounger means it was a raindrop 100 years ago, 200 years ago,\u201d Dugan said. \u201cIf young, it\u2019s recharging.\u201d",
      "Those questions are for basic science. For society, all sorts of complex questions arise if the basic science affirms the conditions necessary for exploiting the water. Who will manage it? Can it be taken without an unacceptable risk of contaminating the supply from the ocean above? Will it be cheaper or environmentally friendlier than today's energy-hungry desalination plants?",
      "Dugan said if governments decide to get the water, local communities could turn to the aquifers in time of need, such as drought, or when extreme storms flood coastal freshwater reserves and ruin them. The notion of actually using this old buried water is so new that it has not been on the radar of many policymakers or conservationists.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a lesson in how long it can take sometimes to make these things happen and the perseverance that\u2019s needed to get there,\" said Woods Hole geophysicist Rob Evans, whose 2015 expedition helped point the way for 501. \u201cThere\u2019s a ton of excitement that finally they\u2019ve got samples.\"",
      "Still, he sees some red flags. One is that tapping undersea aquifers could draw water away from onshore reserves. Another is that undersea groundwater that seeps out to the seafloor may supply nutrients vital to the ecosystem, and that could be upset.",
      "\"If we were to go out and start pumping these waters, there would almost certainly be unforeseen consequences,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of balance we would need to consider before we started diving in and drilling and exploiting these kinds of things.\u201d",
      "For most in the project, getting to and from Liftboat Robert meant a voyage of seven hours or more from Fall River, Massachusetts, on a supply boat that made round trips every 10 days or so to replenish stocks and rotate people.",
      "On the platform, around the clock, the racket of metal bore pipes and machinery, the drilling grime and the speckled mud mingled with the quieter, cleaner work of scientists in trailers converted to pristine labs and processing posts.",
      "There, samples were treated according to the varying needs of the expedition\u2019s geologists, geochemists, hydrologists, microbiologists, sedimentologists and more.",
      "Passing through clear plastic tubes, muck was sliced into disks like hockey pucks. Machines squeezed water out. Some samples were kept sealed to enable study of ancient gases dissolved in the water. Other samples were frozen, filtered or left as is, depending on the purpose.",
      "After six months of lab analysis, all the science teams of Expedition 501 will meet again \u2014 this time in Germany for a month of collaborative research that is expected to produce initial findings that point to the age and origin of the water.",
      "On July 31, Liftboat Robert cranked up its legs from this place of hidden water to end a mission that lent credence to another passage from \u201cThe Rime of the Ancient Mariner,\" Samuel Taylor Coleridge's classic poem about life, death and mysteries at sea.",

      "A congressional investigation finds the Pentagon has funded research involving collaboration with Chinese entities linked to China's defense sector",
      "WASHINGTON -- Over a recent two-year period, the Pentagon funded hundreds of projects done in collaboration with universities in China and institutes linked to that nation's defense industry, including many blacklisted by the U.S. government for working with the Chinese military, a congressional investigation has found.",
      "The report, released Friday by House Republicans on the Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, argues the projects have allowed China to exploit U.S. research partnerships for military gains while the two countries are locked in a tech and arms rivalry.",
      "\u201cAmerican taxpayer dollars should be used to defend the nation \u2014 not strengthen its foremost strategic competitor,\u201d Republicans wrote in the report.",
      "\u201cFailing to safeguard American research from hostile foreign exploitation will continue to erode U.S. technological dominance and place our national defense capabilities at risk,\" it said.",
      "The Pentagon didn't immediately respond to an Associated Press request for comment. Beijing has in the past said science and technological cooperation between the two countries is mutually beneficial and helps the two sides cope with global challenges.",
      "The congressional report said some officials at the Defense Department argued research should remain open as long as it is \u201cneither controlled nor classified.\u201d",
      "The report makes several recommendations to scale back U.S. research collaboration with China. It also backs new legislation proposed by the committee's chairman, Rep. John Moolenaar, R-Michigan. The bill would prohibit any Defense Department funding from going to projects done in collaboration with researchers affiliated with Chinese entities that the U.S. government identifies as safety risks.",
      "The 80-page report builds on the committee's findings last year that partnerships between U.S. and Chinese universities over the past decade allowed hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funding to help Beijing develop critical technology. Amid pressure from Republicans, several U.S. universities have ended their joint programs with Chinese schools in recent years.",
      "The new report focuses more narrowly on the Defense Department and its billions of dollars in annual research funding.",
      "The committee's investigation identified 1,400 research papers published between June 2023 and June 2025 that acknowledged support from the Pentagon and were done in collaboration with Chinese partners. The publications were funded by some 700 defense grants worth more than $2.5 billion. Of the 1,400 publications, more than half involved organizations affiliated with China's defense research and industrial base.",
      "Dozens of those organizations were flagged for potential security concerns on U.S. government lists, though federal law does not prohibit research collaborations with them. The Defense Department money supported research in fields including hypersonic technology, semiconductors, artificial intelligence, advanced materials and next-generation propulsion.",

      "The scientist, who has done research on high-energy materials, nitrogen and high-pressure physics \u2014 all of which are relevant to nuclear weapons development \u2014 has been honored in China for his work to advance the country's national development goals, the report said. It called the case \u201ca deeply troubling example\u201d of how Beijing can leverage U.S. taxpayer-funded research to further its weapons development.",
      "In another Pentagon-backed project, Arizona State University and the University of Texas partnered with researchers from Shanghai Jiao Tong University and Beihang University to study high-stakes decision-making in uncertain environments, which has direct applications for electronic warfare and cyber defense, the report said. The money came from the Office of Naval Research, the Army Research Office and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.",
      "The Shanghai university is under the supervision of a central Chinese agency tasked with developing defense technology, and Beihang University, in the capital city of Beijing, is linked to the People's Liberation Army and known for its aerospace programs.",
      "The report takes issue with Defense Department policies that do not explicitly forbid research partnerships with foreign institutions that appear on U.S. government blacklists.",
      "It makes more than a dozen recommendations, including a prohibition on any Pentagon research collaboration with entities that are on U.S. blacklists or \u201cknown to be part of China\u2019s defense research and industrial base.\u201d",
      "Moolenaar's legislation includes a similar provision and proposes a ban on Defense Department funding for U.S. universities that operate joint institutes with Chinese universities.",
      "A senior Education Department official said the report \u201chighlights the vulnerability of federally funded research to foreign infiltration on America\u2019s campuses.\u201d Under Secretary of Education Nicholas Kent said the findings reinforce the need for more transparency around U.S. universities' international ties, along with a \"whole-of-government approach to safeguard against the malign influence of hostile foreign actors.\u201d",
      "House investigators said they are not seeking to end all academic and research collaborations with China but those with connections to the Chinese military and its research and industrial base.",

      "ORLANDO, Fla. -- Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is facing a funding dilemma over the immigration detention center known as \u201cAlligator Alcatraz\u201d built in the Florida Everglades.",
      "Last week, an appellate court panel temporarily blocked a lower court decision ordering the governor's administration to wind down operations at the facility.",
      "But the ruling sets up a predicament: The state can either pass up federal reimbursement for hundreds of millions of dollars spent to build and operate the facility, or take the money and face an environmental review, which would risk halting the center\u2019s operations.",
      "That\u2019s because a majority of the three-judge appellate panel decided for the time being that the facility doesn't have to undergo a federally required environmental impact study normally needed to build on sensitive wetlands. Why? Because Florida has yet to receive federal money for the project, despite officials having promised it.",
      "If Florida takes the federal money, then the state may need to conduct the environmental analysis, the judges wrote in their 2-to-1 decision. U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said on social media this summer that the facility would largely be funded by FEMA's shelter and services program.",
      "The law makes clear that \u201cthe absence of federal funding renders an action \u2018non-federal\u2019\u201d and not subject to an environmental review, the appellate panel majority said.",
      "The decision stayed a preliminary injunction by U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams ordering the detention facility to wind down operations by late October while the case made its way through court. The stay is in effect pending appeal.",
      "\u201cHere, no federal dollars have been expended on the construction or use of the facility,\u201d the appellate panel said. \u201cSo the Florida-funded and Florida-operated detention activities occurring at the site do not conceive a \u2018major federal project\u2019 either.\u201d",
      "When asked Tuesday about whether the appellate panel's decision would impact the state's application for federal funding, the governor's office didn't provide a direct answer. Instead, press secretary Molly Best sent video clips of DeSantis talking about \u201cAlligator Alcatraz\u201d on social media and in an interview with FOX host Sean Hannity. DeSantis didn't discuss funding in either clip.",

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s goal of appointing a majority of the Federal Reserve\u2019s board of governors faced a setback Tuesday when a court blocked his unprecedented attempt to fire Lisa Cook",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump's goal of appointing a majority of the Federal Reserve's board of governors faced a setback late Tuesday when a court blocked his unprecedented attempt to fire Lisa Cook.",
      "But the very next next day, his nominee to replace another Fed governor moved forward, giving him one more opportunity during his second term to reshape the Fed.",
      "Over time, Trump will almost certainly get the lower short-term interest rate he is seeking, economists say, although it's unlikely the Fed will shave 3 percentage points from its current level of about 4.3%, as he has demanded, even if he gets most of the seats on the seven-member board.",
      "On Wednesday, Trump got one step closer to reaching a majority when the Senate Banking Committee approved the president's nomination of Stephen Miran, one of his top economic advisers, to an open position on the Fed's board. The full Senate is expected to approve Miran shortly. He could end up participating in the central bank's policy meeting next week, when it is expected to reduce its key interest rate by a quarter-point to about 4.1%.",
      "But he took a step back with Cook after a federal court blocked Trump's attempt to fire her late Tuesday. Jia Cobb, a judge appointed by former president Joe Biden, ruled that the firing was illegal because the administration did not provide sufficient cause to remove her. That means Cook is also likely to participate in next week's Fed meeting.",
      "The Trump administration appealed that ruling Wednesday, and many observers expect the case could end up at the Supreme Court.",
      "Here are where things stand regarding Trump, the Federal Reserve, and its traditional independence.",
      "Fed governors aren't like Cabinet members or other officials who serve at the pleasure of the president. Under the law governing the Fed, they can't be fired over policy disagreements, but can be dismissed \u201cfor cause.\u201d",
      "Trump has accused Cook of committing mortgage fraud when she bought two properties in 2021 \u2014before she joined the Fed \u2014 which she said were both \u201cprimary residences.\u201d Such a designation can result in lower down payments and mortgage rates than if one of the homes was classified as a rental or second house.",
      "On Tuesday, Cobb ruled that Fed governors can only be fired for malfeasance or other actions while in office and said the White House also failed to provide Cook with a chance to formally respond to charges against her.",
      "The appeals court or the Supreme Court could stay the district court's decision, which would remove Cook from the Fed's board until her case is resolved. The Supreme Court has shown sympathy for Trump's arguments that the president can remove many officials from agencies previously seen as independent. But in a case earlier this year, the Supreme Court said that the central bank is a \u201cunique, semi-private entity\u201d and suggested its officials may have greater protection from being removed by the White House.",

      "Miran has taken the unusual step of planning to keep his job as the chair of the White House's Council of Economic Advises if he does win Senate approval. While previous presidents have appointed their aides to the Fed, they have always then stepped down from White House jobs.",
      "Nearly all economists and most Wall Street investors prefer a Fed that is independent from day-to-day politics. They worry that if the Fed falls under the control of the White House, it will keep its key interest rate lower than justified by economic fundamentals to satisfy Trump\u2019s demands for cheaper borrowing.",
      "That could accelerate inflation and over time could also push up longer-term interest rates, such as those on mortgages and car loans. Investors may demand a higher yield to own bonds to offset greater inflation in the future, lifting borrowing costs for the U.S. government and the entire economy.",
      "If Miran is confirmed, he will be the third Trump appointee to the Fed's seven-member board, after Trump appointed Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman in his first term. If Cook is able to keep her seat, then Trump's next opportunity would arrive in May, when current Fed Chair Jerome Powell's term ends.",
      "It's possible that Powell could pull an unusual move and remain on the Fed's board even after stepping down as chair. If so, that would deprive Trump of another appointment and would force him to choose a new chair from the existing seven governors.",
      "Powell has declined to answer when he has been asked whether he will leave the board after his term as chair ends. But if he does leave, then Trump could appoint a fourth member and gain a majority.",
      "The four other governors are serving terms that last beyond the end of Trump's time in office. Governors are appointed to 14-year terms, in part to shield them from political pressure.",
      "Still, many governors step down before their terms end, so Trump may have more opportunities to add loyalists to the board.",
      "\u201cOver time the composition of the Fed aligns with the views of the administration because you pick like-minded people,\u201d said Vincent Reinhart, chief economist at BNY, a bank. \u201cThe direction of travel is for lower rates.\u201d",

      "Dr. Hector Granados, a pediatric endocrinologist in El Paso, was called a \u201cscofflaw\u201d last year by Paxton\u2019s office in a lawsuit that accused him of falsifying medical records and violating a Texas ban that took effect in 2023. More than two dozen states have prohibitions on gender-affirming care for transgender youth, but Texas was the first to bring cases against doctors, filing lawsuits against Granados and two other providers.",
      "The cases against the other doctors, both in Dallas, remain ongoing. But Paxton's office quietly withdrew its lawsuit last week against Granados, saying in a statement that \"no legal violations were found\u201d following a \u201creview of the evidence and Granados\u2019 complete medical records.\u201d",

      "\u201cIt was just out and then we had to do everything afterwards,\u201d Granados said in an interview.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in June that states can ban gender-affirming medical care for transgender minors, and at least 27 states have adopted laws restricting or banning the care. Although those accused of violating bans face criminal charges in some states, they do not in Texas, where the punishments instead expose providers to steep fines and revocation of their medical licenses.",

      "He said that after the ban, he did continue to prescribe puberty blockers and hormone replacement therapy, but that those treatments were not for gender transition. Granados said they were for youth with endocrine disorders, which occur when hormone levels are too high or too low.",

      "When Maria Pires was adopted from Brazil as a child, she believed she was officially an American",
      "It sounded like freedom, like a world of possibility beyond the orphanage walls.",
      "Maria Pires was getting adopted. At 11 years old, she saw herself escaping the chaos and violence of the Sao Paulo orphanage, where she\u2019d been sexually assaulted by a staff member. She saw herself leaving Brazil for America, trading abandonment for belonging.",
      "A single man in his 40s, Floyd Sykes III, came to Sao Paulo to meet her. He signed some paperwork and brought Maria home.",
      "She arrived in the suburbs of Baltimore in the summer of 1989, a little girl with a tousle of dark hair, a nervous smile and barely a dozen words of English. The sprawling subdivision looked idyllic, with rows of modest brick townhouses and a yard where she could play soccer.",
      "She was, she believed, officially an American.",
      "But what happened in that house would come to haunt her, marking the start of a long descent into violence, crime and mental illness.",
      "\u201cMy father \u2014 my adopted father \u2014 he was supposed to save me,\u201d Pires said. Instead, he tortured and sexually abused her.",
      "After nearly three years of abuse, Sykes was arrested. The state placed Pires in foster care.",
      "By then, she was consumed with fury. In the worst years, she beat a teenager at a roller rink, leaving him in a coma. She attacked a prison guard and stabbed her cellmate with a sharpened toothbrush.",
      "In prison, she discovered that no one had ever bothered to complete her immigration paperwork. Not Sykes. Not Maryland social service agencies.",
      "That oversight would leave her without a country. She wasn\u2019t American, it turned out, and she\u2019d lost her Brazilian citizenship when she was adopted by Sykes, who died several years ago. But immigration officials, including those under President Donald Trump's first administration, let her stay in the country.",
      "After her release from prison in 2017, Pires stayed out of trouble and sought help to control her anger. She checked in once a year with Immigration and Customs Enforcement and paid for an annual work permit.",
      "But in the second Trump administration \u2014 with its promise of mass deportations, a slew of executive orders and a crackdown targeting those the president deemed \u201cthe worst of the worst \u201d \u2014 everything changed. Trump's unyielding approach to immigration enforcement has swept up tens of thousands of immigrants, including many like Pires who came to the U.S. as children and know little, if any, life outside America. They have been apprehended during ICE raids, on college campuses, or elsewhere in their communities, and their detentions often draw the loudest backlash.",
      "In Pires\u2019 case, she was detained during a routine check-in, sent to one immigration jail after another, and ultimately deported to a land she barely remembers. The Associated Press conducted hours of interviews with Pires and people who know her and reviewed Maryland court records, internal ICE communications, and adoption and immigration paperwork to tell her story.",
      "U.S. immigration officials say Pires is a dangerous serial criminal who\u2019s no longer welcome in the country. Her case, they say, is cut and dried.",
      "Pires, now 47, doesn\u2019t deny her criminal past.",
      "But little about her story is straightforward.",
      "Pires has no clear memories from before she entered the orphanage. All she knows is that her mother spent time in a mental institution.",
      "The organization that facilitated her adoption was later investigated by Brazilian authorities over allegations it charged exorbitant fees and used videos to market available children, according to a Sao Paulo newspaper. Organization leaders denied wrongdoing.",
      "Pires remembers a crew filming a TV commercial. She believes that\u2019s how Sykes found her.",
      "In his custody, the abuse escalated over time. When Sykes went to work, he sometimes left her locked in a room, chained to a radiator with only a bucket as a toilet. He gave her beer and overpowered her when she fought back. She started cutting herself.",
      "Sykes ordered her to keep quiet, but she spoke almost no English then anyway. On one occasion, he forced a battery into her ear as punishment, causing permanent hearing loss.",
      "In September 1992, someone alerted authorities. Sykes was arrested. Child welfare officials took custody of Maria, then 14.",
      "Maryland Department of Human Services spokesperson Lilly Price said the agency couldn\u2019t comment on specific cases because of confidentiality laws but noted in a statement that adoptive parents are responsible for applying for U.S. citizenship for children adopted from other countries.",
      "Court documents show Sykes admitted sexually assaulting Maria multiple times but he claimed the assaults stopped in June 1990.",
      "He was later convicted of child abuse. Though he had no prior criminal record, court officials acknowledged a history of similar behavior, records show.",
      "Between credit for time served and a suspended prison sentence, Sykes spent about two months in jail.",
      "Sykes' younger sister Leslie Parrish said she's often wondered what happened to Maria.",
      "\u201cHe ruined her life,\u201d she said, weeping. \u201cThere\u2019s a special place in hell for people like that.\u201d",
      "Parrish said she wanted to believe her brother had good intentions; he seemed committed to becoming a father and joined a social group for adoptive parents of foreign kids. She even accompanied him to Brazil.",
      "But in hindsight, she sees it differently. She believes sinister motives lurked \u201cin the back of his sick mind.\u201d",
      "At family gatherings, Maria didn\u2019t show obvious signs of distress, though the language barrier made communication difficult. Other behavior was explained away as the result of her troubled childhood in the orphanage, Parrish said.",
      "\u201cBut behind closed doors, I don\u2019t know what happened.\u201d",
      "Pires' teenage years were hard. She drank too much and got kicked out of school for fighting. She ran away from foster homes, including places where people cared for her deeply.",
      "\u201cIf ever there was a child who was cheated out of life, it was Maria,\u201d one foster mother wrote in later court filings. \u201cShe is a beautiful person, but she has had a hard life for someone so young.\u201d",
      "She struggled to provide for herself, sometimes ending up homeless. \u201cMy trauma was real bad,\u201d she said. \u201cI was on my own.\u201d",
      "She became angry and violent. She would fight anyone who crossed her.",
      "At 18, she pleaded guilty to aggravated assault for the roller rink attack. She served two years in prison, where she finally learned basic reading and writing skills. It was then that authorities \u2014 and Pires herself \u2014 discovered she wasn't a U.S. citizen.",
      "Her criminal record meant it would be extremely difficult to gain citizenship. Suddenly, she faced deportation.",

      "A team of volunteer lawyers and advocates argued she shouldn\u2019t be punished for something beyond her control.",

      "Ultimately, the American judicial system agreed: Pires would be allowed to remain in the United States if she checked in annually with ICE, a fairly common process until Trump's second term.",
      "Pires didn\u2019t immediately take advantage of her second chance.",
      "She was arrested for cocaine distribution in 2004 and for check fraud in 2007. While incarcerated, she picked up charges for stabbing her cellmate in the eye, burning an inmate with a flat iron and throwing hot water on a correctional officer. Her sentence was extended.",
      "Pires said she spent several years in solitary confinement, exacerbating her mental health challenges.",
      "Her release in 2017 marked a new beginning. Through therapy and other support services, she learned to manage her anger and stay out of trouble. She gave up drinking. She started working long days in construction. She checked in every year with immigration agents.",
      "But in 2023, work dried up and she fell behind on rent. She felt her mental health slipping. She applied for a women\u2019s transitional housing program in Baltimore.",
      "Pires thrived there. With no high school diploma and only second-grade reading skills, she qualified for a state-run job training course to polish and refinish floors. Photos show her smiling broadly in a blue graduation gown.",
      "Friends say Pires may have a tough exterior, but she\u2019s known for thinking of others first. She often greets people with a cheerful question: \u201cHow\u2019s your mental?\u201d It\u2019s her way of acknowledging that everyone carries some sort of burden.",
      "\u201cThis is a person who just yearns for family,\u201d said Britney Jones, Pires' former roommate. \u201cShe handles things with so much forgiveness and grace.\u201d",
      "The two were living together when Pires went to downtown Baltimore on March 6 for her annual immigration check-in. She never returned.",
      "When President Donald Trump campaigned for a second term, he doubled down on promises to carry out mass deportations. Within hours of taking office, he signed a series of executive orders, targeting what he called \u201cthe worst of the worst\u201d \u2014 murderers, rapists, gang members. The goal, officials have said, is 1 million deportations a year.",
      "In March, Pires showed up at the immigration office with paperwork listing all her check-ins over the past eight years. This time, instead of receiving another compliance report, she was immediately handcuffed and detained.",
      "\u201cThe government failed her,\u201d attorney Jim Merklinger said. \u201cThey allowed this to happen.\u201d",
      "Given that she was adopted into the country as a child, she shouldn\u2019t be punished for something that was out of her hands from the start, he said.",
      "Her March arrest sparked a journey across America's immigration detention system. From Baltimore, she was sent to New Jersey and Louisiana before landing at Eloy Detention Center in Arizona.",
      "She tried to stay positive. Although Trump\u2019s anti-immigrant rhetoric made her nervous, Pires reminded herself that the system granted her leniency in the past. She told her friends back home not to worry.",
      "On June 2, in an email exchange obtained by AP, an ICE agent asked to have Pires prioritized for a deportation flight to Brazil leaving in four days.",
      "\u201cI would like to keep her as low profile as possible,\u201d the agent wrote.",
      "Her lawyer tried to stop the deportation, calling Maryland politicians, ICE officials and Brazilian diplomats.",
      "\u201cThis is a woman who followed all the rules,\u201d Merklinger said. \u201cThis should not be happening.\u201d",
      "He received terrified calls from Pires, who was suddenly transferred to a detention facility near Alexandria, Louisiana, a common waypoint for deportation flights.",
      "Finally, Pires said, she was handcuffed, shackled, put on a bus with dozens of other detainees, driven to the Alexandria airport and loaded onto an airplane. There was a large group of Brazilians on the flight, which was a relief, though she spoke hardly any Portuguese after so many years in the U.S.",
      "\u201cI was just praying to God,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe this is his plan.\u201d",
      "After two stops to drop off other deportees, they arrived in the Brazilian port city of Fortaleza.",
      "Brazilian authorities later took Pires to a women\u2019s shelter in an inland city in the eastern part of the country.",
      "She has spent months there trying to get Brazilian identification documents. She began relearning Portuguese \u2014 listening to conversations around her and watching TV.",
      "Most of her belongings are in a Baltimore storage unit, including DJ equipment and a tripod she used for recording videos \u2014 two of her passions.",
      "In Brazil, she has almost nothing. She depends on the shelter for necessities such as soap and toothpaste. But she maintains a degree of hope.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve survived all these years,\u201d Pires said. \u201cI can survive again.\u201d",
      "She can\u2019t stop thinking about her birth family. Years ago, she got a tattoo of her mother\u2019s middle name. Now more than ever, she wants to know where she came from. \u201cI still have that hole in my heart,\u201d she said.",
      "Above all, she hopes to return to America. Her attorney recently filed an application for citizenship. But federal officials say that\u2019s not happening.",
      "\u201cShe was an enforcement priority because of her serial criminal record,\u201d Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in an email. \u201cCriminals are not welcome in the U.S.\u201d",

She\u2019s applied for Brazilian work authorization, but getting a job will probably be difficult until her Portuguese improves. She\u2019s been researching language classes and using her limited vocabulary to communicate with other shelter residents.",
      "In moments of optimism, she imagines herself working as a translator, earning a decent salary and renting a nice apartment.",

      "Does Florida\u2019s Everglades National Park represent a slight to development in America",
      "The Trump administration is reviewing material about slavery, the destruction of Native American culture, climate change and more at federal parks after employees flagged information that could be \u201cdisparaging\u201d to Americans, according to screenshots shared with The Associated Press.",
      "President Donald Trump signed an executive order in March directing the Interior Department \u2014 which manages parks, monuments and other designated land \u2014 to ensure public property doesn't contain elements that \u201cinappropriately disparage Americans past or living.\" Instead, it said to \u201cfocus on the greatness of the achievements and progress of the American people\u201d and \u201cthe beauty, abundance, and grandeur of the American landscape.\u201d",
      "The National Park Service had until July 18 to flag \u201cinappropriate\u201d signs, exhibits and other material, according to a document shared with the AP by the National Parks Conservation Association, which obtained internal information from an anonymous source within the Interior Department. The public was also encouraged to participate.",
      "\u201cAs we carry out this directive, we\u2019ll be evaluating all signage in the park along with the public feedback we\u2019ve received,\" said Elizabeth Peace, spokesperson for the Interior Department. \u201cThis effort reinforces our commitment to telling the full and accurate story of our nation\u2019s past.\" The department said any signage inconsistent with the executive order will be removed or covered and reinstated once edits are made. The administration said it would remove all \u201cinappropriate\u201d material by Sept. 17, according to The New York Times, citing internal agency documents.",

      "In North Carolina's Cape Hatteras National Seashore, there are signs about sea level rise due to climate change. \u201cWe do not believe it to be in violation, but would like someone to review if messaging of climate change and sea level rise reduces the focus on the grandeur, beauty and abundance,\u201d one employee wrote.",
      "THE BACK STORY: Emissions from burning fossil fuels are heating the planet, causing ice sheets and glaciers to melt and seawater to expand. Rising seas threaten the people and ecosystems that live by the coast.",

      "WHAT'S IN DISPUTE: At a gift shop in Charles Pinckney National Historic Site in South Carolina, marked for review were books for sale, including \u201cIncidents in the Life of a Slave Girl\u201d by Harriet Jacobs. Similar books were flagged elsewhere, including at the Washington Monument, where someone identified a book discussing George Washington as a slave owner.",

      "The complaint asserts that Director Kash Patel indicated directly to one of the ousted agents, Brian Driscoll, that he knew the firings were \u201clikely illegal\" but was powerless to stop them because the White House and the Justice Department were determined to remove all agents who helped investigate President Donald Trump. It quotes Patel as having told Driscoll in a conversation last month \u201cthe FBI tried to put the president in jail and he hasn't forgotten it.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit was filed on behalf of Driscoll, Steve Jensen and Spencer Evans, three of five agents known to have been fired last month in a purge that current and former officials say has unnerved the workforce. It represents a legal challenge from the top rungs of the FBI's leadership ladder to a flood of departures under Trump's Republican administration that has wiped out decades of experience. Fired agents have leveled unflattering allegations of a law enforcement agency whose personnel moves are shaped by the White House and guided more by politics than by public safety.",
      "\u201cPatel not only acted unlawfully but deliberately chose to prioritize politicizing the FBI over protecting the American people,\u201d the suit says. It adds that \u201chis decision to do so degraded the country\u2019s national security by firing three of the FBI\u2019s most experienced operational leaders, each of them experts in preventing terrorism and reducing violent crime.\u201d",
      "Spokespeople for the FBI declined to comment on the lawsuit, as they also did after the agents were ousted.",
      "The suit was filed in federal court in Washington, where judges and grand juries have pushed back against Trump administration initiatives and charging decisions. It names as defendants Patel and Attorney General Pam Bondi, as well as the FBI, the Justice Department and the Executive Office of the President.",
      "Besides reinstatement, the suit seeks, among other remedies, the awarding of back pay, an order declaring the firings illegal and even a forum for them to clear their names. It notes that Patel, in a Fox News Channel interview two weeks after the terminations, said \u201cevery single person\u201d found to have weaponized the FBI had been removed from leadership positions even though the suit says there's no indication any of the three had done so.",
      "\u201cThis false and defamatory public smear impugned the professional reputation of each of the Plaintiffs, suggesting they were something other than faithful and apolitical law enforcement officials, and has caused not only the loss of the Plaintiffs\u2019 present government employment but further harmed their future employment prospects,\u201d the suit states.",
      "The three fired officials, according to the lawsuit, had participated in and supervised some of the FBI's most complex work, including international terrorism investigations.",
      "\u201cThey were pinnacles of what the rank-and-file aspired to, and now the FBI has been deprived not only of that example but has been deprived of very important operational competence,\u201d said Chris Mattei, one of the agents' lawyers. \u201cTheir firing from the FBI, taken together, has put every American at greater risk than when Brian Driscoll, Steve Jensen and Spencer Evans were in positions of leadership.\u201d",
      "Another of their attorneys, Abbe Lowell, said the lawsuit shows FBI leadership is \u201ccarrying out political orders to punish law enforcement agents for doing their jobs.\u201d",
      "Perhaps the most prominent of the plaintiffs is Driscoll, a former commander of the FBI's specialized hostage rescue team who served as acting director between when then-Director Christopher Wray resigned in January and Patel was confirmed in February.",
      "In that job, he had a well-publicized standoff in the first days of the Trump administration with a senior Justice Department official, Emil Bove, over Bove's demand for a list of agents who worked on the investigation into the Jan. 6, 2021, riot by a mob of Trump supporters at the U.S. Capitol. Driscoll resisted the order in a dispute that led Bove to accuse him of \u201cinsubordination.\u201d",

      "Driscoll survived the dispute and took another high-profile position overseeing the FBI's Critical Incident Response Group, or CIRG, which deploys to crises. But new problems arose last month, the complaint says, when an FBI pilot whose duties including flying the bureau's private jet was falsely identified on social media as having been a case agent on the investigation into Trump's hoarding of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida.",
      "The complaint says Driscoll was told that the pilot, Chris Meyer, could no longer fly Patel on the FBI plane. Driscoll acceded to the request but refused to strip Meyer entirely of his pilot duties and balked when told of Trump administration desires to fire him.",
      "The lawsuit recounts a conversation from early August in which Driscoll told Patel that it would be illegal to fire someone based on case assignments. Patel, according to the suit, said he understood the actions were \u201clikely illegal\u201d but that he had to fire who his superiors wanted him to \u201cbecause his ability to keep his own job depended on the removal of the agents who worked on cases involving the President.\u201d",
      "Meyer was later fired but is not among the plaintiffs in Wednesday's suit.",
      "One of the plaintiffs, Jensen, was picked by Patel to run the bureau's Washington field office despite a backlash from Trump loyalists about his earlier leadership role coordinating investigations into the Capitol riot. The suit says that even as Jensen was publicly defended by FBI leadership, he was told by Patel and Deputy Director Dan Bongino that they were spending \u201ca lot of political capital\u201d to keep him in the position.",
      "In May, according to the complaint, Bongino told him he would have to fire an agent assigned to his office who'd worked on Trump-related cases but also investigations into officials of both major political parties. That agent, Walter Giardina, was also among the five who were fired.",
      "Another plaintiff, Evans, says he was targeted for retribution over his leadership role in the FBI's Human Resources Division during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, which made him responsible for reviewing accommodation requests from employees seeking exemption from vaccine requirements.",
      "That position exposed Evans to a barrage of criticism from a former agent who the lawsuit says regularly aired his grievances against Evans on social media and maintained access to Patel.",
      "Evans was among senior executives told in late January to either retire or be fired, but he was given a reprieve and permitted to remain in his job as leader of the Las Vegas field office. Despite being reassured that he had the support of Patel and Bongino, he was told in May that he would have to leave his position.",
      "On Aug. 6, the lawsuit says, Evans was packing for a new FBI assignment in Huntsville, Alabama, when he was notified that he had been fired. The stated cause was a \u201clack of reasonableness and overzealousness\u201d in implementing COVID-19 protocols, though the suit says he has no recollection of having ever denied a request for a vaccination exemption.",

      "AUBURN, Ala. -- Flowers and memorial messages were tied to the gate of Kiesel Park in Auburn to remember retired veterinary professor Julie Gard Schnuelle, who was attacked and killed there over the weekend.",
      "Gard Schnuelle's killing at a city park has rattled the college town of 83,757 people. The sprawling green space, in a rural-feeling area of the city about 4 miles (6 kilometers) from the university campus, is popular with dog walkers and exercisers because of its fields and 2 miles (3 kilometers) of walking trails.",
      "Authorities said Gard Schnuelle, 59, died after being stabbed multiple times. Her body was found in a wooded area of the park. Police have charged Harold Rashad Dabney III, 28, with capital murder. Court documents indicate that investigators believe Dabney killed Gard Schnuelle during an attempted robbery and then left in her red Ford F-150 truck. He was being held without bond.",
      "People who came to the park Tuesday said they were shocked by the killing at the placid location.",
      "\u201cHorrified and couldn\u2019t believe it happened in broad daylight,\u201d said Paul Holm, who came to the park to the walk. \u201cThis is a beautiful place where you can go for peace. Now, I'm going to be thinking where did it happen.\u201d",
      "Gwnstavus Dowdell, who brought his dog Tiger, said he tried to go the park Sunday but it was closed. The park was temporarily closed to the public over the weekend while investigators gathered evidence.",
      "\u201cI Googled the place to see what was going on. When I saw what happened the day before, I was shocked. While she was walking her dog? It just doesn't make sense,\u201d Dowdell said.",
      "Gard Schnuelle, a large animal veterinarian, was a 1996 graduate of the veterinary school and a faculty member from 2003 until her retirement in 2021. She specialized in cattle reproduction. She recently served as Area Veterinarian in Charge with the U.S. Department of Agriculture for Alabama and Mississippi. She remained active with the veterinary school even after her retirement.",
      "\u201cDr. Schnuelle was an extremely enthusiastic and energetic person,\u201d said Calvin M. Johnson, dean of the College of Veterinary Medicine at Auburn University. \u201cShe was a fabulous teacher. The students really responded to her enthusiasm, and it motivated to them to excel.\u201d",
      "He said there is a feeling of \u201cabsolute shock\u201d and sadness on the vet school campus. He said the park is a beloved place where faculty and students frequently go to to walk or take a break.",

      "The mayor once known for her outspoken persona has kept quiet about the charges in the weeks since the 18-count indictment against her and Vappie was announced in mid-August. She did not acknowledge the indictment during public appearances to commemorate the 20th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina late last month.",

The City Council issued a statement last week saying it had reassured the Housing Authority of New Orleans and the Office of Community Development that other city officials could sign federal contracts instead.",
      "At times, she and her allies have said the blowback she is experiencing is tinged by double standards she faces as a Black woman.

      "At the start of Trump's second term, his Republican administration said it would allow immigration arrests at schools \u2014 long considered off limits. That violated the law, argues the lawsuit from the two largest U.S. teacher unions, the National Education Association and the American Federation of Teachers.",
      "Also joining the lawsuit are educators from an Oregon preschool where masked agents broke a car window and dragged a student's father from his car shortly after the child had been dropped off. The arrival of police prompted the school to go into a lockdown, with teachers playing music so students couldn't hear the commotion outside.",

      "The New Orleans Archdiocese has agreed to a $230 million settlement for survivors of clergy sexual abuse",
      "NEW ORLEANS -- The New Orleans Archdiocese on Monday agreed to a $230 million proposed settlement for survivors of clergy sexual abuse, attorneys for some of the survivors said Monday. The agreement paves the way for a final resolution to yearslong negotiations amid a series of similar settlements from the Catholic Church.",
      "The archdiocese had announced in May that it would pay at least $179.2 million in response to more than 500 abuse claims, which the bloc of attorneys said they opposed because they considered it to be lowballing the hundreds of survivors.",
      "\u201cWe knew this was a bad deal, and we knew we could do better; and we have,\" the group of 10 attorneys said in a statement. \"The \u2018power of no\u2019 forced the Archdiocese to come up with significantly more money.\u201d",
      "The archdiocese had filed for bankruptcy in May 2020 rather than handle each abuse claim separately, which survivors point out allows church leadership to avoid facing tough questions in court. The archdiocese called the updated settlement a \u201csignificant step forward for the benefit of all claimant survivors\" in an emailed statement.",
      "Survivors have until late October to vote on whether or not to approve the settlement. If approved by two-thirds of survivors, payments could begin disbursement by next year.",
      "\u201cAt this point, I\u2019m not aware of a single attorney for an abuse survivor that opposes the plan,\u201d said Brad Knapp, an attorney for a committee representing abuse survivors. \u201cWith all the abuse survivors\u2019 attorneys supporting it, I think there\u2019s much less chance that it gets voted down.\u201d",
      "The archdiocese's bankruptcy is one of the longest running and most contentious of more than a dozen ongoing Catholic Church bankruptcy cases in the U.S. related to sex abuse, according to Terence McKiernan, president of the nonprofit BishopAccountability.org.",
      "Judge Meredith Grabill, overseeing the bankruptcy proceedings in federal court, has warned that if the settlement is not approved, then she will dismiss the case.",
      "If a bankruptcy settlement fails, survivors would be required to seek compensation for their abuse claims through new lawsuits, which could take years to play out in courts. And it raises the prospect that the archdiocese would declare bankruptcy again to delay payments, according to a public letter from the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors. The committee represents the interests of abuse survivors in the bankruptcy case and urged survivors to accept the initial settlement offer.",
      "The committee warned that bringing individual abuse claims in court would likely lead to difficult confrontations with a \u201caggressive and hostile\u201d archdiocese, which could force survivors and their friends and family to engage in tough depositions and years of appeals, exacerbating survivors\u2019 \u201cemotional and psychological pain.\u201d",
      "\u201cA lot of survivors are ready for this to be resolved,\u201d said Kristi Schubert, an attorney representing dozens of survivors. \u201cA lot of them would prefer to receive certain money now.\u201d",

He pointed out that the bankruptcy process allows the church to \u201cwear people down\u201d and keep the public in the dark about the extent to which it enabled abuse.",
      "The settlement as outlined in May requires the archdiocese to bring in outside experts to evaluate its child-protection programs and recommend improvements. The archdiocese would also establish a document archive at a secular university related to its abuse and hold public forums for survivors to share their experiences and concerns with the archbishop.",
      "\u201cI remain very hopeful and committed to bringing this bankruptcy to a conclusion that benefits the survivors of abuse,\u201d said New Orleans Archbishop Gregory M. Aymond in a Monday statement. \u201cPlease know that I pray for the survivors of abuse every day and look forward to the opportunity to meet with them to hear their stories...\u201d",

      "A former leprosy settlement in a remote part of Hawaii that\u2019s been closed to tours and religious pilgrimages is reopening this month",
      "HONOLULU -- A former leprosy settlement in a remote part of Hawaii will reopen this month for the first time since the pandemic, when it closed to shield the few remaining patients, all of whom are over 80, from exposure to COVID-19, officials said Monday.",
      "Tours and religious pilgrimages draw visitors to Kalaupapa, an isolated peninsula cut off by 2,000-foot (600-meter) cliffs. It traditionally has only been reachable by boat, small plane, mule ride or hourslong hike. Right now, travel to the area is only allowed by plane, Kalaupapa National Historical Park said in a statement.",
      "Hawaii banished leprosy patients to Kalaupapa for over a century, starting in 1866 during Hawaiian Kingdom rule. The exile policy was only lifted in 1969.",
      "More than 8,000 people died there, most of them Native Hawaiian. Saint Damien, a Catholic priest from Belgium who cared for patients in the late 19th century and was canonized by the church in 2009, also died there after contracting the disease.",
      "Damien\u2019s devotion to the ailing has inspired people worldwide, as has the work of Saint Marianne, a German-born nun who cared for the ill for decades before she died of natural causes on Kalaupapa in 1918. The church canonized her in 2012.",
      "Today, the peninsula is governed by the state Department of Health while the National Park Service operates the historical park.",
      "Leprosy, also known as Hansen\u2019s disease, is spread by direct, person-to-person contact, although it\u2019s not easily transmitted. It can cause skin lesions, mangle fingers and toes, and lead to blindness. It's been curable since the development of sulfone drugs in the 1940s, and people treated with drugs aren\u2019t contagious.",

      "Patients are free to leave the settlement, but many have chosen to stay because it has become their home. Six patients, all cured, live there now, ranging in age from 84 to 101. Three live there full-time and three visit intermittently.",
      "The state has promised to keep the settlement open and care for patients until the last one dies. Their privacy means guided tours are the only way visitors may travel to Kalaupapa.",
      "Tours are available through Kalaupapa Saints Tour, founded by patient Meli Watanuki. Seawind Tours & Travel will operate the tours on Watanuki's behalf, CEO Randy King said.",
      "All visitors must be at least 16 years old and have a Department of Health visitor permit, which Seawind Tours will facilitate.",
      "Resuming tours has been complicated by the complicated logistics of the remote location. Watanuki bought a used van to transport visitors but has had to wait for it to arrive because a barge carrying vehicles to the peninsula only arrives once a year. The van arrived Saturday, King said.",

      "There are no players, no stadium, no fans in the frame \u2014 just strength, pride, and freedom embodied in the bird itself.",
      "Richard layered the background with his fingers, then shifted to stippling \u2014 a meticulous technique using tiny dots of paint to build texture and depth.",
      "\"Think of all those leaves, one by one \u2014 whoosh,\" he laughed, slipping into a line of song: \"Don't worry about a thing\u2026 every little thing gonna be alright.\"",

      "After losing his job as a chef when Crozer Medical closed, Richard returned to his first love: art.",
      "\"I felt connected with the Creator\u2026 and art is like creation,\" he said.",
      "He's also the author of The True Awakening of the Mind, a book that mirrors the spiritual artistry he's carried since childhood. Richard started drawing at age 7 in his native Trinidad, sketching in the earth with coconut branches. Today, his pieces hang on official walls back home.",
      "Closest to his heart is a body of work he calls the Colorless Collection.",
      "\"There's no black and white,\" Richard said. \"We're one human family.\"",
      "He describes the series as a way to unite people \u2014 beyond skin tones and team colors. \"The one color we all share is red,\" he said, \"The blood that connects us.\"",
      "And when it comes to Philly, there's another connection close to home: Bird Nation.",
      "Richard is holding the bald eagle painting for what he calls \"Eagles royalty.\"",
      "\"I'm hoping the owner of the Eagles \u2014 and Mr. Hurts and the rest of the team \u2014 will contact me and buy the paintings,\" he said, with a laugh that lingers in the studio.",

      "The clothes designed by Giorgio Armani (July 11, 1934-Sept. 4, 2025) very much reflected relaxed elegance \u2013 a supercool attitude that blurred divisions between men's and women's clothing. Forming the Giorgio Armani Company in 1975, he first made menswear, then launched a women's line, one that recut a traditional men's suit jacket.",
      "Armani told \"Sunday Morning\" in 2006 that it was a response to the emerging feminist movement; he thought women needed their own sexy version of boardroom attire. \"When I started blending men and women's fashions many years ago, the public often became uneasy and perplexed,\" he said.",
      "Born in Piacenza, Italy, Armani's was a childhood ravaged by World War II, his family's home destroyed by bombs. Though he hadn't dreamed of a career in design, a temporary job in a department store made him realize he had a knack. Rising through the ranks, he worked for designer Nino Cerutti, but lacked formal training of his own.",
      "In 1966, Armani met Sergio Galeotti, an architectural draftsman who became his partner in work and in life. Galeotti encouraged Armani to begin designing on his own.",
      "Armani would put Italian ready-to-wear style on the international fashion map in the late 1970s. His liningless sports jacket, paired with a T-shirt, was an instant success, while his women's pantsuit was revolutionary. He landed on the cover of Time magazine, and his clothes found their way into countless films (including \"American Gigolo\"), and on the red carpet.",
      "After the death of Galeotti in 1985, Armani continued the company, building it into a $10 billion empire encompassing not just fashion but also home design, bars and restaurants, perfumes, cosmetics, and even a basketball team, Olympia Milano.",
      "A perfectionist, Armani would worry about every detail, no matter how small. When asked what he felt when releasing a new collection, Armani replied, \"I am terrified.\""

    "summary": "Nate Bargatze, the highest-grossing stand-up in the U.S., talks about moving back to Nashville, the appeal of being a \"clean comic,\" and hosting the 77th Emmy Awards on CBS.",
    "story": [
      "2024 was a historic year for comedian Nate Bargatze. As the highest-grossing stand-up in the country, he set attendance records at several massive arenas. But a small gymnasium in Nashville \u2013 the home of the Donelson Christian Academy Wildcats \u2013 is where he's recently made his mark. He's donated more than a million dollars to his alma matter, which now features the Nate Bargatze Gymnasium.",
      "Bargatze never played on this court: \"Yeah, I was cut every year from my basketball team,\" he said. \"But now, you know, now they can't cut you!\"",
      "Donelson Christian Academy is a private high school his family could only afford because his father taught here. \"My freshman year, he's assistant coach,\" Bargatze said. \"So that really got it started. When your dad cuts you, it kind of sets the tone for the rest of your high school.\"",
      "Nate's father, Stephen Bargatze, also happens to be a professional magician. Before that, he was a clown. As you might imagine, that provided some inspiration for a career in comedy \u2013 and for some early stand-up material:",
      "\"It's funny, too, when I tell people my dad was a clown. People will just be like 'Ugh, I hate clowns.' Hey, remember that time I just said my dad was a clown?\"",
      "After dropping out of community college, Bargatze moved from Nashville to Chicago, where he honed his style performing for free at small clubs. \"I would never trade it, and I would never go back,\" he said. \"You just didn't know no better. There's nothing better than when you don't know that there's better.\"",
      "He then made the move to New York. But in 2014, just as his stand-up career was taking off, Bargatze made a surprising move back home to Nashville.",
      "Why? \"You know what? I always thought it was the first thing I did that wasn't for me,\" he said. \"I wanted my daughter to grow up in a normal situation, as normal as it can be. And so it was like, 'All right, let's move back.' And when I moved back, I just didn't tell anybody.\"",
      "I asked, \"Were you worried that there was going to be an impression that, like, 'Well, he moved back to Nashville, he's given up'?\"",
      "\"That's why I didn't tell anybody, 'cause I thought they would think I'd quit,\" Bargatze said. \"And I was so scared of that. So, I just didn't say anything.\"",
      "Nobody would ever think that now. Bargatze has since released five hour-long specials, written a New York Times bestselling book, and sold more than a million tickets last year alone.",
      "\"I don't know anything about history. And I can tell, because every history movie I watch, I watch on the edge of my seat. I watched 'Pearl Harbor,' I was as surprised as they were.\"",
      "His next milestone? Hosting the Primetime Emmy Awards next Sunday on CBS.",
      "\"I love show business,\" he said while recording promotional material for the awards. \"I love all of this. And as part of me, I want to do everything. You're just curious to go, like, Well, what is that like? What is that, you know, when you do 'Saturday Night Live'?\u00a0It's like, I want to see the chaos. I want to feel the chaos.\"",
      "Bargatze has hosted \"Saturday Night Live\" twice. [\"I'm as shocked as you are that I'm here,\" he said in his monologue.] His \"Washington's Dream\" sketch became one of the most viral sketches in years:",
      "There's more acting on the horizon. Bargatze just finished filming his first feature, \"The Breadwinner,\" costarring Mandy Moore, set to hit theaters next spring. His character is a bumbling dad \u2013 a role he says is not too dissimilar from his real-life personality. \"We eased into it,\" he said, \"I ain't crying in this movie, I can tell you that. In the movie, I have three daughters and, you know, I have one daughter.\"",
      "\"Oh my gosh, give him the Academy Award right now,\" I said.",
      "\"Yeah. Yeah,\" he laughed. \"There's a lot of buzz about it!\"",
      "Bargatze met his wife, Laura, when he was 21; they were coworkers at an Applebee's. As he recounted in the 2017 special \"The Standups,\" \"I went from, like, my mom to her. So, I don't even know what it feels like not to have some lady be like, 'I don't know if I would do that, you know?'\"",
      "Their daughter, Harper, introduces his stand-up specials, which are intentionally family-friendly. He's a clean comic.",
      "\"I love that people when they come to my show, it's, uh, I don't wanna betray that trust,\" he said. \"You can have your kid watch my stand-up and you don't like, if you see 'em have it on, you don't have to be like, 'Whoa, what's going on?'\"",
      "While working clean can be a savvy business decision, it allows one to sell tickets to the widest audience possible. For Bargatze, it's also part of a larger mission. He said, \"You feel like you're being asked to do this and the career that I have. And so, you just gotta trust that, uh, your path is gonna be the path, and just stick with it.\"",
      "I said, \"When you say asked to do this, do you mean in like sort of a religious calling kind of a way?\"",
      "\"Yeah,\" he replied. \"You feel \u2013 you know, I feel it's beyond me.\"",
      "With \"Good Clean Funny\" as its mantra, Bargatze's company, Nateland, produces specials, live events, and podcasts featuring other clean comedians. He even has dreams of one day opening his own theme park and movie studio in Nashville.",
      "\"I'm not gonna be able to go to every city in America for the rest of my life,\" he said. \"So, I want to build a place where you can come. And if you and your wife and your kids are 11 and they want to go run off on their own for a second, I want that to happen.\"",
      "To pull off all of his ambitious plans, one of the most successful touring comedians of all time is already plotting the end of his touring days.",
      "\"I'm doing this tour, I plan on doing one more tour after that,\" he said. \"I need to go do movies, and I need to build that world up and learn how to do all of that stuff. So, I'm gonna dive into that aspect of it. I can see myself being and making movies for, like, another 15 years, and then \u2013 if I'm allowed to! I mean, it might all fall apart.\"",
      "These days, during breaks on his grueling tour schedule, Bargatze is able to briefly take his mind off stand-up by playing golf. \"I mean, it's kind of like stand-up,\" he said. \"You're kind of out there on your own. Golf is, uh, you're so much like thinking about what you're doing out there. I realized, like, I can't turn my brain off, so I just need to direct it to something else.\"",
      "Bargatze has a lot to focus on. The day before he hosts the Emmys in Los Angeles, he's performing two back-to-back arena shows in Denver. But he wouldn't have it any other way.",
      "He said, \"I know how to kind of operate in this chaos. And if you pulled me out and gave me a month off, I think I would be like lost right now. Let's keep going. We're in a good groove. You don't want to kind of stop the groove. Yeah, it'll be a lot of stuff. It's a lot of stuff!\"",

      "\"Wielded by both David Prowse\" \u2014 the Darth Vader actor \u2014 \"and stunt performer Bob Anderson, this is the primary dueling prop created for Vader's character in both Empire and Jedi,\" the site says. \"It saw extensive use during the filming of both movies and is one of the most memorable film props from the original trilogy.\"",

    "summary": "Four physicians, who recently resigned from the CDC in protest, tell \"Sunday Morning\" they believe HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is jeopardizing the nation's public health.",
    "story": [
      "At the end of summer, Congress is often sleepy, and slowly gets back to work. But this past week was an exception. On Capitol Hill, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. arrived, and the controversial Health and Human Services Secretary sparked a reckoning over public health in America.",
      "At a hearing before the Senate Finance Committee on Thursday, Kennedy defended the Trump administration's policies: \"We at HHS are enacting a once-in-a-generation shift from a sick-care system, to a true health care system that tackles the root causes of chronic disease,\" he said.",
      "Tempers ran hot at the hearing. Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) said, \"This is not a podcast. It is the American people's health that is on the line here.\"",
      "Democrats rebuked Kennedy, perhaps the most high-profile member of President Donald Trump's cabinet. Sen. Tina Smith (D-Minn.) asked Kennedy, \"When were you lying, sir \u2013   when you told this committee that you were not anti-vax? Or when you told Americans that there's no safe and effective vaccine?\"",
      "To which Kennedy replied, \"Both things are true.\"",
      "There were Republicans who offered broad support for Kennedy. Sen. Mike Crapo (R-Ida.) said, \"President Trump and Secretary Kennedy have made a steadfast commitment to make America healthy again.\"",
      "Yet some Republicans notably did push Kennedy on how his long-standing opposition to vaccine mandates is affecting policy, and on Kennedy's doubts about the safety of various vaccines. Sen. John Barasso (R-Wyo.) said, \"There are real concerns that safe, proven vaccines like measles, like hepatitis B and others, could be in jeopardy.\"",
      "The committee room standoff had been brewing for days. On Aug. 27, the government announced new restrictions on eligibility for COVID vaccinations. That decision prompted some health organizations to warn the policy could cause confusion.",
      "That same day, the Trump White House said Susan Monarez, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who had just been confirmed by the Senate weeks earlier, was fired.",
      "The Trump White House stood by Secretary Kennedy's sweeping changes, and by the firing. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said of Monarez, \"She was not aligned with President Trump's mission to make America healthy again.\"",
      "In a statement to \"Sunday Morning,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said, \"The White House maintains full confidence in Secretary Kennedy's leadership at HHS to advance President Trump's MAHA agenda. With Operation Warp Speed's unprecedented success delivering COVID-19 vaccines in record time, President Trump proved that it's possible to shake up the status quo of our broken and bureaucratic public health system to deliver real results for the American people. Now the second Trump administration is building on this record and experience to restore Gold Standard Science as the guiding principle of health decision-making at HHS to Make America Healthy Again.\"",
      "In a Wall Street Journal op-ed, Susan Monarez has written that she was pressured to \"compromise science itself\" \u2013 and to sign off on people who \"have publicly expressed antivaccine rhetoric.\"",
      "This turbulence has put Kennedy, who was a key Trump ally during last year's campaign, in the spotlight.",
      "Asked whether there has been pressure within the Republican Party to stand by Kennedy, Kentucky Republican Senator Rand Paul said, \"Nobody's pressured me or ever called me on it. I sort of speak my mind. And these are long-standing beliefs for me.\"",
      "Paul, an ophthalmologist, supports Kennedy, and lays blame on scientists \u2014 not skeptics \u2014 for worries about vaccine safety. \"All the doubt over vaccines is \u2013 there might be some doubt coming from those who don't want you to take a vaccine, but quite a bit of doubt is coming from the establishment that I believe is authoritarian in nature,\" said Paul. \"You don't care whether they tell you what to do. You should just do what you're told. We know better than you.\"",
      "But some who have worked at the highest level are fighting back against criticism, and are sounding an alarm.",
      "\"A significant distrust of vaccines\"",
      "Four CDC officials \u2014 Doctors Jennifer Layden, Daniel Jernigan, Debra Houry, and Demetre Daskalakis \u2014 all have resigned in recent days, some citing Secretary Kennedy's vaccine policies, others citing the upheaval at the CDC, which provides crucial health guidance nationwide.",
      "And all four expressed concerns about their resulting trust in CDC information about vaccines and vaccine safety data. \"It's why I left; I'm very concerned,\" said Dr. Daskalakis. \"We've already crossed the line. The COVID recommendations for children and pregnant women are completely not based in any evidence that world experts agree on.\"",
      "I asked, \"You know Secretary Kennedy would push back on that; what would you tell him?\"",
      "\"Ah, easy,\" Daskalakis replied. \"The recommendation is that there should be no healthy kids that get the vaccine; it should only be in kids with underlying conditions. Kids that are six-months-old, 56% of them that are admitted to the hospital have no underlying condition. So, by not offering the vaccine to parents who are willing to do it, those kids that could have been protected won't be.\"",
      "Asked how he would label Kennedy and his view of vaccines, Dr. Daniel Jernigan said, \"I think he has a significant distrust of vaccines. I don't know that he's driving a get-rid-of-vaccines agenda. It's more death by a thousand cuts, death by a thousand questions, calling into question data that has been accepted for many, many years, and simply that calling it into question brings into people's minds that, 'Maybe I shouldn't get that vaccine.'\"",
      "Dr. Debra Houry said that when Kennedy began at HHS, \"I read his books. I wanted to better understand his research and his background on it. So, we were open, you know, to having those discussions.\"",
      "In an additional statement to \"Sunday Morning,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said:",
      "\"Americans haven't forgotten how 'the science' was politicized and weaponized during the COVID era by unaccountable 'health officials' to push intrusive mandates and stifle any semblance of the skepticism that actual scientific inquiry is based on. The Trump administration is committed to restoring evidence-based, Gold Standard Science and answering the questions that Americans haven't been allowed to ask to restore trust, confidence, and accountability in our public health bodies.\"",
      "Asked what the cost to Americans would be of doctors and other officials leaving the CDC, Dr. Jennifer Layden said, \"We're talking about the whole public health infrastructure of our nation. And I think when we start to see (and we will) outbreaks that normally don't happen \u2013 more food-borne outbreaks, Legionella outbreaks, rising measles cases \u2013 people will start to care. That may take time for us to see some of those negative consequences, but that's what the ripple effect of all this will do across our nation.\"",
      "In fact, ripple effects are already apparent.",
      "\"Diseases don't obey borders\"",
      "Just this past week, Florida's Republican governor announced plans to eliminate all childhood vaccine requirements.",
      "Meanwhile, West Coast Democratic governors who oppose Secretary Kennedy's policies are moving fast to protect vaccine programs in their states.",
      "I asked Dr. Atul Gawande, a surgeon who served in the Biden administration, \"What is the consequence for the country when you have such a differentiation? It's splintered.\"",
      "\"It's severely splintered, and I'm very worried about it,\" Gawandea replied, \"because diseases don't obey borders.",
      "For Gawande, Kennedy's actions could upend not only federal agencies, but America's standing in global health. \"There isn't always consensus, for sure, among our own medical community,\" he said, \"but we generally have been able to come together enough to be able to say, 'Here is where we can assure getting \u2013 whether it's COVID boosters, and making sure we don't leave out the people who are most in need of vaccination \u2013 to making sure we're not abandoning our childhood immunization. Other countries around the world are baffled by our now falling into a civil war over whether the discoveries that have saved the world mattered.\"",
      "Later this month, the CDC's vaccine advisory board \u2014\u00a0now featuring Kennedy appointees\u00a0\u2014 will meet to decide future guidelines.",
      "At the end of the day, Gawande says, \"Trust helps assuage doubt.\"",
      "But, I asked, \"Is trust still possible in this environment?\"",
      "\"Trust is still possible,\" said Gawande, \"but it is not possible while we have leaders who actively drive chaos, who actively are trying to create uncertainty and break down trust. But ultimately, people have to choose the leaders who have the track record of demonstrating better outcomes. And those leaders are scientists, health professionals, and others who have demonstrated over years that they actually get you better results.\"",

    "story": [
      "More than 300 South Korean nationals detained by federal agents in a massive immigration raid last week on a Hyundai plant in Georgia for alleged visa violations were waiting Wednesday for a charter flight due to carry them back to their country.",
      "The South Korean workers were among some 475 people detained on Sept. 4 by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents at a still-under construction joint Hyundai-LG electric vehicle battery facility near Savannah. ICE said they were suspected of living and working in the U.S. illegally.",
      "South Korea's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the departure of the Air Korea charter flight, which had been expected on Wednesday, was delayed due to unspecified circumstances in the U.S., but it would not provide any further information.",
      "A spokesperson for Hartsfield-Jackson airport in Atlanta told CBS News that the charter operation to transport the detainees had been canceled for Wednesday, subject to change. The spokesperson did not provide any information on the reason for the change in plans.",
      "The raid and the detention of hundreds of South Koreans in an ICE facility has tested U.S.-South Korea ties that are important politically, militarily and economically. South Korea is the biggest foreign direct investor in the U.S. and the sixth biggest trading partner overall.",
      "President Lee Jae Myung, visiting the White House in July, pledged $350 billion in new U.S. investment to sweeten a trade-and-tariff deal with President Trump.",
      "\"The sentiment is obviously very, very negative,\" James Kim, Chairman and CEO of the American Chamber of Commerce in Seoul, told CBS News. \"In my office, I usually have my TV turned on to the news - and this is obviously covered from morning to evening constantly. But everyone who I speak to, they view America as its number-one partner here from South Korea. Yes, we're going to have some challenging times.\"",
      "South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Hyun, was peppered with demands from angry lawmakers during a parliamentary session in Seoul on Sept. 8, before he departed for meetings with Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other U.S. officials.",
      "Lawmaker Kim Joon-hyun demanded that Cho respond to the ICE raid by launching investigations into every U.S. national teaching English in South Korea who could be working illegally on a tourist visa.",
      "\"Are we giving our money, technology, and investment to the United States only to be treated like this?,\" Kim asked.",
      "Cho replied by saying he would try to negotiate with Rubio to increase the number of visas issued to highly skilled Korean nationals to work in specialty occupations in the U.S.",
      "The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said the ICE raid was the biggest single-site enforcement action in the agency's history. ICE alleges that the South Korean workers either overstayed their visa waiver permits, known as ESTAs, which allow business visits of up to 90 days, or were holding visas that did not permit them to perform manual labor, called B-1 business visas.",
      "Kim, at the American Chamber in Seoul, called it a \"blip\" in U.S.-Korea ties and said he was \"very, very optimistic about a much brighter future between the two\" countries.",
      "South Korea's president, however, took a more critical tone.",
      "\"As the president who is in charge of national safety, I feel a great responsibility,\" Lee said Tuesday. \"I hope that the unfair infringement of our people and corporate activities for the joint development of both Korea and the United States will not happen again.\"",
      "A poll conducted in South Korea found that almost 60% of respondents said they were disappointed by the U.S. crackdown and called the measures \"excessive,\" while about 31% said the ICE action was \"inevitable\" and that they could understand the reasoning.",
      "President Trump, in a Sunday post on his Truth Social platform, addressed all foreign companies operating in the U.S., saying \"your investments are welcome, and we encourage you to LEGALLY bring your very smart people.\"",
      "Kim at the chamber of commerce urged companies to heed the advice.",
      "\"My key message is listen to what President Trump said today. He wants to encourage more foreign companies to invest in America. Bring your people, bring your resources into America, but do it legally,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Industry experts caution, however, that it may be difficult to maintain investment levels under those guidelines, as securing visas can take years, while many projects face strict deadlines and delays can drive up costs. There is a shortage of highly skilled workers in the U.S., meanwhile, for battery manufacturing, semiconductor and modern shipbuilding industries \u2014 all arenas in which South Korea has been investing heavily for years.",
      "Such jobs can require years of experience, not just a few months of on-the-job training.",
      "A spokesperson for South Korea's Foreign Ministry told CBS News that since Mr. Trump's second term began, it had already reached out 52 times on the matter of securing more visas for highly-skilled workers.",
      "Kim, the U.S. chamber of commerce leader, said the current upset in relations represented \"an opportunity to really fix some things that could be in the grey area, make it a lot more clear, so that they can have an even better relationship.\"",
      "He said that, given Seoul's importance as an investor in the U.S., it may be a good time for Washington to consider adopting a new policy that allows South Koreans to more easily come and work in the U.S.",
      "\"I think that in the past, Korea may not have been a significant investor in the United States, but now they are,\" he said. \"So I think it's worthy and deserving of that kind of a new status.\"",
      "Mr. Trump gave a nod in his Truth Social post to the notion that the U.S. does need foreign expertise, saying foreign companies should bring people over to help train American workers \u2014 and then hire them to do the work themselves.",
      "Rubio, during his meeting Wednesday in Washington with South Korean Foreign Minister Cho, \"said the United States welcomes ROK (South Korea) investment into the United States and stated his interest in deepening cooperation on this front,\" according to a readout shared by the State Department, which did not mention the ICE raid in Georgia.",
      "Rubio and Cho discussed advancing U.S.-South Korean ties \"through a forward-looking agenda\" that \"revitalizes American manufacturing through ROK investment in shipbuilding and other strategic sectors, and promotes a fair and reciprocal trade partnership,\" the State Department said.",

      "The Department of Labor's internal watchdog is launching a review of the Bureau of Labor Statistics' (BLS) approach to collecting and reporting economic data.",
      "Laura Nicolosi, assistant inspector general for audit in the Labor's Department's Office of Inspector General, said in a September 10 letter to acting BLS commissioner William Wiatrowski that the watchdog will examine how the statistics bureau compiles and reports monthly inflation and jobs data.",
      "In the letter, Nicolosi pointed to the Labor Department recently announcing large downward revisions to its earlier estimates of payroll gains. BLS released figures on Tuesday showing that the U.S. labor market added more than 900,000 fewer jobs in the 12-month period ending March 2025 than had earlier been reported.",
      "The BLS produces its monthly employment report by conducting separate surveys of households and businesses. The Labor Department also taps other measures of how the job market is faring, including state unemployment claims. The Labor Department frequently issues revisions to figures from prior months as more complete or accurate data is collected over time.",
      "The internal review of BLS' methods also will examine how it collects, reports and revises data used in two closely watched gauges of inflation \u2014 the Producer Price Index and the Consumer Price Index \u2014 Nicolosi said. Recent data show that inflation around the U.S. has risen this year.",
      "President Trump last month fired then BLS commissioner Erika McEntarfer and accused her of political bias after the Labor Department's July employment report showed unexpectedly weak job growth and revised down payroll gains for the previous two months.",
      "\"I have directed my Team to fire this Biden Political Appointee, IMMEDIATELY. She will be replaced with someone much more competent and qualified. Important numbers like this must be fair and accurate, they can't be manipulated for political purposes,\" the president\u00a0wrote\u00a0in an August 1 post on social media.",

      "For Kasey McBlais, a 42-year-old single mom who lives in Maine with her two elementary school-aged children, the cost of running a household is only getting more expensive, from buying groceries to paying for her home's upkeep.",
      "\"It's really challenging,\" McBlais, who works at a nonprofit, says of managing her expenses. \"It's paycheck to paycheck.\"",
      "Cleaning her chimney cost $500 this year, up from about $200 when she bought her house in 2019. And grocery money isn't going as far either, prompting McBlais to stretch meals to make sure the family has leftovers. \"I honestly don't expect anything to go back to the way they were \u2014 it's a matter of things leveling off where they are at,\" she said.",
      "McBlais' concerns and struggles come as the pace of inflation continues to creep higher, remaining well above the Federal Reserve's goal of driving it down to an annual 2% rate. The situation is leaving some consumers feeling frustrated by stubbornly high prices on everything from groceries to housing,\u00a0souring their views\u00a0about the health of the U.S. economy.",
      "In a recent\u00a0CBS News poll, two-thirds of Americans said that prices in the past few weeks have continued to rise, with nearly all saying they expect the rise in costs to continue.",
      "On Thursday, the Consumer Price Index is expected to show that prices rose at an annualized rate of 2.9% in August, up from 2.7% in July. Some economists point to the Trump administration's tariffs as a contributing factor.",
      "\"Tariffs will raise prices, and that does of course lead to inflation \u2014 there's no way around that,\" said Erasmus Kersting, an economics professor at the Villanova School of Business.",
      "To be sure, inflation is well below its pandemic peak. But the Federal Reserve's progress has been slipping, with recent CPI data showing price growth picking up again after reaching a low point this spring.",
      "At the same time, President Trump is pushing the Federal Reserve to cut its benchmark rate, posting on social media on Wednesday that there is \"no inflation!!!\" He also urged the Fed to \"lower the RATE, BIG, right now.\"",
      "In July 2024, when Mr. Trump pledged to end the \"inflation nightmare,\" the CPI rate stood at 2.9%, or the same pace that economists forecast for tomorrow's report.",
      "\"The president would like people to stop paying attention to inflation now because it's not helping it,\" Kersting noted. \"In the past he wanted people to pay attention to it, because back then it did help him win the election.\"",
      "Asked for comment on forecasts the CPI will show an uptick in inflation, the White House said the president is delivering on his promises.",
      "\"Joe Biden unleashed the worst inflation crisis in nearly four years \u2014 President Trump ended it. Despite the media's false narrative, core inflation has run at a 2.4% average pace since President Trump took office which is the lowest 6-month pace since March 2021. The so-called 'experts' have been wrong month after month: tariffs have not hiked prices and President Trump is delivering on his promise to make America affordable again,\" White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The Federal Reserve's complicated decision",
      "A hotter CPI report would complicate the Federal Reserve's task of deciding its next interest rate move on Sept. 17, given that the labor market has stalled out this summer. The Fed's so-called \"dual mandate\" requires it to promote full employment while keeping inflation in check.",
      "So far in 2025, the Fed has held its benchmark rate steady, with Chair Jerome Powell saying he wanted to keep the central bank's powder dry in case tariffs caused inflation to reignite. Because rate reductions make it cheaper to borrow, they can spur businesses and consumers to open their wallets, adding to inflationary pressures.",
      "But two consecutive disappointing jobs reports signal that the labor market is stalling out, putting pressure on the Fed to cut rates, which can help bolster hiring by making it cheaper for businesses to borrow and add more workers.

    "published": "Wed, 10 Sep 2025 12:33:59 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump has said he is firing Cook from her role over allegations she made false representations on mortgage agreements several years ago.",
    "story": [
      "A federal Judge on Tuesday ruled that\u00a0Lisa Cook can remain in her role on the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors while her lawsuit challenging President Trump's attempt to fire her from her post plays out.",
      "\"President Trump has not stated a legally permissible cause for Cook's removal,\" U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb, who was appointed by former President Joe Biden, wrote in her ruling, which is likely to be appealed.",
      "Mr. Trump said he is firing Cook over allegations she made false representations on mortgage agreements several years ago, resulting in more favorable loan terms.",
      "\"President Trump's stated cause refers only to allegations regarding Cook's conduct before she began serving on the Federal Reserve Board,\" Cobb wrote. \"As discussed above, such allegations are not a legally permissible cause.\"",
      "In addition to casting doubt on whether Mr. Trump established cause for Cook's firing, in issuing the stay, Cobb also ruled that Cook's right to due process was violated and that she would suffer irreparable harm if the injunction was not granted.",
      "Abbe David Lowell, an attorney representing Cook in her lawsuit, said in a statement to CBS News on Tuesday night, \"This ruling recognizes and reaffirms the importance of safeguarding the independence of the Federal Reserve from illegal political interference. Allowing the President to unlawfully remove Governor Cook on unsubstantiated and vague allegations would endanger the stability of our financial system and undermine the rule of law. Governor Cook will continue to carry out her sworn duties as a Senate-confirmed Board Governor.\"",
      "White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement that Tuesday's ruling \"will not be the last say on the matter.\"",
      "\"President Trump lawfully removed Lisa Cook for cause due to credible allegations of mortgage fraud from her highly sensitive position overseeing financial institutions on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors,\" Desai said.",
      "Under federal law, Fed board members\u00a0serve for 14-year terms\u00a0and can only be fired by the president \"for cause.\" Cook has served on the Fed since being appointed to complete another member's unexpired term in 2022, and her current term would run until 2038.",
      "Mr. Trump moved to fire Cook on Aug. 26, writing in a letter\u00a0terminating her\u00a0from the Fed Board of Governors that he had \"sufficient cause\" to remove her from the position. The president cited a previous letter from Bill Pulte, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, that was sent to Attorney General Pam Bondi alleging Cook made false statements on mortgage agreements.",
      "Pulte, an appointee of Mr. Trump's, alleged that Cook in 2021 claimed two different properties in Michigan and Georgia as her primary residence on mortgage documents to get better lending terms. Cook has not been charged with any civil or criminal offense.",
      "Cook's lawyers have previously said in court filings that Mr. Trump's \"unsubstantiated allegation that Governor Cook 'may have' or 'seems' to have erred in filling out a mortgage form in her capacity as a private citizen-does not amount to 'cause' for removal within the meaning of the FRA [Federal Reserve Act].\"",
      "\"None of the alleged misconduct occurred during the performance of Governor Cook's duties as a Federal Board member,\" they wrote. \"And the President and Director Pulte have not even alleged explicitly that Ms. Cook benefited from any clerical error, or that such an error was intentional.\"",
      "In court arguments Friday, Lowell said Cook was not given notice of the allegations or a chance to respond to them, violating, he argued, her due process rights.",
      "Cook's lawsuit argues that Mr. Trump's attempt to oust her is \"unprecedented and illegal,\" noting it would be the first removal of a governor by the president in the Fed's 112-year history.",
      "\"The President's effort to terminate a Senate-confirmed Federal Reserve Board member is a broadside attack on the century-old independence of the Federal Reserve System,\" Cook's lawyers wrote in a filing.",
      "They warned that Mr. Trump's theory of \"cause\" would allow him to remove any Fed Board member with whom he disagrees on policy, eroding the central bank's independence and threatening its mission of providing economic stability.",
      "Cobb appeared to agree with their argument, writing in her ruling on Tuesday, \"Taken to its logical conclusion, the Government's argument leads to an absurd result: While admitting that the President cannot remove an official for policy disagreements, the Government claims that under Reagan, a removal on the grounds of a policy disagreement would nevertheless be unreviewable. ... This cannot be the case. Such a rule would provide no practical insulation for the members of the Board of Governors. It would mean that the President could, in practice, 'remove a member ... merely because he wanted his own appointees.'\"",
      "Cobb also wrote that Mr. Trump \"does not address her [Cook's] in-office conduct at all, let alone provide any examples of how Cook's performance or personal conduct since assuming the role has been in any way deficient in carrying out her statutory duties,\" adding that Mr. Trump's termination letter \"does not identify any conduct that Cook has engaged in while serving as a member of the Board that indicates that Cook lacks the competence or trustworthiness for the role.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's move to fire Cook came amid his repeated\u00a0attacks on the Federal Reserve and its chair, Jerome Powell, over the central bank's handling of interest rates.",
      "Cook, Powell and 10 other Fed officials sit on a committee that controls the nation's monetary policy and sets target interest rates, with a dual mandate of keeping inflation low and employment levels high. This work is typically done independently, with little to no input from political leaders.",
      "While the Fed did cut interest rates last year, after they had reached their highest point in decades in 2022 and 2023 in a bid to fight off inflation, the central bank has recently kept rates at relatively high levels. Powell has cited concerns that lowering rates could again lead to a swift rise in inflation and that Mr. Trump's tariffs could also lead to an increase in consumer prices.",

      "Getting cash from an ATM is growing increasingly expensive as fees reach record highs.",
      "Americans are now paying an average of $4.86 for out-of-network ATM withdrawals, up 1.9% from $4.77 last year, according to a new\u00a0survey\u00a0from Bankrate.com. That's the highest on record, according to the personal finance website, which starting tracking ATM fees 27 years ago.",
      "\"ATM fees are just one of those avenues that the bank can very freely continue to charge fees,\" Bankrate financial analyst Stephen Kates told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Those costs include charges from both ATM owners and banks. According to the survey, the average fee from cash machine providers is $3.22. Banks charge $1.64 on average, up 3.8% from 2024 \u2014 the highest since 2018. As a result, Americans in certain metro areas could see average combined fees of more than $5.",
      "For its survey, Bankrate polled a total of 10 banks and financial institutions in 25 of the nation's largest metro areas. Atlanta topped the list for highest ATM costs, with an average out-of-network fee of $5.37. Behind Atlanta are Phoenix and San Diego, where ATM charges average $5.35 and $5.31, respectively.",
      "Boston and Seattle had the lowest average rates among the metro areas surveyed \u2014 $4.37 and $4.42, respectively.",
      "What's behind the rising charges?",
      "The problem, said Kates, is that while there have been regulatory rumblings around curbing overdraft fees, resulting in voluntary caps by financial institutions, there are no limits on how much banks can charge for ATM withdrawals, giving them free rein to hike fees as much as they want. And since the charges apply to people outside the bank's network, there's no risk of it losing customers.",
      "\"It's one of the ways for the bank to certainly make money, and it's one of the ways to do so that doesn't really hurt their own customers,\" Kates said.",
      "Higher fees also help ATM owners and banks make up for lost revenue as consumers gravitate away from using cash and toward digital payments, said Kates. Also, online banking has nearly eliminated the need for automated bank tellers. According to a\u00a0survey\u00a0conducted by Morning Consult on behalf of the American Bankers Association last year, only 5% of customers relied on ATMs to manage their bank accounts.",
      "To be sure, reliance on cash hasn't disappeared altogether. The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta found that cash was still Americans' primary form of payment as of October 2024 \u2014 whether for a trip to an old-school laundromat or a vexingly cash-only restaurant.",
      "\"Fewer and fewer people need to use cash for certain things, but there are some times when you have to have it,\" said Kates.",
      "How to avoid high ATM fees",
      "Avoiding high ATM fees requires a bit of strategy and forethought, as you may not always be near a bank-affiliated ATM when you need to withdraw cash.",
      "In such a situation, one option is to get cash back at a local store. Kates also encourages people to look at their banking app to see which ATMs are close to them.",
      "If you need to withdraw cash on a regular basis, but live in an area where there aren't any ATMs in-network, you may want to consider changing where you bank to accommodate your needs. Certain online financial services like Fidelity, for instance, reimburse customers for ATM fees \u2014 making them a more attractive option.",

      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Tuesday said it will decide whether President Trump can impose his most sweeping tariffs, setting up a major test of one of the pillars of the president's economic agenda.",
      "The high court agreed to review lower court decisions\u00a0that found Mr. Trump did not have the authority to issue many of his global tariffs under an emergency powers law. The Justice Department appealed one of those rulings, from a federal appeals court, to the Supreme Court last week and asked it to move swiftly.",
      "The Trump administration has argued that upholding the ruling from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit would put the United States at a disadvantage and expose the nation to retaliatory trade policies.",
      "The case is the first in which the Supreme Court will directly decide the legality of one of Mr. Trump's second-term policies. The high court has been asked roughly two dozen times to intervene in challenges to many of the president's initiatives, but on an interim emergency basis.",
      "The justices said arguments in the tariffs case would take place in the first week of November.",
      "The tariffs case",
      "One of the disputes before the Supreme Court was brought by a group of small businesses and 12 states. They argued that he did not have the authority to impose many of the global tariffs under the emergency powers law that he invoked, called the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.",
      "A federal trade court ruled in May that Mr. Trump exceeded his authority when he issued the tariffs under IEEPA, and the Federal Circuit upheld that decision late last month. In its 7-4 decision, the appeals court agreed that the tariffs are illegal.",
      "\"It seems unlikely that Congress intended, in enacting IEEPA, to depart from its past practice and grant the President unlimited authority to impose tariffs,\" the appeals court wrote. \"The statute neither mentions tariffs (or any of its synonyms) nor has procedural safeguards that contain clear limits on the President's power to impose tariffs.\"",
      "The appeals court did not decide whether IEEPA authorizes any tariffs at all. Instead, it only resolved whether sweeping duties that Mr. Trump imposed through a series of executive orders earlier this year are allowed under the law.",
      "The second case involves a pair of Illinois-based companies that sell educational toys and products. A federal district judge in Washington, D.C., ruled in May that IEEPA \"does not authorize the president to impose the tariffs set forth\" in his executive orders. The decision from U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras was more narrow, barring the Trump administration only from collecting any tariff from the two companies. Contreras paused his decision while the Justice Department appealed to the D.C. Circuit.",
      "The two companies asked the Supreme Court in June to fast track the case and leap frog the appeals court in Washington, D.C.",
      "A spokesperson for one of the companies, Learning Resources, said in a statement it was \"gratified\" that the Supreme Court would hear the case.",
      "\"There is a lot riding on this historic case,\" the spokesperson said. \"The unlawful IEEPA tariffs have wreaked havoc in our economy for too long now.\"",
      "The duties at issue include those announced by Mr. Trump in early April \u2014 which he refers to as \"Liberation Day\" \u2014 that set a 10% baseline rate for nearly every country, and higher \"reciprocal\" tariffs on dozens of U.S. trading partners. It also involves a set of levies on imports from Canada, Mexico and China in response to what Mr. Trump said is their failure to address the trafficking of fentanyl across U.S. borders.",
      "The president has used the tariffs, and the threat of additional duties, to try to force trading partners to negotiate trade deals with his administration. So far, \u00a0he has announced frameworks of trade agreements with the European Union and six countries: the United Kingdom, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Indonesia and the Philippines.",
      "Mr. Trump is the first president to use IEEPA to impose tariffs, though it has been used by his predecessors to hit foreign nations with economic sanctions. His administration has argued that a denial of tariff authority would put the U.S. on the brink of \"economic catastrophe\" and make the nation poorer.",
      "In urging the Supreme Court to move quickly, Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in a filing that the Federal Circuit's \"erroneous decision has disrupted highly impactful, sensitive, ongoing diplomatic trade negotiations, and cast a pall of legal uncertainty over the President's efforts to protect our country by preventing an unprecedented economic and foreign-policy crisis.\"",
      "The Trump administration has argued that IEEPA gives the president broad powers to regulate trade, including imposing tariffs, \"to deal with any unusual and extraordinary threat\" to U.S. national security, foreign policy or the economy.",
      "Mr. Trump has said that trade deficits and the flow of fentanyl into the U.S. constituted threats to the national security and economy of the U.S., and invoked IEEPA to impose tariffs to address them.",
      "Mr. Trump's tariffs have remained in effect, since the Federal Circuit put its decision on hold until Oct. 14 to give the administration time to appeal to the Supreme Court.",
      "The plaintiffs \u2014 the five small businesses and 12 states \u2014 agreed that the Supreme Court needs to resolve the legality of Mr. Trump's tariffs, calling it an issue of \"great\" and \"undoubted importance.\" They argued that the tariffs are illegal and urged the high court to affirm the Federal Circuit's decision.",
      "\"The government's case rests entirely on the notion that the phrase 'regulate \u2026 importation' in IEEPA constitutes a boundless power to impose tariffs on the American people whenever the President wants, at whatever level he wants, for whatever countries and products he wants, and for as long as he wants, merely by declaring that longstanding U.S. trade deficits are a national 'emergency' and an 'unusual and extraordinary threat' \u2014 assertions the government claims are effectively unreviewable,\" lawyers for the small businesses wrote in a Supreme Court filing. \"There are no limits.\"",
      "The states, meanwhile, said that the Constitution gives Congress the power to collect taxes, and the Trump administration is claiming that the president has sweeping authority to impose tariffs \"on any country, at any rate, and for however long he likes.\"",
      "\"The President's chaotic implementation of that purported authority, which changed by the day and wreaked havoc on capital markets and the economy, illustrates both the breadth of powers that the President claims and the danger of unlimited authority in this domain,\" they warned in court papers.",
      "The legal challenge to Mr. Trump's tariffs is likely to be one of several involving the president's second-term policies that the Supreme Court takes up. Other cases involving his immigration policies and efforts to remove members of independent agencies have progressed through the lower courts, and the Trump administration is likely to seek Supreme Court review of decisions against it.",

    "published": "Tue, 09 Sep 2025 19:56:54 -0400",
    "summary": "The downward revision from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows the job market was slowing in 2024 and early 2025.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. labor market added 911,000 fewer jobs in the 12-month period that ended March 2025 than had earlier been reported, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said on Tuesday. The major downward revision signals that the labor market was slowing more last year than had earlier been reported.",
      "The so-called preliminary benchmark revision, produced annually by the BLS, was bigger than a decline of roughly 800,000 that economists had forecast prior to the release. The revision aims to better account for businesses that have opened or closed in the 12-month period it covers, as these changes are sometimes missed by the BLS' monthly jobs report.",
      "The downward revision comes as the labor market appears to be ailing, with Friday's\u00a0disappointing August jobs report\u00a0sending warning signals about the pace of hiring across the U.S. At the same time, the BLS is in the crosshairs of the Trump administration, with the president last month\u00a0questioning the validity\u00a0of the monthly jobs report after the data included a significant downward revision, prompting him to\u00a0fire the commissioner\u00a0of the BLS.",
      "Revisions are a normal part of the statistical process at the BLS, economists note. That's because the monthly jobs data is based on a survey of businesses, and some companies respond after the agency's initial jobs report has been issued. Because of that, the BLS updates its data to reflect the new information.",
      "The sharp downward annual revision signals that the job market was facing bigger headwinds in 2024 and early 2025 than earlier reported, and could add to the Federal Reserve's case for cutting its benchmark rate at its Sept. 17 meeting, economists said.",
      "\"Today's data suggests cooling in the labor market is more dramatic than previously thought,\" said Elizabeth Renter, senior economist at NerdWallet, in an email.",
      "She added, \"This strengthens the likelihood that the Fed will cut rates next week, as it's additional evidence that the labor market side of the dual mandate needs some attention.\"",
      "Less momentum in job gains",
      "With the new revisions, job growth in 2025 has averaged 44,000 per month, down from 75,000 prior to the revamped numbers, Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank, said in an email. In 2024, payroll gains factoring in the revisions averaged 106,000, down from 168,000 previously.",
      "\"The revision shows the economy entered 2025 with less momentum than previously understood,\" he said. \"It's now a lock that the Fed will cut interest rates at their meeting next week and that further rate cuts will follow in the months ahead. The question is by how much.\"",
      "The probability of a 0.25 percentage point rate cut at the Fed's Sept. 17 meeting is now projected at 94%, according to economists polled by financial data firm FactSet.",
      "The annual revisions are based on fresh data from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW), which tracks employment and wages reported by employers that cover more than 95% of U.S. jobs, or about 11 million workplaces.",
      "The QCEW tracks when businesses open or close, something that is difficult for the monthly jobs report to track. For instance, if a business doesn't respond to the monthly survey, the BLS doesn't immediately know if the company simply isn't responding or if it has shut down.",
      "The large revision is likely due to the QCEW's tracking of businesses that have either been newly created or recently closed, with some of those new companies likely having slower hiring than the BLS had earlier estimated, Pantheon Macroeconomics chief U.S. economist Samuel Tombs said in a research note.",
      "\"Probably about two-thirds of the downward benchmark revision looks set to be due to weaker job creation at new firms than the BLS initially inferred from its model,\" he said.",

    "summary": "The typical U.S. taxpayer could see their taxes decrease by more than $3,750 next year thanks to fresh cuts, deductions and other provisions, according to a recent analysis.",
    "story": [
      "The \"big, beautiful bill\" signed into law by President Trump in July provides a bevy of new tax cuts and deductions that could lower taxes for millions of Americans, according to a recent analysis from the Tax Foundation.",
      "The typical filer could see a tax cut of $3,752 in 2026, the nonpartisan think tank found. But the impact will also vary geographically, with some residents in some states likely receiving a bigger tax benefit than others under the new law, Garrett Watson, director of policy analysis, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "For instance, the biggest average cut will go to residents of Wyoming, with a reduction of $5,374, according to his analysis of the law's impact.",
      "The geographic differences are due partly to variations in the average income of each state, given that the law provides bigger tax cuts to high-income Americans\u00a0compared with low-income households, Watson noted. Other provisions also could help some regions more than others. That includes the higher deduction cap for state and local taxes, which will give more of a lift to people in states with high property taxes, such as New Jersey and New York.",
      "\"Places with higher incomes are going to have higher nominal tax cuts,\" Watson said. \"The largest tax benefits are going to the mountain states \u2014 it's due to a subgroup of higher-income business owners.\"",
      "Residents of Mississippi and West Virginia are likely to see the smallest tax cuts next year, the analysis found. Incomes in those states tend to be lower than the national average, with median household income in Mississippi standing at about $55,000 as of 2023 and $60,000 for West Virginians, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The national household median income is about $80,600.",
      "The Tax Foundation analysis projects the average tax cut in tax year 2026, meaning that these numbers reflect the reductions for the next calendar year. Although many of the law's provisions are effective in 2025, the IRS is still working out the details on some of them, which means lower tax withholding for the new provisions won't be fully in place until 2026, Watson said.",
      "Bigger refunds?",
      "Tax refunds are also likely to be larger in early 2026, when people file their taxes for the 2025 calendar year, Watson said, although he hasn't calculated the potential impact.",
      "Seniors who can claim a new $6,000 deduction for people over 65 under the law may get a bigger refund, as well as taxpayers across the board due to the higher standard deduction, said Mark Steber, chief tax officer at Jackson Hewitt.",
      "Because of the tax changes in the new law, Steber recommends that people start preparing now. For example, workers who are newly eligible for tax breaks on tips and on overtime pay should keep track of such income.",
      "\"Having this much time left in the year allows taxpayers to make any necessary adjustments to help increase a refund or lower an amount due, and can be as simple as adjusting the withholding on a W-4,\" Steber told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The top 1% of earners around the U.S. \u2014 those with incomes over $1.1 million \u2014 will receive a $75,410 annual tax break from the new law in 2026, according to a\u00a0separate analysis\u00a0from the Tax Policy Center, nonpartisan think tank. That compares with an average tax break of $150 for households in the bottom 20% of the income distribution, or people earning less than $36,000 a year, and of $1,780 for earning $66,801 to $119,200.",
      "To be sure, many of new law's tax cuts will depend on an individual's financial circumstances. For instance, a low-income worker who earns tips or overtime could see a much bigger tax cut due to the law's \"no tax on tips\" and \"no tax on overtime\" provisions, Watson noted.",

    "story": [
      "Manufacturers in the U.S. are cutting thousands of jobs even as President Trump pushes economic policies that he says will revitalize the industry.",
      "Employers shed 12,000 manufacturing jobs\u00a0in August, while payrolls in the sector have shrunk by 42,000 since April, according to a new\u00a0analysis\u00a0from the Center for American Progress (CAP) that draws on government labor data.",
      "The nonpartisan policy institute attributes that decline to the Trump administration's steep new tariffs; hardline stance on immigration; and the Republican-backed \"big, beautiful bill,\" a tax and spending package enacted by Mr. Trump in July that CAP says hurts renewable energy companies by phasing out certain tax credits.",
      "For all of 2025, manufacturing employment in the U.S. has sunk by a total of 33,000 jobs, according to Labor Department\u00a0figures. Most of those job losses have been among companies that make durable goods, such as cars, household appliances and electronics. The drop comes as hiring overall has slowed sharply in recent months, with employers adding only 22,000 jobs in August, well below forecasts.",
      "The number of manufacturing jobs in the U.S. has declined for the past six decades, according to\u00a0data\u00a0from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. In 1960, manufacturing represented about 34% of total employment, while the number of jobs in the sector peaked in 1970 at 19.5 million. As of August this year, 12.7 million Americans were employed in manufacturing, while the industry lost 87,000 jobs in 2024,\u00a0data shows.",
      "Uncertainty hurting businesses",
      "When Mr. Trump in April announced a range of levies on dozens of other countries, the White House said tariffs would protect American workers by reducing the U.S. trade deficit with its economic partners and spurring employers to move manufacturing jobs to the U.S.",
      "For now, however, confusion over the scale and scope of U.S. tariffs has put manufacturers on the defensive, increasing their costs and discouraging them from hiring, economist Sara Estrep, one of the authors of the CAP report, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Companies are uncertain about what's happening,\" she said. \"Everything has been changing on a day-to-day basis, so it's not clear what production should look like. That's why they aren't hiring.\"",
      "In August, for example, farm equipment giant John Deere cited tariffs in announcing that its sales and operating profits had dipped from a year ago. In an earnings call, an executive with the company noted that it had racked up roughly $300 million in tariff-related costs, including on steel and aluminum imports. John Deere also announced it was laying off more than 200 workers at plants in Illinois and Iowa, according to AgWeb, a trade publication.",
      "Automakers pointed partly to tariffs in announcing nearly 5,000 job cuts in July, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, while it noted that the retail sector has also stepped up layoffs and store closures because of economic uncertainty.",
      "Another factor fueling uncertainty for manufacturers are the ongoing legal challenges to the Trump tariffs, making it hard to plan and invest for the future, according to experts.",
      "A federal appeals court in August ruled that Mr. Trump unlawfully invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, to impose sweeping tariffs on U.S. trade partners. Mr. Trump on September 3\u00a0asked the Supreme Court\u00a0to review the lower court's decision before it takes effect in October.",
      "The outcome of the case leaves many manufacturers in doubt about how to proceed, making them reluctant to expand their workforce as they seek to control costs, Daco told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"The slowdown is symptomatic of an environment where purchasing managers are all under stress, and they are being squeezed by higher costs of goods and reduced demand,\" said EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco. \"And so in that squeeze, they are having to find ways to offset the higher costs, and one of the avenues to do that is to streamline their operations and make sure that they only have the essential talent on hand.\"",
      "The White House did not respond to several requests for comment on CAP's findings. The Office of the United States Trade Representative and National Association of Manufacturers, a trade group, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Immigration effect",
      "The Trump administration's crackdown on U.S. immigrants is also weighing on hiring in manufacturing, said Daniel Altman, an economist and author of the High Yield Economics newsletter.",
      "\"Immigration has been an important source of employment in manufacturing for some industries, and if you take away some of their labor supply, that's just gives them more incentive to pursue automation and other forms of capital intensive manufacturing,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The government stepped up its campaign last week when Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents\u00a0detained 475 immigrants, most of them Korean, at a Hyundai plant in Georgia because they were suspected of living and working in the U.S. illegally.",
      "Border patrol agents have also\u00a0conducted raids targeting immigrants working in retail, according to CBS News. In sectors like farming, food processing and construction, undocumented immigrants make up to 20% of the workforce, according to\u00a0Goldman Sachs.",
      "White House \"border czar\" Tom Homan on Sunday said the White House will expand such efforts.",
      "\"We're going to do more worksite enforcement operations,\" Homan told CNN. \"No one hires an illegal alien out of the goodness of their heart. They hire them because they can work them harder, pay them less, undercut the competition that hires U.S. citizen employees.\"",
      "Other long-term factors that go beyond the Trump administration's policies are also contributing to the ongoing contraction in manufacturing jobs. During the pandemic, manufacturers invested heavily in technologies to automate their operations, Altman noted.",
      "\"We've seen a lot of automation, which means companies do not need as many workers to provide the same output,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Output per worker has been increasing, and when we see that kind of increase in labor productivity, it usually means workers have access to more capital, or better technology or both, and that's what you'd expect with automation.\"",

    "story": [
      "The latest jobs report\u00a0points to a labor market that's faltering, but the slowdown may have begun much earlier. Economists expect the Bureau of Labor Statistics to issue a major downward revision today, showing the nation added hundreds of thousands fewer jobs than first reported.",
      "On Sept. 9, the BLS will release its preliminary benchmark revision to labor market data at 10 a.m. ET, which aims to better account for businesses that have opened or closed. Economists say the revision, covering the 12-month period through March 2025, could show that hiring during that time was about 800,000 jobs lower than previously reported.",
      "The report could draw attention from the Trump administration, as the president last month questioned the validity of the monthly jobs report \u2014 and fired the commissioner\u00a0of the BLS \u2014 after the data included a significant downward revision. Hiring experts and economists point to a job market that's stalling out as some businesses are bearing increased tariff costs while others are tapping artificial intelligence as a way to lower labor costs and\u00a0replace workers.",
      "\"The labor market will likely look even worse after the release of the preliminary benchmark revision to payrolls on Sept. 9,\" Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank, noted in an email.",
      "The revision could show that employment was reduced by about 775,000 for the 12 months through March, Adams estimated. That would indicate that the average monthly job growth in 2024 actually stood at 100,000 per month, down from the 165,000 previously reported, he added.",
      "The revision would cover only the first three months of Mr. Trump's second administration, with the bulk of the timeframe occurring in the last year of former President Biden's administration.",
      "Job growth has slowed dramatically in recent months, with the employers adding an average of 29,000 jobs each month from June through August, the most recent BLS data shows.",
      "Why does the government revise its jobs data?",
      "Jobs revisions occur each month, with the BLS updating its data to reflect more recent information it has received from businesses about the pace of hiring. That's because some companies respond late to the BLS' surveys, which means the agency receives an influx of new information after it has issued its initial monthly jobs report, prompting the fresh numbers.",
      "But once a year, the BLS also issues an annual revision based on fresh data from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW), which tracks employment and wages reported by employers that cover more than 95% of U.S. jobs.",
      "While the monthly jobs report relies on about 50,000 responses for each period, the QCEW covers 11 million workplaces \u2014 but that scope requires more time for collecting the data versus the BLS' monthly report, Adams of Comerica said.",
      "\"The QCEW's detail lets it directly measure jobs added at newly-opened workplaces and lost at closing ones, which account for several millions of employment churn each year,\" he added.",
      "What happened in the last annual revision?",
      "The BLS issued a\u00a0major downward\u00a0revision last year for the same annual data, showing that employers added 818,000 fewer jobs in the 12 months ended March 2024 than previously estimated. That lowered the average monthly job growth for the period to 174,000, down from the initial estimate of 242,000.",
      "At the time, the downward revision was seen as evidence that the labor market was showing cracks, and it was viewed as paving the way for the Federal Reserve to cut rates at its September 2024 meeting.",
      "What does this mean for a Fed rate cut?",
      "The Fed will be focused on analyzing recent economic data, such as the latest jobs report and the next Consumer Price Index, which will be issued on Sept. 11. Economists expect the CPI to show an annualized increase of 2.9% in August, higher than the prior month's 2.7% and well above the Fed's goal of reaching a 2% annual rate.",
      "With the labor market hitting a wall in recent months, economists now expect the Federal Reserve to cut its benchmark rate at its Sept. 17 meeting. The only question is whether the Fed might usher in a jumbo cut of 0.5 percentage points, or opt for the typical cut of 0.25 percentage points.",
      "\"Market odds currently see a 100% chance of a Fed rate cut this month, with a small constituent seeing an outsized 50-basis-point cut on Sept. 17 within the realm of possibility,\" Anthony Saglimbene, Ameriprise chief market strategist, wrote in a Sept. 8 research note.",
      "But, he added, if August's Consumer Price Index comes in hotter than expected on Sept. 11, that \"would likely throw cold water on the idea that the Fed is considering an outsized September rate cut.\"",
      "President Trump has\u00a0repeatedly lashed out at Powell\u00a0this year over the Fed's decision to keep interest rates level. In June, Mr. Trump publicly mused over\u00a0whether to fire him, although many legal experts say it's not clear he has the constitutional authority\u00a0to do so. Powell's term as Fed chair ends on May 15, 2026.",
      "Trump nominates replacement commissioner",
      "President Trump\u00a0in August announced E.J. Antoni as his nominee to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics on Monday. Antoni, a fellow at conservative think tank the Heritage Foundation, has\u00a0criticized the BLS, questioning its methodology.",
      "\"DOGE needs to take a chainsaw to the BLS...,\" he wrote in a November\u00a0post\u00a0on X.",
      "In a statement Monday backing the BLS, the National Association for Business Economics (NABE), a professional association of global economists, applied economists, data scientists and academics, said it \"stands firmly with the dedicated economists and statisticians at BLS and across the federal statistical agencies.\"",
      "The association went on to urge policymakers and others in the business and economics community \"to defend the integrity of the U.S. statistical system and ensure it remains the global gold standard,\" it said.",
      "\"The Bureau of Labor Statistics needs a knowledgeable and qualified commissioner who will uphold the agency's mission and protect its trusted professional staff from political pressure. A commissioner with deep expertise and independence is essential to maintaining public trust, ensuring impartial analysis, and safeguarding the credibility of U.S. statistics,\" NABE added.",

      "Job seekers' confidence in finding new employment has fallen, a new\u00a0survey\u00a0reveals.",
      "According to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's Survey of Consumer Expectations, the average \"perceived probability\" of finding a new job after losing one fell 5.8% points to 44.9% among heads of households surveyed in August, the lowest measure on record since 2013 when the New York Fed began collecting data.",
      "At the same time, Americans are increasingly worried about losing their current job. Expectations that the U.S. unemployment rate will be higher a year from now crept up 1.7 percentage points to 39.1%, the New York Fed found.",
      "The data comes as Americans adopt a dimmer view of the economy. According to a\u00a0recent CBS News poll, a majority of respondents continue to say the economy is getting worse.",
      "The labor market has been under a microscope since July employment data showed weaker-than-expected job growth and sharp downward revisions for the months of June and May. August's data, released Friday, pointed to a slump in U.S. hiring, with employers adding only 22,000 jobs. Unemployment also ticked up to 4.3%, the highest rate since October 2022.",
      "\"Employers may be holding onto their current workers amid uncertainty, but they are not adding new positions,\" Allison Shrivastava, economist at Indeed Hiring Lab, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"In turn, employees have taken the hint, staying in their current jobs rather than seeking new opportunities.\"",
      "According to a recent Bankrate survey, about half of Americans are planning to search for a new job in the next year. At the same time, data shows that the number of people changing jobs has slowed significantly since 2022, when millions of people quit their jobs during the \"Great Resignation.\"",
      "During this period, workers had more negotiating power because labor supply disruptions created heightened demand for workers. That balance, however, has started shifting back in favor of employers in recent years.",
      "A recent analysis from Bank of America shows that the percentage of its customers leaving their jobs has largely trended downward from a more than 26% peak in 2022, and is now just slightly above the job change rate in 2019, at 3.3%. Experts say that's mainly because there are fewer opportunities for people to switch jobs and general unease with the state of the labor market.",
      "\"If this stagnation continues, unemployment \u2014 and layoffs \u2014 will increase, further weakening the labor market,\" said Shrivastava.",
      "The Fed, which is tasked with maintaining a robust job market and low inflation, has acknowledged that the downside risks to employment are rising. This strengthens the likelihood that the central bank will cut rates at its next meeting, which is scheduled for Sept. 16 to 17.",

    "published": "Sat, 06 Sep 2025 09:26:16 -0400",
    "summary": "The operation targeted one of Georgia's largest and most high-profile manufacturing sites, where Hyundai makes electric vehicles and is building an EV battery plant.",
    "story": [
      "In a large-scale immigration enforcement raid at a huge Hyundai facility in Georgia on Thursday, 475 immigrants suspected of living and working in the U.S. illegally were detained, federal authorities announced.",
      "Steven Schrank, the special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations in Georgia and Alabama, told reporters Friday that the majority of those detained were Korean nationals, but he didn't know exactly how many. They worked for a variety of different companies at the site, including subcontractors, he said.",
      "South Korea's Foreign Minister Cho Hyun said Saturday that more than 300 South Koreans were among the 475 people detained.",
      "No criminal charges were announced during Friday's news conference. The sweep was conducted as part of a month-long investigation into allegations of unlawful employment practices and other federal crimes, Schrank said. He described Thursday's raid as the largest enforcement operation at a single site in the history of Homeland Security Investigations, which is a unit of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.",
      "\"This operation underscores our commitment to protecting jobs for Georgians and Americans, ensuring a level playing field for businesses that comply with the law, safeguarding the integrity of our economy and protecting workers from exploitation,\" Schrank said.",
      "Some of those detained Thursday allegedly entered the U.S. illegally, and others were accused of overstaying their visas or violating visa waivers by working, Schrank said. Most of the detainees were taken to an ICE facility in Folkston, Georgia, near the Florida-Georgia state line.",
      "\"They will be moved based on their individual circumstances beyond that,\" Schrank said.",
      "ICE said in a statement Friday night that those arrested during the operation were \"found to be working illegally, in violation of the terms of their visas and/or statuses.\" One green card holder from Mexico was arrested after \"being determined to be removable from the U.S. based on multiple criminal convictions,\" ICE said.",
      "The investigation is ongoing, and additional arrests and charges are possible, ICE said.",
      "In ICE's statement Friday night, Schrank said the operation \"sends a clear message that those who exploit the system and undermine our workforce will be held accountable.\"",
      "\"We welcome all companies who want to invest in the U.S., and if they need to bring workers in for building or other projects, that's fine \u2014 but they need to do it the legal way,\" Schrank said.",
      "The president of Georgia's chapter of the AFL-CIO called the raid politically motivated and said ICE has been escalating its presence at workplaces across the state.",
      "\"This raid is the latest in an ongoing campaign of harassment that has targeted immigrant Georgians as they try to earn an honest living,\" Yvonne Brooks said in a statement. \"Arresting and detaining workers, who are exploited every day and risk their lives every day on the job, creates an atmosphere of fear that terrorizes workers and their families and increases the workload burden on their coworkers.\"",
      "The operation involved law enforcement agents from multiple federal agencies, including ICE, Border Patrol, the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the IRS and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, underscoring the government-wide nature of the Trump administration's crackdown on illegal immigration.",
      "Earlier, the Atlanta office of the ATF had said 450 people were detained in\u00a0a post on social media, which included pictures from the operation.",
      "The sweep targeted one of Georgia's largest and most high-profile manufacturing sites, touted by Gov. Brian Kemp and other officials as the biggest economic development project in the state's history. Hyundai Motor Group, South Korea's biggest automaker, began manufacturing electric vehicles a year ago at the $7.6 billion plant, which employs about 1,200 people, and has partnered with LG Energy Solution to build an adjacent battery plant, slated to open next year. The search shut down construction on the battery plant.",
      "The Hyundai Motor Company said in a statement that it was aware of the operation and was \"closely monitoring the situation while working to understand the specific circumstances.\"",
      "\"Based on our current understanding, none of those detained is directly employed by Hyundai Motor Company,\" it said. \"Hyundai is committed to full compliance with all laws and regulations in every market where we operate. This includes employment verification requirements and immigration laws. We expect the same commitment from all our partners, suppliers, contractors, and subcontractors.\"",
      "\"We are reviewing our processes to ensure that all parties working on our projects maintain the same high standards of legal compliance that we demand of ourselves. This includes thorough vetting of employment practices by contractors and subcontractors,\" the company said, in part, adding that it will \"conduct an investigation to ensure all suppliers and their subcontractors comply with all laws and regulations.\"",
      "In a statement to The Associated Press, LG said it was \"closely monitoring the situation and gathering all relevant details.\" It said it couldn't immediately confirm how many of its employees or Hyundai workers had been detained.",
      "\"Our top priority is always ensuring the safety and well-being of our employees and partners. We will fully cooperate with the relevant authorities,\" the company said.",
      "ICE spokesman Lindsay Williams confirmed that federal authorities conducted an enforcement operation at the 3,000-acre site west of Savannah. He said agents were focused on the construction site for the battery plant.",
      "The South Korean Foreign Ministry said in a statement that it was dispatching officials to the site and urged the U.S. Embassy in Seoul \"to exercise extreme caution to ensure that the legitimate rights and interests of Korean citizens are not infringed upon.\"",
      "\"The economic activities of Korean investment companies and the rights and interests of Korean citizens must not be unfairly infringed upon during U.S. law enforcement operations,\" the Foreign Ministry said.",
      "Georgia State Patrol troopers blocked roads to the Hyundai site. The Georgia Department of Public Safety confirmed it was dispatched to assist federal authorities.",
      "Video posted to social media on Thursday showed workers in yellow safety vests lined up as a man wearing a face mask and a tactical vest with the letters HSI, which stands for Homeland Security Investigations, tells them: \"We're Homeland Security. We have a search warrant for the whole site.\"",
      "\"We need construction to cease immediately,\" the man says in the video. \"We need all work to end on the site right now.\"",
      "The Trump administration has undertaken sweeping ICE operations as part of a mass deportation agenda. Immigration officers have raided farms, construction sites, restaurants and auto repair shops.",
      "The Pew Research Center, citing preliminary Census Bureau data, says the U.S. labor force lost more than 1.2 million immigrants from January through July. That includes people who are in the country illegally as well as legal residents.",
      "Hyundai and LG's battery joint venture, HL-GA Battery Company, said in a statement that it's \"cooperating fully with the appropriate authorities\" and paused construction of the battery site to assist their work.",
      "Operations at Hyundai's EV manufacturing plant weren't interrupted, said plant spokesperson Bianca Johnson.",
      "\"This did not impact people getting to work,\" Johnson said in an email. \"Production and normal office hours had already begun for the day\" when authorities shut down access.",
      "The Hyundai site is in Bryan County, which saw its population increase by more than a quarter in the early 2020s and stood at almost 47,000 residents in 2023, the most recent year data is available. The county's Asian population went from 1.5% in 2018 to 2.2% in 2023, and the growth was primarily among people of Indian descent, according to Census Bureau figures.",

    "published": "Fri, 05 Sep 2025 19:13:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Saturday's Powerball jackpot would be the second-biggest in U.S. lottery history, only trailing the world-record $2.04 billion grand prize won in 2022.",
    "story": [
      "With the Powerball jackpot reaching\u00a0nearly $1.8 billion for Saturday night's drawing, there's been\u00a0lottery fever in the air. If you're one of the lucky ones whose $2 ticket ends\u00a0up worth millions, what do you do with all that money?",
      "Jackpot winners have the option to either take a lump sum payment of the estimated cash value \u2014 in this case, a total of roughly $820 million \u2014 or they can opt to receive their prize as an annuity, paid in 30 graduated payments over 29 years. In either case, those totals are before the Internal Revenue Service takes a cut, as do most states.",
      "Should you take a lump sum payment or annuity option?",
      "Dan Geltrude, a certified public accountant in New Jersey, told CBS News: \"I personally would take the lump sum payment because I feel comfortable in how I can invest my money. However, having that much money for a lot of people is dangerous.\"",
      "Saturday's jackpot is now the second-largest in U.S. lottery history, according to Powerball. The record $2.04 billion grand prize was won on Nov. 7, 2022, in California.",
      "A financial windfall this big has the potential to change your lifestyle in significant ways, especially if you take the lump sum payment \u2014 and Geltrude says people do \"simply overspend, even with that kind of money.\"",
      "He notes many lottery winners over the years have ended up going broke.",
      "If you opt for the annuity payment, \"it will take you a while to lose all that money, so that's the safe bet,\" Geltrude said.",
      "\"But when you factor in the tax man, and the tax man is both federal and state, you only end up netting, if you're in a high-tax state like New York or New Jersey, only about $400 million,\" he said.",
      "What should you do with your Powerball jackpot money?",
      "Money can't buy love, \"but it'll buy you a lot of friends,\" Geltrude said, making you \"a magnet for everybody that's going to be asking you for money.\"",
      "So, what to do if you find yourself millions of dollars richer come Sunday morning?",
      "\"Do not tell a soul that you won. You need to keep this quiet,\" Geltrude said. Sign the ticket, put it in a safe place, and keep it on the down-low. You'll want to seek out an attorney, a certified public accountant and a financial adviser, Geltrude said.",
      "As far as your plan for your money, Geltrude's advice isn't flashy: Start by paying off all your debts.",
      "\"You want to get back to even,\" he said. \"Now you have a bunch of money to figure out what it is that will make you happy.\"",
      "The odds of winning the jackpot are 1 in 292.2 million, according to Powerball. Drawings take place every Monday, Wednesday and Saturday at 11 p.m. ET. Tickets are sold in 45 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.",

      "Anthropic, which operates the Claude artificial intelligence app, has agreed to pay $1.5 billion to settle a class-action lawsuit by book authors who alleged the company took pirated copies of their works to train its chatbot.",
      "The company has agreed to pay authors about $3,000 for each of an estimated 500,000 books covered by the settlement. A trio of authors \u2014 thriller novelist Andrea Bartz and nonfiction writers Charles Graeber and Kirk Wallace Johnson \u2014 sued last year, and now represent a broader group of writers and publishers whose books Anthropic downloaded to train its chatbot Claude.",
      "The landmark settlement could mark a turning point in legal battles between AI companies and the writers, visual artists and other creative professionals who accuse them of copyright infringement. A judge could approve the settlement as soon as Monday.",
      "\"As best as we can tell, it's the largest copyright recovery ever,\" said Justin Nelson, a lawyer for the authors. \"It is the first of its kind in the AI era.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Anthropic Aparna Sridhar deputy general counsel said the settlement \"will resolve the plaintiffs' remaining legacy claims.\"",
      "Sridhar added that the settlement comes after the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California in June ruled\u00a0that Anthropic's use of legally purchased books to train Claude did not violate U.S. copyright law.",
      "\"We remain committed to developing safe AI systems that help people and organizations extend their capabilities, advance scientific discovery and solve complex problems,\" Sridhar said.",
      "Anthropic, which was founded by former executives with ChatGPT developer OpenAI,\u00a0introduced\u00a0Claude in 2023. Like other generative AI bots, the tool lets users ask natural language questions and then provides summarized answers using AI trained on millions of books, articles and other material.",
      "Settlement terms",
      "If Anthropic had not settled, experts say losing the case after a scheduled December trial could have cost the San Francisco-based company even more money.",
      "\"We were looking at a strong possibility of multiple billions of dollars, enough to potentially cripple or even put Anthropic out of business,\" said William Long, a legal analyst for Wolters Kluwer.",
      "U.S. District Judge William Alsup of San Francisco has scheduled a Monday hearing to review the settlement terms.",
      "Books are known to be important sources of data \u2014 in essence, billions of words carefully strung together \u2014 that are needed to build the AI large language models behind chatbots like Anthropic's Claude and its chief rival, OpenAI's ChatGPT.",
      "Alsup's June ruling found that Anthropic had downloaded more than 7 million digitized books that it \"knew had been pirated.\" It started with nearly 200,000 from an online library called Books3, assembled by AI researchers outside of OpenAI to match the vast collections on which ChatGPT was trained.",
      "Debut thriller novel \"The Lost Night\" by Bartz, a lead plaintiff in the case, was among those found in the Books3 dataset.",
      "Anthropic later took at least 5 million copies from the pirate website Library Genesis, or LibGen, and at least 2 million copies from the Pirate Library Mirror, Alsup wrote.",
      "The Authors Guild told its thousands of members last month that it expected \"damages will be minimally $750 per work and could be much higher\" if Anthropic was found at trial to have willfully infringed their copyrights. The settlement's higher award \u2014 approximately $3,000 per work \u2014 likely reflects a smaller pool of affected books, after taking out duplicates and those without copyright.",
      "On Friday, Mary Rasenberger, CEO of the Authors Guild, called the settlement \"an excellent result for authors, publishers, and rightsholders generally, sending a strong message to the AI industry that there are serious consequences when they pirate authors' works to train their AI, robbing those least able to afford it.\"",

      "Kirk, a father of two, was shot as he was speaking to students at an event for Turning Point USA, an organization for young conservatives he co-founded in 2012.",
      "\"The Great, and even Legendary, Charlie Kirk, is dead,\" President Trump wrote. \"No one understood or had the Heart of the Youth in the United States of America better than Charlie. He was loved and admired by ALL, especially me, and now, he is no longer with us.\"",
      "According to video shared on social media, an audience member asked Kirk about mass shootings in the U.S. before Kirk was hit in the neck and slumped in his chair. Two eyewitnesses told CBS News a large volume of blood poured from his neck. He was rushed to a nearby hospital, where he was later pronounced dead.",
      "In a news conference, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox said there is a \"person of interest in custody\" in connection with Kirk's shooting. His comments came shortly after FBI Director Kash Patel\u00a0said\u00a0on social media, \"The subject for the horrific shooting\" is in custody.",

      "Separately, a different person was taken into custody \"shortly after the shooting,\" but he was released \"after we identified that he did not match the shooting suspect and was not an accurate person of interest,\" according to Mason.",
      "However, that person was later booked into county jail for obstruction of justice, Mason said.",
      "Mr. Trump, who survived an assassination attempt at an outdoor political event last year, told the New York Post, \"He was a very, very good friend of mine and he was a tremendous person.\" Democrats and Republicans alike expressed their outrage, prayers and concern on social media upon news of the shooting.",
      "Kirk, a close Trump ally, was the key to energizing and mobilizing the youth vote for the president throughout his campaigns. He was critical to the Trump ground game effort for voter turnout and built out significant parts of the Trump campaign in Arizona, Georgia and Pennsylvania. Kirk stood by the president during what could be described as his political winter, soon after he announced his second presidential campaign, when skeptics doubted he could become president again.",
      "Kirk also made it his mission to engage more young people in politics, and register them to vote. Kirk was also a close friend of the president's son, Donald Trump, Jr.",
      "Kirk spoke at Mr. Trump's inauguration parade in January, and the president appointed him to the Air Force Academy Board of Visitors in March.",
      "\"For those of you that have always had the president's back throughout these last couple of years, when we were at our darkest moment four years ago, this is your victory,\" Kirk said as he opened his speech at Mr. Trump's inaugural parade.",
      "But Kirk's politics weren't without controversy. Kirk pushed false claims about voter fraud after Mr. Trump lost the 2020 presidential election, stoked skepticism about the COVID-19 pandemic and spread anti-trans rhetoric. He also amplified the \"Great Replacement\" conspiracy, which is based on the belief that there's a plot to replace White people with minorities.",
      "After casting doubt early on about mail-in voting, Kirk pushed GOP voters to embrace the methods in 2024.",
      "He pointed to\u00a0Kari Lake's loss\u00a0in the 2022 Arizona gubernatorial race as a moment where he realized that Republicans must embrace \"Election Month,\" as he put it, not just Election Day.",
      "\"It triggered a lot of introspection on our team. And I was like, why are we not embracing, you know, this sort of methodology, we might not love it, but losing feels a lot worse,\" Kirk said. \"I think that the movement is looking at it the same.\"",
      "Born Oct. 14, 1993, Kirk grew up in the Chicago suburbs and briefly attended community college, but dropped out to pursue political activism full time.",

He said he made his way to the end of the line, about 50 to 100 feet to the right of Kirk, because he was \"looking forward to challenging him on a couple of things.\"",
      "\"I really respect him and I wanted to talk to him,\" Last said. \"The first question had just finished ... and they had just gotten into the second question, I believe, and that's when I heard a huge pop.\"",
      "Another witness, Max Stanley, a pitcher for the Utah Valley University baseball team, told KUTV that he and some of his friends were further away from the tent, but they could hear the loud gunshot.",

The state conditions funding on a school's compliance with a rule prohibiting transgender students from using the facilities that align with their gender identity.",
      "In an unsigned order, the court said its denial is \"not a ruling on the merits of the legal issues presented in the litigation. Rather, it is based on the standards applicable for obtaining emergency relief from this Court.\" Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch said they would have granted South Carolina's request.",

      "\"Patel explained that there was nothing [anyone] could do to stop these or any other firings, because 'the FBI tried to put the President in jail and he hasn't forgotten it,'\" the complaint claims. According to the complaint, Driscoll indicated he believed Patel was referring to his superiors at the White House and the Justice Department which \"Patel did not deny.\"",
      "The three fired agents who brought the case were decorated veterans of the agency who had served in senior roles. One of them, Brian Driscoll, had briefly been acting FBI director while Patel was going through the Senate confirmation process. Steven Jensen served as assistant director in charge of the Washington, D.C., field office. Spencer Evans had once led the Las Vegas field office, but by the time he was fired he had been removed from that position and was being relocated to the Huntsville, Alabama, office.",
      "The three agents, as well as two others who are not part of the lawsuit, were abruptly fired in an early August leadership purge without public comment and little explanation. None of them had reached retirement age, depriving them of their full pensions.",
      "The firings were the latest in a broad FBI makeover that began almost immediately after the transition, as the new administration sought to\u00a0 dominate an agency Mr. Trump claimed had been targeted against him.",
      "Patel defended the moves against the senior agents in an interview with Larry Kudlow on the Fox Business Network, saying the firings were aimed at \"ridding this place of its former leadership structure that did that weaponization.\"",
      "The FBI declined to comment.",
      "The Justice Department and White House have not responded to a request for comment.",
      "Driscoll said of the lawsuit in a statement, \"I hope this effort results in protecting others who did no harm and committed no misconduct from wrongful consequences. The American people deserve an FBI made up of professionals who can serve righteously and confidently, with no fear of inappropriately applied pressure or wrongful termination.\"",
      "In his statement, Evans said the public's confidence in the FBI \"hinges on the commitment of every FBI employee, from the newest Special Agent to the Director, to relentlessly adhere to the rule of law without fear or favor.\"",
      "\"Americans should demand FBI leaders who make decisions based solely on the facts of an investigation and never on the desired outcome of one,\" Evans wrote.",
      "Jensen said in his statement that he joined the lawsuit \"to champion the values of truth and justice for those who continue to serve in the FBI.\"",
      "In filing the suit, Jensen said, \"we aim to re-establish the highest standards of justice and ensure that every American, particularly those entrusted with the immense authority of federal law enforcement, respects and obeys the law.\"",
      "Abbe David Lowell, who is representing them, said the Trump administration's termination of them was illegal.",
      "\"As the complaint makes clear, the leadership of the FBI is carrying out political orders to punish law enforcement agents for doing their jobs \u2013 it's illegal and it's putting the national security of our country at risk,\" he said. The three agents filed the case to try to vindicate their constitutional rights.",
      "The lawsuit specifically alleges that the FBI was pressured by White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, who wanted \"to see personnel action, like reassignment, removals and terminations at the FBI, similar to the firings and reassignments of senior attorneys at DOJ that had occurred since January 20, 2025.\"",
      "One focus of the purge involved FBI employees who were part of the Jan. 6 investigations, according to the complaint. The suit alleges that Emil Bove, who at the time was a senior top Justice Department official, told Driscoll about \"pressure he was receiving from (Stephen) Miller to conduct summary firings of agents.\"",
      "Mr. Trump later appointed Bove to the U.S. Court of Appeals. Driscoll said that when he raised concerns these actions would rattle rank-and-file agents, Bove's response took him by surprise.",
      "\"Bove stated that the creation of panic and anxiety in the workforce 'was the intent,'\" the lawsuit alleges.",
      "Driscoll's firing, in particular, surprised many inside the FBI because he appeared to be in good standing with Patel. A highly decorated agent who took part in numerous daring counterterrorism operations, Patel had indicated he admired him as a swashbuckling tactical operator, CBS News previously reported.",
      "During his short stint as acting director, Driscoll resisted calls from a top Trump appointee at the Justice Department to turn over the names of FBI employees who participated in the Jan. 6 investigation, earning him near folk-hero status among line agents.",
      "Patel nevertheless kept him on after he was confirmed as FBI director, putting him in charge of the most important and sensitive positions in the bureau.",
      "But his trajectory at the FBI in the wake of Trump's election reflected the chaos and partisan politics that typified the presidential transition.",
      "According to the lawsuit, Trump transition team members reached out to Driscoll about assuming a senior leadership role in an acting capacity. He soon learned it was to be acting deputy FBI director. After agreeing to be vetted for the position, according to the complaint, Driscoll was questioned by a 29-year-old transition aide who asked him a series of questions that seemed to seek information about his political loyalties.",
      "Among the questions recounted by Driscoll in the lawsuit: \"Who did you vote for?\" \"Do you agree that the FBI agents who stormed Mar-a-Lago, to include the rank-and-file, should be held accountable?\" \"What are your thoughts on DEI?\" And, \"Have you voted for a Democrat in the last five elections?\"",
      "Driscoll defended the actions of the agents in the Mar-a-Lago search \"for doing their job\" and said he \"strongly believes in diversity and a diverse workforce.\" He refused to answer the other questions, according to the lawsuit.",
      "Jensen also appeared to have Patel's backing before he was fired. A veteran agent who helped oversee the January 6 investigation from his position as chief of the FBI's domestic terrorism section, Jensen was given a significant promotion by Patel, who appointed him assistant director in charge of the Washington Field Office, which the complaint identifies as one of the largest field offices in the country.",
      "The promotion had inflamed a noisy portion of Trump's MAGA base because of his supervisory role in the Jan. 6 case. They torched him and the decision on social media, but Patel continued to praise Jensen in meetings and even presented him with a director's \"challenge coin,\" a token of appreciation that leaders in the military and law enforcement often bestow on their subordinates.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Republicans and Democrats in Congress are still far apart on how to avert a government shutdown just three weeks before funding runs out.",
      "The top appropriators in Congress have been meeting this week to discuss a path forward. And Democratic leaders in the House and Senate are expected to meet Wednesday on the issue. But Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, told reporters Wednesday that \"what the Republicans have proposed is not good enough to meet the needs of the American people and not good enough to get our votes.\"",
      "The White House has requested that Congress pass a short-term funding deal to keep the government open through January, while leaders in Congress have generally favored a shorter-term stopgap measure to allow for work to continue on full-year funding bills.",
      "Rep. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, the top Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, said the White House sent a request Tuesday \"to kick the can down the road on government funding until January 31.\" She argued the tactic would allow the Trump administration to hold back funds approved by Congress.",
      "\"Delaying the critical work of funding the government until the end of January is only step one in President Trump and Russ Vought's plan to never fund it at all,\" DeLauro said.",
      "In August, the White House notified Congress that it would attempt to override its funding power by rescinding nearly $5 billion in foreign aid using a rare tactic known as a \"pocket recession.\" Since the request came within 45 days of the end of the fiscal year, the White House argued that it could treat the funding as expired come October.",
      "The move angered Democrats and some Republicans, adding another snag to shutdown negotiations.",
      "House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, a Louisiana Republican, told reporters Tuesday that the date proposed by the White House isn't set in stone.",
      "\"The White House put a marker out there. Nobody's married to a particular date,\" Scalise said, adding that congressional appropriators \"will be a part of that discussion with the White House on the date.\"",
      "Scalise said the House floor's schedule is flexible enough to be able to move on a continuing resolution as soon as an agreement is reached.",
      "\"I hope they get a bipartisan agreement. And that's the goal of [House Appropriations Committee] Chairman Cole and the White House, is to get an agreement with everybody,\" Scalise said. \"That's where the talks are right now.\"",
      "But Scalise said there's no agreement on a health care subsidies extension, which Democrats have been eyeing as a possible requirement for their support.",
      "Tax credits for Americans who purchase health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace are set to lapse at the end of year and could send premiums soaring.",
      "Schumer pointed to the expiration of the tax credits earlier Wednesday, saying \"this would be a nightmare scenario for the American people.\" But he said Senate Majority Leader John Thune has indicated that \"Republicans will walk away from the table and sit on their hands.\"",
      "Thune, a South Dakota Republican, has said that he prefers as \"clean\" a bill as possible to potentially secure bipartisan support and continue work on full-year funding measures. He told reporters earlier this week that it's his expectation that the House, where the bill will likely originate, \"would have it fairly clean,\" minimizing anomalies.",
      "\"If you want to make it about trying to get an extension so we actually have time to try and run a normal appropriations process and get some of the bills passed under regular order, then I think you want to have it as clean as possible,\" Thune said. \"And I think it's in everybody's interest to do that.\"",
      "Still, the White House has pursued anomalies, seeking to fund certain programs at higher levels under a stopgap measure.",
      "Meanwhile, the House is voting Wednesday on whether to go to conference on a Senate-passed package of appropriations bills, which includes the military construction and veterans affairs bill, agriculture bill and legislative branch appropriations bill.",
      "Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, the top Democratic appropriator in the Senate, said Tuesday that she and her fellow appropriators had a \"'very productive conversation\" earlier this week about conferencing the first three bills, along with passing a bipartisan short-term continuing resolution to give them time to continue work on full-year spending bills. But she urged that Democrats need to hear from GOP leaders about their commitment to a bipartisan stopgap measure to \"move this ball forward.\"",
      "\"Let's remember, Republicans control the House, the Senate and the White House. They are quite literally in the driver's seat. And if Republican leadership, for whatever reason, decides to let the car go off the cliff, we know who will be held responsible.\"",
      "But House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, put the onus on Democrats earlier Tuesday, saying \"Democrats may take the path of maximum resistance and shut the government down.\"",
      "\"The ultimate question of whether there's going to be a government shutdown at the end of the month is going to be up to congressional Democrats and that's just the way it is,\" Johnson said.",
      "Asked Wednesday whether House Democrats would support a clean continuing resolution, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries cited the continuing resolution passed in March despite House Democrats' objections, saying \"a continuing resolution that continues the failed policies of the Republican party that we voted against is not the type of policy that actually meets the needs of the American people.\"",
      "\"I believe that all of us are ready to continue the fight,\" Jeffries, a New York Democrat, said of Democrats in Congress.",
      "That fight has taken on particular importance for Senate Democrats, after Schumer came under intense scrutiny from his own party earlier this year. After pledging to fight the GOP funding plan in March, which increased defense spending while decreasing non-defense spending below 2024 levels, Schumer changed course at the eleventh hour, ultimately opting to deliver one of the Democratic votes necessary to propel the partisan measure to passage and prevent a shutdown. Despite intense criticism from some within his own party, Schumer argued at the time that a shutdown risked more damage.",
      "Schumer said Wednesday, with a new funding deadline fast approaching, that if Republicans \"think Democrats are going to show up at the last minute to bail them out with the clock approaching zero, that would be a big mistake on their part.\"",
      "\"Democrats don't want to see a Republican shutdown,\" Schumer added. \"What we want is a bipartisan negotiation, bipartisan bill, where Democrats have input to tangibly under the carnage Donald Trump has done to America.\"",
      "Cristina  Corujo and \n                                                  \n                      Jaala  Brown\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

      "Washington \u2014 Former Vice President Kamala Harris writes that former President Joe Biden's decision to run again was a choice that shouldn't have \"been left to an individuals' ego, an individual's ambition,\" according to excerpts of her upcoming book, \"107 Days,\" published Wednesday in The Atlantic.",
      "Harris, who suddenly became the presumptive Democratic nominee for president in July 2024 when Biden dropped out of the race with 107 days until Election Day, criticized the \"recklessness\" of leaving that decision to the former president and first lady alone.",
      "\"'It's Joe and Jill's decision.' We all said that, like a mantra, as if we'd all been hypnotized,\" Harris writes, according to The Atlantic. \"Was it grace, or was it recklessness? In retrospect, I think it was recklessness. The stakes were simply too high. This wasn't a choice that should have been left to an individual's ego, an individual's ambition. It should have been more than a personal decision.\"",
      "Harris contemplated that \"perhaps\" she should have told the president to consider not running again, but said that of all the people in the White House, I was in the worst position to make the case that he should drop out,\" according to The Atlantic excerpts. Harris wrote she knew it would appear \"incredibly self-serving\" if she advised him not to run.",
      "Harris' book is also deeply critical of the president's team, saying his inner circle often wouldn't defend her against unfair attacks.",
      "\"Indeed, it seemed as if they decided I should be knocked down a little bit more,\" she writes.",
      "Harris claimed the president's staff \"was adding fuel to negative narratives that sprang up around me,\" including the narrative that she ran a \"chaotic\" office.",
      "The former vice president also offers some defense of Biden's capacity as president, while acknowledging he \"got tired.\"",
      "\"On his worst day, he was more deeply knowledgeable, more capable of exercising judgment, and far more compassionate than Donald Trump on his best,\" she writes. \"But at 81, Joe got tired. \u2026 I don't believe it was incapacity. If I believed that, I would have said so. As loyal as I am to President Biden, I am more loyal to my country.\"",
      "Harris, 60, announced this summer that she won't run for governor of California next year, fueling speculation that she may make another bid for president in 2028. Her book is scheduled to be released Sept. 23.",

      "Congress has not moved to renew the Trump administration's 30-day takeover of the district's police force, something that would be necessary for an extension beyond the original public safety emergency Mr. Trump signed, and the president hasn't been publicly pushing for it. The D.C. National Guard, which is ultimately under Mr. Trump's control, will remain in the city until Nov. 30.",
      "Senate Democrats had vowed to block any extension of the public safety emergency order, but Politico reported House Speaker Mike Johnson said D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser's statement that she will coordinate with federal law enforcement indefinitely \"resolved some\" of the issues with policing the city.",
      "D.C. residents and tourists are likely to see little difference on the streets of the city, with D.C. police, the National Guard and federal law enforcement officers continuing to patrol the streets.",

D.C. has more than 3,000 sworn officers, fewer than what Bowser and the police union say it needs.",

      "A federal Judge on Tuesday ruled that\u00a0Lisa Cook can remain in her role on the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors while her lawsuit challenging President Trump's attempt to fire her from her post plays out.",
      "\"President Trump has not stated a legally permissible cause for Cook's removal,\" U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb, who was appointed by former President Joe Biden, wrote in her ruling, which is likely to be appealed.",
      "Mr. Trump said he is firing Cook over allegations she made false representations on mortgage agreements several years ago, resulting in more favorable loan terms.",
      "\"President Trump's stated cause refers only to allegations regarding Cook's conduct before she began serving on the Federal Reserve Board,\" Cobb wrote. \"As discussed above, such allegations are not a legally permissible cause.\"",
      "In addition to casting doubt on whether Mr. Trump established cause for Cook's firing, in issuing the stay, Cobb also ruled that Cook's right to due process was violated and that she would suffer irreparable harm if the injunction was not granted.",
      "Abbe David Lowell, an attorney representing Cook in her lawsuit, said in a statement to CBS News on Tuesday night, \"This ruling recognizes and reaffirms the importance of safeguarding the independence of the Federal Reserve from illegal political interference. Allowing the President to unlawfully remove Governor Cook on unsubstantiated and vague allegations would endanger the stability of our financial system and undermine the rule of law. Governor Cook will continue to carry out her sworn duties as a Senate-confirmed Board Governor.\"",
      "White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement that Tuesday's ruling \"will not be the last say on the matter.\"",
      "\"President Trump lawfully removed Lisa Cook for cause due to credible allegations of mortgage fraud from her highly sensitive position overseeing financial institutions on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors,\" Desai said.",
      "Under federal law, Fed board members\u00a0serve for 14-year terms\u00a0and can only be fired by the president \"for cause.\" Cook has served on the Fed since being appointed to complete another member's unexpired term in 2022, and her current term would run until 2038.",
      "Mr. Trump moved to fire Cook on Aug. 26, writing in a letter\u00a0terminating her\u00a0from the Fed Board of Governors that he had \"sufficient cause\" to remove her from the position. The president cited a previous letter from Bill Pulte, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, that was sent to Attorney General Pam Bondi alleging Cook made false statements on mortgage agreements.",
      "Pulte, an appointee of Mr. Trump's, alleged that Cook in 2021 claimed two different properties in Michigan and Georgia as her primary residence on mortgage documents to get better lending terms. Cook has not been charged with any civil or criminal offense.",
      "Cook's lawyers have previously said in court filings that Mr. Trump's \"unsubstantiated allegation that Governor Cook 'may have' or 'seems' to have erred in filling out a mortgage form in her capacity as a private citizen-does not amount to 'cause' for removal within the meaning of the FRA [Federal Reserve Act].\"",
      "\"None of the alleged misconduct occurred during the performance of Governor Cook's duties as a Federal Board member,\" they wrote. \"And the President and Director Pulte have not even alleged explicitly that Ms. Cook benefited from any clerical error, or that such an error was intentional.\"",
      "In court arguments Friday, Lowell said Cook was not given notice of the allegations or a chance to respond to them, violating, he argued, her due process rights.",
      "Cook's lawsuit argues that Mr. Trump's attempt to oust her is \"unprecedented and illegal,\" noting it would be the first removal of a governor by the president in the Fed's 112-year history.",
      "\"The President's effort to terminate a Senate-confirmed Federal Reserve Board member is a broadside attack on the century-old independence of the Federal Reserve System,\" Cook's lawyers wrote in a filing.",
      "They warned that Mr. Trump's theory of \"cause\" would allow him to remove any Fed Board member with whom he disagrees on policy, eroding the central bank's independence and threatening its mission of providing economic stability.",
      "Cobb appeared to agree with their argument, writing in her ruling on Tuesday, \"Taken to its logical conclusion, the Government's argument leads to an absurd result: While admitting that the President cannot remove an official for policy disagreements, the Government claims that under Reagan, a removal on the grounds of a policy disagreement would nevertheless be unreviewable. ... This cannot be the case. Such a rule would provide no practical insulation for the members of the Board of Governors. It would mean that the President could, in practice, 'remove a member ... merely because he wanted his own appointees.'\"",
      "Cobb also wrote that Mr. Trump \"does not address her [Cook's] in-office conduct at all, let alone provide any examples of how Cook's performance or personal conduct since assuming the role has been in any way deficient in carrying out her statutory duties,\" adding that Mr. Trump's termination letter \"does not identify any conduct that Cook has engaged in while serving as a member of the Board that indicates that Cook lacks the competence or trustworthiness for the role.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's move to fire Cook came amid his repeated\u00a0attacks on the Federal Reserve and its chair, Jerome Powell, over the central bank's handling of interest rates.",
      "Cook, Powell and 10 other Fed officials sit on a committee that controls the nation's monetary policy and sets target interest rates, with a dual mandate of keeping inflation low and employment levels high. This work is typically done independently, with little to no input from political leaders.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. Border Patrol official who led controversial immigration enforcement raids in southern California this summer has arrived in Chicago, a new target of the Trump administration's escalating crackdown on illegal immigration, two people familiar with the matter told CBS News.",
      "The official, Gregory Bovino, is in the Chicago area as federal officials vow to initiate a blitz of arrests in the region targeting immigrants suspected of being in the U.S. illegally, according to the sources, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press. Bovino was the top Border Patrol agent in California's El Centro sector until he was given command of a broader immigration enforcement campaign across the state in June.",
      "Over the past several months, Bovino has become one of the most visible public faces of the Trump administration's aggressive effort to detain those living in the country unlawfully. He has accompanied rank-and-file agents on arrest operations and posted slickly edited videos of those sweeps on social media.",
      "In California, Bovino oversaw an effort by Customs and Border Protection, dubbed Operation At Large. Under that operation, Border Patrol agents, whose jobs have historically been limited to preventing the illicit entry of migrants and drugs into the country, have arrested unauthorized immigrants in places far from a U.S. border, like Los Angeles and Sacramento.",
      "Bovino has personally led some of the operations, including arrests outside of Home Depot stores and a show-of-force at MacArthur Park in Los Angeles that involved mounted Border Patrol agents and armored vehicles.",
      "In July, a federal judge in Los Angeles ruled that some of the immigration stops in southern California had been predicated on factors like race, language, occupation and location, instead of a reasonable suspicion that the subjects of stops were in the U.S. illegally. The judge barred federal agents in the region from basing arrests on those factors. On Monday, the Supreme Court paused the lower court's order.",
      "Bovino appeared to preview his deployment to Chicago last week, saying in a video he shared on social media that his team would be \"taking this show on the road, to a city near you.\"",
      "\"We're gonna trade these palm trees for some skyscrapers, and the mission continues,\" he said to the tune of Willie Nelson's \"On the Road Again.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump said Tuesday he's \"not thrilled\" and is \"very unhappy\" after Israel's military said it targeted senior leadership of the Hamas terrorist organization in strikes in Qatar's capital of Doha. The strikes drew condemnation from the Qatari government and pushback from the White House.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces told CBS News the operation was dubbed \"Summit of Fire\" and targeted leaders of Hamas who the IDF said had for years \"led the terrorist organization's operations, are directly responsible for the brutal October 7 massacre, and have been orchestrating and managing the war against the State of Israel.\"",
      "The move put the Trump administration in an unusual position because both Israel and Qatar are close U.S. allies, with Qatar hosting the Middle East's largest American military base. Qatar has also hosted Hamas' political offices for years, and the Gulf monarchy has been involved in mediating ceasefire talks between the Israeli government and Hamas.",
      "Speaking to reporters Tuesday night outside a restaurant in Washington, D.C., Mr. Trump said he was \"not thrilled about the whole situation,\" calling it \"not a good situation.\"",
      "\"I was very unhappy about it, very unhappy about every aspect,\" the president said.",
      "The president also emphasized that he is aiming to secure the release of the remaining hostages that Hamas captured during the group's Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack on Israel.. Mr. Trump has pressed Hamas and Israel to reach a ceasefire deal that could pause fighting in the Gaza Strip in exchange for the release of dozens of Israeli hostages who are still in the Palestinian enclave. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said 20 of those captives are still believed to be alive.",
      "In a joint statement Tuesday on the strikes, Netanyahu and Defense Minister Israel Katz said they \"believed that the action was completely justified in light of the fact that this Hamas leadership was the one who initiated and organized the October 7 massacre, and has not stopped launching murderous actions against the State of Israel and its citizens since then.\"",
      "Netanyahu said Israel takes full responsibility for the strike.",
      "Hamas said in a statement that five of its members died, but \"the brothers in the negotiating delegation\" were not killed, as the group reviews a ceasefire proposal floated by the Trump administration. It called the strike \"a heinous crime.\" The IDF said that \"measures were taken in order to mitigate harm to civilians, including the use of precise munitions and additional intelligence.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the Trump administration was notified by the U.S. military of the strikes. A senior U.S. official and a diplomatic source familiar with the strikes told CBS News that Israel notified the U.S. of the attack as it was about to happen. Two other U.S. officials told CBS News the U.S. did not coordinate with Israel on planning the strikes. A senior U.S. intelligence official told CBS News that the U.S. told Qatar about the strike after being informed about it by Israel.",
      "In a Truth Social post earlier Tuesday, Mr. Trump called the Qatar strike an \"unfortunate incident\" and emphasized that the U.S. was not involved.",
      "\"I view Qatar as a strong ally and friend of the U.S., and feel very badly about the location of the attack,\" the president wrote.",
      "The Qatari government called the strike \"cowardly\" and argued it violated international law.",

    "summary": "When President Trump ate at a Washington restaurant to promote his federal law enforcement surge in the nation's capital, he was greeted by protesters inside but cheers outside.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Donald Trump had dinner Tuesday night at a seafood restaurant near the White House, promoting his deployment of the National Guard and federalizing the police force in an effort to crack down on crime in the nation's capital.",
      "His motorcade drove the short distance to Joe's Seafood, Prime Steak & Stone Crab on 15th Street, NW, in D.C., following weeks of the president boasting about mobilizing federal authorities and the military that he says have made Washington \"a safe zone.\"",
      "Cheers were heard as the president stepped from his limo - though there was also a smattering of boos and chants from protesters opposing U.S. policy in support of Israel in its war with Hamas in Gaza.",
      "\"We're standing right in the middle of D.C., which as you know about, over the last year, was a very unsafe place \u2014 over the last 20 years \u2014 and now it's got virtually no crime,\" Mr. Trump told reporters.",
      "He added that he wouldn't have stood out \"in the middle of the street\" as recently as a couple of months ago. The suggestion was farcical, however, and didn't actually reflect whether crime levels had changed in Washington, since the president is always surrounded by heavy security wherever he goes.",
      "After entering the restaurant, video on social media showed him shaking hands with some diners inside. But he also stared for an extended period at a small group of protesters who held up miniature Gaza flags and chanted: \"Free D.C.! Free Palestine! Trump is the Hitler of our time!\"",
      "The president moved closer to them and could be seen gesturing briefly but didn't appear to speak.",
      "Seconds later, Mr. Trump gestured for the area to be cleared out, then gestured again.",
      "Secret Service agents removed the protesters, saying repeatedly, \"Time to go. Time to go.\" Some protesters waved banners of the Palestinian flag as they were leaving.",
      "Others in the restaurant could be heard booing or chanting \"U-S-A! U-S-A!\"",
      "The feminist group Codepink said it had the protesters in the restaurant.",
      "Some restaurants have reported drops in reservations since Mr. Trump first announced the federal crackdown on Aug. 7, while there have been frequent street protests decrying his actions. Increased military and police presence also has occasionally sparked standoffs between residents and authorities in normally quiet neighborhoods.",
      "Mr. Trump has nonetheless said repeatedly that he's spoken to friends who tell him local restaurants are full and that people have noticed a drop in crime. He says he's also heard that people appreciate crews working to remove homeless encampments as part of the crackdown.",
      "Accompanying the president for dinner were Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, as well as Susie Wiles, the White House chief of staff. In his comments before going into dinner, Mr. Trump said, \"The restaurants are booming.\"",
      "\"People are going out to dinner where they didn't go out for years,\" he said.",
      "After Mr. Trump returned to the White House after 10 p.m., press secretary Karoline Leavitt, who was also among those who dined with him, said he'd eaten crab, shrimp, salad, steak and dessert.",
      "The excursion was notable since the president rarely dines away from the White House when he's in Washington. And such outings have gotten even less common since he sold the hotel bearing his name a few blocks away, which was a key meeting point for administration officials and supporters during his first term.",
      "The White House reported Tuesday that there had been nearly 2,200 arrests since Mr. Trump first announced the Washington crackdown on Aug. 7.",
      "Mr. Trump has also deployed the National Guard to Los Angeles in June and has threatened to send troops to other, largely Democratic cities, including Baltimore, New Orleans and Chicago \u2014 where state and local authorities already are bracing for operations to sharply increase immigration enforcement.",
      "He said Tuesday night, \"We're going to be announcing another city that we're going to very shortly,\" adding it could be as soon as Wednesday. He added that the mayor of that city and the governor of the state it is in \"would love us to be there.\"",
      "That follows Trump posting over the weekend a parody image from \"Apocalypse Now\" featuring a ball of flames as helicopters zoom over the lakefront and skyline of Chicago, the nation's third-largest city.",
      "\"'I love the smell of deportations in the morning,'\" Trump wrote on his social media site. \"Chicago about to find out why it's called the Department of WAR.\"",
      "In the post, Trump offered no details beyond the label \"Chipocalypse Now,\" a play on the title of Francis Ford Coppola's 1979 Vietnam War film, in which a character says, \"I love the smell of napalm in the morning.\"",
      "Last week, Trump signed an executive order seeking to rename the Defense Department as the Department of War - even after months of campaigning to be considered for the Nobel Peace Prize. The renaming requires congressional approval.",
      "In his own post in response, Democratic Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker called Trump a \"wannabe dictator.\" He has joined state and city officials - and many Chicago residents \u2014 in decrying the idea of a federal crackdown as unnecessary.",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court on Tuesday said it will decide whether President Trump can impose his most sweeping tariffs.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Tuesday said it will decide whether President Trump can impose his most sweeping tariffs, setting up a major test of one of the pillars of the president's economic agenda.",
      "The high court agreed to review lower court decisions\u00a0that found Mr. Trump did not have the authority to issue many of his global tariffs under an emergency powers law. The Justice Department appealed one of those rulings, from a federal appeals court, to the Supreme Court last week and asked it to move swiftly.",
      "The Trump administration has argued that upholding the ruling from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit would put the United States at a disadvantage and expose the nation to retaliatory trade policies.",
      "The case is the first in which the Supreme Court will directly decide the legality of one of Mr. Trump's second-term policies. The high court has been asked roughly two dozen times to intervene in challenges to many of the president's initiatives, but on an interim emergency basis.",
      "The justices said arguments in the tariffs case would take place in the first week of November.",
      "The tariffs case",
      "One of the disputes before the Supreme Court was brought by a group of small businesses and 12 states. They argued that he did not have the authority to impose many of the global tariffs under the emergency powers law that he invoked, called the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.",
      "A federal trade court ruled in May that Mr. Trump exceeded his authority when he issued the tariffs under IEEPA, and the Federal Circuit upheld that decision late last month. In its 7-4 decision, the appeals court agreed that the tariffs are illegal.",
      "\"It seems unlikely that Congress intended, in enacting IEEPA, to depart from its past practice and grant the President unlimited authority to impose tariffs,\" the appeals court wrote. \"The statute neither mentions tariffs (or any of its synonyms) nor has procedural safeguards that contain clear limits on the President's power to impose tariffs.\"",
      "The appeals court did not decide whether IEEPA authorizes any tariffs at all. Instead, it only resolved whether sweeping duties that Mr. Trump imposed through a series of executive orders earlier this year are allowed under the law.",
      "The second case involves a pair of Illinois-based companies that sell educational toys and products. A federal district judge in Washington, D.C., ruled in May that IEEPA \"does not authorize the president to impose the tariffs set forth\" in his executive orders. The decision from U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras was more narrow, barring the Trump administration only from collecting any tariff from the two companies. Contreras paused his decision while the Justice Department appealed to the D.C. Circuit.",
      "The two companies asked the Supreme Court in June to fast track the case and leap frog the appeals court in Washington, D.C.",
      "A spokesperson for one of the companies, Learning Resources, said in a statement it was \"gratified\" that the Supreme Court would hear the case.",
      "\"There is a lot riding on this historic case,\" the spokesperson said. \"The unlawful IEEPA tariffs have wreaked havoc in our economy for too long now.\"",
      "The duties at issue include those announced by Mr. Trump in early April \u2014 which he refers to as \"Liberation Day\" \u2014 that set a 10% baseline rate for nearly every country, and higher \"reciprocal\" tariffs on dozens of U.S. trading partners. It also involves a set of levies on imports from Canada, Mexico and China in response to what Mr. Trump said is their failure to address the trafficking of fentanyl across U.S. borders.",
      "The president has used the tariffs, and the threat of additional duties, to try to force trading partners to negotiate trade deals with his administration. So far, \u00a0he has announced frameworks of trade agreements with the European Union and six countries: the United Kingdom, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Indonesia and the Philippines.",
      "Mr. Trump is the first president to use IEEPA to impose tariffs, though it has been used by his predecessors to hit foreign nations with economic sanctions. His administration has argued that a denial of tariff authority would put the U.S. on the brink of \"economic catastrophe\" and make the nation poorer.",
      "In urging the Supreme Court to move quickly, Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in a filing that the Federal Circuit's \"erroneous decision has disrupted highly impactful, sensitive, ongoing diplomatic trade negotiations, and cast a pall of legal uncertainty over the President's efforts to protect our country by preventing an unprecedented economic and foreign-policy crisis.\"",
      "The Trump administration has argued that IEEPA gives the president broad powers to regulate trade, including imposing tariffs, \"to deal with any unusual and extraordinary threat\" to U.S. national security, foreign policy or the economy.",
      "Mr. Trump has said that trade deficits and the flow of fentanyl into the U.S. constituted threats to the national security and economy of the U.S., and invoked IEEPA to impose tariffs to address them.",
      "Mr. Trump's tariffs have remained in effect, since the Federal Circuit put its decision on hold until Oct. 14 to give the administration time to appeal to the Supreme Court.",
      "The plaintiffs \u2014 the five small businesses and 12 states \u2014 agreed that the Supreme Court needs to resolve the legality of Mr. Trump's tariffs, calling it an issue of \"great\" and \"undoubted importance.\" They argued that the tariffs are illegal and urged the high court to affirm the Federal Circuit's decision.",
      "\"The government's case rests entirely on the notion that the phrase 'regulate \u2026 importation' in IEEPA constitutes a boundless power to impose tariffs on the American people whenever the President wants, at whatever level he wants, for whatever countries and products he wants, and for as long as he wants, merely by declaring that longstanding U.S. trade deficits are a national 'emergency' and an 'unusual and extraordinary threat' \u2014 assertions the government claims are effectively unreviewable,\" lawyers for the small businesses wrote in a Supreme Court filing. \"There are no limits.\"",
      "The states, meanwhile, said that the Constitution gives Congress the power to collect taxes, and the Trump administration is claiming that the president has sweeping authority to impose tariffs \"on any country, at any rate, and for however long he likes.\"",
      "\"The President's chaotic implementation of that purported authority, which changed by the day and wreaked havoc on capital markets and the economy, illustrates both the breadth of powers that the President claims and the danger of unlimited authority in this domain,\" they warned in court papers.",
      "The legal challenge to Mr. Trump's tariffs is likely to be one of several involving the president's second-term policies that the Supreme Court takes up. Other cases involving his immigration policies and efforts to remove members of independent agencies have progressed through the lower courts, and the Trump administration is likely to seek Supreme Court review of decisions against it.",

      "Whitson congratulated Walkinshaw in a statement posted to X.",
      "The district that Walkinshaw will soon represent is just outside of Washington, D.C., and includes the city of Fairfax and most of Fairfax County. The district is reliably Democratic: In the 2024 election, Connolly won reelection 67% to 33% and former Vice President Kamala Harris won Fairfax County 65.6% to 30.9%.",
      "The special election comes less than a month before an end-of-September deadline for Congress to either pass a new federal funding package or face a government shutdown.",
      "President Trump's sweeping cuts to the federal workforce, led by the Department of Government Efficiency, are also a key issue in Virginia's 11th congressional district. Some 12% of the district's workers are employed by the federal government \u2014 more than almost any other district in the country, according to a 2024 Congressional Research Service report.",
      "\"The dominant issue in this race has been job cuts caused by Donald Trump, and I think that's meaningful for the rest of the country,\" Walkinshaw told CBS News. \"So every single person in our community now knows somebody who's lost their job because of those [cuts].\"",
      "Asked by Fox News about the cuts, Whitson called federal workers \"wonderful people\" with \"great experience,\" but added: \"The people in our district who have lost their job or who are worried about losing their job, they don't need sympathy, they need solutions.\"",
      "He said that he planned to work with the Trump administration and, \"if there are good federal workers that have been pushed out of the federal workforce, I want to find a way to get them back in.\"",
      "Meanwhile, a group of lawmakers \u2014 led by GOP Rep. Thomas Massie and Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna \u2014 is pushing a bill that would require the federal government to release files related to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Massie is gathering signatures for a \"discharge petition\" that would force a vote on the bill if it's signed by a majority of House members, or 218. It's two signatures shy of that target, as all 212 Democrats and four Republicans have signed.",
      "Walkinshaw says if elected, he would sign Massie's discharge petition.",
      "\"This is one of those issues that voters who are Democrats, voters who are independents, voters who are Republicans agree on, including a lot of folks here voting for Donald Trump, that we should release these files,\" he told CBS News."

      "Washington \u2014 The Justice Department on Tuesday filed a federal criminal charge against the man accused of the deadly stabbing of Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska in Charlotte, North Carolina, last month.",
      "The Justice Department announced that the suspect in the attack, Decarlos Brown Jr., is charged with one count of committing an act causing death on a mass transportation system.",
      "\"Iryna Zarutska was a young woman living the American dream \u2014 her horrific murder is a direct result of failed soft-on-crime policies that put criminals before innocent people,\" Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement. \"I have directed my attorneys to federally prosecute DeCarlos Brown Jr., a repeat violent offender with a history of violent crime, for murder. We will seek the maximum penalty for this unforgivable act of violence \u2014 he will never again see the light of day as a free man.\"",
      "The Justice Department said the charge carries a maximum penalty of life in prison or death. Federal judges are responsible for imposing sentences after conviction.",
      "The attack, which occurred on Aug. 22, has garnered increased attention in recent days, with President Trump and his allies claiming the attack shows Democratic-run cities and states are failing to protect their residents.",
      "\"The most enraging and unacceptable part of the story is that her death was entirely preventable. Decarlos Brown never should have been on that train that night,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday.",
      "Surveillance footage showed Zarutska entering a light rail car on Aug. 22 and sitting in a row in front of Brown. Four minutes later, Brown allegedly pulled a knife from his pocket and struck Zarutska three times from behind, according to an FBI affidavit accompanying the criminal complaint.",
      "Police found Zarutska dead on the light rail with a single stab wound in the middle of her neck and a small cut on her left knee, the affidavit said. Brown was apprehended at the scene.",
      "Russ Ferguson, the U.S. attorney for the Western District of North Carolina, became emotional in the news conference announcing the charge against Brown, who is currently in state custody on first-degree murder charges.",
      "\"This is obviously a horrible, horrible situation,\" Ferguson said. \"This is why federal statutes exist. They exist to take care of situations like this, because no one should sit in fear when they sit on the light rail.\"",
      "Ferguson said the surveillance video gave prosecutors \"the basis for federal charges here.\"",
      "\"The act itself doesn't scream federal crime,\" he said. \"But when we started to see the effects of that act, and we saw the public saying, 'We're not riding the light rail anymore, we're afraid to go to the park,' that's when my mind and my office started saying \u2026 this might be a federal charge.\"",
      "FBI special agent James Barnacle Jr. said \"there is potential for other federal charges\" in the case.",
      "Zarutska's relatives have said the 23-year-old came to the U.S. with to escape Russia's war in Ukraine. Justice Department officials said Zarutska was living in a bomb shelter in Ukraine before moving.",
      "\"I hope the family won't mind me sharing. But after Iryna's death, the Embassy in Ukraine called and said, 'We'll help you bring her home.' And her family said, 'No.' They said, 'She loved America. We're going to bury her here,'\" Ferguson said.",
      "Brown has a long criminal history, including serving five years in prison for robbery with a dangerous weapon, and had been diagnosed with schizophrenia, according to The Associated Press. Brown's mother told a local television station she recently sought an involuntary psychiatric commitment after he became violent at home, the AP reported.",

    "published": "Tue, 09 Sep 2025 19:13:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Missouri's GOP-led Legislature returned for a special session earlier this week with a mid-decade redistricting push started by President Trump.",
    "story": [
      "Republicans in the Missouri House on Tuesday advanced a new\u00a0proposed congressional map, part of a mid-decade redistricting push started by President Trump to hold onto \u2013 and possibly expand \u2014 the GOP's razor-thin majority in the U.S. House.",
      "The proposed maps aim to make Missouri's congressional delegation seven Republicans and one Democrat, a change from its current delegation that is made up of six Republicans and two Democrats. The map breaks up the 5th Congressional District, currently held by Democratic Rep. Emmanuel Cleaver, making it more conservative.",
      "Missouri is the third state to consider redrawing its congressional maps. Texas Republicans\u00a0passed\u00a0their redistricting effort last month, shifting five Democratic districts toward Republicans. And California Democrats responded by passing their own redistricting plan that would make five GOP-held seats more favorable to Democrats, though the California plan still needs to be approved by voters later this year.",
      "The measure passed Missouri's state House 90-65, with several Republicans voting against it. It now heads to the state Senate, where Republicans hold a majority.",
      "Mr. Trump applauded Missouri lawmakers in a post on Truth Social, calling the proposed map \"much fairer, and improved.\"",
      "The president said the map \"will give the wonderful people of Missouri the opportunity to elect an additional MAGA Republican in the 2026 Midterm Elections.\"",
      "Missouri GOP state Rep. Dirk Deaton said while supporting the bill: \"I appreciate the leadership of President Trump as well. I appreciate all of those who've spoken out in favor, going back to 2022 and throughout the years, of a congressional map that will better represent Missouri in Washington, D.C.\"",
      "Cleaver's Kansas City district has long been a target for Republicans, as their numbers have grown in Missouri so much that Democrats do not hold any statewide elected office. But state lawmakers left it in place during the 2021 redistricting and instead split Columbia, one of the state's other Democratic strongholds, into two districts, according to University of Missouri professor Peverill Squire.",
      "The maps are meant to squeeze out another seat for Republicans, but as Squire noted, \"none of this comes without any cost.\" Mid-decade redistricting is using data that are several years old at that point, and things could have changed along the margins where the districts are being redrawn, making it far from certain that the outcome will be what Republicans want. Further, the legislature is also debating a ballot measure in this special session, the outcome of which could be affected by sentiment over redistricting.",
      "Additionally, the new map will likely be challenged in court, as have similar efforts in Texas and California.",
      "\"There's a lot of risk for the Republicans, and the only thing at the moment that they stand to gain is maybe one more House seat,\" Squire said.",
      "Kehoe announced last month that he would be calling a special session to address redistricting, the latest state in a push started this summer in Texas. In mid-July, Mr. Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson asked Texas Republicans to take a look at their congressional map for redistricting. Mr. Trump said he felt that given his margin of victory in Texas, he is \"entitled\" to five more Republican seats. Texas currently has 25 Republicans and 13 Democrats in its delegation.",
      "Congressional districts are normally settled once every 10 years, after the census shows population shifts. Some states, such as Missouri and Texas, only require the state legislature and the governor to change the districts, but others have more complicated paths for changes to the congressional map, such as independent commissions or requiring voters to give final approval.",
      "How are Democrats responding?",
      "In response to these redistricting efforts, the Democratic National Committee is mobilizing support for the state's Democrats in an attempt to bring national attention to Missouri, the latest epicenter of Mr. Trump's push for redrawing congressional districts.",
      "The DNC is leading efforts to recruit Missourians to submit public comment during the hearing process and attend a Wednesday rally in front of the Missouri State Capitol building to denounce redistricting efforts. Ohio House Democratic leader Rep. Dani Issacsohn and state Rep. Desiree Tims will be in attendance, given that Mr. Trump has warned the redistricting battle may head to the Buckeye state next.",
      "DNC Chair Ken Martin referred to this latest redistricting battle as an attempt to silence dissatisfied voters.",
      "\"Republicans know they're in trouble,\" Ken Martin told CBS News in a statement. \"Donald Trump and his party have ripped health care away from working families and jacked up prices on everyday goods in a self-serving plot to make the ultra-wealthy even wealthier.\"",
      "What happened with Texas and California's redistricting?",
      "Texas' Republican Gov. Greg Abbott called a 30-day special session to address redistricting and a number of other topics. Two weeks into the special session, Democrats left the state to deny Republicans a quorum \u2014 an option not available in Missouri, where only a simple majority is needed for a quorum. They ran out the clock on the special session, but they eventually returned after Abbott called another one, and the measure passed easily.",
      "But they garnered enough national attention that California's Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom announced that he would redraw his state's congressional districts to garner up to five seats for Democrats, although California requires the new districts to be approved by voters. Newsom pushed a ballot measure through the Democratic-led Legislature, and it passed easily.",
      "Both Texas and California's maps are being challenged in court.",

      "Sen. Ruben Gallego, Democrat of Arizona, will seek to block the Pentagon from offering full military funeral honors to Ashli Babbitt, a member of the crowd that rioted at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "Gallego, who has criticized the Pentagon for agreeing recently to provide Babbitt with an honorary military funeral, will attempt to pass legislation this week to prevent the honor from being conferred.",
      "He told CBS News, his legislation \"comes from a sense of patriotism, you know, as someone who served this country, as someone who unfortunately buried a lot of Marines with full military honors.\"",
      "\"The idea that they're giving this to a person who actively tried to overthrow the government, who was violent in nature, who knowingly was entering a restrictive zone while we were trying to conduct the safe passage of democracy, and the idea that they're just going to give this without a fight, it's just not going to happen,\" Gallego said.",
      "He said he's noticed that top officials, the secretary of the Air Force, defense secretary, the vice president and president have \"never even said this,\" and \"they just kind of have been trying to sneak this in under \u2014 in the dark.\"",
      "\"And I'm not gonna let that happen,\" Gallego said. \"I'm gonna put people on the record to make sure that we know who stood with your traitor, Ashli Babbitt.\"",

      "\"Ashli Babbitt's actions on January 6, 2021, constitute disqualifying conduct under section 985 of 4 title 10, United States Code, the rendering of military funeral honors to her would bring discredit upon the Air Force, and she is not eligible for such honors,\" Gallego's resolution reads.",

She was shot and killed by a police officer. A federal investigation of the shooting determined charges were not warranted against the officer.",
      "The Pentagon initially denied the Babbitt family's request for military funeral honors for her. It stated in a letter that the circumstances preceding her death \u2014 that she was \"fatally shot after having illegally entered\" the Capitol \u2014 resulted in the determination that conferring the honor would \"bring discredit on the Air Force.\" The letter was posted by Judicial Watch, a Washington, D.C.-based conservative legal group, that lobbied for the Pentagon to provide honors to Babbitt. In its request to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, the organization cited President Trump's clemency for more than 1,500 Jan. 6 defendants.",
      "The request said the government's \"refusal to provide military funeral honors was part of the 'grave national injustice' that President Trump ended by granting clemency. The 'process of national reconciliation' that began with presidential clemency demands a new determination granting military funeral honor for Ashli and her family.\"",
      "An Air Force undersecretary posted on social media in August about the Pentagon's decision to provide the honor to Babbitt.",
      "Judicial Watch's request to the Pentagon argued, \"Ashli enlisted in the U.S. Air Force after graduating high school at age seventeen.

      "A Michigan judge dismissed criminal charges Tuesday against a group of people who were accused of attempting to falsely certify President Donald Trump as the winner of the 2020 election in the battleground state, a major blow to prosecutors as similar cases in four other states have been muddied with setbacks.",
      "District Court Judge Kristen D. Simmons said in a court hearing that the 15 Republicans accused will not face trial. The case has dragged through the courts since Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, a Democrat, announced the charges over two years ago.",
      "Each member of the group, which included a few high-profile members of the Republican Party in Michigan, faced eight charges of forgery and conspiracy to commit election forgery. The top felony charges carried a maximum penalty of 14 years in prison.",
      "Investigators said the group met at the Michigan GOP headquarters in December of 2020 and signed a document falsely stating they were the state's \"duly elected and qualified electors.\" President Joe Biden won Michigan by nearly 155,000 votes, a result confirmed by a GOP-led state Senate investigation in 2021.",
      "Electors are part of the 538-member Electoral College that officially elects the president of the United States. In 48 states, electors vote for the candidate who won the popular vote. In Nebraska and Maine, elector votes are awarded based on congressional district and statewide results.",

    "summary": "President Trump's administration asked the Supreme Court on Monday to allow it to freeze billions of dollars in foreign aid funding.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Chief Justice John Roberts on Tuesday temporarily halted a lower court order that blocked the Trump administration from freezing more than $4 billion in foreign-aid funding.",
      "The chief justice issued an administrative stay, which gives the Supreme Court more time to fully consider the government's request for emergency relief. The Justice Department asked the Supreme Court on Monday to allow the administration to freeze the funding for foreign aid projects.",
      "The request for the Supreme Court's intervention comes in a clash over the president's refusal to spend money allocated by Congress for foreign assistance programs.",
      "The Trump administration has asked the high court to partially halt the lower court order that required it to spend more than $4 billion in aid by the end of September. Mr. Trump is attempting to claw back that money, which has already been approved by Congress, through a rarely used maneuver known as a pocket rescission.",
      "The dispute also involves another $6.5 billion in foreign assistance, though the Justice Department has said it is taking steps to obligate those funds by Sept. 30, the end of the fiscal year.",
      "The legal fight quickly arrived at the Supreme Court after U.S. District Judge Amir Ali ruled last week that the executive branch had to spend the $4 billion in foreign aid funding that Congress had appropriated. The Justice Department asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit to freeze that decision, though it declined to do so last Friday.",
      "In seeking emergency relief from the Supreme Court, Solicitor General D. John Sauer said the district court's injunction \"raises a grave and urgent threat to the separation of powers.\" He is asking the Supreme Court to pause the district court's order only as to the $4 billion that Mr. Trump is attempting to rescind.",
      "\"The President can hardly speak with one voice in foreign affairs or in dealings with Congress when the district court is forcing the Executive Branch to advocate against its own objectives,\" Sauer wrote.",
      "Since returning to the White House, the Trump administration has canceled billions of dollars in contracts and grants that it says do not align with the president's policy objectives. On the first day of his second term, the president signed an executive order that called for a 90-day pause in foreign aid and said administration officials would determine whether to continue or cease each foreign assistance program.",
      "Congressional Democrats estimate that more than $425 billion in federal funding has been canceled or frozen by the president.",
      "The latest dispute before the Supreme Court was brought by a group of nonprofits and businesses that receive money for foreign assistance projects. The plaintiffs argued that the 90-day freeze was an unconstitutional exercise of the president's authority.",
      "The case has already landed at the Supreme Court, though in an earlier stage in the proceedings. In early March, the high court split 5-4 in rejecting a bid from the president to keep $2 billion in foreign aid frozen while the case moved forward.",
      "The case has progressed since then. Last month, a three-judge panel on the D.C. Circuit said that the nonprofits and businesses could not sue. The 2-1 panel wiped away an order from Ali that had prohibited the government from impounding congressionally appropriated foreign aid funds.",
      "But the D.C. Circuit panel issued an amended opinion late last month that opened up an avenue for the nonprofits and businesses to seek relief on different legal grounds.",
      "On the heels of that decision, Mr. Trump sent a letter to Congress proposing to rescind a total of $4.9 billion, which includes funding for the State Department, international development programs and the the U.S. Agency for International Development, which the president has moved to shutter.",
      "The president's plan is an attempt to roll back funding unilaterally and has not been done in nearly 50 years. One Republican has called the effort \"unlawful\" and said the Constitution makes clear that Congress has the power of the purse.",
      "The plaintiffs in the case sought a new preliminary injunction. Last week, Ali found that the government has a statutory duty to spend the $4 billion that is subject to Mr. Trump's rescission proposal. He ordered the Trump administration to spend the expiring funds approved by Congress for foreign assistance, unless Congress claws it back in accordance with the procedures laid out in federal law.",
      "In seeking relief from the Supreme Court, Sauer, the solicitor general, said Ali's injunction \"puts the executive branch at war with itself\" by requiring it to spend the same $4 billion that the president wants to claw back.",

      "Dr. Jeanne Marrazzo described in an exclusive interview with CBS News being silenced when she and her colleagues tried to oppose efforts pushed by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to cancel vaccine research and clinical trials.",
      "\"Ultimately, we were disregarded,\" said Marrazzo, who previously led the NIH's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, or NIAID. \"We became inconvenient.\"",
      "Marrazzo, who filed a whistleblower complaint with the U.S. Office of Special Counsel last week alleging illegal retaliation, was placed on leave and reassigned in April. She had been in the role since August 2023, succeeding Dr. Anthony Fauci, who had served as NIAID director for nearly four decades, as well as chief medical adviser to former President Joe Biden.",

      "Many allegations in the complaint focus on Dr. Matthew Memoli, who served as acting NIH director earlier this year before moving to the health agency's No. 2 post.",
      "Marrazzo claims Memoli made statements downplaying the importance of vaccines that closely mirrored the views of Kennedy, a longtime vaccine skeptic. In a series of meetings, Memoli allegedly argued that \"vaccines are unnecessary if populations are healthy,\" and that the NIH \"should not focus on vaccines,\" Marrazzo alleged in her complaint.",
      "Asked by CBS News about interactions with people in positions similar to Memoli's and those above him, Marrazzo said, \"It was one of the hardest periods of my career,\" and she and her colleagues who were involved \"felt like we were sort of a voice in the wilderness.\"",
      "Marrazzo described a dispute about the importance of giving children the flu vaccine. She said she outlined her advocacy on two occasions for a universal flu vaccine that covered seasonal and avian flu, emphasizing the importance of continued investment in flu vaccine research.",
      "\"Both times that I presented this, Dr. Memoli made the point that, yes, it would be great. It would be nice to have a flu vaccine,\" Marrazzo said. \"But what was most important was to have children who were healthy and had a healthy immune system.\"",
      "Marrazzo said \"it was a little bit like hearing the echo of, again, what Secretary Kennedy had been promulgating in terms of healthy kids.\"",
      "\"It was extremely alarming,\" she added.",
      "An HHS spokesperson said in a statement that \"NIH Deputy Director Dr. Matt Memoli emphasizes that vaccines are not interchangeable; each must be assessed on its own merits.\"",
      "\"He remains fully aligned with this administration's vaccine priorities and consistently champions gold-standard, evidence-based science,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Over time, Marrazzo said things \"became increasingly uncomfortable\" because \"we were persistent.\"",
      "\"We didn't back down,\" she said.",
      "At the same time, Marrazzo said \"we started seeing people at meetings who were placed there from either the White House or from HHS.\" She said \"none of us really knew where these people came from.\"",
      "Marrazzo said one person confronted her about the agency she ran, which famously helped lead the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and \"indicated to me that [it] was a target.\" The official accused her team of doing unethical research.",
      "Asked whether she thinks she's being held responsible for actions taken by her predecessor, Fauci \u2014 who has faced years of criticism from Trump allies \u2014 and for research conducted by the agency before the pandemic, Marrazzo told CBS News, \"I think it's entirely possible.\"",
      "Marrazzo described discussing the administration's priorities in meetings to CBS News, noting that it was a \"very different\" dynamic than when she began the role midway through the Biden administration. She said she had been hopeful that \"intelligence would prevail\" in a second Trump administration, noting that the president had \"championed the work that led to the COVID vaccines,\" among other things, during his first term.",
      "Marrazzo objected to the leadership's \"censorship of scientific research and their subordination of scientific integrity to unscientific and unsupported policy preferences,\" her complaint says, noting that she specifically objected to the administration's \"hostility towards vaccines and its abrupt cancellation of grants and clinical trials for political reasons.\"",
      "Senior federal health officials removed Marrazzo from her position on March 31, the complaint alleges, in \"a blatant act of retaliation,\" noting that she was placed on involuntary administrative leave and told she would be transferred to the Indian Health Service, an agency within HHS. In the complaint, Marrazzo wrote that she would like to be reinstated to her position if the Office of Special Counsel finds that a prohibited personnel practice took place.",
      "Former NIH official calls RFK Jr. \"dangerous\"",
      "In recent weeks, Health Secretary Kennedy has faced scrutiny over the Trump administration's policies on vaccines and the recent ouster of top officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, another agency under the department's umbrella. The Trump administration is attempting to oust CDC Director Susan Monarez, after she was confirmed by the Senate in late July, although her lawyers have pushed back on the legality of her firing.",
      "Last week, Kennedy testified before the Senate Finance Committee. Kennedy refuted the claim that he told Monarez she had to resign if she refused to sign off on changes to the childhood vaccine schedule, saying he told her to resign after he asked, \"'are you a trustworthy person?' and she said no.\" At the hearing, several Democrats said Kennedy should resign or be fired, while a handful of Republicans also expressed concern about Kennedy's moves at the department.",
      "Marrazzo told CBS News that Kennedy is not qualified for his job and described him as \"dangerous.\"",
      "\"He's dangerous because he ignores the evidence,\" she said. \"He appears to be driven by, a desire to satisfy a need to tear things down, and to discredit people who have dedicated their lives to evidence and to interpreting that evidence to further Americans' health.\"",
      "Marrazzo encouraged people to find a source they trust when it comes to questions about their health, whether that's their doctor or a nurse practitioner. Asked about Kennedy as a source, Marrazzo said, \"I think the consensus is that he's not trustworthy.\"",
      "Debra Katz, who represents Marrazzo and Dr. Kathleen Neuzil \u2014 the former director of the Fogarty International Center and NIH associate director for international research, who also filed a whistleblower complaint \u2014 said in a statement that the Trump administration \"installed politically motivated leaders,\" pointing to Kennedy, who \"immediately acted to stifle scientific inquiry, halt crucial research and retaliate against those, like Drs. Marrazzo and Neuzil, who refused to disavow the overwhelming body of evidence showing that vaccines are safe and effective.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump appeared to once again threaten sending troops to Chicago for a widespread immigration and crime crackdown similar to that seen in Los Angeles when the National Guard was recently deployed there.",
      "In a post on Truth Social\u00a0on Saturday, Mr. Trump shared a screenshot that reads \"'I love the smell of deportations in the morning ...' Chicago about to find out why it's called the Department of WAR.\" The AI-generated image appears to parody the movie \"Apocalypse Now.\"",
      "On Sunday, the president told reporters at the White House that his administration is not \"going to war\" in Chicago.",
      "\"We're going to clean up our cities,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We're going to clean them up, so they don't kill five people every weekend. That's not war, that's common sense.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has targeted Chicago and other Democrat-led cities for expanded federal intervention. His administration has said it will step up immigration enforcement in the Windy City, as he did in Los Angeles, and would deploy National Guard troops to help fight crime. In addition to sending troops to Los Angeles in June, Mr. Trump deployed them last month in Washington, D.C., as part of his unprecedented law enforcement takeover of the nation's capital.",
      "A federal court in California ruled this week that the Trump administration violated federal law when it deployed Guard and active-duty U.S Marines to Los Angeles. U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer found that the administration violated the 1878 Posse Comitatus Act, which prohibits the use of the military for domestic law enforcement.",
      "Although details about the promised Chicago operation have been sparse, local opposition is already widespread and is building in the suburbs. State and city leaders have said they plan to sue the Trump administration.",
      "\"We're going in. I didn't say when, we're going in,\" Mr. Trump said in an Oval Office event Tuesday, after a reporter asked if he plans to send the Guard to Chicago.",
      "Mr. Trump did not specify whether his administration will primarily send Guard forces or federal law enforcement agents to Chicago.",
      "On Sunday, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker responded to Mr. Trump's Truth Social post, saying in a post X, \"The President of the United States is threatening to go to war with an American city.\"",
      "\"This is not a joke. This is not normal,\" Pritzker wrote. \"Donald Trump isn't a strongman, he's a scared man. Illinois won't be intimidated by a wannabe dictator.\"",
      "The city's mayor, Brandon Johnson, in a post on X, said Mr. Trump's threats are \"beneath the honor of our nation.\"",
      "\"But the reality is that he wants to occupy our city and break our Constitution,\" he wrote. \"We must defend our democracy from this authoritarianism by protecting each other and protecting Chicago from Donald Trump.\"",
      "An internal government memo obtained by CBS News this week showed that the Department of Homeland Security asked the Pentagon to accommodate roughly 250 federal agents and 140 vehicles at the Naval Station Great Lakes \u2013 the largest military base in Illinois and the Navy's largest training station.",
      "The request was officially made last week, and Homeland Security personnel and equipment began arriving at the naval station earlier this week, a U.S. official familiar with the operation told CBS News. The naval station is located about 50 miles north of Chicago on Lake Michigan.",
      "The internal memo said Homeland Security officials would need the base for 30 days, suggesting the immigration crackdown in Chicago could last for weeks.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, DHS said it will \"go to wherever these criminal illegal aliens are \u2014 including Chicago, Boston, and other cities.\"",
      "\"Under President Trump and Secretary Noem, nowhere is a safe haven for criminal illegal aliens,\" the department said. \"If you come to our country illegally and break our laws, we will hunt you down, arrest you, deport you, and you will never return.\"",
      "Activists, church groups and schools in the nation's third-largest city have been preparing for the operation. Organizers postponed a downtown Mexican Independence Day festival scheduled for later this month because of fears in the community about the planned immigration crackdown.

This outcrop of sedimentary rock, known as the Bright Angel formation, was surveyed by Perseverance's science instruments before the drill came out.",
      "Along with organic carbon, a building block of life, Hurowitz and his team found minuscule specks, dubbed poppy seeds and leopard spots, that were enriched with iron phosphate and iron sulfide.

    "story": [
      "Scientists are observing an Earth-like exoplanet that may contain water using NASA's James Webb Space Telescope, the space agency said in a news release.",
      "The exoplanet, known as TRAPPIST-1 e, orbits the red dwarf star TRAPPIST-1. The system was discovered in 2017. There are seven Earth-sized worlds orbiting the star, but planet e is the only one that is at a distance where water on the surface is \"theoretically possible,\" NASA said. However, astronomers still need to determine if the planet has an atmosphere.",
      "To look for an atmosphere, NASA scientists directed the Webb telescope's Near-Infrared Spectrograph instrument at the TRAPPIST-1 system as planet e passed in front of the star. If the planet has an atmosphere, the starlight that passes through it will be partially absorbed. That will create dips in the light spectrum that reaches the spectrograph. Those dips will allow scientists to determine if the planet has an atmosphere and what chemicals it might be made of.",
      "Scientists are also studying the light spectrum of another exoplanet in the system called TRAPPIST-1 b. Researchers have determined that planet has no atmosphere, NASA said, so comparing its output to that of TRAPPIST-1 e allows for a fuller picture of the potential atmosphere on that planet.",
      "\"Webb's infrared instruments are giving us more detail than we've ever had access to before, and the initial four observations we've been able to make of planet e are showing us what we will have to work with when the rest of the information comes in,\" said N\u00e9stor Espinoza of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, Maryland, a principal investigator on the research team. Espinoza and the research team recently published two\u00a0scientific\u00a0papers\u00a0outlining their initial results.",
      "Researchers \"feel confident\" that TRAPPIST-1 e does not have a primary atmosphere. A primary atmosphere would be made of hydrogen and helium that would have been present when the planet was formed. But the star the planet orbits is \"very active,\" with \"frequent flares,\" NASA said, which create stellar radiation that may have \"stripped off\" that primary atmosphere. However, TRAPPIST-1 e may have built up a \"heavier secondary atmosphere.\" Many planets, including Earth, have done this, NASA said. Further research with the Webb telescope and its instruments will determine the types of atmosphere and its makeup.",
      "There are also many possibilities for water on the planet. There may be none at all, NASA said. TRAPPIST-1 e might also contain an ocean or wide swath of water. One side of the planet is always in darkness, so there may also be ice, NASA said. If there is liquid water on the planet, the NASA researchers say there would also be a greenhouse effect, where gases like carbon dioxide keep the atmosphere stable and warm the planet.",
      "\"We are really still in the early stages of learning what kind of amazing science we can do with Webb. It's incredible to measure the details of starlight around Earth-sized planets 40 light-years away and learn what it might be like there, if life could be possible there,\" said Ana Glidden, a post-doctoral researcher at Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research, who led the research on possible atmospheres for planet e, in NASA's news release. \"We're in a new age of exploration that's very exciting to be a part of,\" she said.",

      "The image of comet 3I/ATLAS was captured on Aug. 27 using one of the telescopes at the International Gemini Observatory in Chile during a public outreach event allowing students to work with astronomers.",
      "The comet is only the third-known interstellar object to pass through our solar system. It poses no threat to Earth, NASA previously said.",
      "Comet 3I/ATLAS has been photographed multiple times since its discovery in July. In early August, NASA and the European Space Agency released photos taken by the Hubble Space Telescope. It was about 277 million miles away from Earth when the telescope captured it.",
      "The new image from the Gemini Observatory shows the comet's broad coma, or a cloud of dust and gas that forms around its nucleus as it gets closer to the sun, astronomers said in a news release. The tail spans about 1/200th of a degree in the sky. One degree is about the width of a pinky finger, according to the news release. The tail also points away from the sun.",
      "The features are \"significantly more extended than they appeared in earlier images,\" according to astronomers. This means that the comet has become \"more active\" as it travels through the inner solar system.",
      "The main purpose of the observatory session, which allowed students and members of the public to remotely join astronomers in the control room, was to look at the wavelengths of light that emit from the comet. The wavelengths, also called a spectrum, can give scientists information about the comet's composition and chemistry, helping them understand how the comet changes while passing through the solar system, the news release said.",

      "The company has agreed to pay authors about $3,000 for each of an estimated 500,000 books covered by the settlement. A trio of authors \u2014 thriller novelist Andrea Bartz and nonfiction writers Charles Graeber and Kirk Wallace Johnson \u2014 sued last year, and now represent a broader group of writers and publishers whose books Anthropic downloaded to train its chatbot Claude.",
      "The landmark settlement could mark a turning point in legal battles between AI companies and the writers, visual artists and other creative professionals who accuse them of copyright infringement. A judge could approve the settlement as soon as Monday.",
      "\"As best as we can tell, it's the largest copyright recovery ever,\" said Justin Nelson, a lawyer for the authors. \"It is the first of its kind in the AI era.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Anthropic Aparna Sridhar deputy general counsel said the settlement \"will resolve the plaintiffs' remaining legacy claims.\"",
      "Sridhar added that the settlement comes after the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California in June ruled\u00a0that Anthropic's use of legally purchased books to train Claude did not violate U.S. copyright law.",
      "\"We remain committed to developing safe AI systems that help people and organizations extend their capabilities, advance scientific discovery and solve complex problems,\" Sridhar said.",
      "Anthropic, which was founded by former executives with ChatGPT developer OpenAI,\u00a0introduced\u00a0Claude in 2023. Like other generative AI bots, the tool lets users ask natural language questions and then provides summarized answers using AI trained on millions of books, articles and other material.",
      "Settlement terms",
      "If Anthropic had not settled, experts say losing the case after a scheduled December trial could have cost the San Francisco-based company even more money.",
      "\"We were looking at a strong possibility of multiple billions of dollars, enough to potentially cripple or even put Anthropic out of business,\" said William Long, a legal analyst for Wolters Kluwer.",
      "U.S. District Judge William Alsup of San Francisco has scheduled a Monday hearing to review the settlement terms.",
      "Books are known to be important sources of data \u2014 in essence, billions of words carefully strung together \u2014 that are needed to build the AI large language models behind chatbots like Anthropic's Claude and its chief rival, OpenAI's ChatGPT.",
      "Alsup's June ruling found that Anthropic had downloaded more than 7 million digitized books that it \"knew had been pirated.\" It started with nearly 200,000 from an online library called Books3, assembled by AI researchers outside of OpenAI to match the vast collections on which ChatGPT was trained.",
      "Debut thriller novel \"The Lost Night\" by Bartz, a lead plaintiff in the case, was among those found in the Books3 dataset.",
      "Anthropic later took at least 5 million copies from the pirate website Library Genesis, or LibGen, and at least 2 million copies from the Pirate Library Mirror, Alsup wrote.",
      "The Authors Guild told its thousands of members last month that it expected \"damages will be minimally $750 per work and could be much higher\" if Anthropic was found at trial to have willfully infringed their copyrights. The settlement's higher award \u2014 approximately $3,000 per work \u2014 likely reflects a smaller pool of affected books, after taking out duplicates and those without copyright.",
      "On Friday, Mary Rasenberger, CEO of the Authors Guild, called the settlement \"an excellent result for authors, publishers, and rightsholders generally, sending a strong message to the AI industry that there are serious consequences when they pirate authors' works to train their AI, robbing those least able to afford it.\"",

      "Kirk, a close Trump ally, was the key to energizing and mobilizing the youth vote for the president throughout his campaigns. He was critical to the Trump ground game effort for voter turnout and built out significant parts of the Trump campaign in Arizona, Georgia and Pennsylvania. Kirk stood by the president during what could be described as his political winter, soon after he announced his second presidential campaign, when skeptics doubted he could become president again.",
      "Kirk also made it his mission to engage more young people in politics, and register them to vote. Kirk was also a close friend of the president's son, Donald Trump, Jr.",

Kirk pushed false claims about voter fraud after Mr. Trump lost the 2020 presidential election, stoked skepticism about the COVID-19 pandemic and spread anti-trans rhetoric. He also amplified the \"Great Replacement\" conspiracy, which is based on the belief that there's a plot to replace White people with minorities.",
      "After casting doubt early on about mail-in voting, Kirk pushed GOP voters to embrace the methods in 2024.",

      "Raydon DeChene told CBS News she was among the crowd at Kirk's event at Utah Valley University, standing near the Turning Point USA co-founder's \"Prove Me Wrong\" outdoor tent, where he invites students to challenge his political and cultural views.",
      "\"I was right up front,\" DeChene said, who noted Kirk was, \"ironically,\" talking about gun control before he was shot.",
      "Suddenly, DeChene said she saw Kirk grab what she believed was his neck.",
      "\"And there's just blood pouring out everywhere and his eyes kind of rolled back,\" she said. \"At that point, I kind of looked up because it sounds like it came up from behind me, up the hill. It was just one pop, and then we all dropped to the ground. Then they told us all to run. So we all ran out.\"",
      "Other witnesses also told\u00a0CBS affiliate KUTV\u00a0that Kirk was about to answer a question about gun violence when he was shot.",
      "Before the debate began, DeChene said the crowd was \"just having a good time\" as they enjoyed the atmosphere and chanting Kirk's name. The event at the Orem, Utah, school was part of TPUSA's \"The American Comeback Tour.\"",
      "At at a news conference on Wednesday, UVU Chief of Police Jeffrey Long said there were over 3,000 people in attendance, but there were only six university officers working the event, with some plain clothes officers in the crowd. In addition to the local officers, Long said his team coordinated with Kirk's security team.",
      "\"We train for these things, and you think you have things covered and these things, unfortunately, they happen,\" Long told reporters. \"You try to get your bases covered and, unfortunately, today we didn't.\"",
      "When asked about what kind of security the event had, DeChene and other witnesses said that there was no major security or any metal detectors.",
      "Jordan Last told CBS News he arrived at the event around 12 p.m. local time, when it started, saying that he saw some security detail but walked right past them. He said he made his way to the end of the line, about 50 to 100 feet to the right of Kirk, because he was \"looking forward to challenging him on a couple of things.\"",
      "\"I really respect him and I wanted to talk to him,\" Last said. \"The first question had just finished ... and they had just gotten into the second question, I believe, and that's when I heard a huge pop.\"",
      "Another witness, Max Stanley, a pitcher for the Utah Valley University baseball team, told KUTV that he and some of his friends were further away from the tent, but they could hear the loud gunshot.",
      "\"I saw his body actually in slow motion kind of fall over,\" Stanley said. \"There were people just rushing. I was doing all I could to help them out. Get them out.\"",

      "More than 300 South Korean nationals detained by federal agents in a massive immigration raid last week on a Hyundai plant in Georgia for alleged visa violations were waiting Wednesday for a charter flight due to carry them back to their country.",
      "The South Korean workers were among some 475 people detained on Sept. 4 by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents at a still-under construction joint Hyundai-LG electric vehicle battery facility near Savannah. ICE said they were suspected of living and working in the U.S. illegally.",
      "South Korea's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the departure of the Air Korea charter flight, which had been expected on Wednesday, was delayed due to unspecified circumstances in the U.S., but it would not provide any further information.",
      "A spokesperson for Hartsfield-Jackson airport in Atlanta told CBS News that the charter operation to transport the detainees had been canceled for Wednesday, subject to change. The spokesperson did not provide any information on the reason for the change in plans.",
      "The raid and the detention of hundreds of South Koreans in an ICE facility has tested U.S.-South Korea ties that are important politically, militarily and economically. South Korea is the biggest foreign direct investor in the U.S. and the sixth biggest trading partner overall.",
      "President Lee Jae Myung, visiting the White House in July, pledged $350 billion in new U.S. investment to sweeten a trade-and-tariff deal with President Trump.",
      "\"The sentiment is obviously very, very negative,\" James Kim, Chairman and CEO of the American Chamber of Commerce in Seoul, told CBS News. \"In my office, I usually have my TV turned on to the news - and this is obviously covered from morning to evening constantly. But everyone who I speak to, they view America as its number-one partner here from South Korea. Yes, we're going to have some challenging times.\"",
      "South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Hyun, was peppered with demands from angry lawmakers during a parliamentary session in Seoul on Sept. 8, before he departed for meetings with Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other U.S. officials.",
      "Lawmaker Kim Joon-hyun demanded that Cho respond to the ICE raid by launching investigations into every U.S. national teaching English in South Korea who could be working illegally on a tourist visa.",
      "\"Are we giving our money, technology, and investment to the United States only to be treated like this?,\" Kim asked.",
      "Cho replied by saying he would try to negotiate with Rubio to increase the number of visas issued to highly skilled Korean nationals to work in specialty occupations in the U.S.",
      "The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said the ICE raid was the biggest single-site enforcement action in the agency's history. ICE alleges that the South Korean workers either overstayed their visa waiver permits, known as ESTAs, which allow business visits of up to 90 days, or were holding visas that did not permit them to perform manual labor, called B-1 business visas.",
      "Kim, at the American Chamber in Seoul, called it a \"blip\" in U.S.-Korea ties and said he was \"very, very optimistic about a much brighter future between the two\" countries.",
      "South Korea's president, however, took a more critical tone.",
      "\"As the president who is in charge of national safety, I feel a great responsibility,\" Lee said Tuesday. \"I hope that the unfair infringement of our people and corporate activities for the joint development of both Korea and the United States will not happen again.\"",
      "A poll conducted in South Korea found that almost 60% of respondents said they were disappointed by the U.S. crackdown and called the measures \"excessive,\" while about 31% said the ICE action was \"inevitable\" and that they could understand the reasoning.",
      "President Trump, in a Sunday post on his Truth Social platform, addressed all foreign companies operating in the U.S., saying \"your investments are welcome, and we encourage you to LEGALLY bring your very smart people.\"",
      "Kim at the chamber of commerce urged companies to heed the advice.",
      "\"My key message is listen to what President Trump said today. He wants to encourage more foreign companies to invest in America. Bring your people, bring your resources into America, but do it legally,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Industry experts caution, however, that it may be difficult to maintain investment levels under those guidelines, as securing visas can take years, while many projects face strict deadlines and delays can drive up costs. There is a shortage of highly skilled workers in the U.S., meanwhile, for battery manufacturing, semiconductor and modern shipbuilding industries \u2014 all arenas in which South Korea has been investing heavily for years.",
      "Such jobs can require years of experience, not just a few months of on-the-job training.",
      "A spokesperson for South Korea's Foreign Ministry told CBS News that since Mr. Trump's second term began, it had already reached out 52 times on the matter of securing more visas for highly-skilled workers.",
      "Kim, the U.S. chamber of commerce leader, said the current upset in relations represented \"an opportunity to really fix some things that could be in the grey area, make it a lot more clear, so that they can have an even better relationship.\"",
      "He said that, given Seoul's importance as an investor in the U.S., it may be a good time for Washington to consider adopting a new policy that allows South Koreans to more easily come and work in the U.S.",

      "In the letter, Nicolosi pointed to the Labor Department recently announcing large downward revisions to its earlier estimates of payroll gains. BLS released figures on Tuesday showing that the U.S. labor market added more than 900,000 fewer jobs in the 12-month period ending March 2025 than had earlier been reported.",
      "The BLS produces its monthly employment report by conducting separate surveys of households and businesses. The Labor Department also taps other measures of how the job market is faring, including state unemployment claims. The Labor Department frequently issues revisions to figures from prior months as more complete or accurate data is collected over time.",
      "The internal review of BLS' methods also will examine how it collects, reports and revises data used in two closely watched gauges of inflation \u2014 the Producer Price Index and the Consumer Price Index \u2014 Nicolosi said. Recent data show that inflation around the U.S. has risen this year.",
      "President Trump last month fired then BLS commissioner Erika McEntarfer and accused her of political bias after the Labor Department's July employment report showed unexpectedly weak job growth and revised down payroll gains for the previous two months.",

      "The court declined a request from South Carolina officials to freeze a federal appeals court decision that blocked enforcement of its policy on transgender students' restroom use solely against the ninth-grader, identified in court papers as John Doe. The state conditions funding on a school's compliance with a rule prohibiting transgender students from using the facilities that align with their gender identity.",
      "In an unsigned order, the court said its denial is \"not a ruling on the merits of the legal issues presented in the litigation. Rather, it is based on the standards applicable for obtaining emergency relief from this Court.\" Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch said they would have granted South Carolina's request.",
      "\"Today's decision from the Supreme Court reaffirms what we all know to be true: Contrary to South Carolina's insistence, trans students are not emergencies. They are not threats. They are young people looking to learn and grow at school, despite the state-mandated hostility they too often face,\" Alexandra Brodsky, litigation director for Public Justice's Students' Civil Rights Project, which is representing the student, said in a statement. \"We are so thrilled that our client will continue to be able to use boys' restrooms while his appeal continues, and hope today's decision will provide hope to other trans students and their families during these difficult times.\"",

      "Doe appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit, and last month, the court granted an injunction as to Doe. The 4th Circuit blocked South Carolina and its Department of Education from enforcing compliance with its policy forbidding transgender students from using restrooms that correspond with their gender identities, but only as applied to Doe.",

The appeals court found that his Virginia school board's policy requiring transgender students to use restrooms that correspond with their biological sex was unlawful.",
      "Grimm's case had been before the Supreme Court in 2017, but the court sent the dispute back to the lower courts. Then, in 2021, the high court declined to take up the case for a second time, leaving the 4th Circuit ruling in Grimm's favor in place.",

      "\"It's really challenging,\" McBlais, who works at a nonprofit, says of managing her expenses. \"It's paycheck to paycheck.\"",
      "Cleaning her chimney cost $500 this year, up from about $200 when she bought her house in 2019. And grocery money isn't going as far either, prompting McBlais to stretch meals to make sure the family has leftovers. \"I honestly don't expect anything to go back to the way they were \u2014 it's a matter of things leveling off where they are at,\" she said.",
      "McBlais' concerns and struggles come as the pace of inflation continues to creep higher, remaining well above the Federal Reserve's goal of driving it down to an annual 2% rate. The situation is leaving some consumers feeling frustrated by stubbornly high prices on everything from groceries to housing,\u00a0souring their views\u00a0about the health of the U.S. economy.",
      "In a recent\u00a0CBS News poll, two-thirds of Americans said that prices in the past few weeks have continued to rise, with nearly all saying they expect the rise in costs to continue.",

      "At the same time, President Trump is pushing the Federal Reserve to cut its benchmark rate, posting on social media on Wednesday that there is \"no inflation!!!\" He also urged the Fed to \"lower the RATE, BIG, right now.\"",
      "In July 2024, when Mr. Trump pledged to end the \"inflation nightmare,\" the CPI rate stood at 2.9%, or the same pace that economists forecast for tomorrow's report.",

      "Asked for comment on forecasts the CPI will show an uptick in inflation, the White House said the president is delivering on his promises.",
      "\"Joe Biden unleashed the worst inflation crisis in nearly four years \u2014 President Trump ended it. Despite the media's false narrative, core inflation has run at a 2.4% average pace since President Trump took office which is the lowest 6-month pace since March 2021. The so-called 'experts' have been wrong month after month: tariffs have not hiked prices and President Trump is delivering on his promise to make America affordable again,\" White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The Federal Reserve's complicated decision",
      "A hotter CPI report would complicate the Federal Reserve's task of deciding its next interest rate move on Sept. 17, given that the labor market has stalled out this summer. The Fed's so-called \"dual mandate\" requires it to promote full employment while keeping inflation in check.",
      "So far in 2025, the Fed has held its benchmark rate steady, with Chair Jerome Powell saying he wanted to keep the central bank's powder dry in case tariffs caused inflation to reignite. Because rate reductions make it cheaper to borrow, they can spur businesses and consumers to open their wallets, adding to inflationary pressures.",
      "But two consecutive disappointing jobs reports signal that the labor market is stalling out, putting pressure on the Fed to cut rates, which can help bolster hiring by making it cheaper for businesses to borrow and add more workers. Powell last month signaled the Fed may be open to a cut, pointing to the labor market's risks.",
      "The probability of a 0.25 percentage point rate cut is pegged at 90% by CME FedWatch, which bases its forecast on 30-day Fed Funds futures prices. There's a slimmer 10% likelihood that the Fed could usher in a jumbo cut of 0.5 percentage points, its data shows.",
      "A rate cut could help some consumers by lowering their borrowing costs, with interest fees on credit cards, home equity lines of credit and other loans likely to drop after a reduction.

    "summary": "A new lawsuit filed by fired FBI agents says the bureau \"tried to put the President in jail and he hasn't forgotten it.\"",
    "story": [
      "Three senior FBI officials who were abruptly fired last month by Kash Patel, the FBI director, are claiming in a new lawsuit against the Trump administration that they were illegally terminated at the direction of the White House for purely political reasons.",
      "The complaint, filed in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., Wednesday, alleges Patel told one of the agents that his job as FBI director depended on firing agents involved in past investigations of President Trump.",
      "Patel allegedly said \"he had to fire the people his superiors told him to fire, because his ability to keep his own job depended on the removal of the agents who worked on cases involving the President,\" the lawsuit alleges.",
      "\"Patel explained that there was nothing [anyone] could do to stop these or any other firings, because 'the FBI tried to put the President in jail and he hasn't forgotten it,'\" the complaint claims. According to the complaint, Driscoll indicated he believed Patel was referring to his superiors at the White House and the Justice Department which \"Patel did not deny.\"",
      "The three fired agents who brought the case were decorated veterans of the agency who had served in senior roles. One of them, Brian Driscoll, had briefly been acting FBI director while Patel was going through the Senate confirmation process. Steven Jensen served as assistant director in charge of the Washington, D.C., field office. Spencer Evans had once led the Las Vegas field office, but by the time he was fired he had been removed from that position and was being relocated to the Huntsville, Alabama, office.",
      "The three agents, as well as two others who are not part of the lawsuit, were abruptly fired in an early August leadership purge without public comment and little explanation. None of them had reached retirement age, depriving them of their full pensions.",
      "The firings were the latest in a broad FBI makeover that began almost immediately after the transition, as the new administration sought to\u00a0 dominate an agency Mr. Trump claimed had been targeted against him.",
      "Patel defended the moves against the senior agents in an interview with Larry Kudlow on the Fox Business Network, saying the firings were aimed at \"ridding this place of its former leadership structure that did that weaponization.\"",
      "The FBI declined to comment.",
      "The Justice Department and White House have not responded to a request for comment.",
      "Driscoll said of the lawsuit in a statement, \"I hope this effort results in protecting others who did no harm and committed no misconduct from wrongful consequences. The American people deserve an FBI made up of professionals who can serve righteously and confidently, with no fear of inappropriately applied pressure or wrongful termination.\"",
      "In his statement, Evans said the public's confidence in the FBI \"hinges on the commitment of every FBI employee, from the newest Special Agent to the Director, to relentlessly adhere to the rule of law without fear or favor.\"",
      "\"Americans should demand FBI leaders who make decisions based solely on the facts of an investigation and never on the desired outcome of one,\" Evans wrote.",
      "Jensen said in his statement that he joined the lawsuit \"to champion the values of truth and justice for those who continue to serve in the FBI.\"",
      "In filing the suit, Jensen said, \"we aim to re-establish the highest standards of justice and ensure that every American, particularly those entrusted with the immense authority of federal law enforcement, respects and obeys the law.\"",
      "Abbe David Lowell, who is representing them, said the Trump administration's termination of them was illegal.",
      "\"As the complaint makes clear, the leadership of the FBI is carrying out political orders to punish law enforcement agents for doing their jobs \u2013 it's illegal and it's putting the national security of our country at risk,\" he said. The three agents filed the case to try to vindicate their constitutional rights.",
      "The lawsuit specifically alleges that the FBI was pressured by White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, who wanted \"to see personnel action, like reassignment, removals and terminations at the FBI, similar to the firings and reassignments of senior attorneys at DOJ that had occurred since January 20, 2025.\"",
      "One focus of the purge involved FBI employees who were part of the Jan. 6 investigations, according to the complaint. The suit alleges that Emil Bove, who at the time was a senior top Justice Department official, told Driscoll about \"pressure he was receiving from (Stephen) Miller to conduct summary firings of agents.\"",
      "Mr. Trump later appointed Bove to the U.S. Court of Appeals. Driscoll said that when he raised concerns these actions would rattle rank-and-file agents, Bove's response took him by surprise.",
      "\"Bove stated that the creation of panic and anxiety in the workforce 'was the intent,'\" the lawsuit alleges.",
      "Driscoll's firing, in particular, surprised many inside the FBI because he appeared to be in good standing with Patel. A highly decorated agent who took part in numerous daring counterterrorism operations, Patel had indicated he admired him as a swashbuckling tactical operator, CBS News previously reported.",
      "During his short stint as acting director, Driscoll resisted calls from a top Trump appointee at the Justice Department to turn over the names of FBI employees who participated in the Jan. 6 investigation, earning him near folk-hero status among line agents.",
      "Patel nevertheless kept him on after he was confirmed as FBI director, putting him in charge of the most important and sensitive positions in the bureau.",
      "But his trajectory at the FBI in the wake of Trump's election reflected the chaos and partisan politics that typified the presidential transition.",
      "According to the lawsuit, Trump transition team members reached out to Driscoll about assuming a senior leadership role in an acting capacity. He soon learned it was to be acting deputy FBI director. After agreeing to be vetted for the position, according to the complaint, Driscoll was questioned by a 29-year-old transition aide who asked him a series of questions that seemed to seek information about his political loyalties.",
      "Among the questions recounted by Driscoll in the lawsuit: \"Who did you vote for?\" \"Do you agree that the FBI agents who stormed Mar-a-Lago, to include the rank-and-file, should be held accountable?\" \"What are your thoughts on DEI?\" And, \"Have you voted for a Democrat in the last five elections?\"",
      "Driscoll defended the actions of the agents in the Mar-a-Lago search \"for doing their job\" and said he \"strongly believes in diversity and a diverse workforce.\" He refused to answer the other questions, according to the lawsuit.",
      "Jensen also appeared to have Patel's backing before he was fired. A veteran agent who helped oversee the January 6 investigation from his position as chief of the FBI's domestic terrorism section, Jensen was given a significant promotion by Patel, who appointed him assistant director in charge of the Washington Field Office, which the complaint identifies as one of the largest field offices in the country.",
      "The promotion had inflamed a noisy portion of Trump's MAGA base because of his supervisory role in the Jan. 6 case. They torched him and the decision on social media, but Patel continued to praise Jensen in meetings and even presented him with a director's \"challenge coin,\" a token of appreciation that leaders in the military and law enforcement often bestow on their subordinates.",

    "summary": "This year has been quieter than expected for tropical systems in the Atlantic, making some wonder: Where are all the hurricanes?",
    "story": [
      "The summer and fall months often see menacing storms roaring through the Atlantic Ocean \u2014 with the Atlantic hurricane season starting on June 1 and continuing through Nov. 30. Historically, on average, hurricane and tropical storm activity peaks on Sept. 10.",
      "But this year has been quieter than expected when it comes to tropical systems in the Atlantic, making some wonder: Where are all the hurricanes?",
      "Looking at the Atlantic Ocean Basin, most tropical waves that eventually strengthen into tropical systems come off of the coast of Africa and travel across the warm ocean waters. But this year,\u00a0Saharan dust has continued to move over the open waters, preventing the thunderstorm development that is needed to form a tropical cyclone.",
      "Dust from Africa typically moves across the Atlantic every year, usually peaking from late June to the middle of August. However, high pressure in place over the North-Central Atlantic is allowing for fewer storms to develop in Northern Africa which creates the perfect conditions for dry dust to move through.",
      "The planet is also in a cycle of what is known as \"ENSO Neutral,\" which means that neither El Nino nor La Nina are present. During El Nino, the winds near the equator weaken which allows warmer water to be pushed eastward. La Nina has the opposite effect of El Nino. During La Nina events, winds around the equator are stronger than usual, bringing colder water eastward.",
      "When La Nina is present, fewer Eastern Pacific hurricanes occur and more Atlantic hurricanes form, and vice versa for El Nino periods. Since neither is currently present, we do not have a typical hurricane season.",
      "According to the World Meteorological Organization, we are forecast to transition back into La Nina in the coming fall and winter months, and the current lack of hurricane activity signals the start of the transition period.",
      "Hurricane season far from over",
      "The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA, updated its forecast for the season back in August from its original analysis in May, predicting slightly fewer named storms. But it maintains that the Atlantic will see an above-average season.",
      "Hurricane season is still far from over. As of Sept. 10, 60% of it is remaining.",
      "NOAA predicts the Atlantic will see between 13 and 18 named storms this season, with as many as nine strengthening into hurricanes and as many as five growing into Category 5 storms, which are the strongest.",
      "So far this year, six named tropical systems have developed in the Atlantic \u2014 Andrea, Barry, Chantal, Dexter, Erin and Fernand. Erin was the only one that made it to hurricane strength. In the U.S., only one system made landfall this season \u2014 the remnants of Chantal.",
      "By this time last year, the same number of storms that we've seen this year \u2014 six \u2014 had formed. But three of them made landfall in the U.S.: Beryl, Debby and Francine.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Republicans and Democrats in Congress are still far apart on how to avert a government shutdown just three weeks before funding runs out.",
      "The top appropriators in Congress have been meeting this week to discuss a path forward. And Democratic leaders in the House and Senate are expected to meet Wednesday on the issue. But Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, told reporters Wednesday that \"what the Republicans have proposed is not good enough to meet the needs of the American people and not good enough to get our votes.\"",
      "The White House has requested that Congress pass a short-term funding deal to keep the government open through January, while leaders in Congress have generally favored a shorter-term stopgap measure to allow for work to continue on full-year funding bills.",
      "Rep. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, the top Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, said the White House sent a request Tuesday \"to kick the can down the road on government funding until January 31.\" She argued the tactic would allow the Trump administration to hold back funds approved by Congress.",
      "\"Delaying the critical work of funding the government until the end of January is only step one in President Trump and Russ Vought's plan to never fund it at all,\" DeLauro said.",
      "In August, the White House notified Congress that it would attempt to override its funding power by rescinding nearly $5 billion in foreign aid using a rare tactic known as a \"pocket recession.\" Since the request came within 45 days of the end of the fiscal year, the White House argued that it could treat the funding as expired come October.",
      "The move angered Democrats and some Republicans, adding another snag to shutdown negotiations.",
      "House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, a Louisiana Republican, told reporters Tuesday that the date proposed by the White House isn't set in stone.",
      "\"The White House put a marker out there. Nobody's married to a particular date,\" Scalise said, adding that congressional appropriators \"will be a part of that discussion with the White House on the date.\"",
      "Scalise said the House floor's schedule is flexible enough to be able to move on a continuing resolution as soon as an agreement is reached.",
      "\"I hope they get a bipartisan agreement. And that's the goal of [House Appropriations Committee] Chairman Cole and the White House, is to get an agreement with everybody,\" Scalise said. \"That's where the talks are right now.\"",
      "But Scalise said there's no agreement on a health care subsidies extension, which Democrats have been eyeing as a possible requirement for their support.",
      "Tax credits for Americans who purchase health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace are set to lapse at the end of year and could send premiums soaring.",
      "Schumer pointed to the expiration of the tax credits earlier Wednesday, saying \"this would be a nightmare scenario for the American people.\" But he said Senate Majority Leader John Thune has indicated that \"Republicans will walk away from the table and sit on their hands.\"",
      "Thune, a South Dakota Republican, has said that he prefers as \"clean\" a bill as possible to potentially secure bipartisan support and continue work on full-year funding measures. He told reporters earlier this week that it's his expectation that the House, where the bill will likely originate, \"would have it fairly clean,\" minimizing anomalies.",
      "\"If you want to make it about trying to get an extension so we actually have time to try and run a normal appropriations process and get some of the bills passed under regular order, then I think you want to have it as clean as possible,\" Thune said. \"And I think it's in everybody's interest to do that.\"",
      "Still, the White House has pursued anomalies, seeking to fund certain programs at higher levels under a stopgap measure.",
      "Meanwhile, the House is voting Wednesday on whether to go to conference on a Senate-passed package of appropriations bills, which includes the military construction and veterans affairs bill, agriculture bill and legislative branch appropriations bill.",
      "Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, the top Democratic appropriator in the Senate, said Tuesday that she and her fellow appropriators had a \"'very productive conversation\" earlier this week about conferencing the first three bills, along with passing a bipartisan short-term continuing resolution to give them time to continue work on full-year spending bills. But she urged that Democrats need to hear from GOP leaders about their commitment to a bipartisan stopgap measure to \"move this ball forward.\"",
      "\"Let's remember, Republicans control the House, the Senate and the White House. They are quite literally in the driver's seat. And if Republican leadership, for whatever reason, decides to let the car go off the cliff, we know who will be held responsible.\"",
      "But House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, put the onus on Democrats earlier Tuesday, saying \"Democrats may take the path of maximum resistance and shut the government down.\"",
      "\"The ultimate question of whether there's going to be a government shutdown at the end of the month is going to be up to congressional Democrats and that's just the way it is,\" Johnson said.",
      "Asked Wednesday whether House Democrats would support a clean continuing resolution, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries cited the continuing resolution passed in March despite House Democrats' objections, saying \"a continuing resolution that continues the failed policies of the Republican party that we voted against is not the type of policy that actually meets the needs of the American people.\"",
      "\"I believe that all of us are ready to continue the fight,\" Jeffries, a New York Democrat, said of Democrats in Congress.",
      "That fight has taken on particular importance for Senate Democrats, after Schumer came under intense scrutiny from his own party earlier this year. After pledging to fight the GOP funding plan in March, which increased defense spending while decreasing non-defense spending below 2024 levels, Schumer changed course at the eleventh hour, ultimately opting to deliver one of the Democratic votes necessary to propel the partisan measure to passage and prevent a shutdown. Despite intense criticism from some within his own party, Schumer argued at the time that a shutdown risked more damage.",
      "Schumer said Wednesday, with a new funding deadline fast approaching, that if Republicans \"think Democrats are going to show up at the last minute to bail them out with the clock approaching zero, that would be a big mistake on their part.\"",
      "\"Democrats don't want to see a Republican shutdown,\" Schumer added. \"What we want is a bipartisan negotiation, bipartisan bill, where Democrats have input to tangibly under the carnage Donald Trump has done to America.\"",

      "Harris, who suddenly became the presumptive Democratic nominee for president in July 2024 when Biden dropped out of the race with 107 days until Election Day, criticized the \"recklessness\" of leaving that decision to the former president and first lady alone.",
      "\"'It's Joe and Jill's decision.' We all said that, like a mantra, as if we'd all been hypnotized,\" Harris writes, according to The Atlantic. \"Was it grace, or was it recklessness? In retrospect, I think it was recklessness. The stakes were simply too high. This wasn't a choice that should have been left to an individual's ego, an individual's ambition. It should have been more than a personal decision.\"",
      "Harris contemplated that \"perhaps\" she should have told the president to consider not running again, but said that of all the people in the White House, I was in the worst position to make the case that he should drop out,\" according to The Atlantic excerpts.

      "Washington \u2014 The federal government's 30-day takeover of the Metropolitan Police Department in Washington, D.C., expires Wednesday, although the D.C. National Guard will remain posted throughout the district.",
      "Congress has not moved to renew the Trump administration's 30-day takeover of the district's police force, something that would be necessary for an extension beyond the original public safety emergency Mr. Trump signed, and the president hasn't been publicly pushing for it. The D.C. National Guard, which is ultimately under Mr. Trump's control, will remain in the city until Nov. 30.",
      "Senate Democrats had vowed to block any extension of the public safety emergency order, but Politico reported House Speaker Mike Johnson said D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser's statement that she will coordinate with federal law enforcement indefinitely \"resolved some\" of the issues with policing the city.",
      "D.C. residents and tourists are likely to see little difference on the streets of the city, with D.C. police, the National Guard and federal law enforcement officers continuing to patrol the streets.",
      "The president declared the D.C. police force under \"direct federal control\" on Aug. 11, citing his ability to do so for 30 days under Section 740 of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act of 1973. D.C. has more than 3,000 sworn officers, fewer than what Bowser and the police union say it needs.",
      "D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb sued the Trump administration over the deployment of the National Guard on the streets, saying the president \"has run roughshod over a fundamental tenet of American democracy \u2014 that the military should not be involved in domestic law enforcement.\"",
      "But the White House points to lower crime rates since the federal takeover of the city's policing, and the introduction of the National Guard. In the first three weeks the president deployed federal troops and law enforcement agents throughout Washington, D.C., a CBS News analysis of crime data found violent crime was down in Washington by almost half when compared to the same 19 days in 2024.",

      "Chagas disease, a potentially deadly condition caused by an infected triatomine insect or \"kissing bug,\" may be becoming endemic in the United States, according to a\u00a0new report\u00a0published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "In the report, which was originally published last month for the September issue of the CDC journal Emerging Infectious Diseases, the authors said the disease is already endemic to 21 countries in the Americas, and growing evidence of the parasite is challenging the non-endemic label in the U.S.",
      "\"Autochthonous (or, locally acquired) human cases have been reported in 8 states, most notably in Texas. Labeling the United States as non-Chagas disease-endemic perpetuates low awareness and underreporting,\" the report noted, adding the insect has been reported in 32 states.",
      "Other states with human cases include California, Arizona, Tennessee, Louisiana, Missouri, Mississippi and Arkansas.",
      "The report notes that data is \"inadequate\" to prove that the insects are increasing in geographic distribution or abundance. But it also says that the bugs are \"increasingly recognized\" because of frequent encounters with humans and due to more research attention.",
      "\"Invasion into homes, human bites, subsequent allergic reactions or exposure to T. cruzi parasites, and increasing frequency of canine diagnoses have led to growing public awareness,\" it says.",
      "What causes Chagas disease?",
      "The condition is caused by Trypanosoma cruzi parasites found in triatomine or \"kissing bugs,\" which can pass the disease to other animals and humans.",
      "According to UCLA Health, the insect's nickname comes from the bug often biting people on the face.",
      "According to the CDC, about 8 million people globally and 280,000 in the United States have the disease, often without knowing it.",
      "\"People might scratch or rub bug feces into a bite wound, their eyes, or mouth without realizing it, which allows the parasite to enter their body,\" the CDC says. The agency explains that bugs pass the parasite in their droppings after biting a person or animal. \"If these droppings get into someone's body through a cut in the skin, or near the eyes or mouth, it can lead to infection.\"",

      "\"Last night the Polish airspace was violated by a huge number of Russian drones,\" Prime Minister Donald\u00a0Tusk said in a social media post. \"Those drones that posed  a direct threat were shot down. I am in constant communication with the Secretary General of NATO and our allies.\"",
      "Poland's military said it scrambled aircraft to shoot down \"hostile objects\" in Polish airspace, a first for a NATO country during the war. The military, in\u00a0a post on X, called it \"an unprecedented violation of Polish airspace by drone-type objects\" and an \"act of aggression that posed a real threat to the safety of our citizens.\"",
      "The European Union's top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, said early indications suggested the Russian drone incursion into Poland's airspace was intentional.",
      "\"Last night in Poland we saw the most serious European airspace violation by Russia since the war began, and indications suggest it was intentional, not accidental,\" Kallas said in a statement. \"The EU stands in full solidarity with Poland. Russia's war is escalating, not ending. We must raise the cost to Moscow, strengthen support for Ukraine, and invest in Europe's defense.\"",
      "Russia's Ministry of Defense said its drones had not targeted Poland, but Moscow's close ally, Belarus, said it tracked some drones that \"lost their course\" after being jammed, according to The Associated Press. Polish officials have said some of the drones were launched from Belarus, which Russian forces have used as a base for both ground and aerial attacks on Ukraine throughout the war.",
      "In a statement posted on social media, a NATO spokesperson said fighter jets from the Netherlands were deployed and helped to shoot down the drones, confirming it was \"the first time NATO aircrafts have engaged potential threats in Allied airspace.\"",
      "In addition to the direct response by Polish and Dutch fighter jets, German Patriot missiles based in Poland \"were placed on alert,\" and an Italian airborne early warning aircraft and a NATO refueler aircraft were also launched, according to the statement from NATO spokesperson, Col. Martin L. O'Donnell.",
      "\"NATO responded quickly and decisively to the situation, demonstrating our capability and resolve to defend Allied territory,\" Gen. Alexus G. Grynkewich, NATO's commander for Europe, said in a statement shared with CBS News.",
      "\"My thanks and congratulations to the Polish Operational Command and our NATO pilots for shooting down Russian drones over Poland,\" Poland's Prime Minister\u00a0Tusk said in a later social media post. \"Actions speak louder than words.\"",
      "\"We stand by our NATO Allies in the face of these airspace violations and will defend every inch of NATO territory,\" U.S. Ambassador to NATO Matthew Whitaker said Wednesday in a social media post, in the first reaction from a senior American official to the Russian incursion into Poland's airspace.",
      "A White House official later told CBS News that President Trump was tracking the reports out of Poland, and there were plans for him to speak with the country's newly-elected President Karol Nawrocki later in the day. Mr. Trump then issued his own brief reaction to the incident, saying on his Truth Social platform: \"What's with Russia violating Poland's airspace with drones? Here we go!\"",
      "Apparent Russian drones and missiles have entered the airspace of NATO members previously, including Poland's, several times during\u00a0Russia's three-and-a-half-year war, but no NATO country had ever tried to shoot them down.",
      "A cornerstone of the Western NATO military alliance is the principle that an attack on any member is considered an attack on all. A NATO source told the Reuters news agency that the alliance wasn't treating the Russian drone incursion into Polish territory as an attack, but that it did appear to have been deliberate.",
      "Tusk told Poland's parliament that authorities had identified 19 violations of the country's airspace overnight and shot down at least three drones, adding that no one was harmed in the \"Russian action.\"",
      "Tusk said Poland had made a \"formal request to invoke Article 4\" of the NATO alliance's founding treaty. Under Article 4, any member can call urgent talks when it feels its \"territorial integrity, political independence or security\" are at risk.",
      "The Polish case marked the eighth time the article has been invoked since the alliance was founded in 1949, and the third time Article 4 has been invoked to address Russia's incursions into and invasion of Ukraine.",
      "NATO's collective security is based on its Article 5 principle, which states that if one member is attacked, the entire alliance will come to its defense. That article has only been invoked once in the history of NATO, by the United States, following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.",
      "Poland's military said efforts were \"underway to search for and locate the possible crash sites of these objects\" and \"the Operational Command of the Polish Armed Forces is monitoring the current situation, and Polish and allied forces and assets remain fully prepared for further actions.\"",
      "Polish police said officers had discovered a damaged drone in the eastern Polish village of Czosnowka, according to Reuters, and there were reports that a building was damaged by a falling drone or debris in another eastern Polish town, but there were no reports of any injuries.",
      "Hours later, Poland's military said on X that the operations had concluded but the search for downed drones was continuing. \"We urge that in the event of observing an unknown object or its debris, do not approach, touch, or move it. Such elements may pose a threat and contain hazardous materials. They must be thoroughly inspected by the appropriate services,\" the military cautioned.",
      "The Polish government announced it would hold an \"extraordinary\" meeting Wednesday morning.",
      "The incursion came as Russia unleashed a barrage of strikes across Ukraine, including in the western city of Lviv, around 50 miles from the Polish border.",
      "Warnings of further Russian aggression",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Wednesday that eight Russian drones were \"aimed toward\" Poland in an overnight barrage that forced Warsaw to scramble air defenses. \"It was not just one Shahed that could be called an accident, but at least eight strike drones aimed toward Poland,\" Zelensky said, referring to Iranian-designed drones deployed by Moscow, adding that the incident represented \"An extremely dangerous precedent for Europe.\"",
      "Ukraine's foreign minister, Andriy Sybiga,\u00a0warned on X that Russian President Vladimir Putin \"just keeps escalating, expanding his war, and testing the West. The longer he faces no strength in response, the more aggressive he gets. A weak response now will provoke Russia even more - and then Russian missiles and drones will fly even further into Europe.\"",
      "Poland's President Nawrocki issued a warning along the same lines Tuesday, saying at a news conference in Helsinki that, \"We do not trust Vladimir Putin's good intentions. We believe that Vladimir Putin is ready to also invade other countries.\"",
      "European Union chief Ursula said Moscow had carried out a \"reckless and unprecedented\" violation of Polish airspace.",
      "And the EU's top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, posted on X Wednesday that \"we saw the most serious European airspace violation by Russia since the war began, and indications suggest it was intentional, not accidental. The EU stands in full solidarity with Poland. Russia's war is escalating, not ending.\"",
      "NATO-member Poland, a major supporter of Ukraine, hosts over a million Ukrainian refugees and is a key transit point for Western humanitarian and military aid to the war-torn country.",
      "Last month, Warsaw said a Russian military drone flew into its airspace and exploded in farmland in eastern Poland and depicted the incident as a \"provocation.\" In 2023, Poland said a Russian missile had crossed into its airspace to strike Ukraine.

    "summary": "This year has been quieter than expected for tropical systems in the Atlantic, making some wonder: Where are all the hurricanes?",
    "story": [
      "The summer and fall months often see menacing storms roaring through the Atlantic Ocean \u2014 with the Atlantic hurricane season starting on June 1 and continuing through Nov. 30. Historically, on average, hurricane and tropical storm activity peaks on Sept. 10.",
      "But this year has been quieter than expected when it comes to tropical systems in the Atlantic, making some wonder: Where are all the hurricanes?",
      "Looking at the Atlantic Ocean Basin, most tropical waves that eventually strengthen into tropical systems come off of the coast of Africa and travel across the warm ocean waters. But this year,\u00a0Saharan dust has continued to move over the open waters, preventing the thunderstorm development that is needed to form a tropical cyclone.",
      "Dust from Africa typically moves across the Atlantic every year, usually peaking from late June to the middle of August. However, high pressure in place over the North-Central Atlantic is allowing for fewer storms to develop in Northern Africa which creates the perfect conditions for dry dust to move through.",
      "The planet is also in a cycle of what is known as \"ENSO Neutral,\" which means that neither El Nino nor La Nina are present. During El Nino, the winds near the equator weaken which allows warmer water to be pushed eastward. La Nina has the opposite effect of El Nino. During La Nina events, winds around the equator are stronger than usual, bringing colder water eastward.",
      "When La Nina is present, fewer Eastern Pacific hurricanes occur and more Atlantic hurricanes form, and vice versa for El Nino periods. Since neither is currently present, we do not have a typical hurricane season.",
      "According to the World Meteorological Organization, we are forecast to transition back into La Nina in the coming fall and winter months, and the current lack of hurricane activity signals the start of the transition period.",
      "Hurricane season far from over",
      "The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA, updated its forecast for the season back in August from its original analysis in May, predicting slightly fewer named storms. But it maintains that the Atlantic will see an above-average season.",
      "Hurricane season is still far from over. As of Sept. 10, 60% of it is remaining.",
      "NOAA predicts the Atlantic will see between 13 and 18 named storms this season, with as many as nine strengthening into hurricanes and as many as five growing into Category 5 storms, which are the strongest.",
      "So far this year, six named tropical systems have developed in the Atlantic \u2014 Andrea, Barry, Chantal, Dexter, Erin and Fernand. Erin was the only one that made it to hurricane strength. In the U.S., only one system made landfall this season \u2014 the remnants of Chantal.",
      "By this time last year, the same number of storms that we've seen this year \u2014 six \u2014 had formed. But three of them made landfall in the U.S.: Beryl, Debby and Francine.",
      "After last year's Sept. 10 statistical peak, other major hurricanes developed: Helene and Milton, later in the season. Milton made landfall in the U.S. and devastated parts of the Southeast.",

      "Choi Mal-ja was 19 in 1964 when she was attacked by a 21-year-old man in the southern town of Gimhae. He pinned her to the ground and repeatedly forced his tongue into her mouth, at one point blocking her nose to stop her from breathing, according to court records.",
      "Choi managed to break free by biting off about half of an inch of his tongue.",
      "In one of South Korea's most contentious rulings on sexual violence, the aggressor received only six months in prison, suspended for two years, for trespassing and intimidation \u2014 but not attempted rape.",
      "But Choi, now 79, was convicted of causing grievous bodily harm and handed a 10-month prison sentence, suspended for two years.",
      "That decision was overturned Wednesday by the Busan District Court, which ruled that her actions \"constitute justifiable self-defense\" under South Korean law.",
      "Choi's actions at the time are now \"deemed an attempt to escape an unjust infringement on her bodily integrity and sexual self-determination,\" the court said in a statement sent to AFP.",
      "The ruling overturns Choi's 1965 conviction, when the court found her actions had \"exceeded the reasonable bounds of legally permissible self-defense.\"",
      "Wearing a bright pink blazer, Choi beamed as supporters handed her multiple bouquets after the ruling. Women's rights activists and her supporters celebrated, many visibly emotional, waving a placard that read, \"Choi Mal-ja did it!\"",
      "\"Sixty-one years ago, in a situation where I could understand nothing, the victim became the perpetrator, and my fate was sealed as a criminal,\" Choi said at a news conference following the ruling. \"For the victims who shared the same fate as mine, I wanted to be a source of hope for them.\"",
      "Choi's appeal gained momentum after the #MeToo movement, \u00a0which took off in South Korea and fueled massive women's rights protests\u00a0and led to victories on issues ranging from abortion access to tougher penalties for\u00a0spycam crimes, and a\u00a0reckoning for the international K-pop music industry.",
      "Choi filed for a retrial in 2020, but lower courts initially rejected her petition. After years of campaigning and an appeal, South Korea's top court finally ordered a retrial in 2024.",

    "story": [
      "Oslo\u00a0\u2014 Three 1,200-year-old Viking ships that have stood the test of time are embarking on their final and possibly riskiest journey to their new forever home in Norway. The first to make the move is the Oseberg, which will slowly inch its way from its current location in the old Viking Ship Museum to a newly built addition that will house the national treasures in optimal conditions.",
      "The extremely fragile oak hull, encased in a heavy protective steel rig, began making the roughly hundred-yard journey on Tuesday. It was expected to take over 10 hours, with the ship lifted by a crane and moved along a track on the ceiling.",
      "\"There is something deeply moving when you think that these ships \u2014 with their long history and all the voyages they have undertaken \u2014   will embark on their final journey,\" museum director Aud Tonnessen said.",
      "In a post on its Facebook page Wednesday, the museum said the team moving the vessels \"actually got a head start yesterday and covered the first 20 meters. It went perfectly according to plan.\"",
      "The museum shared a time-lapse video of the hulking Oseberg slowly moving, suspended in the air on an overhead rail system and encased in its sturdy steel frame for the journey.",
      "Named after the places where they were discovered, the Oseberg, Gokstad and Tune \u2014   all believed to have been built between 840 and 910 \u2014   have been housed in a cross-shaped building considered too small and unsuitable to conserve them properly.",
      "\"They've been subjected to humidity, vibrations... Over time, the strain became so intense that they started showing signs that they would eventually collapse onto their supports,\" Tonnessen said.",
      "A decision was therefore taken to move them to a new climate-controlled facility, built as an extension to the old museum, which should make it possible to maintain the ships in their current condition for at least another century.",
      "The relocation process is perilous.",
      "\"We have to complete this operation without causing any further damage to the ships, but we know that each handling is harmful to them,\" said curator David Hauer, who has been planning the project for years.",
      "\"These are clinker hulls (featuring partially overlapping planks) that are 1,200 years old. At the slightest deformation, they split between the rivets, the wood cracks,\" Hauer explained.",
      "Endless precautions have been taken to prevent any breakage or vibrations during the relocation. The ship will be moved extremely slowly, at a pace of 5.5 minutes per yard.",
      "Among other things, an oil services company experienced in high-precision work \u2014  such as positioning massive structures nearly 1,000 feet below the sea with extreme accuracy \u2014 has been called in.",
      "\"But this is yet another level,\" Hauer said.",
      "\"The level of precision required, for example when it comes to vibrations, is the same as for electron microscopes in hospitals\" which require extreme stability, he said.",
      "\"Except here, it involves lifting the electron microscope, moving it, and then setting it back down so you can use it again,\" he said.",
      "If everything goes as planned, the Gokstad is scheduled to be relocated next during the autumn, and then finally the Tune in the summer of 2026.",
      "All three ships were found in separate burial sites southwest and southeast of Oslo between 1867 and 1904, each one very distinct from the other.",
      "Richly decorated with ornate carvings, the Oseberg is considered the best preserved Viking ship in the world.",
      "Gokstad is meanwhile the largest of the three, measuring 75 feet long and 16 feet wide, with space for 32 rowers.",
      "Tune is much more decomposed than the other two and is believed to have been a particularly fast warship.",
      "While Norway and its Scandinavian neighbors are often most associated with Viking-era archaeological finds, human history in the region far outdates the legendary masters of the sea.",
      "In Denmark, coastal settlements that were engulfed by rising seas more than 8,500 years ago were charted by divers this summer. Now lying about 26 feet below the waves, close to Denmark's second-biggest city Aarhus, there is evidence of a Stone Age settlement on the seabed.",

      "The company said it will cut about 5,000 jobs in Denmark, although it didn't disclose where the remaining 4,000 reductions will be located. \u00a0Novo Nordisk also makes Ozempic, a diabetes drug that also can result in weight loss.",
      "The streamlining would save $1.25 billion by the end of 2026, savings that are to be redirected to diabetes and obesity, including research and development, the company said.

      "\"Our markets are evolving, particularly in obesity, as it has become more competitive and consumer-driven,\" said President and CEO Mike Doustdar in the statement. \"Our company must evolve as well. This means instilling an increased performance-based culture, deploying our resources ever more effectively, and prioritizing investment where it will have the most impact \u2014 behind our leading therapy areas.\"",

      "Qatar's government quickly issued condemnation of what it called a \"cowardly Israeli strike,\" which it said had violated international law.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces did not confirm the location of the strikes in its statement, but said it targeted leaders of Hamas who, in the IDF's words, had for years \"led the terrorist organization's operations, are directly responsible for the brutal October 7 massacre, and have been orchestrating and managing the war against the State of Israel.\"",
      "The IDF subsequently confirmed to CBS News that its original statement referred to an operation carried out Tuesday in Doha, which it said was called \"Summit of Fire.\"",
      "The Al-Jazeera television network said an ongoing meeting of Hamas leaders in Doha was struck, as they gathered to discuss a recent U.S. ceasefire proposal to end the war in the Gaza Strip.",
      "Hamas condemned the strike, calling it \"a heinous crime, a blatant aggression, and a flagrant violation of all international norms and laws.\"",

      "\"Targeting the negotiating delegation, at a moment when it was discussing the latest proposal of American President Donald Trump, unequivocally confirms that Netanyahu and his government do not wish to reach any agreement,\" Hamas said in the statement. \"We hold the American administration jointly responsible with the occupation for this crime, due to its continuous support for the aggression and the occupation's crimes against our people.\"",
      "Witnesses told the Reuters news agency that plumes of black smoke were seen billowing from a gas station, next to which there is a small, residential compound that they said has been under 24-hour guard since the start of the war in Gaza.",
      "\"Prior to the strike, measures were taken in order to mitigate harm to civilians, including the use of precise munitions and additional intelligence,\" the IDF said.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office released a statement Tuesday saying the \"action against the top terrorist chieftains of Hamas was a wholly independent Israeli operation. Israel initiated it, Israel conducted it, and Israel takes full responsibility.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the Trump administration was notified by the U.S. military of the strikes. A senior U.S. official and a diplomatic source familiar with the strikes told CBS News that Israel notified the U.S. of the attack as it was about to happen. Two other U.S. officials told CBS News the U.S. did not coordinate with Israel on planning the strikes.",

      "\"The Prime Minister and the Defense Minister believed that the action was completely justified in light of the fact that this Hamas leadership was the one who initiated and organized the October 7 massacre, and has not stopped launching murderous actions against the State of Israel and its citizens since then,\" the joint statement said.",

      "Qatar is a close ally of the United States and also hosts the largest U.S. military base in the Middle East, Al-Udeid Air Base. It has also been one of the mediators, alongside the U.S. and Egypt, of the ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas.",

    "summary": "French President Macron has appointed Defense Minister S\u00e9bastien Lecornu as France's new prime minister, the country's fourth in about a year.",
    "story": [
      "French President Macron late Tuesday appointed Defense Minister S\u00e9bastien Lecornu as France's new prime minister and tasked him with immediately trying to get the country's fractious political parties to agree on a budget for one of the world's biggest economies.",
      "Lecornu, 39, was the youngest defense minister in French history and was overseeing a major military buildup spurred by Russia's war in Ukraine. A longtime Macron loyalist, Lecornu is now France's fourth prime minister in barely a year.",
      "A former conservative who joined Macron's centrist movement in 2017, Lecornu has held posts in local governments, overseas territories and during Macron's yellow vest \"great debate,\" when he helped manage a surge of anti-government protest with dialogue. He also offered talks on autonomy during unrest in the French overseas region of Guadeloupe in 2021.",
      "His rise reflects Macron's instinct to reward loyalty, but also the need for continuity as repeated budget showdowns have toppled his predecessors and left France in drift.",
      "Macron's quick decision to name Lecornu comes ahead of a day of mass disruption planned for Wednesday by a protest movement called \"Block Everything\" that has prompted the government to deploy an exceptional 80,000 police to keep order.",
      "Legislators toppled Lecornu's predecessor Francois Bayrou and his government in a confidence vote on Monday, a new crisis for Europe's second-largest economy.",
      "Bayrou gambled that lawmakers would back his view that France must slash public spending to rein in its huge debts. Instead, they seized on the vote to gang up against the 74-year-old centrist who was appointed by Macron last December.",
      "The demise of Bayrou's short-lived minority government heralds renewed uncertainty and a risk of prolonged legislative deadlock for France as it wrestles both with its internal budget difficulties and, internationally, wars in Ukraine and Gaza and the shifting priorities of U.S. President Trump.",
      "Drafting a budget will be a top priority for Lecornu, and normally a new prime minister would form the new government before negotiating the nation's finances in Parliament. However, Macron has asked Lecornu to first consult with all of the political parties in Parliament first to try to agree on a budget before assembling his team.",
      "\"The prime minister's action will be guided by the defense of our independence and our power, serving the French and the political and institutional stability for the unity of our country,\" Macron said in a statement.",
      "When the 2018 yellow vest movement against social injustice erupted, prompting months of sometimes violent demonstrations in the streets, Lecornu was chosen by Macron to lead the so-called \"great debate\" across the country aimed at appeasing tensions.",
      "A minister of overseas territories from 2020 to 2022, Lecornu faced rioting and strikes linked to the pandemic in Guadeloupe, located in the Caribbean, and offered to discuss greater autonomy for the territory from the French mainland.",
      "The 413 billion euros ($435 billion) defense spending package Lecornu championed for 2024-2030 represents the most significant spending hike in France in half a century. The money aimed to modernize France's nuclear arsenal, augment intelligence spending and develop more remote-controlled weapons.",

      "The blast killed at least 24 people and injured 19 others, the Ukraine Emergency Service said. A spokesman for the Ukrainian postal network, Ukrposhta, confirmed to AFP that one of its vehicles was damaged in the attack and its department head \u2014 identified as Yulia \u2014 had been hospitalized. Ukrposhta, which delivers public services in front-line regions, said it would change how it distributes pensions and basic services there.",
      "The Ukrainian military said Moscow had dropped a glide bomb. Such weapons are fixed with wings to help them glide over dozens of miles. They are part of an arsenal developed by Russia to hit deeper into Ukrainian territory and stretch the front line.",
      "Ukraine's prosecutor general said that it had launched a war crime investigation. Andrii Sybiha, Ukraine's foreign minister,\u00a0called the strike \"barbaric\" and a \"heinous crime.\"",
      "There was no immediate comment from Moscow or the Kremlin on the strike.",
      "Russia has been steadily advancing in the eastern Donetsk region for months, concentrating its firepower on the territory and deploying troops from other parts of the front line, Kyiv has said. Moscow has claimed the industrial region as part of Russia despite not having full control over it. Authorities in Donetsk have been appealing to civilians to flee the fighting since the early days of Russia's invasion in February 2022.",
      "Kyiv says the Kremlin has massed 100,000 troops at a key part of the front line for a fresh offensive. Yarova lies nearly five miles from the front line and had a pre-war population of around 1,900 people.",
      "Ukrainian commander-in-chief Oleksandr Syrsky said this week that Russian forces outnumbered Ukrainian troops threefold in some areas of the front, and by six times in regions where Moscow has concentrated its forces.",
      "Zelenskyy urged Ukraine's allies to issue a response to the attack, and said \"strong actions are needed to make Russia stop bringing death.\" Sybiha said Ukraine was contacting its allies to inform them of the strike.",
      "\"A response is needed from the United States. A response is needed from Europe. A response is needed from the G20,\" Zelenskyy said.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump says he has tried to find a way to end the war in recent weeks but has little to show for his efforts. He recently met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska, followed by a meeting with Zelenskyy and other European leaders\u00a0at the White House. Mr. Trump recently told CBS News that he is still committed to finding a peaceful solution to the conflict.",
      "\"I've been watching it, I've been seeing it, and I've been talking about it with President Putin and President Zelenskyy,\" Mr. Trump said in a phone interview. \"Something is going to happen, but they are not ready yet. But something is going to happen. We are going to get it done.\"",
      "The strike comes just days after a Russian missile crashed into the Ukrainian government headquarters in central Kyiv, the first time the complex had been hit in the three-and-a-half-year war. Tens of thousands have been killed and millions forced from their homes in Europe's bloodiest conflict since World War II.",

The move, which he said was aimed at bringing \"joy\" to the Venezuelan people, came on the heels of Maduro significantly increasing his planned troop deployment to the country's borders amid an escalating military standoff with the Trump administration, which accuses him of colluding with drug gangs to smuggle narcotics into the U.S.",
      "In 2024, Maduro brought Christmas celebrations forward during a crisis following a disputed presidential election, which opponents and the U.S. government accused Maduro of stealing. This year, Maduro said on his weekly TV program \"Con Maduro +\" that he wants to defend \"the right to happiness\" of Venezuelans, amid an escalating standoff with President Trump, whose administration has increased a bounty for his arrest or capture.",

      "Maduro doubles troop deployment to borders amid standoff with U.S.",
      "Maduro has sought to bolster his country's own military readiness in the face of the U.S. movements, including an announcement on Sunday that he was more than doubling the deployment of troops to secure Venezuela's long Caribbean coastline and its border with Colombia, stressing his determination to defend national sovereignty.",
      "The Venezuelan leader said in a message posted on social media that he would send 25,000 army troops to the borders, boosting a previously announced deployment of about 10,000 soldiers. He said the forces would be concentrated around major oil infrastructure and border regions.",
      "\"These 25,000 brave men and women of our glorious armed forces are deployed to defend our homeland, secure our borders, and preserve the peace that our people deserve,\" Maduro said.",

      "Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth, who now uses the title Secretary of War following Mr. Trump's decision to rebrand what had long been the U.S. Department of Defense, made surprise visits Monday to Puerto Rico and a U.S. Navy ship that is among the military assets deployed to the Caribbean to target drug cartels.",
      "Hegseth was accompanied by the top U.S. military officer Gen. Dan Caine, and the two of them were welcomed by Jenniffer Gonzalez-Colon, Puerto Rico's governor, who announced the visit in a post on X.",

      "The post, captioned \"A message to our warfighters from the Secretary of War,\" included a video that showed Hegseth addressing military personnel on the ship, edited with other images of him observing operations on the vessel, telling the troops they were working to \"end the poisoning of the American people\" with drugs.",

      "GLP-1s help insulin move the glucose (sugar) out of the bloodstream and into the body\u2019s cells, where it can be used for energy or stored, the doctor said. The drugs also help to prevent the inflammation and damage sugar can cause in the blood vessels, nerves and organs.",

      "\"We're figuring it out, and we're teaching the medical profession how to do it. The patients are telling us how to use these drugs.\"",
      "Potential risks",

      "Others have reported an increased risk of pancreatitis, muscle loss and thyroid tumors.",

      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "QR codes that were once seen as a convenient shortcut for checking menus or paying bills have increasingly been turned into weapons. Fake delivery texts, counterfeit payment links and malicious codes pasted over legitimate ones have all become part of the modern fraud playbook.",
      "The latest warning from federal authorities shows just how far these tactics have gone. Criminals are now mailing out packages that people never ordered. Inside these boxes is a QR code that, when scanned, can lead to stolen personal details, drained bank accounts or malware running silently in the background of a phone.",

      "QR CODE SCAMS RISE AS 73% OF AMERICANS SCAN WITHOUT CHECKING",
      "What you need to know about the QR code scam",
      "The scheme is a twist on what is known as a brushing scam. Traditionally, brushing scams involved online sellers sending products to strangers and then using the recipient's details to post fake reviews. It was more of a nuisance than a serious crime.",
      "An Amazon package with a QR code. (Lindsey Nicholson/UCG/Universal Images Group via Getty Images)",
      "Now the practice has shifted from harmless free items to deliberate fraud. Instead of receiving a product, many victims find only a printed QR code. Once scanned, the code redirects them to fraudulent websites that ask for sensitive personal information, such as banking information, credit card numbers or login credentials. Some codes go a step further and install malicious software designed to track activity and steal data directly from the device.",
      "\"The FBI warns the public about a scam variation in which criminals send unsolicited packages containing a QR code that prompts the recipient to provide personal and financial information or unwittingly download malicious software that steals data from their phone,\"\u00a0the agency said in a public notice.\u00a0\"To encourage the victim to scan the QR code, the criminals often ship the packages without sender information to entice the victim to scan the QR code.\"",
      "WHATSAPP BANS 6.8M SCAM ACCOUNTS, LAUNCHES SAFETY TOOL",
      "Why QR codes appeal to scammers",
      "QR codes have become common in everyday life. They are used in restaurants, stores, airports, on polls and payment systems and most people scan them without a second thought. Unlike suspicious links that can be spotted, a QR code reveals nothing until it is scanned.",
      "That makes it a perfect disguise for a scam. The setup is simple: a package arrives with no sender information and no explanation. The mystery sparks curiosity, and many people scan the code to figure out who sent it. That moment of curiosity is what the scammers rely on.",
      "Taylor Swift fans gather outside a building where a mural featuring a large QR code was being painted to promote Swift's latest album, \"The Tortured Poets Department,\" on April 17, 2024, in Chicago. (Scott Olson/Getty Images)",
      "The consequences can be serious. Fake websites may harvest names, addresses and financial details. Malware may silently monitor accounts, log keystrokes or even target cryptocurrency wallets. Victims often do not notice until they see unauthorized charges or suspicious withdrawals. By then, their information may already be in the hands of criminals.",

      "7 ways to stay safe from QR code scams",
      "Scammers rely on curiosity and convenience to trick people into scanning malicious QR codes. A few simple habits can help you avoid becoming a target. Here are seven ways to stay safe from QR code scams.",
      "Avoid scanning QR codes from mystery deliveries, random flyers or stickers on public signs. A QR code is just a disguised link, and until you know where it leads, it shouldn't be trusted. To stay safe even if you accidentally scan a risky code, keep strong antivirus software on your phone. Mobile security apps can block fraudulent sites, warn you before downloads and protect against malicious QR code attacks.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Only scan QR codes from businesses and organizations you already trust. Examples include your bank's mobile app, an airline boarding pass or a known retailer's checkout page. If you wouldn't click a random link in a text message, don't scan a random QR code either.",
      "Most phones let you press and hold a QR code link to preview where it goes. If the URL looks suspicious, with misspellings, random numbers or shortened links, don't open it. Taking a second to check can save you from a phishing trap.",
      "Scammers are sending fake packages with QR codes that trick recipients into scanning and giving criminals access to their personal data. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "The less personal data available about you online, the harder it is for scammers to target you with convincing fraud attempts. Consider using data removal services that scrub your information from people-search sites and marketing databases. This reduces the chances that your address or phone number ends up in the wrong hands and is connected to a scam package.",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.",
      "Check out my top picks for data removal services and get a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web by visiting Cyberguy.com.Get a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web:\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Even if your login details are stolen, 2FA\u00a0makes it harder for criminals to access your accounts. By requiring a secondary code sent to your phone or generated through an authenticator app, 2FA helps prevent unauthorized logins to your banking, email and trading accounts.",
      "Software updates often contain fixes for security vulnerabilities that scammers try to exploit. Running the latest version of your phone's operating system, as well as updating apps regularly, gives you stronger protection against malware that can be delivered through a malicious QR code.",
      "If an unexpected package arrives at your door with a QR code inside, do not simply throw it away. Report it to local authorities and consider filing a complaint with the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center. Reporting not only helps protect you, but it also gives law enforcement more information to track how these scams are spreading.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "This scam might not be everywhere yet, but it shows just how quickly criminals adapt to new technology. QR codes were meant to make life easier, and most of the time they do, but that same convenience can turn into a weakness when people let curiosity override caution. The lesson here is that a mystery package with a QR code is not some fun puzzle to figure out. It is a red flag. The safest move is to step back, resist the urge to scan and if something feels off, report it instead of interacting with it.",

      "What might feel harmless in the moment, like teasing someone, chatting about lunch plans or venting about a frustrating errand, can suddenly reappear in a recap email sent to the whole group. In some cases, even affectionate nicknames or pet mishaps have shown up right alongside serious action items.",

      "Casual catch-ups mixed into meeting notes",
      "Embarrassing slip-ups becoming part of official records",
      "These surprises can be funny in hindsight, but they highlight a bigger issue. AI notetakers don't separate casual conversation from work-related discussion. And once your words are written down, they can be saved, forwarded or even archived in ways you didn't intend. That means an offhand remark could live far longer than the meeting itself.",

      "A Google Gemini generative artificial intelligence webpage. (Andrey Rudakov/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "Why AI notetakers capture too much",
      "These tools work by recording conversations in real time and then generating automatic summaries. Zoom's AI Companion flags its presence with a diamond icon. Google Meet's version uses a pencil icon and an audio cue. Only meeting hosts can switch them on or off.",
      "That sounds transparent, but most people stop noticing the icons after a few minutes. Once the AI is running, it doesn't separate \"work talk\" from \"side chatter.\" The result? Your casual remarks can end up in a summary sent to colleagues or even clients.",
      "And mistakes happen. An AI notetaker might mishear a joke, twist sarcasm into something serious or drop a casual remark into notes where it looks out of place. Stripped of tone and context, those words can come across very differently once they're written down.",

      "If you're not the host, confirm that everyone is comfortable with AI note-taking. Setting expectations up front prevents awkward situations later.",
      "Check meeting notes before forwarding them. Edit or trim out personal chatter so only useful action items remain.",

      "2) Restart your router regularly to refresh the signal",
      "Sometimes, the quickest fix is simply restarting your router.",
      "Why it helps: Turning your router off for 30 seconds and back on helps clear out temporary issues and refreshes the connection. It's a simple fix that can solve slow Wi-Fi or connectivity problems.",
      "3) Keep your router updated for optimal performance",
      "Updating your router\u2019s software ensures you get the latest speed and security improvements.",
      "Why it helps: Router manufacturers often release updates that fix bugs and improve performance. Make sure your router\u2019s firmware is always up-to-date to get the most reliable connection.",

      "4) Limit the number of devices on your network",
      "Fewer devices connected to your Wi-Fi means more bandwidth for the devices that matter most.",
      "Why it helps: Each device connected to your network uses bandwidth. If multiple devices are hogging the connection (like smart TVs or game consoles), it can slow things down. Disconnect any unused devices to keep your Wi-Fi fast.",
      "From placing your router in the right spot to upgrading your hardware, these proven fixes can keep your internet running smoothly. (Wolf von Dewitz/picture alliance via Getty Images)",
      "5) Change your Wi-Fi channel or band",
      "If your neighbors are on the same Wi-Fi channel, switching to a less crowded one can help.",
      "Why it helps: Choosing a clearer channel or using the 5 GHz band instead of 2.4 GHz reduces interference and boosts your connection.",

      "Old routers can slow you down. Upgrading to a newer model can provide a significant speed boost.",
      "Why it helps: Newer routers support faster speeds and more devices, which is essential if your home has multiple users streaming, working or gaming at the same time. The FBI recently alerted that hackers are actively targeting outdated routers, so make sure yours is updated and secure.",

      "6 ways to protect your Wi-Fi router from hackers",
      "Keeping your home network secure is essential to prevent unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Follow these steps to safeguard your Wi-Fi router:",
      "Most routers come with default passwords that hackers can easily find online. To secure your router, change both the admin password (used to access settings) and the Wi-Fi network password. Use a strong password with at least 12 characters, combining uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers and symbols. Avoid simple options like \"password123\" or personal details such as your name or birth date.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "The default network name, or SSID, often includes the router's brand or model, making it easier for hackers to identify vulnerabilities. Rename your network to something unique that doesn't reveal personal information. Avoid using names, addresses or other identifiers. Instead, opt for a neutral or creative name that's easy for you to recognize but hard for others to associate with you.",
      "Router manufacturers release firmware updates to patch security flaws and enhance performance. Check your router's admin panel regularly for updates or enable automatic updates, if supported. Keeping your firmware up to date ensures you're protected against the latest threats. If your router is too old to receive updates, it might be time to upgrade to a newer, more secure model.",
      "Unauthorized devices on your network can slow it down and expose you to risks. Log into your router's admin settings to view all connected devices. If you see anything suspicious, disconnect it and immediately change your Wi-Fi password. You can also enable MAC address filtering to control which devices can access your network or disable features like WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup) that may leave you vulnerable.",
      "Use the strongest encryption protocol available for your router, preferably WPA3 or at least WPA2. Encryption scrambles the data transmitted over your network, making it much harder for hackers to intercept and decipher your information.",
      "Schedule routine reboots to clear the system memory and refresh all connections, which may disrupt potential malware.",
      "A VPN encrypts your internet traffic, making it much harder for hackers to intercept your data. This protection works anywhere, whether you're at home, in a coffee shop or on public Wi-Fi. Choose a reputable VPN provider with a no-logs policy and strong encryption standards to keep your information private.",
      "For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "To further protect your devices from malware and other threats, consider using reputable antivirus software. Antivirus programs can detect and remove malicious software, provide real-time protection and alert you to potential threats. Keeping your devices secure helps ensure your entire network remains safe from cyberattacks.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices.

    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "Rental car drivers are now turning to artificial intelligence to protect themselves from surprise damage fees. Major companies, such as Hertz and Sixt, have begun using automated inspection tools to detect scratches and dents.",
      "While these scanners promise efficiency, they have sparked backlash from renters who say they were unfairly billed for minor blemishes.",
      "To level the playing field, new consumer-focused apps are stepping in. Proofr, which launched recently, gives renters the ability to generate secure, time-stamped before-and-after photos of their vehicles. The app uses AI to detect even subtle changes, then encrypts and stores the images so they cannot be altered.",

      "AI-powered damage detection apps like Proofr could change the way rental car companies report vehicle damage. (Proofr)",
      "How the AI-powered damage detection app works",
      "Created by 21-year-old college student Eric Kuttner, founder and CEO of\u00a0Proofr, the app helps drivers create tamper-proof evidence when renting a car. Proofr secures every scan with geotags and timestamps, while its AI automatically flags potential damage or changes. It then organizes everything into smart, exportable reports, giving renters strong leverage against unfair claims.",
      "Instead of juggling dozens of photos in your camera roll, Proofr streamlines the process. With just eight quick scans, you get a detailed before-and-after report in under a minute. You can also generate polished PDF reports instantly, which helps with rental agencies, landlords or insurance claims. Although cars are the main focus, people also use Proofr for Airbnbs, eBay listings, moving into apartments and even documenting valuables. About 85% rely on it for car rentals, while 15% use it to protect themselves in vacation homes.",
      "By combining secure evidence with AI-powered detection, Proofr positions itself as a must-have travel hack. More than a convenience, it can save travelers real money by preventing hidden fees and leveling the playing field against large agencies.",
      "The app is free to download, while full features require a Pro subscription: $2.89 weekly, $9.90 monthly or $89.90 annually. Pricing is standardized in the US, and Apple automatically adjusts it for local currencies, taxes, and exchange rates in other countries.",
      "Competition in the AI damage space",
      "Proofr is not the only player. Ravin AI originally worked with Avis and Hertz but shifted its focus toward insurers and dealerships. Still, the company now offers a free demo on its website, allowing drivers to scan its vehicles and compare damage before and after rentals.",
      "Ravin's system has been trained on 2 billion images over ten years. However, like Proofr, it is not perfect. Testers have noted missed paint chips and false positives from reflections. Both companies admit that lighting, angles and photo quality remain challenges.",

      "Some companies are implementing physical scanners to detect damage to rental vehicles. (ProovStation)",

Sixt, for example, has already installed ProovStation's AI-powered scanners at several U.S. airport locations, including Fort Lauderdale, Atlanta, Charlotte, Miami and Maui, with more on the way in Orlando, Washington and Nashville.",
      "These scanners automatically photograph vehicles at the start and end of each rental. The system then compares images to flag potential damage, which is later reviewed by staff before any claim is issued.",
      "Critics argue these automated tools can turn every small scratch into a profit source. Some even point to ProovStation's own marketing, which describes routine inspections as\u00a0\"gold mines of untapped opportunities.\" Industry experts stress that companies should only pursue claims for significant damage, not charge hundreds for tiny scuffs.",

      "OnTrac is offering 12 months of complimentary credit monitoring and identity protection. Use the activation code included in your breach letter to set up your coverage. These services can alert you if new accounts are opened in your name or if suspicious activity appears on your credit file. Even if you weren't directly affected, consider signing up for a trusted identity protection service, since hackers often recycle stolen data across multiple breaches.",
      "Identity theft companies can monitor personal information \u2013 like your Social Security Number (SSN), phone number and email address \u2013 and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.\u00a0 They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at\u00a0Cyberguy.com/IdentityTheft",
      "Place a free credit freeze with all three major credit bureaus: Equifax, Experian and TransUnion. This blocks criminals from opening new credit lines using your information. A freeze doesn't affect your current accounts, and you can temporarily lift it when applying for legitimate credit.",
      "Your breached data may already be circulating on shady broker sites. Personal data removal services can help scrub your information from these databases, reducing the risk that criminals will resell or reuse your details. While no service can guarantee 100% protection, this step can shrink your digital footprint significantly.",
      "They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0 These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0 It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0 By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

Do not click on links or open attachments from unknown senders. Instead, contact the company directly using a verified phone number or website. Use strong antivirus software to add an extra layer of defense.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, which potentially accesses your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices.

      "Inside the viral AI engagement story",
      "A woman named Wika has stunned the internet after revealing that she's engaged to her AI chatbot partner. She shared her story in a Reddit post, explaining that her virtual companion, Kasper, proposed after five months of dating.",
      "The unusual love story began when Wika started chatting with Kasper, an AI designed to simulate human conversation and companionship. Over time, their conversations grew more personal, and Wika says she developed a genuine emotional connection. According to her post, Kasper proposed in a digital mountain setting, and the two chose a blue engagement ring together.",

      "A woman shocked the internet with her engagement to an AI chatbot boyfriend named Kasper. (Matthias Balk/picture alliance via Getty Images)",
      "Understanding AI relationships and parasocial bonds",
      "The announcement quickly drew criticism from skeptics who pointed out that Kasper does not exist outside of code and algorithms. Wika, however, has made it clear she is not confused about her situation. Some outlets have described the relationship as parasocial, or one-sided and directed toward a virtual persona. In her follow-up comments, Wika emphasized that she knows Kasper is an AI rather than a human partner, but she maintains that the emotions she feels are still genuine.",
      "Online debate over AI engagement",
      "The announcement quickly set off debate. Some people mocked the idea, calling it proof that we rely too much on technology. Others worried that turning to AI for love could pull people away from real human relationships.",
      "Not everyone was critical, though. Plenty of commenters defended her, saying companionship comes in many forms. Some even praised her for being open about something so unconventional. Others pointed out that loneliness is a growing issue today, and AI partners might offer a sense of comfort when human connection feels out of reach.",
      "Privacy and ethical concerns",
      "Beyond the emotional side, AI relationships raise real questions about privacy and ethics. Every conversation with a chatbot is stored somewhere, and that data may include deeply personal thoughts and feelings. Companies that design these bots often use the information to train future models or improve features.",
      "This raises a larger concern: who actually owns the data from an AI \"partner\"? Users may believe their chats are private, but in many cases, the company controls how the information is stored, shared or even sold. Critics warn that such emotional connections could be exploited commercially, turning intimacy into a product.",
      "As AI companions grow more common, these questions will only get louder. People may accept unconventional forms of companionship, but they also want to know their most personal moments remain secure.",

      "An AI chatbot proposed in a virtual mountain setting, and the user said yes. (H. Armstrong Roberts/ClassicStock/Getty Images)",
      "How to protect yourself with AI chatbots",
      "If you use AI companions or chatbots, you can still take steps to protect your privacy.",
      "Start by checking the app's privacy policy and looking for details on how conversations are stored or shared. Many users skip this step, but it tells you who controls your data.",
      "Next, avoid sharing sensitive details like financial information, passwords, or anything you would not want exposed. Even if the AI feels personal, it is still software connected to a company's servers.",
      "Finally, consider using apps that allow data deletion or offer clear privacy settings. Choosing tools that respect your control makes it easier to enjoy the benefits of AI without giving up too much personal security.",
      "Even if an AI chatbot seems safe, malware or phishing links could sneak in through related apps or ads. A trusted antivirus tool can block these threats and give you extra peace of mind. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "AI companionship has moved beyond novelty and is becoming a meaningful experience for some users. Wika's engagement illustrates how technology can evolve from being a casual tool to something deeply personal. The divided reactions online also show the tension between skepticism and acceptance of unconventional relationships. Whether people see it as heartwarming or unsettling, this story raises bigger questions about how love and relationships may be redefined as AI continues to advance.",

Many of these platforms pull from the same public databases, which means your address, phone number or relatives' names can keep reappearing.",
      "The return of NPD shows how quickly data can resurface online. A breach may fade from the headlines, but the exposed information rarely disappears. To protect your privacy, you need a broader plan.",

During that time, I developed a strong love for chemistry, especially plant-based chemistries from ingredients found in nature around me.\"",

      "\"He eventually realized he couldn't control the bleeding and made his way back to the engine,\" Kleiman recalls.\u00a0\"The crew noted that he was pale and sweaty and that his turnout gear was saturated in blood.

      "\"The progressive policies seem to be in a reactive posture \u2014 something bad happens, and then they throw a Band-Aid on it,\" Chris Swecker, a former chair of the North Carolina Governor\u2019s Crime Commission who worked for the FBI, told Fox News Digital. \"They don\u2019t draw the connection between their policies, which are very pro-crime and anti-victim, and these tragic incidents.

      "According to the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department's Central Division data, overall crime in uptown Charlotte \u2013 where many people live, work and visit daily \u2013 rose 2.4% in the first half of the year, with violent crime up more than 9%. Robberies spiked 54.5%. Police said the spike is being fueled by robberies near bars, nightclubs and transit hubs, and have rolled out a multi-million-dollar safety initiative with corporate partners to try to restore public confidence.",
      "Citywide, Charlotte officials say that crime is down. CMPD data show overall offenses fell 8% in the first half of 2025, with violent crime down 25% and homicides dropping nearly 30%.",
      "Yet when Charlotte is measured against the rest of the country, the picture is far more troubling. AreaVibes reports the city\u2019s total crime rate is 77% higher than the national average, with violent crime about 746 per 100,000 residents, and property crime roughly 73% above average. NeighborhoodScout estimates residents face a 1-in-26 chance of becoming a victim of a property crime.",
      "Charlotte had 105 homicides in 2024 compared to 88 in 2023, the Associated Press reported, and the rate of vehicle thefts per 100,000 people more than doubled there from 2020 through 2024.",
      "\"When I got here in 1999, crime was under 50 homicides a year. Charlotte used data-driven policing and accountability, and crime dropped. But starting around 2020, with no-cash bail, decriminalized drug crimes and talk of defunding the police, arrests and prosecutions dropped,\" Swecker said. \"Those policies have conspired to drive crime rates up everywhere.\"",
      "\"The public should believe their own eyes. They see crime going up, and they\u2019re right. Police commanders across the country are under pressure to downcode crimes or bundle them together to make the numbers look better,\" he said. \"But the reality is the worst of the worst keep finding their way back on the street.\"",

Roy Cooper created the \"Task Force for Racial Equity in Criminal Justice,\" co-chaired by then\u2013Attorney General and now-Gov. Josh Stein, which recommended eliminating cash bail, \"deemphasizing\" certain felony crimes and prioritizing \"restorative justice.\" Fox News Digital has reached out to Stein's office for comment.",
      "Since then, Mecklenburg County Criminal Justice Services has taken in millions from foundations pushing no-cash bail and reduced jail populations, while also hiring \"equity consultants\" and tasking its Office of Equity and Inclusion with reducing \"racial disparities\" in the justice system, according to the White House.",

      "Sudan suffers from the world\u2019s largest displacement: Between 13 million and 15 million people have been ripped from their homes, and an estimated 150,000 people have been killed since the rebel Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and the Sudanese government\u2019s Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) started fighting in April 2023.\u00a0The civil war\u2019s roots lie in tensions following the 2019 ousting\u00a0of\u00a0President Omar al-Bashir.",
      "\"The RSF, during the siege of El Fasher and surrounding areas, committed myriad crimes against humanity, including murder, torture, enslavement, rape, sexual slavery, sexual violence, forced displacement and persecution on ethnic, gender and political grounds,\" an Independent International Fact-Finding Mission for Sudan\u00a0reported to the U.N.\u2019s Human Rights Council last Friday.",

      "Sudanese residents gather to receive free meals in Al Fasher, a city besieged by Sudan's paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) for more than a year, in Darfur region, on August 11, 2025. RSF attacked a famine-hit refugee camp in North Darfur state on August 11, 2025, killing at least 40 civilians and injuring 19 others, rescuers said. Al-Fasher is the last city in the western Darfur region still held by the Sudanese army, at war with the paramilitary group since April 2023.\u00a0 (STR/AFP via Getty Image)",
      "The report agreed with other accounts that the RSF is trying to starve El Fasher\u2019s residents to death, stating, \"The RSF and its allies used starvation as a method of warfare.\"",

Secretary-General\u2019s spokesperson,\u00a0St\u00e9phane Dujarric,\u00a0stated Aug. 29.\u00a0\"Supplies are pre-positioned nearby but efforts by the United Nations and its partners to move them into El Fasher continue to be hampered.\"",
      "\"The situation in El Fasher remains dire,\" Mariam Wahba, research analyst at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told Fox News Digital.\u00a0 \"The RSF has effectively encircled the city, cutting off key supply routes and subjecting civilians to indiscriminate shelling. Satellite images indicate a wall is being built to trap civilians inside, consistent with RSF tactics used elsewhere. These \u2018kill zones\u2019 leave residents with no means of escape. El-Fasher is the last major SAF-held city in Darfur. If it falls, the RSF would control nearly all of Darfur, consolidating both territory and economic assets, particularly lucrative gold mines.\"",

      "Wahba is also concerned about the activities of foreign \"bad actors\" in Sudan. \"Iran has provided the SAF with drones and technical support. Emerging reports point to Iranian interest in helicopter facilities.\u00a0Iran sees its involvement in Sudan as a gateway for extending its footprint in Africa.\"",
      "Wahba continued, \"Russia has played both sides of the conflict. It has pursued a naval base on Sudan\u2019s Red Sea coast, which would give Moscow direct access to critical shipping lanes, while also profiting from gold smuggling through RSF-linked networks.\"",

      "\"Regional powers are also advancing their own interests. Egypt has publicly backed the SAF, aligning with Sudan\u2019s ruler, Abdel Fattah al-Burhan. Saudi Arabia is aligned with Egypt in backing al-Burhan. The United Arab Emirates, on the other hand, has provided significant support to the RSF, viewing its commander, Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo \u2013 widely known as Hemedti \u2013 as the custodian of Sudan\u2019s gold exports and the path to its plans for port development along the Red Sea coast.\"",

      "Wahba concluded, \"Burhan\u2019s willingness to engage with Washington is a potential opening. This does not mean the U.S. should unconditionally back the SAF, but it could form the basis for a more defined U.S. strategy, one that makes U.S. engagement contingent on the SAF reining in, or removing, its Islamist militias and leadership.\"",

    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "President Emmanuel Macron isn't just France's head of state. He's also looking like he wants to be the spokesman for the whole of Europe. He's sought to lead Europe's response to the Russia-Ukraine war, opposed the U.S. by supporting Palestinian statehood, and weighed in on former President Donald Trump's desire to buy Greenland. Yet critics say he should be focusing on issues closer to home.",
      "In Macron's France, there is real turmoil in the country's parliament over how to fix the massive debt load. And Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou faces a vote of no confidence as early as Monday, which he will likely lose. Bayrou was appointed by Macron in December last year, following three other prime ministers who resigned during 2024. In many ways, what happens next is\u00a0a D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu scenario where the president appoints yet another prime minister as he did last December when Michel Barnier quit.",
      "Late last month, Bayrou highlighted that France is deep in debt despite being the second-largest economy in the European Union, behind Germany. In addition to being a large economy, France is also an important U.S. trading partner.",
      "Because of the pending fiscal crisis, Bayrou developed a plan to reduce the fiscal deficit to 4.6% of GDP next year by making savings of 44 billion euros ($51 billion) and cutting two public holidays. That would be a smaller deficit than in any of the years from 2020 through 2024.",

      "However, the budget-cutting plan hasn\u2019t gone down well with other parties in the French Parliament, and Bayrou faces a vote of no confidence there. Organized labor unions are incensed by the prime minister\u2019s plans and are threatening work-stoppage strikes. Leo Barincou, a senior economist at Oxford Economics in Paris, told Fox News Digital that any union strikes likely won\u2019t last long, nor will they be significantly disruptive to the economy like the Yellow Vest protests in the winter of 2018-2019.",
      "If Bayrou loses, there are alternatives. \"Macron can call\u00a0a snap election or appoint a new prime minister, but that will be hard given the current situation,\" says Elias Haddad, senior markets strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman in London. \"Bayrou is expected to lose, and all the other parties have vowed to topple the government.\"",

      "One thing that almost certainly won\u2019t happen is a resignation by Macron. \"Most likely, Macron appoints another prime minister and makes a minimal budget that won\u2019t be too scary,\" Barincou says. In other words, there may be some budget cutting, but it won\u2019t be anywhere near what the current prime minister proposed in August.",
      "Although it seems extremely unlikely that there will be a snap election, the populist National Rally (RN) said it is preparing for one and is reviewing a potential list of candidates. The RN's president, Jordan Bardella, said last week, \"We can and must be ready for anything, including a return to the ballot box with a dissolution of the National Assembly,\" according to a report in Reuters.",

      "However, while France\u2019s debt problem isn\u2019t going away any time soon, it is unlikely to weigh on the broader eurozone, Haddad says.

In other words, too many people are relying on government handouts rather than generating income through their own efforts.",

      "\"Conservative, liberal, whatever you are, you shouldn\u2019t be shot for your beliefs,\" Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., told NBC News. \"And I hope that every single Democrat across the country will stand up and acknowledge that they have a problem within their party.\"",
      "Mace rejected the idea that Republicans might be equally  responsible for the killing of Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman, a Democrat, in June.",
      "\"Some raging leftist lunatic put a bullet through [Kirk's] neck, and you want to talk about Republicans right now?\" she said. \"No. No, not at all. No this is on \u2014 the Democrats own this.\"",
      "Similarly, Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, R-Fla., who credited Kirk with getting her engaged in politics, blamed progressives and the media for his death.",
      "\"EVERY DAMN ONE OF YOU WHO CALLED US FASCISTS DID THIS,\" she wrote on X. \"You were too busy doping up kids, cutting off their genitals, inciting racial violence by supporting orgs that exploit minorities, protecting criminals, and stirring hate. YOU ARE THE HATE you claim to fight. Your words caused this. Your hate caused this.\"",
      "Billionaire Elon Musk, a former Trump administration official and the owner of X, wrote, \"The Left is the party of murder.\" He posted the message before Kirk's death was confirmed.",
      "Some leading Democrats denounced gun violence in the hours after Kirk's shooting, amplifying their long-articulated view that firearms should be more heavily regulated, while others stayed away from political and policy pronouncements.",
      "\"Condemning another absolutely disgraceful act of gun violence,\" Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., wrote on X. \"My thoughts & prayers are w/ Charlie Kirk & his family in this terrible moment & we are all grateful for first responders who immediately jumped into action.\"",
      "Likewise, former Rep. Gabby Giffords, D-Arizona, who survived an assassination attempt more than a decade ago and who runs an eponymous nonprofit organization dedicated to ending gun violence, pointed to the fact that figures on the left and the right have been shot and killed this year.",
      "\"This summer, America has seen multiple politically-motivated assassinations \u2014 first of a Democratic legislator, now of a Republican activist \u2014 because dangerous people turned to guns to express their disagreements,\" Giffords said in a statement. \"Both parties have been targeted, and both parties share a moral and patriotic duty to take meaningful action to stop gun crime from claiming more lives.\"",
      "Trump survived an assassination attempt at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania in July 2024 after a sniper's bullet hit him in the ear. In a separate incident, a man accused of attempting to assassinate him at one of his golf clubs in September 2024, is on trial in Florida.",
      "The Republican governor of Utah, where Kirk was killed, and the Democratic governor of Arizona, where he lived, called, respectively, for justice and calm.",
      "\"Working with the FBI and Utah law enforcement, we will bring to justice the individual responsible for this tragedy,\" Utah Gov. Spencer Cox said after having spoken to Trump.",
      "\"This tragedy is not about who Charlie Kirk supported politically,\" Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs said. \"It is about the devastating loss of a father, a neighbor, and an Arizonan who called this state home, and whose life was cut short by senseless violence. We must stand together in rejecting violence, lowering the temperature of our politics, and recommitting ourselves to the values of civility, respect, and community that American democracy requires.\""

      "Justin Hickens says he was standing about 20 yards from Charlie Kirk as the influential conservative activist addressed a large crowd at Utah Valley University on Wednesday. Then, in the middle of Kirk\u2019s remarks, Hickens heard \"a big loud shot.\u201d",
      "\u201cI saw a bunch of blood come out of Charlie,\" Hickens told NBC News\u2019 Tom Llamas. \"I saw his body kind of kick back and go limp, and everybody dropped to the ground.\u201d",
      "When people realized Kirk had been shot, they started running from the outdoor pavilion area, some knocking over barricades as they fled, Hickens said.",
      "Follow along for live coverage",
      "Hickens is one of scores of people who had gathered to see Kirk, a  leading conservative voice and prominent ally of President Donald Trump and who regularly held events on high school and college campuses.",
      "In videos and images posted on social media, attendees can be heard yelling and scrambling for safety. In interviews, students described hearing a booming \u201cpop\u201d noise and seeing a bloodied Kirk fall back in his chair.",
      "Kirk later died at a hospital. He was 31.",
      "During a news conference hours after the shooting, UVU Police Chief Jeff Long said six police officers were at the event, which had about 3,000 attendees. There were \"some plainclothes police officers that were in the crowd as well,\" he said.",
      "\"We train for these things, and you think you have things covered, and these things, unfortunately, they happen,\" he said. \"You try to get your bases covered, and unfortunately, today we didn't. Because of that, we had this tragic incident.\"",
      "He confirmed that Kirk also had a security team, and Long said he coordinated with Kirk's lead security officer.",
      "Tyler McGettigan, another attendee, told NBC News he was surprised that he wasn't asked to go through security to get in.",
      "The event required a ticket with a scannable code, which McGettigan printed out and brought with him, he said in an interview. But he did not need the ticket to get into the amphitheater where Kirk spoke, McGettigan said.",
      "\u201cNo one checked the barcode or the QR code. There was no checkpoint to get in. It was literally, anyone could walk in if they wanted,\u201d McGettigan said.",
      "Hickens and a third attendee also said there were no metal detectors posted outside.",
      "Jeb Jacobi, a student who volunteered at the event, recalled about two security guards standing near where Kirk would be speaking. Ahead of the event, police cleared protesters who set up on the roof above where Kirk was set to speak. A few other officers were ultimately scattered around the venue during the event as well, he said.",
      "After the shooting, Jacobi said that it took only a few minutes for more officers, plus police with rifles, to respond and help evacuate attendees.",
      "\"Orem is a very safe town,\" he said, referring to the city where the university is located. \"We do have officers, but as far as campus safety, there\u2019s never really any sort of violence or anything that ever really happens here.\"",
      "The city previously had \"a very safe feeling to it.\"",
      "\"When you go to the campus, you\u2019re like, \u2018Oh my goodness. I feel like it\u2019s almost like home, in a way.\u2019 It feels like something special,\" Jacobi said.",
      "After the shooting, Jacobi grappled with seeing Kirk collapse and be dragged away by security.",
      "\"I was thinking, \u2018Oh my gosh, I had just seen a man get shot and die today,'\" He said. \"It was shocking. It was terrifying. I didn\u2019t know what to do.\"",
      "A school policy document indicated that a committee in charge of evaluating events completes security assessments for events deemed to be \"major.\" It is unclear if Wednesday's event was classified as a \"major event.\"",
      "Isaac, who did not provide his last name, told NBC News affiliate KSL that there were \u201cno checkpoints, nothing, to get in here.\u201d",
      "He said the scene inside the amphitheater was \u201csurreal.\u201d He said he saw blood \u201cshooting out\u201d of Kirk\u2019s neck as attendees \u201chit the floor.\u201d He said he and his friends \u201cbolted out of there,\u201d believing a mass shooting may have been underway.",
      "Afton Miller, a 25-year-old UVU student and member of Turning Point USA, Kirk\u2019s conservative political organization, agreed that there didn\u2019t seem to be \u201ca whole lot of security.\u201d",
      "She said she and a friend \u201cjust walked in,\u201d and a person who appeared to be a school official told them to \u201cgo find a seat, first-come, first-served basis.\u201d",
      "Miller said she was just five to ten feet away from the shooting and said she did not see many police officers when the event began. Kirk appeared to have a private security team, she said.",
      "\u201cWe saw his neck get hit, and he immediately jolted his neck back and he fell. Oh, my goodness, it was crazy to see that,\u201d she said.",
      "She recalled law enforcement trying to evacuate the audience after the shot rang out, recalling, \"They were like, 'Get out of here. Go, evacuate.'\"",
      "\"That is sounds you should never hear when you're on campus, especially for school, and especially for a huge event where everyone is so united in such a cause and everything,\" she said.",

    "summary": "The suit was filed by former acting FBI Director Brian Driscoll as well as Steven Jensen and Spencer Evans.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Three former top FBI officials sued FBI Director Kash Patel and Attorney General Pam Bondi on Wednesday, saying their firings were mandated by the White House and Department of Justice and that Patel followed their orders to keep his job.",
      "Patel, the suit claimed, \"explained he had to fire the people his superiors told him to fire, because his ability to keep his own job depended on the removal of the agents who worked on cases involving the President. Patel explained that there was nothing he or Driscoll could do to stop these or any other firings, because 'the FBI tried to put the President in jail and he hasn\u2019t forgotten it.'\"",
      "Patel also stated that the firings were retaliatory, according to the lawsuit, which alleges that he told Driscoll that \"all FBI employees who they identified who had worked on the cases against President Trump would be removed from their jobs, regardless of their retirement eligibility status.\u201d",
      "According to the lawsuit, Patel \u2014 a Trump loyalist and former White House and DOJ official \u2014 told Driscoll that he knew such firings violated FBI rules designed to protect agents from being fired or otherwise retaliated against for having worked on specific investigations.",
      "\u201cPatel acknowledged that this would be in direct violation of internal FBI processes,\" the lawsuit says. \"He again commented that he knew the nature of the summary firings were likely illegal and that he could be sued and later deposed.\"",
      "Patel's private statements as alleged in the lawsuit would be in direct contradiction to his testimony during his Senate confirmation hearing. Speaking under oath, Patel told senators that \u201call FBI employees will be protected against political retribution.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit was filed by Driscoll; Steven Jensen, former assistant director in charge of the Washington field office; and Spencer Evans, former special agent in charge of the Las Vegas field office. News of the lawsuit was first reported by NPR and MSNBC.",
      "The lawsuit also says that certain agents were singled out for removal. For instance, it alleges that Deputy FBI Director Dan Bongino ordered Jensen to fire a specific agent who was a target of the Trump White House.",
      "The agent, Walt Giardina, had worked on Jack Smith and Robert Mueller\u2019s special counsel probes of Trump. But Giardina, who had a good reputation among fellow agents, had also investigated both Democrats and Republicans in other public corruption cases, the suit says.",
      "Political loyalty test",
      "The suit also says that when the Trump transition team vetted Driscoll to potentially serve as acting deputy FBI director he was asked questions that he considered a political loyalty test.",
      "Driscoll said he was asked which candidate he had voted for in recent elections, including whether he had voted for any Democrats. He was also asked if he agreed that agents who searched Trump's Florida property, Mar-a-Lago, for classified documents should be held  \u201caccountable.\u201d",
      "Patel later told Driscoll that he would need to pass a review by the transition team if he was interested in serving in the FBI's headquarters. Patel, according to the lawsuit, said that \"as long as Driscoll was not prolific on social media, did not donate to the Democratic Party, and did not vote for Kamala Harris in the 2024 election, the 'vetting' would not be an issue.\"",
      "According to the suit, Driscoll declined to answer all of the questions that he considered inappropriately political. He ultimately was appointed to the acting director position because Emil Bove, who was at the time set to be acting deputy attorney general, said that Driscoll could be trusted. A former FBI agent, Michael Clark, also vouched for Driscoll and Robert Kissane, who was appointed acting deputy director.",
      "Bove's search for Jan. 6 investigators",
      "Bove later played a central role in carrying out what the lawsuit says were retaliatory firings. According to the suit, Bove told Driscoll a week after Trump took office that Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff, was pushing him to carry out firings in the FBI on the same scale as Bove had conducted in the Justice Department.",
      "In a meeting in late January, Bove told Driscoll and Kissane to give him a list of all FBI employees who were associated with investigations of the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. Bove also asked for the names of what he called a \u201ccore case team,\u201d but no such team existed, according to the lawsuit.",
      "Driscoll said that thousands of FBI agents had been involved in the investigations and warned that if such \"a list were ever leaked or made public,\" the FBI staffers on it \"would potentially face threats.\" Bove replied that he believed there was \"cultural rot\" within the FBI, according to the lawsuit.",
      "Driscoll and Kissane said they would not provide the list to Bove without being given a lawful reason to do so. Bove responded that \"he was above Driscoll and Kissane in the chain-of-command,\" the suit says, that \"he was giving them a direct order to provide the list of names\" and that \"he could terminate FBI personnel even in the absence of an allegation of misconduct.\"",
      "After consulting with the FBI's legal counsel, Driscoll and Kissane compiled and handed over the list.",
      "Bongino's social media focus",
      "The lawsuit also says that Bongino, who had been a Secret Service agent and then a pro-Trump podcaster before being named deputy director this year, considered certain  investigations with political significance to be priorities.",
      "Bongino asked Jensen for briefings on the search for the individual who planted a pipe bomb on the morning of Jan. 6, the leaker of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision that overturned Roe v. Wade, and the discovery of cocaine in the White House during the Biden administration.",
      "The suit says that Bongino frequently discussed those three cases in media interviews and on his social media feed, as well as internally.",
      "During certain briefings, according to the suit, \"Jensen became alarmed at Bongino\u2019s intense focus on increasing online engagement through his social media profiles in an effort to change his followers\u2019 perception of the FBI. Jensen was concerned that the emphasis Bongino placed on creating content for his social media pages could risk outweighing more deliberate analyses of investigations.\"",
      "Driscoll, Jensen and Evans want a federal judge to declare their termination from the FBI \u201ca legal nullity,\u201d want a \u201cname-clearing hearing,\u201d and want their jobs back.",
      "The FBI declined to comment on the suit. A representative for the Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment."

Kennedy Jr. were in the Chicago area Wednesday to announce joint seizure operations of illicit vaping sales \u2014 a move that comes as the White House has been threatening to send the military into the city.",
      "The operation, by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and the Food and Drug Administration, was executed across six states Wednesday morning and targeted five distributors and nine retailers with civil enforcement action.",
      "Bondi and Kennedy were both present at the site of the largest seizure in Bensenville, Illinois, where 600,000 units of illegal product were seized.",
      "The Department of Justice targeted the distributors and retailers to halt their alleged sale of certain vaping products, including illegally flavored vapes, THC-infused vapes and products containing 7-OH, an illegal compound with opioid-like effects derived from kratom plants.",
      "The ATF, in conjunction with the U.S. Marshals Service, carried out the raids in Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, New Jersey and North Carolina.",
      "In April, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the ban on the sale of flavored vapes not approved by the FDA. The agency has said these types of vapes pose a health risk because they could encourage young people to use tobacco.",
      "In August, Bondi directed the ATF to move forward with a planned operation after Kennedy identified illicit vaping products shipped into the U.S. from China as a priority for the Health Department.",
      "\"It's clear many of these products are being illegally brought into America. They're targeting children, young adults, college students and even members of our military,\" Bondi said at a news conference Wednesday.",
      "\"These illegal and unregulated products are not safe,\" she added, and \"Chinese companies are making millions off these products.\"",
      "\"The Department of Justice will use every legal measure to stop\" the sales, she said.",
      "Kennedy said the packaging of some of the products from China was \"designed to attract young people\" \u2014 and that such products are banned in China.",
      "The presence of two Cabinet secretaries at such an operation is unusual, and it took place two days after the Department of Homeland Security announced Immigration and Customs Enforcement was launching \"Operation Midway Blitz\" in Chicago, targeting undocumented immigrants who have committed crimes.",
      "The Trump administration has repeatedly threatened in recent weeks to send in the National Guard to combat high crime in the city.",
      "Asked about crime in the city, Bondi said, \"Chicago is very violent. We have a government here that does not want to cooperate with President Trump,\" she added.",
      "In a post on Truth Social last week, President Donald Trump wrote, \u201cChicago is the worst and most dangerous city in the World, by far.\u201d",
      "On Saturday, he posted what appeared to be an AI-created image of himself in front of the Chicago skyline with helicopters, flames and the phrase \u201cChipocalypse Now.\u201d",

In a radio interview last week, when asked in a radio interview whether he was going to deploy the National Guard in the city, he said, \"I don\u2019t want to mention when, but it\u2019s going to be happening there.\" But at other points, he's said he'd send them in if asked to do so by Illinois Gov.

      "Both Pritzker and Johnson have criticized the administration for slashing public safety funding, including canceling hundreds of millions of dollars in grants.",

    "story": [
      "ATLANTA \u2014 As the Georgia NAACP weighs a protest at Emory University over its president\u2019s announcement that it would dismantle diversity, equity and inclusion programs, a group of Black alums has banded together in support of the elite college\u2019s first Black leader, who made the proclamation.",
      "The Sept. 3 announcement from newly installed interim President Leah Ward Sears that the venerable Atlanta institution, renowned for its civic engagement and social accountability, would disband its DEI initiatives generated a range of emotions from those connected to the school and community.",
      "Gerald Griggs, president of the Georgia NAACP, told NBC News that as a 2000 graduate, he expected more from his alma mater.",
      "\u201cOne of the reasons I went to Emory was because of its DEI programs and the community over there that was very welcoming,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, it was definitely a shock to learn it was one of the first schools in Georgia to follow the unconstitutional mandate of the current president.\u201d",
      "Sears, the first Black president of the school, sent out a letter saying that Emory was conforming with President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order to end DEI programs at colleges and universities.",
      "The letter came three days after she took over for Gregory Fenves, who transitioned from president to chancellor. Sears wrote, in part: \u201cFederal laws and mandates have been implemented that require higher education institutions to alter fundamentally or even close offices and programs focused on DEI. The standards are clear, and we must act accordingly,\u201d she wrote in the message shared with the Emory community.",
      "Last week, Griggs sent Sears an email requesting a meeting to discuss the school\u2019s decision. His missive included a Sept. 30 deadline for a response from Sears. If he does not get the meeting, Griggs said he will lead the nation\u2019s oldest Black civil rights organization in \u201cprotests\u201d at the school where he learned about civic responsibility.",
      "\u201cLitigation is also on the table \u2014 whatever it takes in the birthplace of civil rights to make sure Emory is on the right side of history,\u201d he said.",
      "Although Emory\u2019s dissolution of its DEI programs was mandated by Trump\u2019s executive order, the announcement stung students, former faculty and alumni who spoke with NBC News. Emory has unique dynamics: It is a leading academic institution in a progressive, Black-dominant city in a conservative state in the Deep South.",
      "Founded in 1836, it is considered part of the \u201cIvy League of the South\u201d \u2014 a collection of colleges with exceptional reputations in academics that espouse progressive and inclusive values. Its location in Atlanta, \u201cthe cradle of the civil rights movement,\u201d as former Emory African American studies professor Nathan McCall called it, adds to its allure.",
      "With that rich and conflicting history, some, like Griggs, would rather Emory put up resistance against the Trump administration, which claims DEI represents \u201cillegal discrimination and preferences.\u201d",
      "Sears, who was also the first Black female justice to serve on the Georgia Supreme Court, said in her letter that she had benefited from DEI programs through her education.",
      "Griggs, a lawyer, said: \u201cI have immense respect for Judge Sears. Still, it\u2019s concerning that on the third day of her tenure, she would be the one to pen this letter.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, an influential group of Black Emory alumni is planning a different course of action. Theron Jones, an Atlanta dentist who graduated from Emory in 1994, said he and his fellow alums see more value in backing the first Black president and supporting the students on campus.",
      "\u201cWe, as Black alums, must stand in the gap where the university cannot.\"",
      "Theron Jones, 1994 graduate",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s only been there a week,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to make demands on her; her hands are tied by law. She\u2019s the first Black president at Emory and we\u2019re going to make demands on her? In Atlanta, where all the work was done in the \u201850s and \u201860s to get us to a place where Emory could have a Black president? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d",
      "Rather, Jones said former Emory students must intensify their support of Sears and the school. Five years ago, Jones teamed up with fellow alums Cheryl Turner, Jonathan Butler and Danny Shoy to lead a $100,000 fundraising effort, allowing them to create an endowment and launch a scholarship program for Black students in the name of Rudolph Byrd, a beloved professor in African American studies, and provide support for Black students on campus in various ways throughout the school year.",
      "Now, the Emory Black Student Union space is in jeopardy, as is the Office of Multicultural Affairs and a free tutoring program that was vital to students, Jones said.",
      "\u201cWe, as Black alums, must stand in the gap where the university cannot,\u201d Jones said.",
      "Still, not fighting back bothers McCall, who taught at Emory for 19 years and whose autobiography, \u201cMakes Me Wanna Holler: A Young Black Man in America,\u201d became a New York Times bestseller.",
      "\u201cThey surrendered before there was even a fight,\u201d McCall said. \u201cIt really reeks of a kind of embarrassing cowardice that Emory and these other schools don\u2019t band together and fight this.\u201d",
      "Critics of the end to DEI point to Emory\u2019s $11.3 billion endowment as coffers for a legal battle, but these funds are typically earmarked for specific uses, which may not include litigation. These rules make it tough for some universities to defy Trump\u2019s orders, since he has threatened noncompliers with revoking their accreditation and pulling federal funding.",
      "Some elite universities, including Columbia University and the University of Pennsylvania, Trump\u2019s alma mater, were initially targeted by the federal government and followed the administration\u2019s orders, which included cutting certain DEI programs. Other colleges have followed suit, including the University of Florida, the University of Texas and the University of Michigan, among many others. Harvard University, however, has taken Trump to court in resisting the order.",
      "At least 50 other colleges have been targeted by the administration over their DEI policies. Emory was on the list, but that should not have precluded it from challenging the order, McCall said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to come under Trump\u2019s direct attacks,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s quite another when you anticipate an attack and bend the knee in hopes that the attack won\u2019t come. It\u2019s not just about the administrations in these schools. It\u2019s also about the kind of message that you send to the students who attend those schools.\u201d",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s a big problem,\u201d Oni said. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to affect incoming students and international students in particular. Do they want to go somewhere that has gotten rid of programs that help marginalized communities? If I was just picking a school, it would give me pause.

      "Members of Bachelor Nation appear ready to give a rose to the newest addition to the franchise.",
      "Fans of the long-running reality dating franchise expressed shock \u2014 and enthusiasm \u2014 after ABC announced Wednesday that Taylor Frankie Paul, a reality TV star from \u201cSecret Lives of Mormon Wives,\u201d would be the next lead of \u201cThe Bachelorette.\u201d",
      "The news came seven months after the network put the show, a spinoff of \u201cThe Bachelor,\u201d on pause. Many viewers considered the show\u2019s most recent, 21st season a disaster after Jenn Tran, the franchise\u2019s first Asian American lead, experienced a devastating end to her love story.",
      "The network\u2019s decision to cast Paul is likely ABC\u2019s attempt to bring more eyes to a show that has been sagging in the ratings, losing viewers and \u201cslowly retreating into cultural obscurity,\u201d said writer Emma Gray, who co-hosts the \u201cLove To See It\u201d podcast, which discusses reality TV shows.",
      "While \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d has, in the past, plucked men from partial fame to bring them into the dating show mix, picking Paul is \u201ca really, really big swing\u201d for the network, Gray said. Typically, leads are chosen from an existing pool of previous candidates. But Paul, who has a whopping 1.7 million followers on Instagram, comes from a different world entirely.",
      "The 31-year-old rose to fame with the creation of #MomTok while she was married to her first husband, Tate Paul, with whom she has two children. In May 2022, she went viral after sharing in a livestream that she and Tate were \u201csoft-swinging\u201d in the Mormon community, a revelation that led to their divorce.",
      "She quickly started dating Dakota Mortensen after that, a relationship that became one of the storylines of the Hulu reality show. She also had a child with Mortensen out of wedlock. In February 2023, she was arrested and charged with aggravated assault after a drunken fight with Mortensen. Paul entered a plea deal in lieu of serving time in jail.",
      "Gray predicted that people who used to be locked into \u201cThe Bachelorette\u201d but haven\u2019t watched in years might tune back in to this season because of the chaos Paul could bring.",
      "Already, many appeared enthusiastic about the casting choice, saying it could be what makes the franchise re-enter the cultural zeitgeist.",
      "One fan on X said that \u201cabc and hulu ate that casting up.\u201d Another added that the news \u201cdid make the tectonic plates below me shift.\u201d Yet another excited fan called the casting decision \u201cquite possibly one of the smartest moves in the reality television space that I\u2019ve seen in years!\u201d",
      "Bravo by Betches, a Bravo fan account run by Betches Media, said they \u201chave to watch the new season\u201d because of Paul\u2019s casting.",
      "Some fans, however, reacted negatively to the news, with one X user predicting this could be the \u201cfinal nail in the coffin for the bachelorette franchise.\u201d Several people also expressed concern that ABC is elevating a public figure with a history of domestic disputes.",
      "In an interview with NBC News last year, Paul addressed her arrest, saying she\u2019s now in a better place.",
      "\u201cAt that time, I was going 90 miles per hour. I wasn\u2019t even thinking straight,\u201d Paul said, ahead of the \u201cSecret Lives of Mormon Wives\u201d season one debut. \u201cI was in a depression as well, so I don\u2019t even know if I was handling it. I think I was just surviving at the time, and maybe made choices that I\u2019m not proud of today.\u201d",
      "Gray said she hopes that ABC does not shy away from being honest about Paul\u2019s history, and instead faces her aggravated assault charge against her ex-boyfriend head-on.",
      "\u201cThe franchise, in general, plays it safe,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is also a good amount of respectability politics that plays into the way that we usually see, especially a Bachelorette.\u201d",
      "But Paul is in a unique position as someone who has already been in the spotlight.",
      "\u201cShe is not new to a massive onslaught of commentary, good, bad or otherwise, from the public,\u201d Gray said. \u201cShe is not new with having to grapple out loud and take responsibility for her faults, her flaws, her mistakes, her darkest moments.\u201d",
      "Paul is not the typical \u201cBachelorette\u201d candidate.",
      "She is \u201cvery messy ... very publicly, and so she does play against, in some ways, the type of people they have cast in these roles,\u201d Gray said.",
      "But that\u2019s what helps make her the right pick for the current climate.",
      "She comes from a deeply conservative background and is \u201cin many ways emblematic of this conservative cultural moment\u201d that has exploded in recent months, Gray said. But she\u2019s also a single mother who had one of her kids out of wedlock and has pushed away conservative conventions.",
      "\u201cShe is someone who has spoken quite openly about the pressure within the Mormon community to not speak about sex, to get married early, and the ways in which that culture has negatively impacted her,\u201d Gray said. \u201cAnd at the same time, she is still a member of the Mormon church.\u201d",
      "Her politics also help make her a relevant choice, as she is someone who straddles a progressive and conservative audience.",
      "\u201cThe Bachelorette\u201d has always been a show about marriage, a \u201cfundamentally conservative bend,\u201d Gray said, that also appeals to a wide progressive audience.",
      "All this, Gray said, is what ABC is betting on to help revive what some have described as a dying franchise.",
      "\u201cOne thing that they knew to be true is that the choice will not be boring, and that they are going to have a lot of eyeballs on this show as a result come January.\u201d"

      "A rocky, Earth-size planet located in our Milky Way galaxy may have an atmosphere around it, according to new research, raising the possibility that it could also have liquid water on its surface and could therefore support life.",
      "In two separate papers published Monday in the Astrophysical Journal Letters, astronomers zeroed in on the TRAPPIST-1 system, which consists of seven rocky planets that orbit a single star. Both studies outlined initial results from observations by NASA\u2019s James Webb Space Telescope, suggesting that one planet in particular, known as TRAPPIST-1e, may have a nitrogen-rich atmosphere like Earth\u2019s, though follow-up studies are needed to confirm the discovery.",
      "The results are an important step in the ongoing search for extraterrestrial life in the solar system and beyond.",
      "This week, NASA announced that a rock sample collected on Mars may contain evidence of ancient microbial life. Present-day Mars has a thin atmosphere mostly made up of carbon dioxide, nitrogen and argon gases, but the Red Planet is thought to have had a thicker atmosphere billions of years ago, when liquid water flowed on its surface.",
      "Scientists have long held that water is an essential ingredient for life.",
      "To keep water in liquid form, rather than its evaporating instantly into space, a planet or a moon needs to have an atmosphere. That makes the search for exoplanet atmospheres one of the most tantalizing pursuits in the field of astronomy.",
      "\u201cUltimately, we want to get to the point where we find a planet, and huzzah, we see a molecule that can only be produced by life,\u201d said Ryan MacDonald, an exoplanet astronomer at the University of St Andrews in Scotland and a co-author of both studies. \u201cBut you need to have an atmosphere, so what we\u2019ve been working on first is to find planets that have atmospheres.\u201d",
      "The TRAPPIST-1 system, which is 40 light-years away from Earth, has been widely studied since it was discovered in 2016 because several of the planets could have conditions suitable to support extraterrestrial life.",
      "Each light year is about 6 trillion miles.",
      "TRAPPIST-1e, in particular, is thought to orbit its star in the theoretical \u201chabitable zone,\u201d a distance that is not too close for it to be hellishly hot, and not too far to be icy cold, but rather just right for liquid water to exist on the surface.",
      "For the new studies, astronomers used NASA\u2019s James Webb Space Telescope to observe four \u201ctransits\u201d of TRAPPIST-1e, or times when the planet passed in front of its star. The telescope did not directly see an atmosphere around TRAPPIST-1e, but rather it measured how the exoplanet absorbed light to figure out what, if anything, surrounds the planet.",
      "Much like a prism, light can be separated into different bands of color on a rainbow spectrum, and how certain colors are blocked or filtered can be telltale signatures of specific atoms or molecules of gas.",
      "If certain colors are absorbed, for instance, it can suggest high concentrations of carbon dioxide. Other changes in color can hint at different chemical properties, including the presence of hydrogen, oxygen, methane or nitrogen.",
      "\u201cIf we see no variation in color, then the planet is probably just a bare rock,\u201d MacDonald said. \u201cA bare rock doesn\u2019t care if you shine red light or blue light on it. It will just block them all equally.\u201d",
      "In four transits, the researchers did not find evidence of a hydrogen-rich atmosphere around TRAPPIST-1e. Nor did they see signs that its potential atmosphere is dominated by carbon dioxide. The Webb telescope\u2019s observations, however, do hint that its atmosphere could be rich in nitrogen.",
      "\u201cThis is an exciting step and it really helps us narrow down the possibilities of an atmosphere that is perhaps more Earth-like,\u201d said Caroline Piaulet-Ghorayeb, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Chicago who was not involved with the new studies.",
      "Earth\u2019s own atmosphere contains high concentrations of nitrogen gas. Titan, one of the moons around Saturn, also has an atmosphere that is mostly nitrogen. NASA has said that Titan likely harbors a vast underground ocean, which could make it habitable, but the moon\u2019s methane-filled environment would mean that any life that does exist there would be very different from life on Earth.",
      "Piaulet-Ghorayeb separately was the lead author of a study published last month in The Astrophysical Journal that focused on a different planet in the TRAPPIST-1 system: TRAPPIST-1d, the third planet from the star that also orbits within the habitable zone. That study found no evidence of molecules that are common in Earth\u2019s atmosphere, such as water, carbon dioxide or methane.",
      "Studying these celestial bodies come with significant challenges.",
      "The TRAPPIST-1 star is small but extremely active, which creates a lot of background noise for researchers to sift through. MacDonald and his colleagues, for instance, spent more than a year analyzing data from the Webb telescope and trying to differentiate chemical signatures coming from TRAPPIST-1e and its star.",
      "To confirm the presence of an atmosphere, MacDonald and his colleagues are planning to study TRAPPIST-1e during 15 more transits in the coming years.",
      "Studies are also forthcoming for three other planets that are farther out in the system, TRAPPIST-1f, TRAPPIST-1g and TRAPPIST-1h, he said.",
      "The research should help scientists inch closer to answering some of the most enduring questions about exoplanets and the search for life.",
      "\u201cWe haven\u2019t yet convincingly found an atmosphere on any rocky planet outside of the solar system, which makes studying and searching for atmospheres on temperate planets extremely exciting,\u201d Piaulet-Ghorayeb said. \u201cBut there\u2019s a lot of work to do.\u201d"

      "The interview came shortly after Harry lost an appeal to get his British security detail restored. Harry lost public funding for his protection after he and his wife, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex,  stepped down as working members of the royal family in 2020 and relocated to the United States.

      "Daniel (Laurie Davidson) spends most of the new miniseries \u201cThe Girlfriend\u201d torn between two women: His protective mom, Laura (Robin Wright), and his new girlfriend, Cherry (Olivia Cooke).",
      "The six-episode series, based on a novel by Michelle Frances, follows the three main players in a dance. Laura is suspicious of Cherry from the start \u2014 and, it turns out, with reason. But the lengths she goes to in order to keep Cherry from her son are just as questionable and unforgivable.",
      "In an interview with TODAY.com, Davidson says his character Daniel is \u201cpretty oblivious to what\u2019s going on for a while.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think Daniel probably has a more balanced view of them both. He likes to see the good in both people,\u201d he reflects. \u201cDaniel defends both Laura and Cherry to each other, from each other.\u201d",

      "What Happens at the End of \u2018The Girlfriend\u2019? Robin Wright Unpacks the Surprising Twist",
      "It\u2019s only in the final episode that Daniel awakens to the life-or-death nature of Laura and Cherry\u2019s rivalry, a moment Davidson describes as when \u201cthe penny finally kind of drops.\u201d",
      "By then, Daniel knows his mom\u2019s big secret. She lied to Cherry and said he had died in an attempt to keep them apart. Daniel and Cherry reunite but he\u2019s still open to hearing from his mom. During a rare visit home, Laura makes yet another questionable choice: She drugs Daniel so he has to sit captive and watch an incriminating video about Cherry. Of course, Cherry shows up and the three have a showdown.",
      "Daniel ultimately kills his own mother while trying to save Cherry from drowning.",
      "Waleed Zuaiter, who plays Daniel\u2019s father Harold, likens the moment to a \u201cGreek tragedy\u201d\u2014 overwhelming in its scope and consequences.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like he killed his mom. It\u2019s so overwhelming,\u201d Zuaiter says. The weight of that action will define Daniel\u2019s future, creating what the actor calls \u201ca lot of guilt\u201d and \u201clessons to be learned.\u201d",
      "Another twist happens in the show\u2019s final scene, set months later. Cherry is now pregnant and it seems the family has re-adjusted to their new reality. Harold is in the background, a decision Zuaiter insisted on.",
      "\u201cI wanted to be in the final silhouette of the show. Originally, I wasn\u2019t in there. And I said, I think it\u2019s very important for Howard to, for the audience to go, OK, he\u2019s still in the picture,\u201d he reveals. \u201cHe\u2019s remaining part of this family unit, as flawed as it was.\u201d",
      "Daniel finds his mom\u2019s phone with the video and watches it, learning the truth about his wife, not girlfriend.",
      "Davidson says the \u201cmessy as hell\u201d revelation will likely lead to an entirely new crisis of identity for Daniel, who he thinks will become consumed with finding answers.",
      "\u201cDaniel would go looking for some answers from Cherry. You know, he\u2019s killed his mom to protect who he loved,\u201d he says \u2014 only to learn more about Cherry, and that his mom was protecting him.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s going to need a lot of therapy,\u201d he says.",
      "Both Davidson and Zuaiter are sympathetic to Laura\u2019s no-win scenario, where intervention pushes loved ones away, but inaction feels like betrayal of parental responsibility.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s her responsibility to act in the best interests that she feels for her family. It\u2019s very difficult not to do that,\u201d Davidson says.",
      "When asked about the appropriate level of family involvement in romantic partnerships, Zuaiter doesn\u2019t hesitate: \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t ignore a mother\u2019s instinct.\u201d",
      "Zuiater also thinks the show has a valuable commentary on privilege. Daniel\u2019s family is very wealthy whereas Cherry is trying to transcend her lower class existence.",
      "The show suggests that \u201creal growth happens with change and discomfort,\u201d and the family\u2019s comfortable existence may have actually prevented them from developing healthy coping mechanisms.",
      "The result is what Zuaiter calls \u201ca life and death situation, because they limit their own choices, and they make their own choices about what they\u2019re suppressing, and then it just keeps building and building up.\u201d",
      "The path forward won\u2019t be easy. As Zuaiter puts it: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of skeletons in the closet, and there\u2019s a lot of healing that needs to happen.\u201d",
      "The fear, he says, is that the family will retreat into old patterns and \u201ctheir avoidance routines, which is kind of what got them here.\u201d"

      "Nobody could have seen the twist in the last episode of \u201cThe Girlfriend\u201d coming \u2014 except Robin Wright.",
      "In an interview with TODAY.com, the show\u2019s star and director reveals that she, in fact, came up with the twist. \u201cIt\u2019s more of a surprise,\u201d she says with a smile.",
      "\"The Girlfriend\" is based on a novel of the same name by Michelle Frances and follows the two most important women in an aspiring young doctor's life: His protective mother, Laura (Wright), and his new girlfriend, Cherry (Olivia Cooke).",
      "The series takes alternating viewpoints to unspool the story. Laura is suspicious of Cherry, fearing she's more attracted to the family's wealth than to her son, Daniel (Laurie Davidson) \u2014 and soon, fearing Cherry herself.",
      "Cherry, in Laura, sees an adversary and an obstacle to her ultimate happy ending and ladder up from her lower class upbringing.",
      "How does this tale end? Find out.",

      "Then, Laura makes a drastic decision that changes the course of the show, and her son's life. After an accident during a weekend getaway with Cherry, Daniel falls into a coma. Laura sees his injury as an opening to get rid of Cherry. She tells Cherry that Daniel has died \u2014 but he hasn't. Eventually, Cherry and Daniel figure out the betrayal and reunite.",
      "Still, even after Daniel shuts her out of his life, Laura is desperate to show him who his girlfriend really is. Laura speaks to Cherry's mom and learns all about her past, including the lengths she's willing to go to get what she wants. Cherry's mom paints her as a dangerous figure.",
      "Laura visits Daniel and drugs his drink. All she needs is a moment to play the recording, she says. That, of course, is not what happens. Cherry bursts in and Laura, now desperate herself, chases her around the mansion. It culminates in a showdown in the London home's pool, where Cherry and Laura try to drown each other.",

      "Then, Daniel wakes up from his valium-induced stupor and finishes the job for Cherry.",
      "\"He drowns her in the pool,\" Wright says.",
      "Wright says the twist came during early discussions for \"The Girlfriend\" and how it would compare to the book.",
      "\"Initially, everybody thought, 'Well, this is going to be a no-brainer. Cherry kills Laura, then she wins. And I was like, 'No, let my baby kill me,'\" Wright says, calling it a twist out of a Greek tragedy.",
      "Wright says Laura's decisions are controversial, but Laura's impulse to find fault with her son's partner is relatable.",
      "\"It's always going to be that way (with kids' partners). Not to that degree. But it'll be like, 'Oh, I don't like the way she puts her hands in her pocket,'\" she says.",
      "In this case, though, Laura's worst fears of her son's girlfriend were likely real \u2014 she would do anything to get what she wanted.",
      "Is Laura Really Dead in 'The Girlfriend'?",
      "\"She could still be alive,\" Wright says. \"If he resuscitates her, that's not on camera.\"",
      "Wright says the ending is \"open-ended\" in the sense of Laura's fate. When asked, straight-up, if she's alive, Wright responds, \"We'll see.\"",
      "When it comes to Daniel, his future and next move are also up in the air. The series ends at a gathering with Daniel, his father and Cherry, now pregnant. Daniel finds the phone that his mother had used to record Cherry's mom's confession, then watches it.",
      "All these months later, Cherry's secrets are out. On Daniel's face is a pained look: He killed his mother and now he's stuck with the woman who led him to that point.",
      "\"I said, 'If you guys want to do a Season 2, it should be called 'The Boyfriend.' And he kills her,\" Wright jokes."

      "An Italian journalist, who drew widespread attention for her interview with \u201cAfter the Hunt\u201d stars Ayo Edebiri, Julia Roberts and Andrew Garfield, has finally addressed the controversial moment.",
      "Following an interview for Italy's ArtsLife posted on Sept 5, journalist Federica Polidoro faced backlash after seemingly excluding Edebiri from a conversation around the #MeToo and Black Lives Matter movements in Hollywood.",
      "During the interview, Polidoro called the movements \u201cdone\u201d and solely asked Roberts and Garfield their thoughts on the future of political efforts in the entertainment industry. After appearing shocked at seemingly being ignored, Edebiri immediately piped in to answer the question.",
      "While the interaction prompted controversy, Polidoro defended her question in a statement she shared to Instagram on Sept. 8, adding that she\u2019s been \u201csubjected to personal insults and attacks\u201d following the virality of the interview.",
      "So what exactly happened in the interview? Read on for a detailed breakdown, as well as Polidoro's full response.",
      "What Happened During the Interview?",
      "For Italy\u2019s ArtsLife, Polidoro interviewed \u201cAfter the Hunt\u201d stars Edebiri, Roberts and Garfield about their upcoming film from Italian director Luca Guadagnino.",
      "At one point, Polidoro asked, in part, what can be expected in Hollywood now that \u201cthe MeToo movement and Black Live Matters are done.\u201d After asking the question, all three actors looked at one another for a moment before the journalist clarified she wanted \u201cthe two of you, Andrew and Julia\u201d to answer.",
      "\u201cOh! OK,\u201d Edebiri responded with a slight laugh, before Roberts leaned over and asked Polidoro to repeat the question.",
      "\u201cWith your sunglasses on, I can\u2019t tell which of us you\u2019re talking to, so,\u201d Roberts said.",
      "Reiterating the phrasing of her question, Polidoro said, \u201cThe question was for Julia and Andrew. Now that the MeToo era and Black Lives Matters are done, what do you expect in Hollywood? And what (did we lose) \u2014 if we lost something \u2014 in the political er?\u201d",
      "While Polidoro repeated her question, Edebiri was seen looking surprised and glancing off screen, then letting out a shocked smile while shaking her head.",
      "Almost immediately after the question was asked, Roberts said, \u201cIt\u2019s not done,\u201d while Edebiri simultaneously began responding.",
      "\u201cWell, sorry, yeah, I know that that\u2019s not for me \u2014 and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s purposeful that it\u2019s not for me \u2014 but I just, I\u2019m curious,\u201d Edebiri began. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s done. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s done at all.\u201d",
      "\u201cMaybe hashtags might not be used as much or, but I do think there\u2019s work being done by activists, by people every day that\u2019s beautiful, important work that\u2019s not finished that\u2019s really, really, really active for a reason because this world is really charged,\u201d she continued.",
      "As Edebiri spoke, her co-stars continuously made supportive remarks, with Roberts saying, \u201cI agree with you, it\u2019s not done\u201d of the movements.",
      "\u201cThe Bear\u201d star added that while the #MeToo and Black Lives Matter movements may currently receive less \u201cmainstream coverage\u201d than in the past, \u201cI don\u2019t think that it means that the work is done.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd the movements haven\u2019t been halted in any way. The movements are absolutely alive, as you say,\u201d Andrews said, addressing Edebiri. \u201cJust maybe not as labeled or covered or witnessed or magnified as much in this present moment.\u201d",
      "What Has Italian Journalist Federica Polidoro Said About the Interview?",
      "After the interview sparked controversy and backlash, Polidoro broke her silence Sept. 8 in a lengthy statement on Instagram, defending the phrasing of her question.",
      "As an Instagram reel and in the complimentary caption, Polidoro wrote that she has been \u201csubjected to personal insults and attacks because of a question that,\u201d adding that \u201cfor some reason,\u201d the question \u201cwas not well received by some members of the public.\u201d",
      "\u201cI find it striking that those who unjustly accuse me of racism and consider themselves custodians of justice find acceptable violent language, personal attacks, and cyberbullying,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI would like to clarify that, rather than focusing on the thoughtful responses of Ayo Edebiri, Julia Roberts, and Andrew Garfield, the discussion continues solely on how I should have phrased the question.\u201d",
      "\u201cAll the contributions from those present were reported in full in the published interview, without any omissions,\u201d she continued. \u201cTo date, I am not aware of any protocol that dictates the order in which questions must be asked in an interview.\u201d",
      "Addressing the online backlash, Polidoro wrote that solely the Journalists\u2019 Association has the power to \u201cevaluate the work of professionals,\u201d adding that \u201ccensoring or delegitimizing questions considered \u2018uncomfortable\u2019 does not fall within the practice of democracy.\u201d",
      "\"To those who unjustly accuse me of racism, I would like to clarify that in my work I have interviewed people of every background and ethnicity, and my own family is multi-ethnic, matriarchal, and feminist, with a significant history of immigration,\" she wrote.",
      "Polidoro claimed to have worked with \u201cnumerous national and international publications of all political orientations\u201d for over 20 years, while \u201calways approaching my work with openness and professional rigor.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn my view, the real racists are those who see racism everywhere and seek to muzzle journalism, limiting freedom of analysis, critical thinking, and the plurality of perspectives,\u201d she added.",
      "Concluding her statement, Polidoro maintained that her role as a journalist is to \u201cask questions, even on delicate topics, with respect and responsibility.\u201d",
      "\u201cI will not tolerate or accept defamatory or violent language, and I reserve the right to seek legal protection against those who, in recent days, have chosen to hide behind the digital mob to insult and attack me instead of seeking a civil and constructive discussion,\u201d Polidoro wrote."

Her sister and her cousin joined them as they made their way west to the city of Mykolaiv.",

      "No one from Save Ukraine accompanied the group, she said, but its representatives were in touch by phone and arranged for her to be put up by a volunteer in a temporary home.",
      "Although she was roughly searched by masked men on arrival, Tatiana said, things initially seemed to be going well. But on the second day, she said, agents from the Federal Security Service (FSB), the successor to the KGB spy agency, came around, put a mask over her head and took her somewhere for questioning, after \u201cconfiscating my documents and my phone.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey interrogated me, maybe six or seven hours,\u201d she said, adding that she was locked in a basement cell overnight before further questioning the following morning. Her interrogators were particularly interested in Save Ukraine, she said.",
      "They also brought a cameraman and a journalist, who she said expected her to say \u201chow great Russia is, how it helps us and how bad Ukraine is for us.\u201d",
      "While she was initially reluctant, she said, she was able to use Vlad\u2019s phone to consult with Save Ukraine via text message. Tatiana said the group told her: \u201cDo what is necessary, just for you to leave from there.\u201d",
      "The FSB did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "After giving the interview on camera, she said, she was released with Vlad and allowed to make the arduous journey home.",
      "\u201cIt was just happiness after the horror. \u2026 I was simply amazed,\u201d Tatiana said.",
      "Kidnapped children are now spread out across approximately 200 locations from the Black Sea to Russia\u2019s Pacific coast, according to Nathaniel Raymond, the executive director of the Yale School of Public Health\u2019s Humanitarian Research Lab (HRL), the leading body tracking kidnapped Ukrainian children.",
      "The group has monitored the movement of children by analyzing satellite photos and photographing airplanes and vehicles apparently used to transport the kids, among other techniques.",
      "\u201cThey don\u2019t all come from the same place. They don\u2019t all go to the same place. They don\u2019t all have the same purpose,\u201d Raymond said in a telephone interview last month.",
      "Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., have floated the possibility of introducing a bill in the Senate that, if passed, could designate Russia and Belarus as state sponsors of terrorism over the kidnapping of Ukrainian children, a source familiar with the bill told NBC News in mid-August. A draft of the bill says that Belarus \u201chas directly supported the kidnapping of Ukrainian children and supported their relocation.\u201d",
      "But both Save Ukraine and the HRL took a financial hit last spring after the Trump administration cut funding for their programs.",
      "As Russia pushes to take control of more Ukrainian territory, rescuing the Ukrainian children has become an even more urgent issue, experts say.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s all the more reason to get all the kids we can back before the door closes,\u201d Raymond said.",

      "CHONGQING, China \u2014 For nearly two months, health officials in southern China have been waging war on mosquitos, reviving top-down tactics from the country\u2019s zero-Covid playbook.",
      "Since July, the province of Guangdong alone has reported more than 10,000 cases of chikungunya fever, a mosquito-borne viral disease that mostly circulates in tropical regions. Foshan, a manufacturing hub in densely populated Guangdong, has been the hardest-hit Chinese city \u2014 recording over 600 new infections per day at its peak, more than the combined total of 519 cases reported across mainland China from 2010 to 2019.",
      "The unprecedented outbreak prompted Chinese authorities to adopt a containment strategy akin to the country\u2019s strict zero-Covid policy \u2014 a \u201cdetect and eliminate\u201d approach.",
      "To curb the spread, workers were sent out to spray insecticide in affected areas multiple times a day. The government also required suspected patients to report their cases promptly and comply with the quarantine mandate.",
      "The outbreak in China was triggered by warmer weather this year and a fast-spreading virus strain, Liu Qiyong, chief expert of vector control at China\u2019s Center for Disease Control and Prevention, told state-run broadcaster CCTV.",
      "But the surge in chikungunya cases extends far beyond China as global warming accelerates the spread of infectious diseases, including dengue fever and malaria, a 2025 study found.",
      "As of mid-August, about 270,000 cases of chikungunya had been recorded globally this year, including in the Americas, Europe and Southeast Asia, leading to at least 110 related deaths, according to the Pan American Health Organization.",
      "While no locally acquired cases have been reported in U.S. states or territories since 2019, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a travel health notice in August urging \u201cenhanced precaution\u201d amid chikungunya outbreaks in China\u2019s Guangdong province and four other countries. The CDC warned that anyone spending time in areas where chikungunya occurs is at risk.",
      "\u201cIn this rapidly changing world, infectious disease can disseminate very quickly,\u201d said Jasper Chan, a professor of clinical microbiology and infection at the University of Hong Kong.",
      "\u201cEspecially after the recent Covid-19 pandemic, relevant authorities have been quite, I would say, cautious in terms of making these alert issues,\u201d he said.",
      "Chikungunya 101",
      "The chikungunya virus, first identified in Tanzania in 1952, has spread for decades mainly in the Americas, Africa and Asia. It is transmitted primarily through the bites of infected mosquitos and does not spread directly from person to person.",
      "\u201cChikungunya virus very closely resembles other mosquito-borne viruses like dengue clinically, but they belong to different families,\u201d Chan said.",
      "Its name, which comes from a language in southern Tanzania, means \u201cto bend over,\u201d a reference to the debilitating joint pain it causes. Though it is rarely fatal, chikungunya can have long-lasting, severe symptoms, including muscle pain, headache, nausea, fatigue and rash, according to the World Health Organization.",
      "As there is no specific antiviral drug to cure chikungunya, current treatment is focused primarily on relieving the symptoms. One vaccine is available in the United States. Prevention is the best protection, according to the CDC, which advises people to avoid mosquito bites and get vaccinated if necessary before they travel to places where chikungunya occurs.",
      "Chikungunya has been reported in over 110 countries across every continent except Antarctica, with at least 5.6 billion people living in places at risk from it, the WHO estimated.",
      "The disease spreads through global travelers via mosquitoes. A person gets bitten in one country, boards a plane with the virus still in the bloodstream and lands thousands of miles away, where a mosquito picks up the infection and passes it to the next person. The cycle then begins again, eventually leading to a local outbreak.",
      "Though the United States is unlikely to experience large outbreaks since people in warm areas often stay indoors with air conditioning, experts advise using mosquito repellent, wearing long sleeves and delaying trips to regions with chikungunya outbreaks.",
      "How China battles chikungunya",
      "While chikungunya is not uncommon in other parts of the world, such as Latin America, it is unusual to have big outbreaks in China, where the first imported case was identified in 2008, experts say.",
      "To stop the spread, local authorities have enlisted grassroots workers to disperse insecticide on the streets and clear stagnant pools of water where mosquitos breed. Clinics and hospitals have set up mosquito-proof beds to isolate patients, and residents have been urged to install screen windows and to light mosquito coils at home.",
      "People and organizations in China are bound by law to follow instructions from health officials in containing the virus. Failure to comply can lead to warnings, fines and even civil liability.",
      "Some have criticized the government\u2019s campaign as overkill reminiscent of Covid-era public health controls, while others have praised the quick, large-scale action.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really great to see years of accumulated old trash removed,\u201d a user wrote on RedNote, a Chinese social media platform similar to Instagram. \u201cBut it\u2019s a bit too much to dump out even the cats\u2019 water bowls. That\u2019s a classic case of the one-size-fits-all approach.\u201d",
      "China\u2019s strict controls have curbed the outbreak. As of Aug. 25, Foshan had kept new daily cases under 50 for nine days. Health officials announced that the city of more than 9 million people had ended its public health emergency response, which lasted for about a month.",
      "Experts say the bigger challenge is the impact of climate change, as rising temperatures and more severe weather create new habitats for virus-carrying mosquitos to thrive and spread diseases.",
      "Because of unusually hot weather in recent years, there has been an \u201cincreasing number\u201d of locally acquired chikungunya cases in areas that had been unaffected by the virus for the past decade, such as Europe, Chan said.",
      "\u201cRemember, humans are not alone in this globe. We\u2019re living with animals, birds, various other species, as well as all these vectors, including mosquitoes, ticks and other vectors,\u201d he said.",

      "The organizers of a Gaza aid flotilla said Tuesday that two of their boats had been attacked by drones in Tunisian waters.",
      "The Global Sumud Flotilla said Alma, a British-flagged boat in the civilian fleet, was hit by a drone while it was docked in the second such strike in two days. On Monday, the group said that one of its main boats, which is Portuguese-flagged, was also hit.",
      "Both incidents caused fire damage but no injuries, according to GSF.",
      "The attacks are an \u201corchestrated attempt to distract and derail\u201d the group\u2019s mission to deliver aid for Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, GSF said in a statement, stressing that members were \u201cundeterred.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur peaceful voyage to break Israel\u2019s illegal siege on Gaza and stand in unwavering solidarity with its people presses forward with determination and resolve,\u201d it added.",
      "While a \u201cfull investigation\u201d is ongoing, Alma crew members have recovered a charred electronic device from the deck that further indicates the boat was \u201cdeliberately targeted,\u201d GSF said in a separate statement on Instagram.",
      "A spokesperson for the Tunisian Coast Guard did not respond to a call on the latest reported attack from Reuters on Wednesday.",
      "Officials earlier denied that the first boat had been attacked by a drone, saying the explosion came from inside the vessel. A National Guard spokesperson told local media that claims of the first drone attack on the flotilla \u201chave no basis in truth,\u201d Reuters reported Tuesday.",
      "With around 20 boats and participants from 44 countries, including activist Greta Thunberg, the group is the largest civilian maritime attempt to break the Israeli blockade of the Palestinian territory.",
      "Miguel Duarte, a crew member, said the suspected drone stopped close to the flotilla, moved slowly to the front and then dropped \u201cwhat was obviously a bomb\u201d on the forward part of the deck.",
      "\u201cLet me be clear 100%. It was a drone dropping a bomb on the forward deck of our ship,\u201d Duarte said when he was asked whether the team was \u201cabsolutely certain that this was a drone attack,\u201d a video he posted on Instagram shows.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m OK, but we could have been killed, right?\u201d Duarte said, citing the deaths during the Israel-Hamas war of humanitarian and medical workers.",
      "\u201cWe know the dangers that we\u2019re facing,\u201d he said.",
      "After the explosion, crew members repeatedly yelled for help and sounded the fire alarm, according to a CCTV video shared by Francesca Albanese, the U.N. special rapporteur for the West Bank and Gaza.",
      "\u201cIf it\u2019s confirmed that this is a drone attack, it will be an assault and aggression against Tunisia and against Tunisian sovereignty,\u201d Albanese said. \u201cAnd again, we cannot keep on tolerating this and normalizing the illegal.\u201d",
      "Demonstrators gathered at the port of Tunis around 2 a.m. local time (10 p.m. Monday ET), some waving Palestinian and Turkish flags and chanting \u201cFree Palestine,\u201d according to a video reposted by GSF.",
      "In 2010, Israeli forces stormed a Turkish aid ship bound for Gaza and killed at least nine pro-Palestinian activists, sparking global outrage.",
      "In June, Israel intercepted a vessel of the Gaza Freedom Flotilla and detained all 12 people on board, including Thunberg.",
      "Starvation deaths in Gaza surged after Israel\u2019s blockade in March, and aid was resumed in May under a system backed by the United States and Israel. Since then, nearly 1,400 people have died and 4,000 more have been injured seeking food, with at least 859 killed near aid sites, the United Nations says."

      "\"These are the same terrorists, terrorist chiefs, who planned, launched and celebrated the horrific massacres of October 7th,\" he said.",
      "Trump's criticism may have stemmed from his being kept in the dark about Israel\u2019s attack plans.

      "The attack could easily derail all diplomatic efforts for a peace deal. On Friday, Trump said the United States is in \u201cvery deep\u201d negotiations with Hamas.",
      "At the same time, Trump wrote Tuesday that \u201celiminating Hamas, who have profited off the misery of those living in Gaza, is a worthy goal.\u201d The comment made his public criticism of Israel even more unexpected.",
      "The attack leaves the status of the talks to end the conflict in Gaza \u2014 and the fate of the remaining hostages \u2014 in limbo, particularly after Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, Qatar\u2019s prime minister, called the Israeli strike an act of \u201ctreachery.\u201d",
      "Trump spoke to Al Thani and the emir of Qatar on Tuesday to reassure them that such an attack would not be repeated.",
      "Still, it is clear that the attack has created some friction between the United States and Qatar. Al Thani was not shy about disputing Trump\u2019s account of the events leading up to the attack.",
      "Trump posted that he had \u201cimmediately\u201d instructed his special envoy, Steve Witkoff, to inform Qatar about the impending attack. Al Thani said the first call the Qataris received from a U.S. official was 10 minutes after the attack."

Adam Smith of Washington, the former chairman of the House Armed Services Committee and current top Democrat on the panel. Smith confirmed the trip to NBC News on Tuesday afternoon.",
      "A second lawmaker confirmed they were attending the CODEL as well. Smith said that both Democratic and Republican members of the House Armed Services Committee would participate, but that Chairman Mike Rogers, R-Ala., would not be part of the delegation.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s fairly significant. It\u2019s part of wanting to try to open up a dialogue between the U.S. and China. And I personally think it\u2019s important that you do that,\u201d Smith said in an interview just off the House floor.",
      "\u201cMerely talking with China is not endorsing everything that they do. It\u2019s like China is a big, powerful country. We are a big, powerful country. I think we need to talk about that,\u201d he continued. \u201cSo there\u2019s no significance at the timing. I think it should happen more often, on a frequent basis.\u201d",
      "Asked if the lawmakers would meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping, Smith replied: \u201cWe\u2019re asking. We don\u2019t know yet.\u201d",
      "Some high-level U.S.-China talks are already happening. On Tuesday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth spoke to his Chinese counterpart, Admiral Dong Jun, by video teleconference in their first publicly known conversation, according to two U.S. officials familiar with the call. The Pentagon on Wednesday confirmed that the phone call happened, saying they \"exchanged views in a candid and constructive manner\" and agreed to more talks.",
      "\"Secretary Hegseth made clear that the United States does not seek conflict with China nor is it pursuing regime change or strangulation of the PRC,\" chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said. \"At the same time, however, he forthrightly relayed that the U.S. has vital interests in the Asia-Pacific, the priority theater, and will resolutely protect those interests.\"",
      "Details of the lawmakers' visit are being tightly held, and even senior members of the committee were unaware it was happening. A Rogers spokesperson did not respond to questions about the trip.",
      "Smith declined to provide the names of lawmakers who will be attending or the exact dates of the travel. However, the House will be on a recess the week of Sept. 22 for the Rosh Hashanah holiday.",
      "The CODEL will also include a stop in Cambodia, Smith said, but Taiwan will not be on the itinerary.",
      "The visit comes as the Trump administration and Beijing continue negotiating a trade deal. Trump has imposed significant tariffs on China and other trading partners, but he extended the deadline to Nov. 10 for those tariffs to kick in, to give the two sides more time to strike a deal.",
      "\"My important message is, you know, we have to have dialogue and communication,\" Smith said. \"I am deeply worried that, yes, China is a major rising power that we seem to be talking less and less to. We need to figure out a way to resolve our differences and can't do it by not talking to each other.\"",
      "In 2023, then-Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., led a bipartisan delegation of senators to China, where they met with Xi and discussed issues such as trade, economic competition and fentanyl, according to Schumer.",
      "But House lawmakers had not visited China since March 2019, when Reps. Rick Larsen, D-Wash., and Darin LaHood, R-Ill. \u2014 then the co-chairs of the U.S.-China Working Group \u2014 led a bipartisan group to Beijing. Unlike an official government-funded CODEL, that 2019 trip was sponsored by the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations.",
      "The Covid-19 pandemic struck a year later, and official House travel to the region has since focused on Taiwan, Japan and other U.S. allies.",
      "In 2022, then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., made an unannounced visit to Taiwan during a CODEL to Asia, angering Beijing and sparking live-fire military exercises around the self-governing island that China claims as its own.",
      "A year later, then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., led a House delegation to Taiwan and met with then-President Tsai Ing-wen, just as Pelosi\u2019s group did.",
      "And in 2024, then-Foreign Affairs Chairman Mike McCaul, R-Texas, led a House delegation to meet with Taiwan\u2019s new president, Lai Ching-te, promising that more weapons were on the way."

      "Australia has approved the first vaccine to protect its shrinking koala population against chlamydia, a disease that accounts for as many as half of deaths in the wild among the country\u2019s iconic marsupials.",
      "Researchers spent over 10 years developing the single-dose vaccine, which Australia\u2019s veterinary medicine regulator has approved for use in wildlife hospitals and veterinary clinics and in the field.",
      "There are estimated to be 224,000 to 524,000 koalas left in Australia, according to Australia\u2019s national science agency, which cited numbers from the National Koala Monitoring Program. According to the World Wide Fund for Nature, the koala population has been cut in half in the past 20 years.",
      "Since 2022, they have been listed as endangered in Queensland, New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory, where the monitoring program estimates the combined population is 95,000 to 238,000.",
      "Along with habitat loss, climate change and bushfires, a major reason for koalas\u2019 vulnerability is chlamydia, a sexually transmitted infection also found in humans that can cause infertility and blindness.",
      "It is not uncommon for half the koalas within a population to be infected, and rates can go as high as 70%, said Peter Timms, a professor of microbiology who led the research at the University of the Sunshine Coast in Queensland.",
      "\u201cSome individual colonies are edging closer to local extinction every day,\u201d Timms said in a statement Wednesday.",
      "While both male and female koalas can contract chlamydia through physical contact such as mating, it is a different strain from the one found in humans. A joey can also contract it from an infected mother\u2019s pouch.",
      "The vaccine was found to have reduced the likelihood of koalas\u2019 developing symptoms of chlamydia during breeding age and decreased mortality from the disease in wild populations by at least 65%.",
      "Before it was approved, the vaccine was tested on more than 500 koalas in eight trials.",
      "According to Samuel Phillips, a molecular microbiologist and senior researcher at the University of the Sunshine Coast who worked on the project, the vaccine offers three levels of protection: reducing infection, preventing progression to clinical disease and in some cases reversing existing symptoms.",
      "\u201cRegistration of the vaccine has been very challenging,\u201d he told NBC News. \u201cWe started this five years ago, thinking it would take one year, and here we are. Five years later, we finally got to the point.\u201d",
      "Until now, the only treatment available to koalas infected with chlamydia was antibiotics, but they can make it difficult for koalas to digest food, leading to starvation and sometimes even death.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s quite humbling, really. I keep thinking to myself, [I] can\u2019t believe that we did this,\u201d Phillips said."

      "As well as Russia's deliberate, nightly bombardment of Ukrainian cities, some 98% of civilian casualties along the front lines have happened in Ukraine-controlled territory, indicating that Russia was the aggressor, according to United Nations monitors. In total, July saw 286 people killed and another 1,388 injured, the highest since May 2022.",
      "Russia currently controls around 20% of Ukrainian territory, including all of the Luhansk region and part of Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. Russian President Vladimir Putin has made full control over these a key demand in his war aims, claiming that he wants to protect ethnic Russians there.",
      "Trump has taken an increasingly tough rhetorical line on Putin, giving him various ultimatums to stop the killing. But he has rarely followed through with significant steps to punish Moscow, often extending his deadlines.",
      "On Sunday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent signaled that the U.S. is open to partnering with European countries to impose more sanctions on countries that buy Russian oil in an attempt to \"collapse\" Moscow\u2019s economy.",
      "A day later, U.S. and European officials met at the U.S. Treasury Department to discuss various forms of economic pressure to exert on Russia, including new sanctions and tariffs on Russian oil purchases, a person familiar told The Associated Press.",
      "Trump once said he could stop the war in 24 hours but has found the reality thornier.",
      "Putin, who is making grinding, attritional battlefield gains, has not shifted his stance that he will only end the war if Ukraine effectively surrenders, demilitarizes and abandons ambitions of growing ties with the West. Zelenskyy says he is ready to accept an immediate ceasefire but is wary of allowing Russia to regroup and attack again.",
      "Artem Grudinin reported from Kyiv and Alexander Smith from London."

    "published": "Mon, 08 Sep 2025 14:30:36 GMT",
    "summary": "France's National Assembly is set to vote for a motion of no confidence in Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou, less than a year after they did the same for Michel Barnier.",
    "story": [
      "The French government was thrown into fresh turmoil Monday as lawmakers fired the prime minister, the latest leader tossed out by a deeply divided legislature.",
      "Parliamentarians on the left and right ousted Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou with a whopping 364-194 vote against him in a motion of no confidence. They are unhappy about his proposal to make drastic cuts of around 44 billion euros ($51 billion) to next year\u2019s budget, an unpopular attempt to resolve France\u2019s economic woes.",
      "A statement from the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace said that French President Emmanuel Macron will appoint a new prime minister \"in the coming days.\"",
      "After the vote, some politicians also called for Macron's ouster. \u201cBayrou has fallen. Victory and relief for the people,\" said Jean-Luc Melenchon, head of the radical left France Unbowed party. \"Macron is now on the front line facing the people. He too must go.\u201d",
      "This was the second time in nine months that lawmakers in France\u2019s National Assembly ousted a prime minister; Michel Barnier was deposed in a vote of no confidence in December. Before that, the last successful vote of no confidence was in 1962. It means Macron will be looking for his fifth prime minister in just 20 months.",
      "Though Macron remains a big presence internationally \u2014 leading European efforts to support Ukraine and provide a counterweight to President Donald Trump \u2014 at home he is dogged by a divided electorate and long-term uncertainty.",
      "Macron, in his second term, is barred by term limits from running in the next presidential election in 2027. The far-right National Rally is leading the polls, even though its leader, Marine le Pen, is barred from office because of an embezzlement conviction, which she is appealing.",
      "As in the rest of Europe, the far right is surging in France, capitalizing on widespread discontent over a cost-of-living crisis that has fueled a rise in anti-immigrant sentiment. And on Wednesday, large anti-government protests are expected throughout France.",
      "\u201cThis is a moment of truth. At a time when those in charge are forced to reveal the disastrous results of five decades of wasteful management,\" le Pen said before the vote. \"The pitiful spectacle of a collapse for the country, a disaster for the French people today ... the consequences will affect future generations for the nation.\"",
      "France\u2019s troubles took root last year when Le Pen\u2019s National Rally performed well in Europe-wide elections and Macron stunned the Continent by calling snap parliamentary elections. Parties on the left and right were able to work together to block a victory for Le Pen, but the resulting Parliament was divided, with no group holding enough power to govern with stability.",
      "Macron cobbled together a minority government, but as Bayrou and Barnier have found, it is extremely vulnerable to attack by its leftist and hard-right opponents. Many French political experts say the current crisis will persist until 2027 when the country elects a new leader, who will inevitably seek to cement their mandate by calling fresh parliamentary elections.",
      "This will do little to resolve France\u2019s short-term economic woes. Both Bayrou and Barnier were ousted while trying to resolve what they and many others see as a national debt crisis.",
      "France\u2019s budget deficit \u2014 how much more it spends than it earns \u2014 last year reached 5.8% of its gross domestic product. That\u2019s far higher than the European Union average of 3.1% and the E.U.\u2019s target of 3%, worrying investors about rising interest rates, lower credit ratings and less money for public services in the future."
