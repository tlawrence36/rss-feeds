      "A federal judge says Russian soprano Anna Netrebko can move forward with her case claiming national original discrimination by the Metropolitan Opera",
      "NEW YORK -- A federal judge says Russian soprano Anna Netrebko can move forward with her case claiming national original discrimination by the Metropolitan Opera, which dropped her after she refused to repudiate President Vladimir Putin over Russia's campaign against Ukraine.",
      "The decision by U.S. District Judge Analisa Nadine Torres in Manhattan was made public Wednesday, a day after it was issued. The case, which will proceed alongside her claim of gender discrimination, has yet to be scheduled for trial.",
      "The Met did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Met General Manager Peter Gelb had demanded that she repudiate Putin shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, but she refused and was withdrawn from three Met productions. The Met replaced her with Ukrainian soprano Liudmyla Monastyrska in at least one of those productions.",

      "Last August, Torres dismissed the performer's national original discrimination claim, when she also threw out allegations of defamation and breach of contract.

      "The American Guild of Musical Artists filed a grievance on Netrebko\u2019s behalf and arbitrator Howard C. Edelman ruled in February 2023 that the Met violated the union\u2019s collective bargaining agreement when it canceled deals with Netrebko for three productions. Edelman awarded compensation the union calculated at $209,103.48.",
      "Torres allowed Netrebko to proceed with her separate allegation of gender discrimination under the New York State Human Rights Law and New York City Human Rights Law. She said the Met treated Netrebko's male counterparts with connections to Putin and the Russian government more favorably. She cited bass-baritone Evgeny Nikitin and baritones Igor Golovatenko and Alexey Markov, who have continued to sing at the Met.",

      "Blues legend Buddy Guy will release a new album on Wednesday, his 89th birthday",
      "NEW YORK -- For Buddy Guy \u2014 a stalwart and staunch defender of the blues \u2014 there's nothing more important than keeping his chosen genre at the forefront of conversation. It comes naturally: Guy is one of America's greatest guitar players, a singular artist with a thick roster of A-list super fans \u2014 Eric Clapton, Jimmy Page and Gary Clark Jr. among them.",
      "The list also includes innovative writer and director Ryan Coogler, who tapped Guy for his critically acclaimed film \u201cSinners\u201d earlier this year, and artists like Peter Frampton and the Eagles' Joe Walsh, who feature on his new album \u201cAin't Done with the Blues.\u201d It releases Wednesday, on Guy's 89th birthday.",
      "For the eight-time Grammy Award-winning musician, those recognitions aren't priority. The longevity of the music that made his life is his primary concern. \u201cLike I promised B.B. King, Muddy Waters and all of them,\u201d he tells The Associated Press over the phone, \u201cI do the best I can to keep the blues alive.\u201d",
      "He's concerned that radio stations no longer play the blues, and that the genre might miss out on connecting with younger listeners. It's one of the reasons \u201cAin't Done with the Blues\u201d is a strong collection of classics that run the risk of being forgotten \u2014 like on the album closer \u201cTalk to Your Daughter,\u201d a rendition of the J.B. Lenoir tune.",
      "In Guy's performance, there's an undeniable universality. \u201cBlues is based on everyday life,\u201d he says. \u201cA good time or a bad time.\u201d",
      "Or, another way Guy explains it: \u201cMusic is like a bowl of real good gumbo. They got all kinds of meat in there. You got chicken in there, you got sausage in there. You got a seafood in it. ... When we play music, we put everything in there.\u201d",
      "It's resonating. In its 2025 midyear report, Luminate, an industry data and analytics company, found that U.S. on-demand audio streams of blues music has climbed this year due to the success of \u201cSinners.\u201d",

      "Returning director Pierre Perifel, writers Yoni Brenner and Etan Cohen and the same voice cast have done what all sequels do these days \u2014 amp it all up like everyone is on molly, try to hit the same emotional notes and layer an insane plot with the fate of the world at stake. It's hard to watch a franchise drift so expensively and pointlessly in Earth's orbit.",
      "The gang is all back: Sam Rockwell as Mr. Wolf,Marc Maron as safe-cracker Mr. Snake, Craig Robinson as master-of disguise Mr. Shark, Anthony Ramos as Mr. Piranha and Awkwafina as hacker Ms. Tarantula. We left them in the last movie walking out of prison early after good behavior and trying to turn their back on bad-hood.",
      "It's not that easy since would-be employers these days want to know about gaps in their job experience \u2014 they were robbing banks, after all \u2014 workplace trust issues and salary expectations. No one wants to hire a bunch of ex-cons.",
      "\u201cAnyone who wants to change has to start somewhere,\u201d Mr. Wolf, pushing the George Clooney-like charm offensive, begs one dubious interviewer. \u201cI'm just asking for a chance.\u201d",
      "A life on the straight-and-narrow is hard for four of the former baddies, but not Maron \u2014 so perfectly cast as the grouchy, self-loathing snake. Now he spends his days doing Vinyasa yoga, listening to Sabrina Carpenter's \u201cEspresso,\u201d telling people \"namaste\" and sips wheatgrass kombucha with dandelion. He's even more irritating.",
      "Soon all five are caught in a series of traps and double-crosses by a new robbery crew \u2014 Danielle Brooks\u2019 lollipop-licking venomous snow leopard, Maria Bakalova\u2019s Bulgarian wild boar engineer and Natasha Lyonne\u2019s wry raven, using her same vocal tick as on \u201cPoker Face.\u201d These dames have a plan to get very rich using a substance known as MacGuffinite, a clever \u2014 or lazy \u2014 joke on the object that everyone wants in a movie like this, which drives the plot.",

Then the rocket has to be stopped before a gadget aboard creates a \u201c24-carat catastrophe.\u201d",
      "The animation is amazingly kinetic and with no corners cut, from tiny bugs illuminated in a light beam at night to the bumpy way a truck moves on the highway. The franchise's love of vroooming and fishtailing Looney Tunes-like car chases stays intact, as does the wavy green air farts that emanate from Piranha.",

It was all nicely set against a zombie guinea pig uprising.",
      "This time the writers have just given up on what side of the ethical divide their anti-heroes are on. \u201cAre we bad again?\u201d ask the confused piranha. Replies Mr. Wolf: \u201cI get it.

      "\u201cThe Bad Guys 2,\u201d a Universal Pictures release in theaters Friday, is rated PG for \u201caction/mild violence, rude humor, and language.\u201d Running time: 104 minutes. One and a half stars out of four.",

      "Rene\u00e9 Rapp's second album, \u201cBite Me,\u201d gave the 25-year-old multi-hyphenate an outlet to work through the whirlwind that has been her career so far",
      "NEW YORK -- Rene\u00e9 Rapp was clear on her intentions for her sophomore album, \u201cBite Me,\u201d from the start.",
      "\u201cI wanted to love this,\u201d Rapp says. \u201cI wanted to be able to walk away from this and be so proud of myself and impressed, no matter what anybody else thought.\u201d Her first album, 2023's \u201cSnow Angel, \u201d  had been an experiment in figuring out her sound (a mix of pop, R&B and heart-wrenching ballads), and assembling a collection of songs that worked together. This album, out Friday, offered the chance to do it again, with an eye toward the way her life had changed in the intervening years.",
      "\u201cThat intention, and also wanting to prove it to myself, was really grueling,\u201d Rapp told The Associated Press. \u201cAnd also really fun.\u201d",
      "The writing process gave Rapp, 25, an outlet to work through the burnout-inducing whirlwind that was her career in those two years. Uncharacteristically restrained in its vocal styling, the album's lead single, \u201cLeave Me Alone,\u201d is strikingly open \u2014 clever zingers allude to her departure from HBO\u2019s \u201cSex Lives of College Girls,\u201d the media frenzy that surrounded her turn as Regina in the 2024 remake of \u201cMean Girls,\u201d and the external pressure she felt to put out more music after the positive reception of \u201cSnow Angel.\u201d Basically, anything that's been said about her in the last few years? She reframes it, poking fun at her reputation and the industry.",
      "\u201cLeave Me Alone\u201d felt like a proper introduction to the album, Rapp says, and \u201cBite Me\u201d \u2014 both a warning and a tease \u2014 the appropriate title. Paris Hilton and Monica Lewinsky were among the famous faces that teased the album upon its announcement, donning merch emblazoned with the title in bold print. Rapp herself posed in front of a newsstand filled with mock tabloids depicting her as a diva, concealed behind big sunglasses and a fur coat, to promote the second single, \u201cMad.\u201d (\u201cThat's a Rapp!\u201d the headline read.)",
      "\u201cIt really feels just like a time capsule of those two years of my life, a lot having to do with the business and the industry and people\u2019s expectations of me,\u201d Rapp says of the album. \u201cAnd then also me wanting things for myself and being confused where those two roads diverge.\u201d",
      "Rapp's confidence and humor is evident across the album, just as it is on stage \u2014 \u201cI write lyrics in the way that I talk,\u201d she says. Many of the tracks tackle the destabilizing emotions that accompany the beginning and end of relationships, whether platonic or romantic, and how her now-very public career has amplified the challenges of creating, and maintaining, those connections.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m so surrounded all the time, but I feel so lonely, and it feels really heavy and isolating. And I think a lot of that is just being an artist. And I also think a lot of that is just like the nature of like the business, for better or for worse,\" she says. The can't-be-bothered attitude heard on \u201cLeave Me Alone\u201d is countered by the ache of \u201cThat's So Funny,\u201d which recounts the end of a deeply affecting, but ultimately toxic friendship in Rapp's signature soaring vocals.",

      "In June, Rapp served as a grand marshal of the World Pride parade in Washington, D.C., alongside Laverne Cox and Deacon Maccubbin. \u201cIt can be difficult to feel resilient and empowered as a queer person,\u201d Rapp said. \u201cBecause World Pride was in D.C., I was like, well, I can\u2019t not be there.\u201d She recalled a conversation with Cox, who dispelled some of Rapp's fears of coming off as self-important in the role by emphasizing the power of showing up, and showing face. \u201cRight now, when everything is so under attack, which it pretty much always is, it feels like that\u2019s the time to be really loud.\u201d",

      "Duane \u201cKeffe D\u201d Davis filed an appeal with the court Tuesday after a lower court judge upheld his charges.",
      "Davis, the only man ever to be charged in Shakur's killing, was arrested in September 2023. Other conspirators in the drive-by shooting have since died.",
      "The 62-year-old has admitted in interviews and in his 2019 tell-all memoir, \u201cCompton Street Legend,\u201d that he provided the gun used in the shooting.",
      "His attorney, Carl Arnold, said Davis\u2019 constitutional rights were being violated.",
      "\u201cMr. Davis cooperated with law enforcement over the course of more than a decade, relying on repeated assurances that his statements would not be used against him \u2014 yet those very statements now form the core of the State\u2019s case,\u201d Arnold said in a statement.",
      "Arnold first filed a motion to dismiss the case in January of this year, alleging constitutional violations because of a 27-year delay in prosecution. He also said Davis had immunity agreements granted to him by federal and local authorities.",

      "According to the appeal, Davis was interviewed in 1998 and 1999 by federal prosecutors under the agreement that his statements would not be used to prosecute him. At the time, he denied knowing who was involved in Shakur's killing.",
      "He was interviewed again in 2008 and 2009 under the same conditions that he would not be prosecuted with his statements, according to the appeal. It was then that he described his \u201calleged involvement in the murder and identified the alleged shooter,\" the appeal said.",
      "Arnold said prosecutors had not presented any evidence connecting Davis to the slaying other than his own statements, which is not enough for a trial. He asked the Nevada Supreme Court to grant their motion to dismiss the case, or recognize that he was granted immunity from prosecution for the statements he made during law enforcement interviews.",
      "Davis remains in custody at the Clark County Detention Center. His trial is scheduled to begin in early February 2026.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- No matter the time on Martha's Vineyard, a shimmering glow will be powered by the star presence of Black filmmakers, actors and tastemakers like Issa Rae, Mara Brock Akil and Michelle Obama who are shaping culture on their own terms.",
      "For two-plus decades, the Martha's Vineyard African American Film Festival has been a cultural reunion, a summer sanctuary and a safe haven where some of the industry's most influential voices converge in Oak Bluffs, Massachusetts. This week marks the return of the 23rd annual nine-day celebration, which kicks off Friday with a stacked slate that includes appearances from singer-actor Jennifer Hudson and Hall of Fame basketball player Dwyane Wade, screenings like Spike Lee 's \u201cHighest 2 Lowest\u201d and intimate conversations with figures such as the Rev. Al Sharpton.",
      "Over the years, the festival has drawn the who\u2019s who of Black Hollywood \u2014 including Ava DuVernay, Kerry Washington, Tyler Perry and Regina King. The Obamas made a surprise appearance in 2022.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a moment when so many of us converge and gather in a location that has historically received us incredibly well,\u201d said Tracee Ellis Ross, who will screen her new Roku Channel series \u201cSolo Traveling with Tracee Ellis Ross.\u201d The three-episode show follows Ross as she embarks on solo journeys to unplug, indulge and reconnect through Morocco, Mexico and Spain.",
      "Ross said traveling solo is a way of life. She said sharing her project at MVAAFF felt right, noting that the Vineyard-set episode of Akil's \u201cForever\u201d captures the spirit and beauty of the picturesque island.",
      "\u201cIt felt like the perfect location to kind of share,\u201d she said. \u201cThe timing was perfect from when the show came out.\u201d",
      "Set on the campus of the Martha\u2019s Vineyard Performing Arts Center and the Vineyard Lounge, the festival has grown from a grassroots gathering into a premier destination where Black creatives can find inspiration, connection and support.",

They know the need,\u201d said Akil, who will screen \u201cThe Vineyard\u201d episode from the Netflix series \u201cForever\u201d at the festival. \u201cRegardless of what the institution or systems of Hollywood sees as valuable, we claim the value of our stories. We have a chance to celebrate them, complete them, tell them, view them and share them with an audience. It allows for the completion of the story, so that we can move on to many, many, many more stories that need to be told.\u201d",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s always good to have somewhat of a convergence for folks of like mind in the arts and entertainment to gather, coalesce, share ideas, rekindle friendships and fellowship,\u201d said Floyd, who along with Stephanie said they did not expect their festival to become such a main attraction.",
      "\u201cDespite the political climate and what\u2019s going on in entertainment, it\u2019s always a good time for birds of a feather to flock together.\u201d",
      "In addition to the panels and screenings, Stephanie Rance said this year's festival centers on the theme of joy, focusing more on celebration than struggle. She\u2019s especially excited for attendees to experience a range of conversations, from little-known moments in Black history to a panel on Ralph Lauren\u2019s Oak Bluffs collection with Morehouse and Spelman.",

      "NEW YORK -- U.S. fashion retailer American Eagle Outfitters wanted to make a splash with its new advertising campaign starring 27-year-old actor Sydney Sweeney. The ad blitz included \u201cclever, even provocative language\u201d and was \u201cdefinitely going to push buttons,\u201d the company\u2019s chief marketing officer told trade media outlets.",
      "It has. The question now is whether some of the public reactions the fall denim campaign produced is what American Eagle intended.",
      "Titled \u201cSydney Sweeney has great jeans,\u201d the campaign sparked a debate about race, Western beauty standards, and the backlash to \u201cwoke\u201d American politics and culture. Most of the negative reception focused on videos that used the word \u201cgenes\u201d instead of \u201cjeans\u201d when discussing the blonde-haired, blue-eyed actor known for the HBO series \u201cEuphoria\u201d and \u201cWhite Lotus.\u201d",
      "Some critics saw the wordplay as a nod, either unintentional or deliberate, to eugenics, a discredited theory that held humanity could be improved through selective breeding for certain traits.",
      "Marcus Collins, an assistant professor of marketing at the University of Michigan\u2019s Ross School of Business, said the criticism could have been avoided if the ads showed models of various races making the \u201cgenes\u201d pun.",
      "\u201cYou can either say this was ignorance, or this was laziness, or say that this is intentional,\u201d Collins said. \u201cEither one of the three aren\u2019t good.\u201d",
      "Other commenters accused detractors of reading too much into the campaign's message.",
      "\u201cI love how the leftist meltdown over the Sydney Sweeney ad has only resulted in a beautiful white blonde girl with blue eyes getting 1000x the exposure for her \u2018good genes,\u2019\" former Fox News host Megyn Kelly wrote Tuesday on X.",
      "American Eagle didn't respond to requests for comment from The Associated Press.",
      "The ad blitz comes as the teen retailer, like many merchants, wrestles with sluggish consumer spending and higher costs from tariffs. American Eagle reported that total sales were down 5% for its February-April quarter compared to a year earlier.",
      "A day after Sweeney was announced as the company's latest celebrity collaborator, American Eagle's stock closed more than 4% up. Shares were volatile this week and trading nearly 2% down Wednesday.",
      "Like many trendy clothing brands, American Eagle has to differentiate itself from other mid-priced chains with a famous face or by saying something edgy, according to Alan Adamson, co-founder of marketing consultancy Metaforce.",
      "Adamson said the Sweeney campaign shares a lineage with Calvin Klein jeans ads from 1980 that featured a 15-year-old Brooke Shields saying, \u201cYou want to know what comes in between me and my Calvins? Nothing.\u201d Some TV networks declined to air the spots because of its suggestive double entendre and Shields' age.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the same playbook: a very hot model saying provocative things shot in an interesting way,\u201d Adamson said.",
      "Chief Marketing Officer Craig Brommers told industry news website Retail Brew last week that \u201cSydney is the biggest get in the history of American Eagle,\u201d and the company would promote the partnership in a way that matched.",
      "The campaign features videos of Sweeney wearing slouchy jeans in various settings. She will appear on 3-D billboards in Times Square and elsewhere, speaking to users on Snapchat and Instagram, and in an AI-enabled try-on feature.",
      "American Eagle also plans to launch a limited edition Sydney jean to raise awareness of domestic violence, with sales proceeds going to a nonprofit crisis counseling service.",
      "In a news release, the company noted \u201cSweeney\u2019s girl next door charm and main character energy \u2013 paired with her ability to not take herself too seriously \u2013 is the hallmark of this bold, playful campaign.\u201d",
      "In one video, Sweeney walks toward an American Eagle billboard of her and the tagline \u201cSydney Sweeney has great genes.\u201d She crosses out \u201cgenes\u201d and replaces it with \u201cjeans.\u201d",

      "Dead & Company, featuring original Grateful Dead members Bob Weir and Mickey Hart, will play Golden Gate Park's Polo Field starting Friday with an estimated 60,000 attendees each day. The last time the band played that part of the park was in 1991 \u2014 a free show following the death of concert promoter and longtime Deadhead Bill Graham.",
      "Certainly, times have changed.",
      "A general admissions ticket for all three days is $635 \u2014 a shock for many longtime fans who remember when a joint cost more than a Dead concert ticket.",
      "But Deadhead David Aberdeen is thrilled anyway.",
      "\u201cThis is the spiritual home of the Grateful Dead,\u201d said Aberdeen, who works at Amoeba Music in the bohemian, flower-powered Haight-Ashbury neighborhood. \u201cIt seems very right to me that they celebrate it in this way.\u201d",
      "Formed in 1965, the Grateful Dead is synonymous with San Francisco and its counterculture. Members lived in a dirt-cheap Victorian in the Haight and later became a significant part of 1967\u2019s Summer of Love.",
      "That summer eventually soured into bad acid trips and police raids, and prompted the band's move to Marin County on the other end of the Golden Gate Bridge. But new Deadheads kept cropping up \u2014 even after iconic guitarist and singer Jerry Garcia \u2019s 1995 death \u2014 aided by cover bands and offshoots like Dead & Company.",
      "\u201cThere are 18-year-olds who were obviously not even a twinkle in somebody\u2019s eyes when Jerry died, and these 18-year-olds get the values of Deadheads,\u201d said former Grateful Dead publicist and author Dennis McNally.",
      "Deadheads can reel off why and how, and the moment they fell in love with the music. Fans love that no two shows are the same; the band plays different songs each time. They also embrace the community that comes with a Dead show.",

    "story": [
      "Netflix's animated musical film \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d has become the surprise hit of the summer",
      "NEW YORK -- In the colorful, animated, musical world of \u201cKPop Demon Hunters,\u201d everyone is a fan. The general public rocks T-shirts supporting their favorite idols. They hold light sticks and stare starry-eyed at stadium stages; they scream, they cry, they cheer, they buy the merch.",
      "It shouldn't come as much of a surprise, then, that the Sony Pictures/ Netflix film itself has inspired similar fanfare, having topped the streamer\u2019s global rankings. Fans have flooded the internet with art, covers, cosplay and choreography in response to the movie, which follows the fictional K-pop girl group HUNTR/X as they fight demons.",
      "And it's not just the film that's a summer hit. The \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d soundtrack has topped the charts \u2014 debuting at No. 1 on Billboard's Soundtracks chart and No. 8 on the all-genre Billboard 200.",
      "Here's how \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d became the year's surprising success story.",
      "The \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d soundtrack utilizes some of the best and brightest in the genre. That included a partnership with K-pop company The Black Label, co-founded by super producer Teddy Park, known for his work with YG, Blackpink and 2NE1 \u2014 empowered girl groups used as references for the film\u2019s protagonists, the trio HUNTR/X.",
      "It's one of the many reasons the musical film's soundtrack stands on its own. Filmmakers \u201creally did their homework,\u201d says Jeff Benjamin, a music journalist who specializes in K-pop.",
      "Indeed, they did a lot of research. One of the film\u2019s directors, Maggie Kang, said that her team prioritized \u201crepresenting the fandom and the idols in a very specific way,\u201d as to not disappoint K-pop fans.",
      "They pulled from a treasure trove of influences heard at every corner: The fictional, rival boy band Saja Boys\u2019 hit song \u201cSoda Pop,\u201d for example, references the \u201990s K-pop group H.O.T.",
      "And it has worked. \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d is the highest charting soundtrack of 2025, with eight of its songs landing on the Billboard Hot 100. It peaked at No. 2 on the all-genre Billboard 200. To put that in perspective: Lorde's \u201cVirgin\u201d and Justin Bieber's \u201cSwag\u201d did the same.",
      "In some ways, it recalls Disney's \u201cEncanto,\u201d which topped the Billboard 200 and produced a No. 1 hit, \u201cWe Don't Talk About Bruno \u201d in 2022. Similarly, \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d embraces \u201cthe original soundtrack, which is a lost art form,\u201d adds Benjamin.",
      "Tamar Herman, a music journalist and author of the \u201cNotes on K-pop\u201d newsletter, says the movie succeeds because it embraces animated musical tradition and authentic K-pop music production styles in equal measure. She considers \u201cKpop Demon Hunters\u201d to be \u201ca musical with songs inspired by K-pop,\u201d not unlike a Jukebox musical, where the songs of ABBA are reimagined for \u201cMamma Mia.\u201d",
      "The novelty of the film, too, seems to be resonating. Where many animated films rely on adapting existing intellectual property, \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d is original. And it comes from an original perspective. \u201cIt\u2019s not completely Korean, it\u2019s not completely Western and it\u2019s kind of right in that middle,\u201d says Kang. \u201cIt\u2019s like not pulled from one side; it\u2019s kind of flavors of both. So, I think that\u2019s what makes the movie feels a little different.\u201d",
      "And \u201cthe core story is what\u2019s drawing everybody in,\u201d says Kang.",
      "San Francisco-based cosplayer and content creator Nanci Alc\u00e1ntar, who goes by Naanny Lee online agrees. \u201cIt\u2019s not only a K-pop group, but it also tells a story of their journey, of how they transform into powerful warriors,\u201d said Alc\u00e1ntar in Spanish. For her, it goes beyond K-pop \u2014 it\u2019s about the narrative.",
      "Kang\u2019s approach to cultural authenticity, too, may have contributed to the film\u2019s crossover appeal. Rather than explaining Korean elements like HUNTR/X\u2019s visit to a traditional medicine clinic or translating K-pop light stick culture for Western audiences, she opted for full immersion. \u201cWe just wanted everybody to just accept that they were in Korea,\u201d Kang said.",
      "The director said this method of \u201cthrowing people into the deep end of a culture\u201d breaks down barriers better than heavy-handed explanation. \u201cWe just wanted to keep everything feeling normal,\u201d she explained. \u201cIf you don\u2019t shine a light on it, it just becomes more easily accepted.\u201d",

      "Indeed \u2014 if the film wasn't authentic to K-pop fans' experience, or mocked them, it is unlikely to have become so popular, says Benjamin. Instead, there are Easter eggs for the dedicated K-pop listener.",
      "Herman agrees, and says that the film has in-jokes for K-pop fans, not unlike a children's movie that features some humor meant to appeal specifically to parents.",
      "\u201cFiguring out what makes K-pop tick in a way that resonates with musical fans was really important to this movie,\u201d said Herman.",
      "For Kang, that was always at the heart of the project. \u201cFandom plays a huge part in the world being saved at the end of the movie,\u201d she said. \u201cSo, we were really confident that we were doing that justice.\u201d",

      "Andre wrapped his tree-trunk arms around the champ and tried to wring the final breaths out of Hogan with a bear hug so tight that more than 90,000 fans in Detroit almost witnessed the final day of Hulkamania.",
      "But, wait!",
      "This was Hulk Hogan.",
      "Wrestling\u2019s biggest star had more late comebacks than fellow 1980s sports stars John Elway or Michael Jordan combined. Hogan had some gas left in the tank, some extra bite in those 24-inch pythons, and hammered away at Andre. One right hand, then another one, and another! Wrestling fans roared as they knew the bad news that was coming for Andre. Hogan fought back \u2014 much as he did against those 1980s baddies out of the Cold War or Iran \u2014 and finally body-slammed Andre the Giant. Hogan hit the hopes and delivered his famous leg drop on Andre\u2019s chest to get the three count.",
      "Hulk Hogan won again at WrestleMania.",
      "He always won, of course. It\u2019s what the story called for and there was no reason for WWF owner and pro wrestler puppeteer Vince McMahon to ever deviate from the plan of Hulkamania running wild.",
      "Why would he?",
      "Hogan had the hulking size, the charisma and catchphrases \u2014 \u201cWhat\u2019cha gonna do when Hulkamania runs wild on you?\u201d \u2014 that led the industry out of gyms and regional arenas and into NFL stadiums, like that 1987 night when Hogan beat Andre at the Pontiac Silverdome in WrestleMania III.",
      "\u201cThere he is,\u201d announcer Gorilla Monsoon said, as Hogan played to the crowd, \u201cthe greatest professional athlete in the world today.\u201d",
      "Whether you break out an eye roll or crank up Hogan\u2019s \u201c Real American \u201d anthem to that statement depends, of course, on one\u2019s ability to suspend disbelief. There is no denying, though, just how real Hogan\u2019s impact was on professional wrestling and pop culture in the 1980s. He stood toe-to-toe with Rocky Balboa. He fought side-by-side with Mr. T. He hosted \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d and flexed on the cover of Sports Illustrated.",
      "\u201cHe did what he set out to do,\u201d WWE Hall of Famer Sgt. Slaughter said Friday by phone. \u201cHe became the most recognized, not only professional wrestler and sports entertainer in the world, he\u2019s probably top-five of anybody you\u2019d recognize when you saw him.\u201d",
      "WWE has long claimed the paid attendance of WrestleMania III was 93,173, a number some historians claim is as artificially inflated as the chemically-enhanced biceps of that era. What can\u2019t be disputed, when the two had their match in 1988, live on national television, more than 33 million fans tuned in to NBC, still far and away the record for largest viewing audience in American televised wrestling.",
      "Making money and moving merch. That was the real power of Hulkamania.",
      "Hogan, who died Thursday in Florida at age 71, left behind more than three decades of memorable matches that captured the spirit of those little Hulkamaniacs to the ones that loved to hate him in the 1990s as \u201cHollywood\u201d Hulk Hogan in the New World Order.",
      "Here are some of his best moments.",
      "Hogan wasn\u2019t some upstart when he returned to the WWF (now WWE) in late 1983. He tested the waters of Hulkamania in the old American Wrestling Association and made his famous appearance as Thunderlips in \u201cRocky III,\u201d when was beckoned back to WWE and became an instant contender to face the champion, the hated Iron Sheik. Hogan broke out of the dreaded camel clutch and pinned the Sheik to become the new champion on Jan. 23, 1984, at Madison Square Garden \u2014 the building paid tribute to Hogan on Thursday night \u2014 and set the course for Hulkamania.",

      "Back before the internet spilled behind-the-scenes secrets, and there was easy access to watch wrestling around the globe, WWE created its own version of wrestling history. If the company said Andre the Giant had never been slammed, and had never been pinned over a 15-year undefeated streak, then it was believed to be true (neither were, of course).",
      "Yet, the faux hype set the stage for the match that changed wrestling forever.",
      "\u201cAndre the Giant was a momentum-shifting moment where he passed his torch,\u201d Hogan said in a 2009 interview with the AP. \u201cHe was like the icing on the cake. Once he blessed me, it was up to me to mold that business and carry it through.\u201d",
      "By 1996, Hogan\u2019s good-guy, beats-the-odds character had grown stale as he made the shift from WWE to Ted Turner\u2019s World Championship Wrestling. Hogan even started to get booed as wrestling fans clamored for a new direction, a new star on top.",
      "They got one. \u201cHollywood\u201d Hulk Hogan.",
      "For weeks, two former WWE stars had \u201cinvaded\u201d WCW and claimed they were taking over the company. That led to a six-man tag-team match where the two outsiders, Kevin Nash and Scott Hall, promised a third man to help with their cause. No one showed to help the two until the end, when Hogan walked out in his red-and-yellow attire, and stunned the crowd when he put the leg drop on Randy Savage. Hogan was third man. He ditched his traditional colors for black-and-white, sunglasses, dark facial hair and embraced the \u201cHollywood\u201d heel persona.",
      "Much as he did a decade earlier, Hogan led WCW to new heights and the company would defeat WWE in the TV ratings for 83 straight weeks in what would be known as the \u201cMonday Night Wars.\u201d Hogan lost as much as he won without his Hulkamania powers. He still moved the needle where it mattered most and made WCW must-see TV every Monday night.",
      "With WCW out of business and bought by McMahon, Hogan kept a low profile until he made a comeback with WWE in 2002. He returned with Hall and Nash as the NWO but at this point, WWE fans wanted their old Hulkster back.",
      "Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson was WWE\u2019s baby-faced crowd favorite when he met the villainous Hogan at WrestleMania in an \u201cIcon vs. Icon\u201d match in WrestleMania in 2002. One problem, the Toronto crowd decided to back Hogan.",
      "\u201cWhen we hit the ring, 70,000 loyal people didn\u2019t want to hate Hulk Hogan,\u201d Hogan said in 2009. \u201cEverybody kind of started to panic and I just said, \u2019Brother, stick with me and I\u2019ll get you through this.\u201d\u2019",
      "After the match, the cheers for Hogan called for a last-second change of plans, with his former NWO allies running down to attack him. The Rock helped Hogan fight off the NWO and the two men posed together to riotous cheers.",
      "\u201cAs I raised his hand and said he\u2019s the greatest wrestler in the world, they had to turn me back red and yellow immediately,\u201d Hogan said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of interesting, that was going to be the nail in my coffin. It turned out to be the fountain of youth for me.\u201d",

      "Cleo Laine, whose husky contralto was one of the most distinctive voices in jazz and who was regarded by many as Britain\u2019s greatest contribution to the quintessentially American music, has died",
      "LONDON -- Cleo Laine, whose husky contralto was one of the most distinctive voices in jazz and who was regarded by many as Britain's greatest contribution to the quintessentially American music, has died. She was 97.",
      "The Stables, a charity and venue Laine founded with her late jazz musician husband John Dankworth, said Friday it was \u201cgreatly saddened\u201d by the news that \u201cone of its founders and Life President, Dame Cleo Laine has passed away.\"",
      "Monica Ferguson, artistic director of The Stables, said Laine \"will be greatly missed, but her unique talent will always be remembered.\u201d",
      "Laine's career spanned the Atlantic and crossed genres: She sang the songs of Kurt Weill, Arnold Schoenberg and Robert Schumann; she acted on stage and on film, and even played God in a production of Benjamin Britten's \"Noye's Fludde.\"",
      "Laine's life and art were intimately bound up with band leader Dankworth, who gave her a job and her stage name in 1951, and married her seven years later. Both were still performing after their 80th birthdays. Dankworth died in 2010 at 82.",
      "In 1997, Laine became the first British jazz artist to be made a dame, the female equivalent of a knight.",
      "\"It is British jazz that should have received the accolade for its service to me,\" she said when the honor was announced. \"It has given me a wonderful life, a successful career and an opportunity to travel the globe doing what I love to do.\"",
      "Laine was born Clementina Dinah Campbell in 1927. Her father, Alexander Campbell, was a Jamaican who loved opera and earned money during the Depression as a street singer. Despite hard times, her British mother, Minnie, made sure that her daughter had piano, voice and dance lessons.",
      "She began performing at local events at age 3, and at age 12 she got a role as a movie extra in \"The Thief of Bagdad.\" Leaving school at 14, Laine went to work as a hairdresser and faced repeated rejection in her efforts to get a job as a singer.",
      "A decade later, in 1951, she tried out for the Johnny Dankworth Seven, and succeeded. \"Clementina Campbell\" was judged too long for a marquee, so she became Cleo Laine.",
      "\"John said that when he heard me, I didn't sound like anyone else who was singing at the time,\" Laine once said. \"I guess the reason I didn't get the other jobs is that they were looking for a singer who did sound like somebody else.\"",
      "Laine had a remarkable range, from tenor to contralto, and a sound often described as \"smoky.\"",
      "Dankworth, in an interview with the Irish Independent, recalled Laine's audition.",
      "\"They were all sitting there with stony faces, so I asked the Scottish trumpet player Jimmy Deuchar, who was looking very glum and was the hardest nut of all, whether he thought she had something. 'Something?' he said, 'She's got everything!'\"",
      "Offered 6 pounds a week, Laine demanded \u2014 and got \u2014 7 pounds.",
      "\"They used to call me 'Scruff', although I don't think I was scruffy. It was just that having come from the sticks, I didn't know how to put things together as well as the other singers of the day,\" she told the Irish Independent. \"And anyway, I didn't have the money, because they weren't paying me enough.\"",
      "Recognition came swiftly. Laine was runner-up in Melody Maker's \"girl singer\" category in 1952, and topped the list in 1956 and 1957.",
      "She married Dankworth \u2014 and quit his band \u2014 in 1958, a year after her divorce from her first husband, George Langridge. As Dankworth's band prospered, Laine began to feel underused.",

      "West Virginia is banning seven artificial dyes from school meals before the start of class",
      "When school starts in West Virginia next month, 240,000 students in districts large and small will notice something missing from their cafeteria trays.",
      "Gone will be red Jell-O fruit cups, yogurt topped with brightly hued sprinkles and Cool Ranch Doritos \u2014 all foods made with synthetic dyes.",
      "In their place will be foods that contain colors made only from natural sources \u2014 such as vegetables, spices and seeds \u2014 after West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey signed a sweeping new law in March banning seven artificial dyes from school meals.",
      "Other states have enacted similar laws that would strip artificial dyes from school meals, but West Virginia\u2019s action is the first to take effect, starting Aug. 1. It triggered a four-month sprint that that left state and local nutrition directors reeling.",
      "\u201cI think the initial reaction was like, \u2018Wow, what are we going to do?\u2019\" said Tony Crago, director of child nutrition for the West Virginia Department of Education. \u201cWhere do we start?\u201d",
      "Across the state, managers of school food programs scoured district grocery lists for dozens of products that contained any trace of petroleum-based synthetic dyes including Red 3, Red 40, Yellow 5, Yellow 6, Blue 1, Blue 2 and Green 3.",
      "\u201cWhen it went into law, it was shocking,\u201d said Diane Miller, who leads child nutrition and food services for Kanawha County Schools in the state\u2019s central region. \u201cWe began to realize that these dyes were in much more than just your cereals.\u201d",
      "West Virginia's ban on synthetic dyes was cheered by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has successfully pressured food makers to agree to remove artificial colors from their products. The law focuses first on dyes in school foods, followed by a second action that will ban the colors plus two preservatives from all foods sold in the state starting in 2028.",
      "The move is aimed at halting potential health effects from the dyes, which have been linked to neurobehavioral problems, such as hyperactivity and attention problems, in some children. It's part of a larger focus on limiting artificial ingredients in food, Morrisey said in March.",
      "\u201cBy eliminating harmful chemicals from our food, we\u2019re taking steps toward improving the health of our residents and protecting our children from significant long-term health and learning challenges,\u201d he said.",
      "Health advocates have long called for the removal of the dyes, citing mixed evidence of potential harm. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has said the color additives are safe when \u201cused properly,\u201d in the amounts and products approved by the agency. Most children have no problems when consuming the dyes, the agency adds, \u201cbut some evidence suggests that certain children may be sensitive to them.\u201d",
      "More recently, however, FDA Commissioner Marty Makary has joined Kennedy in the push to get artificial dyes out of food, despite limited proof of health effects.",
      "\u201cWhen you get rid of petroleum-based dyes, kids aren't gonna all suddenly be healthy,\u201d Makary said on a recent podcast. \u201cWe're not going to address the fact that 30% of our nation's kids have prediabetes by simply removing petroleum-based food dyes. But these are steps in the right direction.\u201d",
      "Nutrition experts agree that removing artificial colors from foods doesn\u2019t address the main drivers of America\u2019s chronic health problems. Those stem largely from ingredients such as added sugars, sodium and saturated fat.",

      "Some suppliers had already removed artificial dyes from some school foods, swapping them for products colored with beet juice or turmeric, said Hollie Best, food service director for Wood County Schools in Parkersburg, which has 11,000 children in 27 schools. Overall, Best said she removed just five foods from her menus.",
      "General Mills said 98% of its products for schools were already made without the banned colors. The company \u201cwill be compliant\u201d with West Virginia's law immediately and plans to remove the dyes from school foods nationwide by next summer, said Mollie Wulff, a company spokesperson.",
      "In Miller\u2019s district, with 23,000 students in 67 schools, the new law affects about 10% of the foods served, she estimated. She expected some foods to contain artificial colors, like strawberry milk and Pop-Tarts. Others were surprising, such as pickles, salad dressing and certain snack chips.",
      "\u201cPeople were like, \u2018Oh my gosh, no more Doritos?'\" Miller said. The popular Cool Ranch flavor contains dyes Red 40, Blue 1 and Yellow 5.",
      "The challenge is finding substitutes that will still appeal to children, Miller said.",
      "\u201cBecause the last thing we need them to do is to choose not to participate in our school lunch program,\u201d she said, adding that schools provide many students their healthiest meals of the day.",
      "Parents of children with sensitivities or allergies to artificial dyes had already raised concerns, according to school food directors. But for others, the presence of synthetic colors in school meals hasn\u2019t been an issue. Chris DeRico, nutrition director of Barbour County Schools, with 2,000 students, said few parents seemed worried about dyes.",
      "\u201cThey'd be in the minority, I believe,\" he said. \u201cIn rural West Virginia, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s really on radar screens.\u201d",
      "In Best's district, dyes were already out of the food dished up during the summer session in July. That didn't make much difference to Lilith Wilson, 9, who said her meal of a meatball sub sandwich, sweet potato fries and ice cream was \u201creally good.\u201d",
      "Asked whether she likes school lunches in general, the incoming fourth-grader echoed the sentiments of picky kids everywhere: \u201cSometimes I don't, sometimes I do. It just depends on what it is.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- The Food and Drug Administration\u2019s polarizing vaccine chief is leaving the agency after a brief tenure that drew the ire of biotech companies, patient groups and conservative allies of President Donald Trump.",

      "Two people familiar with the situation told The Associated Press that Prasad was ousted following several recent controversies. The people spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal personnel matters.",
      "Prasad joined the FDA in May after years as an academic researcher at the University of California San Francisco, where he frequently criticized the FDA\u2019s approach to drug approvals and COVID-19 vaccines.",
      "His contrarian approach appeared to match FDA Commissioner Marty Makary, who repeatedly praised Prasad\u2019s work and intellect.",

      "Prasad has long been skeptical of the therapy and other muscular dystrophy drugs sold by the drugmaker, Sarepta Therapeutics. As an academic, Prasad gained prominence by attacking the FDA for being too lenient in its standards for approving cancer drugs and other new therapies.",
      "That approach is at odds with Trump\u2019s Republican supporters, who generally favor speedier approvals and unfettered access to experimental treatments. During Trump\u2019s first term he signed the \u201c Right to Try \u201d law, a largely symbolic piece of legislation that won popular support from conservatives seeking to give dying patients expanded access to unproven drugs.",

      "A former Ukrainian prisoner of war has embraced life with urgency since his release in April",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- Since his release from a Russian prison in April, Stanislav Tarnavskyi has been in a hurry to build the life in Ukraine he dreamed about during three years of captivity.",
      "The 25-year-old has proposed to his girlfriend, bought an apartment and adopted a golden retriever. And that was just what he accomplished one week in July.",
      "But as busy as he is rekindling old relationships and creating new ones, Tarnavskyi cannot shake the trauma he and thousands of other Ukrainian soldiers experienced as prisoners of war. The U.N. says many endured beatings, starvation and humiliation at the hands of their captors \u2014 experiences that will leave lifelong scars.",
      "Tarnavskyi, who was captured during the battle for Mariupol in April of 2022, regularly has nightmares about the prisons where he was held.",
      "\u201cI see the officers who watched over us. I dream they want to harm me, catch me,\u201d he said. When he wakes up, his heart pounds, anxiety surges \u2014 until he realizes he is in the outskirts of Kyiv, where he was forced to move because Russia occupied his hometown of Berdiansk.",
      "As the three-year war drags on, Tarnavskyi is one of more than 5,000 former POWs back in Ukraine rehabilitating with the help of regular counseling. Regardless of any physical injuries that may require attention, psychologists say it is vital to monitor former POWs for years after their release; the cost of war, they say, echoes for generations.",
      "In a photography studio high above Kyiv, Ukraine's capital, sunlight floods the white walls. After a shoot that lasted several hours Tarnavskyi said the brightness was hurting his eyes, which are still sensitive from years spent in a dark cell.",
      "But his mood couldn't be dimmed. The girlfriend who waited for his return had just consented to his surprise proposal.",
      "\u201cI love you very much, I am very glad that you waited for me,\" Tarnavskyi said, holding a thick bouquet of pink roses and a ring. \"You have always been my support, and I hope you will remain so for the rest of my life. Will you marry me?\u201d",
      "Tarnavskyi said it was the thought of Tetiana Baieva \u2014 whom he met in 2021 \u2014 that helped stop him from taking his own life three times during captivity.",
      "Still, he finds it hard to talk with Baieva about his time in prison. He doesn't want to be pitied.",
      "Soon after he returned home, he was paranoid, feeling watched \u2014 a reaction to constant surveillance in prison. \u201cIf you stepped out of line, they\u2019d (Russians) come and beat you. I still get flashbacks when I see (surveillance) cameras. If I see one, I get nervous,\u201d he said.",
      "But with each passing week, he is feeling better, progress Tarnavskyi credits to the work he is doing with a psychologist.",
      "Any small stimulus \u2014 a smell, a breeze, a color \u2014 can trigger traumatic memories for POWs, says Kseniia Voznitsyna, the director of Ukraine's Lisova Polyana mental health center for veterans on the outskirts of Kyiv.",
      "Yet contrary to stereotypes, ex-POWs aren\u2019t more aggressive. \u201cThey tend to isolate themselves, avoid large gatherings, and struggle with trust,\u201d said Voznitsyna.",
      "\u201cThey say time heals \u2014 five or 10 years, maybe \u2014 but it doesn\u2019t,\" she added. \"It just feels less intense.\u201d",

Even in captivity, he sang quietly to himself, composing songs in his mind about love, home and war. Now he dreams of turning that passion into a career as an artist.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve become stronger now,\u201d Zalizko said. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of death, not afraid of losing an arm or a leg, not afraid of dying instantly. I fear nothing anymore.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The European Medicines Agency has recommended authorizing a twice-yearly injectable drug to prevent HIV",
      "LONDON -- The European Medicines Agency has recommended authorizing a twice-yearly injectable drug aimed at preventing HIV, which scientists say could help end the virus' transmission.",
      "In a statement on Friday, the EU drug regulator said its evaluations of lenacapavir, sold as Yeytuo in Europe by Gilead Sciences, showed the drug is \u201chighly effective\u201d and \u201cconsidered to be of major public health interest.\u201d Once the regulator's guidance is accepted by the European Commission, the authorization is valid in all 27 EU member countries as well as Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein.",
      "Last year, studies suggested that lenacapavir, already used to treat people with HIV, was nearly 100% effective in stopping transmission in both women and men.",
      "Winnie Byanyima, executive director of the U.N. AIDS agency, has said the drug \u201ccould change the trajectory of the HIV epidemic\u201d if it is made available to everyone who needs it.",
      "In June, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized lenacapavir to prevent HIV. Earlier this month, the World Health Organization recommended countries offer the drug as an additional option to people at risk of the virus.",
      "Condoms help guard against HIV infection if used properly. Other medication aimed at preventing HIV include daily pills that people can take and another injectable drug called cabotegravir, which is given every two months. Lenacapavir\u2019s six-month protection makes it the longest-lasting type, an option that could attract people wary of more visits to health clinics or stigma from taking daily pills.",
      "Critics have raised concerns, however, that lenacapavir may not be made widely enough available to stop global outbreaks of HIV. Drugmaker Gilead has said it will allow cheap, generic versions to be sold in 120 poor countries with high HIV rates \u2014 mostly in Africa, Southeast Asia and the Caribbean.",

    "story": [
      "Michigan has become a leader in safe drinking water after the Flint crisis, but mobile home parks remain a rough spot",
      "After the Flint water crisis, Michigan became a national leader on safe drinking water, requiring the removal of lead pipes and the reduction of harmful \u201cforever chemicals\u201d years before the federal government acted.",
      "But the state has a blind spot when it comes to the hundreds of thousands of people who live in its mobile home parks.",
      "Regulators say they have little power to enforce the rules in the state's estimated 100 or more unlicensed parks when owners fail to provide safe water. The problem is compounded by private equity firms that have been buying up parks over the past two decades and now control about 1 in every 6 parks in Michigan \u2014 among the highest rates in the country, according to the Private Equity Stakeholder Project, a group that advocates against such purchases.",
      "Officials say it can be a struggle to even contact those park owners, let alone get them to comply with regulations.",
      "\u201cWith private equity moving into this space, the goal these companies seem to have is to return the absolute highest return they can to investors even if that means providing inadequate service or engaging in exploitative practices, or unsafe practices for the residents,\u201d said state Sen. John Cherry, a Democrat who sponsored legislation to strengthen enforcement in the communities.",
      "But the state doesn't attempt to track unlicensed parks. And an industry spokesperson said Michigan officials \u2014 particularly law enforcement \u2014 have the power to do more if they choose.",
      "At North Morris Estates where Theo Gantos lives outside Flint, conditions got so bad that the state refused to renew the park\u2019s license to operate.",
      "Water often flowed weakly from the tap because the wells that service the park didn\u2019t produce enough, Gantos said. Sometimes the water was discolored. It could stain laundry and destroy appliances. He installed a multistage filter system just to be able to use it.",
      "Eventually, local law enforcement investigated. In March, the owner pleaded guilty to a criminal charge for operating without a license, agreeing to pay a fine and sell the park.",
      "That might not have happened if Gantos had not been so pugnacious. He spent years battling Homes of America, an affiliate of private equity group Alden Global Capital that local prosecutors said owns North Morris. That included filing a public records request for emails on officials\u2019 handling of problems at his park, pushing regulators to enforce rules and speaking out to media over what he calls blight conditions.",
      "\u201cThese guys, they don\u2019t care,\u201d Gantos said about complying with the rules.",
      "Representatives of North Morris and Homes of America, including an attorney who appeared for the park in legal proceedings, did not respond to messages seeking comment.",
      "The Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs, called LARA, has the authority to inspect and investigate complaints at licensed mobile home parks. But it\u2019s typically fallen to law enforcement to pursue criminal charges against unlicensed parks.",
      "The North Morris conviction for operating without a license is likely the first such under the state\u2019s mobile home law that has been on the books since 1987, the county prosecutor said.",

And what we\u2019ve seen so far with both the state and local units of government is they\u2019ve elected not to.\u201d",
      "Mobile home parks without a license are \u201cessentially operating unregulated,\u201d Cherry said. One of the state\u2019s few options is to shut down a park, a rarely used last resort that can mean throwing people out of their homes.",
      "Mobile home parks have long been an important affordable housing option. But that affordability is fading.",
      "A study by Lending Tree, a lending marketplace, found new mobile home sale prices rose more than 50% nationally from 2018 to 2023 \u2014 new single-family home price averages, by contrast, rose 38% over that period.",
      "Last year, LARA supported legislation that would have given the department more power to penalize unlicensed parks, force parks to provide owner contact information and limit rent increases. That failed.",
      "This year, Democratic Sen. Jeff Irwin has proposed a narrower law that would give state drinking water officials more power to make sure water in all mobile home parks is drinkable. Right now, they only have direct authority over parks that provide their own water. But it\u2019s common for parks to take city water from a pipe connecting to the nearby town.",
      "That water is usually safe when it reaches the park, but if the park\u2019s water pipes crack or fail, water protections won\u2019t apply on the private property. That keeps officials from stepping in and forcing change except in limited situations when there\u2019s a public health threat. It can leave residents unsure where to turn when the owner refuses to fix problems.",
      "\u201cWe take those issues very seriously,\u201d said Eric Oswald, director of the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy\u2019s drinking water and environmental health division. He said they try to work with licensing officials to ensure water is safe, though \u201cthe problem is, I\u2019m not resourced for that.\u201d",
      "The Michigan Manufactured Housing Association opposed last year\u2019s legislation, arguing it would make mobile homes less affordable. The group says it supports extending water protections to within parks, as called for in this year\u2019s legislation. It passed the state Senate in late June and is now in the GOP-controlled House.",

      "Samuel Doria Medina is running for president of Bolivia",
      "LA PAZ, Bolivia -- It's no surprise that Samuel Doria Medina is running for president of Bolivia: The 66-year-old multimillionaire ran as a center-right candidate in the elections of 2005, 2009 and 2014. He failed each time as Bolivia's leftist ruling party, founded by former President Evo Morales, maintained a tight grip over politics.",
      "What\u2019s unexpected is that next month, after almost two decades of the Movement Toward Socialism (MAS) party in power, the candidate who promises to arrest Morales and cozy up to U.S. President Donald Trump stands a real chance of victory.",
      "Polls show Doria Medina, owner of hotel chains and Bolivia\u2019s Burger King restaurants, as a front-runner in the Aug. 17 election.",
      "\"Not only are we going to change the president, but the political cycle,\" Doria Medina, a former cement magnate, told The Associated Press Wednesday from his sleek office on the 20th floor of one of Bolivia\u2019s tallest towers that he helped build. \u201cPart of that change will be the emergence of new figures.\u201d",
      "Doria Medina, a successful businessman and entrepreneur, is tapping public outrage over Bolivia\u2019s worst economic crisis since 1991.",
      "He promises unity to voters frustrated by the fracturing of the MAS party between current President Luis Arce and his erstwhile ally, the larger-than-life Morales, who oversaw a so-called economic miracle of rising growth and falling poverty for much of his tenure from 2006-2019.",
      "But Morales' statist economic model, built on natural gas exports, has gone bust. Now the landlocked nation of 12 million is approaching a watershed moment as crippling dollar shortages, mass unrest and fuel scarcity threaten the once-unquestioned dominance of the MAS party founded in the 1990s.",
      "\u201cWe have a population that wants the economic conflict and lack of fuel to be solved,\u201d Doria Medina said.",
      "Much remains uncertain in the run-up to the highly anticipated vote, with Morales\u2019 large base of loyalists vowing to leave their ballots blank on account of the former president\u2019s contentious exclusion from the race \u2014 in part a result of his bitter political fight with Arce.",
      "Facing a humiliating defeat, Arce dropped out of the race.",
      "The only leftist candidate leading polls is Andr\u00f3nico Rodr\u00edguez, the 36-year-old president of the senate and vice president of Morales\u2019 coca-farming union. Rodr\u00edguez would be considered the political heir of Morales' MAS if it weren't for Morales branding him a traitor for running against him.",
      "With other opposition candidates further to the right, analysts see the moderate Doria Medina as best-positioned to win over traditional MAS party supporters as he promises to put the brakes on the foreign exchange rate and resolve fuel shortages within his first 100 days.",
      "The value of a boliviano on the black market is now around half the official exchange rate.",
      "\u201cThis type of crisis has to be resolved very quickly,\" Doria Medina said, citing as a model the shock adjustment of radical libertarian President Javier Milei that drove down Argentina's double-digit inflation.",
      "To achieve such a swift transformation, Doria Medina told AP he would first scrap fuel subsidies, which have long been a politically sensitive pillar of the MAS party\u2019s economic policy. When Morales tried to eliminate the generous subsidies in 2010, mass nationwide riots forced him to backtrack.",
      "\u201cIt's the biggest absurdity that in Bolivia it's $0.30 per liter of gasoline and in all neighboring countries it's $1,\u201d Doria Medina said, dismissing possible fallout from the move. Bolivia hemorrhaged $3 billion subsidizing gasoline and fuel last year.",

      "Arguably the biggest potential prize for the U.S. is Bolivia's large stockpiles of strategic minerals, including lithium, a key component of renewable batteries. Chinese and Russian companies have sought stakes in Bolivian lithium mines that remain largely undeveloped despite Morales' attempts and Arce's ambitions.",
      "After being run out of the presidential election and hit with an arrest warrant on charges related to his sexual relationship with a 15-year-old girl, Morales remains holed up in his tropical stronghold. He says the allegations are politically motivated.",

      "RIO DE JANEIRO -- The U.S. Treasury Department on Wednesday announced sanctions on Brazilian Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes over alleged suppression of freedom of expression and the ongoing trial of former President Jair Bolsonaro.",
      "De Moraes oversees the criminal case against Bolsonaro, who is accused of masterminding a plot to stay in power despite his 2022 election defeat to current President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva.",
      "\u201cDe Moraes is responsible for an oppressive campaign of censorship, arbitrary detentions that violate human rights, and politicized prosecutions \u2014 including against former President Jair Bolsonaro,\u201d U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a statement.",
      "The department cited the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act, which targets perpetrators of human rights abuse and corrupt officials, as its authority to issue the sanctions.",
      "The decision orders the freezing of any assets or property de Moraes may have in the U.S.",
      "Brazil\u2019s Supreme Court and the Presidential Palace did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Wednesday\u2019s sanctions follow the U.S. State Department's announcement of visa restrictions on Brazilian judicial officials, including de Moraes, on July 18.",
      "They also come after U.S. President Donald Trump announced a 50% tariff on Brazilian imported goods on July 9. In a letter announcing the tariff, Trump explicitly linked the import tax to what he called the \u201cwitch hunt\u201d trial of Bolsonaro currently underway in Brazil.",
      "Trump appears to identify with Bolsonaro, who is accused of trying to overturn the results of his 2022 loss to Lula. Similarly, Trump was indicted in 2023 on allegations that he tried to overturn the results of the 2020 U.S. presidential election.",
      "Bolsonaro has been ordered to wear an ankle monitor after being deemed a flight risk.",
      "Bolsonaro's son Eduardo celebrated the U.S. Treasury Department announcement on X, calling it a \u201chistoric milestone\u201d and a warning that \u201cabuses of authority now have global consequences.\u201d",
      "Eduardo Bolsonaro relocated to the U.S. in March and is under investigation for allegedly working with U.S. authorities to impose sanctions against Brazilian officials.",
      "Also on Wednesday, Trump signed an executive order to implement the 50% tariff announced earlier this month. The White House said in a statement that the order was a response to \u201crecent policies, practices, and actions\u201d of Brazil that \u201cconstitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States.\u201d",

      "In Wednesday's order, Trump said Brazil\u2019s policies and criminal prosecution of former President Jair Bolsonaro constitute an economic emergency under a 1977 law.",

      "The group of foreigners visiting the National Museum of Afghanistan was made up only of women. Its guide was a woman, too \u2014 one of the first Afghan female tour guides in a country whose Taliban rulers impose the severest restrictions on girls and women anywhere in the world.",
      "Somaya Moniry, 24, hadn't known that tour guides existed, as a profession or even as a concept. But while browsing the internet for help on improving her English language skills, she stumbled upon Couchsurfing, an app where travelers connect with locals and stay in their homes.",
      "After hosting a traveler, \u201cI became very passionate about it and it was very interesting for me,\u201d Moniry said. \u201cIt was very unique. I have never heard about it before, so I said: \u2018Why not (do) this?\u2019\u201d",
      "As she showed that first visitor around her hometown in western Afghanistan, she saw a new side to her country.",
      "\u201cMost of the things that we have heard (about Afghanistan) was just \u2026 negativity. The focus of the people, focus of the media, focus of headlines, all of them were just the negativity. And definitely we get influenced by that,\u201d Moniry said.",
      "But for her, Afghanistan is far more nuanced. While there are undoubtedly problems in a place recovering from decades of war and chaos, there is also another side to the complex, stunning country. Her love for her homeland runs deep, and she is eager to share it. She hopes to gradually change people\u2019s perceptions.",
      "\u201cWhenever \u2026 I saw all of that natures, all those beauty, all those positivity, it changed my view totally,\u201d Moniry said in her enthusiastic English. \u201cAnd definitely this can be also for other people.\u201d",
      "One of those visitors is Australian Suzanne Sandral. She originally wanted to see Afghanistan in the 1960s but the pressures of having a family kept her away. Now at 82, she was part of Moniry\u2019s women-only tour group in Kabul.",
      "Afghanistan surprised her.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not what I expected at all. I expected to feel rather fearful. I expected to be given a lot of ... accusatory looks. Not at all,\u201d she said during a pause in sightseeing. \u201cWherever you go in the streets, if you smile at someone and give them a little nod or say hello, you get a terrific response. So it\u2019s very different.\u201d",

      "The groups are small \u2014 one had eight women, the other three \u2014 but the company is looking to build a network of female guides across Afghanistan.",
      "\u201cWhat we try and do with this tour, especially the women\u2019s tour, is conquer those ethical concerns,\u201d Stephens said. \u201cThe idea is to learn about the lives of Afghan women in context.\u201d",

      "Ugandan opposition figure Bobi Wine says the political climate in the East African country has gone \u201cfrom bad to worse\u201d ahead of presidential polls set for early next year",
      "KAMPALA, Uganda -- Opposition figure Bobi Wine said the political climate in Uganda has \u201cgone from bad to worse\u201d ahead of presidential polls set for early next year, citing threats to himself and other activists mobilizing against the longtime president.",
      "Wine, a singer-turned-lawmaker whose real name is Kyagulanyi Ssentamu, said the threats he faces as President Yoweri Museveni\u2019s main opponent \u201ccome in no unclear terms.\u201d",
      "Fears for Wine's safety have grown in recent months, fueled by regular attacks on X from Museveni\u2019s son and presumptive heir, army chief Muhoozi Kainerugaba. In January, Kainerugaba wrote he \u201cwould cut off\u201d Wine\u2019s head if the president allowed it, and he drew widespread criticism in May for saying he was holding Wine\u2019s missing bodyguard \u201cin my basement.\u201d The bodyguard later appeared unable to walk without support when presented in court, the apparent victim of torture.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a constant reminder that the threat is real, because this is no ordinary person,\u201d Wine said, speaking of Gen. Kainerugaba. \u201cThis is a person that is not only the son of the person in charge of the country but is also the person in charge of all the organs of violence. He heads the military, the police, the prisons, you know. He is above the law, and he has acted as such.\u201d",
      "Wine, 43, spoke to The Associated Press in an exclusive interview at the headquarters of his National Unity Platform party in the Ugandan capital of Kampala, a site briefly occupied by security forces in a raid last month.",
      "Museveni, 80, who has ruled Uganda since 1986, dismisses Wine as an agent of foreign interests and has even questioned his patriotism. But Wine, who denies the allegations, has a large following among working-class people in urban areas, and his party has the most seats of any opposition party in Parliament.",
      "In the 2021 election, Wine secured 35% of the vote, while Museveni, with 58%, posted his worst-ever result, establishing Wine as the president's most potent challenger in decades.

      "Ivory Coast\u2019s President Alassane Ouattara has announced that he would be running for a fourth term",
      "LAGOS, Nigeria -- The decision of Ivory Coast\u2019s President Alassane Ouattara to run for a fourth term risks a return to a past era of \u201cold guard dictator rule,\u201d an analyst warned on Wednesday.",
      "Ibrahim Anoba, an Africa affairs analyst at the Atlas Network, was speaking a day after Ouattara ended months of speculation about his contested candidacy with an announcement that is likely to lead to a near-guaranteed extension of a presidency that started in 2010.",
      "While Ouattara, 83, said his decision to run was informed by the \u201cunprecedented security, economic, and monetary challenges\u201d the country faces, his announcement comes after the disqualification of most of his prominent rivals, including former Credit Suisse chief executive Tidjane Thiam.",
      "After changing the constitution in 2016 to remove presidential term limits, Ouattara is the latest leader in West and Central Africa to attempt to stay in power with little or no challenge from a weakened opposition.",
      "Togo\u2019s Faure Gnassingb\u00e9 swapped the presidential system with a parliamentary system and introduced a new all-powerful role, while in Cameroon Paul Biya is eyeing an eighth term after being in power since 1982, nearly half his lifetime. Central African Republic\u2019s Faustin Touadera is seeking a third term amid a constitutional controversy.",
      "With Ivory Coast considered a regional powerhouse, analysts say a weakened opposition and the constitutional change that kept Ouattara in power after abolishing initial term limits could lead the country to an era of one-man rule, especially in a region where democracy is increasingly being challenged.",
      "Opposition protests against Ouattara have been blocked, and several protesters have been arrested and accused of disturbing public order.",
      "\u201cWe might be sliding back to that era of old men, old guard dictator rule in West Africa because (of) the attitude of the military and equally the civilian rulers,\u201d said Anoba. \u201cAnd the announcement of Ouattarra is a reflection of that reality.\u201d",
      "Opposition politicians are now rallying against Ouattara, which could feed into a growing wave of discontent among citizens battling declining economies and security challenges.",
      "\u201cIt is a repetition of the same problem that we have seen lead to the same consequences,\u201d said Anoba.",
      "West and Central Africa has recorded 8 coups since 2020, with the military juntas sometimes pointing to the lack of fair democratic processes as one of their reasons for deposing elected governments.",

      "\u201cWhat we are having at the moment across West and Central Africa is status-quo elections,\u201d said Beverly Ochieng, a senior analyst at Control Risks. \u201cThey end up reinforcing the authority and executive power of the incumbent in a way the opposition parties are not able to challenge it.\u201d",
      "Ochieng added: \u201cThere is also almost like an equivalent in the sense that people want to prolong their stay in power and are willing to use constitutional and transitional means to achieve.\"",
      "Ivory Coast has maintained its reputation as one of Africa\u2019s most stable democracies, especially after its ruinous civil wars. It has established itself as a major African economic power, mostly due to the policies of Ouattara\u2019s presidency.",
      "However, beneath the veneer of stability is a firm grip on government institutions that makes it impossible for the opposition to challenge the ruling party, analysts say.",
      "Ivory Coast has frequently experienced electoral violence, which has killed several people, even pushing it close to another civil war in 2011 when then-leader Laurent Gbagbo refused to concede defeat after losing the election, and some 3,000 people were killed in the violence that followed.",

      "His seizure from his home in the Luhansk region in April 2022 \u2014 weeks after Moscow's full-scale invasion \u2014 was part of a coordinated operation by pro-Russian forces who detained him and two other Ukrainian OSCE workers. Maksym Petrov, an interpreter, also was seized in the Luhansk region, while Vadym Golda, another security assistant, was detained in neighboring Donetsk.",

      "Chinese scientists have been developing strategies to counter Elon Musk's Starlink satellites, which they see as a threat",
      "ROME -- Stealth submarines fitted with space-shooting lasers, supply-chain sabotage and custom-built attack satellites armed with ion thrusters. Those are just some of the strategies Chinese scientists have been developing to counter what Beijing sees as a potent threat: Elon Musk\u2019 s armada of Starlink communications satellites.",
      "Chinese government and military scientists, concerned about Starlink\u2019s potential use by adversaries in a military confrontation and for spying, have published dozens of papers in public journals that explore ways to hunt and destroy Musk\u2019s satellites, an Associated Press review found.",
      "Chinese researchers believe that Starlink \u2014 a vast constellation of low-orbit satellites that deliver cheap, fast and ubiquitous connectivity even in remote areas \u2014 poses a high risk to the Chinese government and its strategic interests. That fear has mostly been driven by the company\u2019s close ties to the U.S. intelligence and defense establishment, as well as its growing global footprint.",
      "\u201cAs the United States integrates Starlink technology into military space assets to gain a strategic advantage over its adversaries, other countries increasingly perceive Starlink as a security threat in nuclear, space, and cyber domains,\u201d wrote professors from China\u2019s National University of Defense Technology in a 2023 paper.",
      "Chinese researchers are not the only ones concerned about Starlink, which has a stranglehold on certain space-based communications. Some traditional U.S. allies are also questioning the wisdom of handing over core communications infrastructure \u2014 and a potential trove of data \u2014 to a company run by an unpredictable foreign businessman whose allegiances are not always clear.",
      "Apprehensions deepened after Russia\u2019s 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine made clear the battlefield advantages Starlink satellites could convey and have been exacerbated by Musk\u2019s proliferating political interests.",
      "Musk pumped tens of millions of dollars into President Donald Trump\u2019s reelection effort and emerged, temporarily, as a key adviser and government official. As Musk toys with the idea of starting his own political party, he has also taken an increasing interest in European politics, using his influence to promote an array of hard-right and insurgent figures often at odds with establishment politicians.",
      "Musk left the Trump administration in May and within days his relationship with Trump publicly imploded in a feud on social media. SpaceX, the rocket launch and space-based communications company that Musk founded and that operates Starlink, remains inextricably linked with core U.S. government functions. It has won billions in contracts to provide launch services for NASA missions and military satellites, recuperate astronauts stranded at the International Space Station and build a network of spy satellites for the National Reconnaissance Office.",
      "Starlink's space dominance has sparked a global scramble to come up with viable alternatives. But its crushing first-mover advantage has given SpaceX near monopoly power, further complicating the currents of business, politics and national security that converge on Musk and his companies.",
      "Since its first launches in 2019, Starlink has come to account for about two-thirds of all active satellites, according to Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, who writes a newsletter tracking satellite launches. SpaceX operates more than 8,000 active satellites and eventually aims to deploy tens of thousands more.",
      "Beijing\u2019s tendency to view Starlink as tool of U.S. military power has sharpened its efforts to develop countermeasures \u2014 which, if deployed, could increase the risk of collateral damage to other customers as SpaceX expands its global footprint. The same satellites that pass over China also potentially serve Europe, Ukraine, the United States and other geographies as they continue their path around the earth.",
      "Starlink says it operates in more than 140 countries, and recently made inroads in Vietnam, Niger, Somalia, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Pakistan. In June, Starlink also obtained a license to operate in India, overcoming national security concerns and powerful domestic telecom interests to crack open a tech-savvy market of nearly 1.5 billion people.",
      "On the company\u2019s own map of coverage, it has very few dead zones beyond those in North Korea, Iran and China.",
      "No other country or company is close to catching up with Starlink. Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos has taken aim at rival Musk with Project Kuiper, which launched its first batch of internet satellites into orbit in April. So far Amazon has just 78 satellites in orbit, with 3,232 planned, according to McDowell, and London-based Eutelstat OneWeb has around 650 satellites in orbit, a fraction of the fleet it had initially planned.",
      "The European Union is spending billions to develop its own satellite array \u2014 called the IRIS2 initiative \u2014 but remains woefully behind. EU officials have had to lobby their own member states not to sign contracts with Starlink while it gets up and running.",
      "\u201cWe are allies with the United States of America, but we need to have our strategic autonomy,\u201d said Christophe Grudler, a French member of the European Parliament who led legislative work on IRIS2. \u201cThe risk is not having our destiny in our own hands.\u201d",

In December, the company launched its first operational satellites, and now has 60 of a planned 13,000 in orbit, according to McDowell.",
      "Qianfan, a company backed by the Shanghai government, has launched 90 satellites out of some 15,000 planned.

Qianfan is also targeting customers in Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Oman, Pakistan and Uzbekistan and has ambitions to expand across the African continent, according to a slide presented at a space industry conference last year and published by the China Space Monitor.",
      "Concerns about Starlink\u2019s supremacy were supercharged by Russia\u2019s 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The war was a turning point in strategic thinking about Starlink and similar systems. Ukraine used the Starlink network to facilitate battlefield communications and power fighter and reconnaissance drones, providing a decisive ground-game advantage. At the same time, access to the satellites was initially controlled by a single man, Musk, who can \u2014 and did \u2014 interrupt critical services, refusing, for example, to extend coverage to support a Ukrainian counterattack in Russia-occupied Crimea.",

Therefore, it\u2019s a risk because the Chinese Communist Party can use technology as a lever against you. Now it\u2019s no different with the Americans.\u201d",
      "Nearly all of the 64 papers about Starlink reviewed by AP in Chinese journals were published after the conflict started.",
      "Starlink\u2019s omnipresence and potential military applications have unnerved Beijing and spurred the nation\u2019s scientists to action. In paper after paper, researchers painstakingly assessed the capabilities and vulnerabilities of a network that they clearly perceive as menacing and strove to understand what China might learn \u2014 and emulate \u2014 from Musk\u2019s company as Beijing works to develop a similar satellite system.",
      "Though Starlink does not operate in China, Musk\u2019s satellites nonetheless can sweep over Chinese territory. Researchers from China\u2019s National Defense University in 2023 simulated Starlink\u2019s coverage of key geographies, including Beijing, Taiwan, and the polar regions, and determined that Starlink can achieve round-the-clock coverage of Beijing.",
      "\u201cThe Starlink constellation coverage capacity of all regions in the world is improving steadily and in high speed,\u201d they concluded.",
      "In another paper \u2014 this one published by the government-backed China Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team \u2014 researchers mapped out vulnerabilities in Starlink\u2019s supply chain. \u201cThe company has more than 140 first-tier suppliers and a large number of second-tier and third-tier suppliers downstream,\u201d they wrote in a 2023 paper. \u201cThe supervision for cybersecurity is limited.\u201d",
      "Engineers from the People\u2019s Liberation Army, in another 2023 paper, suggested creating a fleet of satellites to tail Starlink satellites, collecting signals and potentially using corrosive materials to damage their batteries or ion thrusters to interfere with their solar panels.",
      "Other Chinese academics have encouraged Beijing to use global regulations and diplomacy to contain Musk, even as the nation\u2019s engineers have continued to elaborate active countermeasures: Deploy small optical telescopes already in commercial production to monitor Starlink arrays. Concoct deep fakes to create fictitious targets. Shoot powerful lasers to burn Musk\u2019s equipment.",
      "Some U.S. analysts say Beijing\u2019s fears may be overblown, but such assessments appear to have done little to cool domestic debate. One Chinese paper was titled, simply: \u201cWatch out for that Starlink.\u201d",

It comes as the country continues to suffer from the turmoil that followed the army's seizure of power from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in February 2021, which triggered widespread popular opposition.",
      "The military sought to justify its seizure of power by claiming massive fraud took place in the 2020 election, though independent observers did not find major irregularities. After peaceful pro-democracy demonstrations were put down with lethal force, many opponents of military rule took up arms. Large parts of Myanmar are now embroiled in conflict.",
      "The ruling military had said after its takeover that an election was its primary goal but repeatedly pushed back the date. The plan for a general election is widely seen as an attempt to normalize the military's seizure of power through the ballot box and deliver a result that ensures that the generals retain control.",
      "The new law, signed by Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, the head of the military government, says anyone who orates, speaks, organizes, incites, protests or distributes letters to disrupt any part of the electoral process shall be punished with three to 10 years imprisonment, as well as a fine.",
      "It also says that anyone who threatens, obstructs, abuses or severely hurts any personnel of the election commission, candidates or voters could be sentenced to three years to life in prison.",

      "President Donald Trump may have gotten his way with tariffs on some countries, but his overhaul of American trade policy has not gone unchallenged",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump has been getting his way on trade, strong-arming the European Union, Japan and other partners to accept once unthinkably high taxes on their exports to the United States.",
      "But his radical overhaul of American trade policy, in which he's bypassed Congress to slam big tariffs on most of the world's economies, has not gone unchallenged. He's facing at least seven lawsuits charging that he's overstepped his authority. The plaintiffs want his biggest, boldest tariffs thrown out.",
      "And they won Round One.",
      "In May, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of International Trade, a specialized federal court in New York, ruled that Trump exceeded his powers when he declared a national emergency to plaster taxes \u2014 tariffs \u2014 on imports from almost every country in the world. In reaching its decision, the court combined two challenges \u2014 one by five businesses and one by 12 U.S. states \u2014 into a single case.",
      "Now it goes on to Round Two.",
      "On Thursday, the 11 judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, which typically specializes in patent law, are scheduled to hear oral arguments from the Trump administration and from the states and businesses that want his sweeping import taxes struck down.",
      "That court earlier allowed the federal government to continue collecting Trump\u2019s tariffs as the case works its way through the judicial system.",
      "The issues are so weighty \u2014 involving the president\u2019s power to bypass Congress and impose taxes with huge economic consequences in the United States and abroad \u2014 that the case is widely expected to reach the U.S. Supreme Court, regardless of what the appeals court decides.",
      "Trump is an unabashed fan of tariffs. He sees the import taxes as an all-purpose economic tool that can bring manufacturing back to the United States, protect American industries, raise revenue to pay for the massive tax cuts in his \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill,\u2019\u2019 pressure countries into bending to his will, even end wars.",
      "The U.S. Constitution gives the power to impose taxes \u2014 including tariffs \u2014 to Congress. But lawmakers have gradually relinquished power over trade policy to the White House. And Trump has made the most of the power vacuum, raising the average U.S. tariff to more than 18%, highest since 1934, according to the Budget Lab at Yale University.",
      "At issue in the pending court case is Trump\u2019s use of the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose sweeping tariffs without seeking congressional approval or conducting investigations first. Instead, he asserted the authority to declare a national emergency that justified his import taxes.",

They also note that the trade deficit hardly meets the definition of an \u201cunusual and extraordinary\u2019\u2019 threat that would justify declaring an emergency under the law. The United States, after all, has run trade deficits \u2014 in which it buys more from foreign countries than it sells them \u2014 for 49 straight years and in good times and bad.",

      "South Dakota rancher Calli Williams wants to benefit from high beef prices, but it's not so simple",
      "MINNEAPOLIS -- In a period when retail beef prices are at an all-time high and consumers are still willing to pay, South Dakota rancher Calli Williams would love to cash in. But it's not so simple.",
      "Williams and her husband, Tate, raise about 70 cow-calf pairs near Letcher in southeastern South Dakota, roughly 18 miles (29 kilometers) north of Mitchell. They own about 80 acres (32 hectares) and rent additional pasture.",
      "Between the drought that hit cattle country hard over the last few years, still being maxed out on the grass available to feed their animals, and with land prices rising, she said, they simply can\u2019t yet make the financial investments that they\u2019d need to raise production.",
      "\u201cIt is a goal of ours to expand,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m just not sure if that will be in the 10-year plan or even longer.\u201d",
      "Farmers and ranchers across the U.S. would love to take greater advantage of the high prices, but with the U.S. herd at record lows, they can\u2019t meet the demand quickly. It's basic biology.",
      "\u201cIt takes three years to get more cows \u2014 between making a decision, having that gestation period, having the calf born, raising the calf until it, too, can have a calf,\" said Michael Swanson, chief agricultural economist for the Wells Fargo Agri-Food Institute in Minneapolis.",
      "The Williamses' county was hard hit by drought over the previous few seasons. Because of the lack of their grass and uneconomically high hay prices, they had to sell all their young females last year that could have produced more calves for them this year, she said.",
      "Their area has caught some rain lately, though. It has improved to just \u201cabnormally dry\u201d in recent U.S. Drought Monitor reports. But Williams said they\u2019re simply playing catch-up.",
      "Swanson said some of the main cattle areas in North America \u2014 from Saskatchewan and Manitoba in Canada down to Texas in the U.S. \u2014 are just naturally prone to drought. It's often boom or bust.",
      "Colin Woodall, CEO of the National Cattlemen\u2019s Beef Association, said a lot of cattle country has had good rain this summer, but it's a cyclical business.",
      "\u201cSometimes we have good times, and sometimes we don\u2019t,\u201d Woodall said. \u201cAnd we are just coming off what was a pretty significant negative hit to the cattle industry in \u201919, \u201920 and \u201921, with the height of the pandemic. So we have a lot of producers who are still trying to pay off bills from those times.\"",
      "And Woodall said his members are still leery. They're asking how long the better weather will last.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re getting some good moisture now. But will it be that way in the fall? Will it be that way next year?\u201d he said. \u201cBecause the last thing you want to do is pay to rebuild your herd and then just have to liquidate them again in six months to a year.\u201d",
      "Although it\u2019s difficult to attribute any single weather event, such as a drought, directly to climate change, scientists say that rising temperatures stoked by climate change are increasing the odds of both severe droughts and heavier precipitation, which wreak havoc on people and the environment.",
      "When extreme weather collides with tight margins, farmers and ranchers feel the squeeze.",
      "Retail beef prices have hit record highs with no relief for consumers in sight. Ground beef rose to an average of $6.12 per pound in June, up nearly 12% from 2024. The average price of all steaks rose 8% to $11.49 per pound.",

      "And the average prices that producers receive for cattle and calves have increased from $1.51 per pound in May 2020 to $4.05 in May of this year.",
      "The total U.S. cattle herd is the smallest it has been at midyear since the government began keeping those figures in 1973, and probably since the 1950s. There were few signs in the U.S. Department of Agriculture data released last Friday that producers have begun rebuilding herds.",
      "As of July 1, the U.S. had 94.2 million cattle and calves, down from the last midyear peak in 2019 of nearly 103 million. Critical for the future supply, 2025 calf production is projected at 33.1 million head, down 1% from last year.",
      "Derrell Peel, a livestock marketing specialist at Oklahoma State University, said if producers were planning to grow their herds, the USDA reports would have shown them keeping heifers \u2014 female cows that haven\u2019t given birth yet.",
      "While retail prices are high, consumers so far have been willing to pay them.",
      "Glynn Tonsor, who leads the Meat Demand Monitor at Kansas State University, said taste is the most important consideration when shoppers choose proteins \u2014 and beef remains the favorite.",
      "The late June report found that consumers were willing to fork out $17.62 a pound for rib-eye steaks and $8.82 for a pound of ground beef. That\u2019s more than the $7.13 they\u2019d pay for pork chops, $6.19 for bacon, or $8.55 for chicken breasts.",
      "A major reason, Woodall offered, is that the beef industry has focused on the eating experience.",
      "\u201cThe kind of beef that we are producing today is some of the highest quality, best tasting beef that we\u2019ve ever produced in history here in the United States,\" he said. \u201cSo, things such as USDA prime graded steaks that at one point in time you could only get in a restaurant, you can now get that in a grocery store.\u201d",
      "For consumers who balk at costs, the marketing specialist Peel said, pork and poultry are \u201cabundant and quite favorably priced.\"",
      "The Williamses, who are both 34, built their TW Angus business from scratch. Tate Williams started buying cattle when he was in high school, and they bought their land in 2015. They sell bulls in the spring and keep heifers when they can. They also raise steers in their own feedlot and sell the meat directly to consumers.",
      "\u201cWe would really like to expand our operation,\" Calli Williams said. \"We have a goal of being able to pass this on to the next generation,\u201d Williams said, meaning their sons Jack, 7, and Tommy, nearly 4.",
      "But recalling a friend\u2019s words, she said ranchers are a resilient bunch.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re optimistic that if Mother Nature \u2014 she wreaked havoc on us, whether that was a drought or a flood \u2014 that next year she\u2019ll be kinder to us, \u201c she said. \u201dOr, if the markets weren\u2019t on our side, we\u2019re optimistic that the markets will be on our side next time.\u201d",

      "ROME -- Stealth submarines fitted with space-shooting lasers, supply-chain sabotage and custom-built attack satellites armed with ion thrusters. Those are just some of the strategies Chinese scientists have been developing to counter what Beijing sees as a potent threat: Elon Musk\u2019 s armada of Starlink communications satellites.",
      "Chinese government and military scientists, concerned about Starlink\u2019s potential use by adversaries in a military confrontation and for spying, have published dozens of papers in public journals that explore ways to hunt and destroy Musk\u2019s satellites, an Associated Press review found.",
      "Chinese researchers believe that Starlink \u2014 a vast constellation of low-orbit satellites that deliver cheap, fast and ubiquitous connectivity even in remote areas \u2014 poses a high risk to the Chinese government and its strategic interests. That fear has mostly been driven by the company\u2019s close ties to the U.S. intelligence and defense establishment, as well as its growing global footprint.",
      "\u201cAs the United States integrates Starlink technology into military space assets to gain a strategic advantage over its adversaries, other countries increasingly perceive Starlink as a security threat in nuclear, space, and cyber domains,\u201d wrote professors from China\u2019s National University of Defense Technology in a 2023 paper.",
      "Chinese researchers are not the only ones concerned about Starlink, which has a stranglehold on certain space-based communications. Some traditional U.S. allies are also questioning the wisdom of handing over core communications infrastructure \u2014 and a potential trove of data \u2014 to a company run by an unpredictable foreign businessman whose allegiances are not always clear.",
      "Apprehensions deepened after Russia\u2019s 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine made clear the battlefield advantages Starlink satellites could convey and have been exacerbated by Musk\u2019s proliferating political interests.",
      "Musk pumped tens of millions of dollars into President Donald Trump\u2019s reelection effort and emerged, temporarily, as a key adviser and government official. As Musk toys with the idea of starting his own political party, he has also taken an increasing interest in European politics, using his influence to promote an array of hard-right and insurgent figures often at odds with establishment politicians.",
      "Musk left the Trump administration in May and within days his relationship with Trump publicly imploded in a feud on social media. SpaceX, the rocket launch and space-based communications company that Musk founded and that operates Starlink, remains inextricably linked with core U.S. government functions. It has won billions in contracts to provide launch services for NASA missions and military satellites, recuperate astronauts stranded at the International Space Station and build a network of spy satellites for the National Reconnaissance Office.",
      "Starlink's space dominance has sparked a global scramble to come up with viable alternatives. But its crushing first-mover advantage has given SpaceX near monopoly power, further complicating the currents of business, politics and national security that converge on Musk and his companies.",
      "Since its first launches in 2019, Starlink has come to account for about two-thirds of all active satellites, according to Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, who writes a newsletter tracking satellite launches. SpaceX operates more than 8,000 active satellites and eventually aims to deploy tens of thousands more.",
      "Beijing\u2019s tendency to view Starlink as tool of U.S. military power has sharpened its efforts to develop countermeasures \u2014 which, if deployed, could increase the risk of collateral damage to other customers as SpaceX expands its global footprint. The same satellites that pass over China also potentially serve Europe, Ukraine, the United States and other geographies as they continue their path around the earth.",
      "Starlink says it operates in more than 140 countries, and recently made inroads in Vietnam, Niger, Somalia, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Pakistan. In June, Starlink also obtained a license to operate in India, overcoming national security concerns and powerful domestic telecom interests to crack open a tech-savvy market of nearly 1.5 billion people.",
      "On the company\u2019s own map of coverage, it has very few dead zones beyond those in North Korea, Iran and China.",
      "No other country or company is close to catching up with Starlink. Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos has taken aim at rival Musk with Project Kuiper, which launched its first batch of internet satellites into orbit in April. So far Amazon has just 78 satellites in orbit, with 3,232 planned, according to McDowell, and London-based Eutelstat OneWeb has around 650 satellites in orbit, a fraction of the fleet it had initially planned.",
      "The European Union is spending billions to develop its own satellite array \u2014 called the IRIS2 initiative \u2014 but remains woefully behind. EU officials have had to lobby their own member states not to sign contracts with Starlink while it gets up and running.",
      "\u201cWe are allies with the United States of America, but we need to have our strategic autonomy,\u201d said Christophe Grudler, a French member of the European Parliament who led legislative work on IRIS2. \u201cThe risk is not having our destiny in our own hands.\u201d",

      "China has been public about its ambition to build its own version of Starlink to meet both domestic national security needs and compete with Starlink in foreign markets. In 2021, Beijing established the state-owned China SatNet company and tasked it with launching a megaconstellation with military capabilities, known as Guowang. In December, the company launched its first operational satellites, and now has 60 of a planned 13,000 in orbit, according to McDowell.",
      "Qianfan, a company backed by the Shanghai government, has launched 90 satellites out of some 15,000 planned. The Brazilian government in November announced a deal with Qianfan, after Musk had a scorching public fight with a Brazilian judge investigating X, who also froze Space X\u2019s bank accounts in the country. Qianfan is also targeting customers in Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Oman, Pakistan and Uzbekistan and has ambitions to expand across the African continent, according to a slide presented at a space industry conference last year and published by the China Space Monitor.",
      "Concerns about Starlink\u2019s supremacy were supercharged by Russia\u2019s 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The war was a turning point in strategic thinking about Starlink and similar systems. Ukraine used the Starlink network to facilitate battlefield communications and power fighter and reconnaissance drones, providing a decisive ground-game advantage. At the same time, access to the satellites was initially controlled by a single man, Musk, who can \u2014 and did \u2014 interrupt critical services, refusing, for example, to extend coverage to support a Ukrainian counterattack in Russia-occupied Crimea.",

Therefore, it\u2019s a risk because the Chinese Communist Party can use technology as a lever against you. Now it\u2019s no different with the Americans.\u201d",
      "Nearly all of the 64 papers about Starlink reviewed by AP in Chinese journals were published after the conflict started.",
      "Starlink\u2019s omnipresence and potential military applications have unnerved Beijing and spurred the nation\u2019s scientists to action. In paper after paper, researchers painstakingly assessed the capabilities and vulnerabilities of a network that they clearly perceive as menacing and strove to understand what China might learn \u2014 and emulate \u2014 from Musk\u2019s company as Beijing works to develop a similar satellite system.",
      "Though Starlink does not operate in China, Musk\u2019s satellites nonetheless can sweep over Chinese territory. Researchers from China\u2019s National Defense University in 2023 simulated Starlink\u2019s coverage of key geographies, including Beijing, Taiwan, and the polar regions, and determined that Starlink can achieve round-the-clock coverage of Beijing.",
      "\u201cThe Starlink constellation coverage capacity of all regions in the world is improving steadily and in high speed,\u201d they concluded.",
      "In another paper \u2014 this one published by the government-backed China Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team \u2014 researchers mapped out vulnerabilities in Starlink\u2019s supply chain. \u201cThe company has more than 140 first-tier suppliers and a large number of second-tier and third-tier suppliers downstream,\u201d they wrote in a 2023 paper. \u201cThe supervision for cybersecurity is limited.\u201d",
      "Engineers from the People\u2019s Liberation Army, in another 2023 paper, suggested creating a fleet of satellites to tail Starlink satellites, collecting signals and potentially using corrosive materials to damage their batteries or ion thrusters to interfere with their solar panels.",
      "Other Chinese academics have encouraged Beijing to use global regulations and diplomacy to contain Musk, even as the nation\u2019s engineers have continued to elaborate active countermeasures: Deploy small optical telescopes already in commercial production to monitor Starlink arrays. Concoct deep fakes to create fictitious targets. Shoot powerful lasers to burn Musk\u2019s equipment.",
      "Some U.S. analysts say Beijing\u2019s fears may be overblown, but such assessments appear to have done little to cool domestic debate. One Chinese paper was titled, simply: \u201cWatch out for that Starlink.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Investigators have found that a helicopter involved in a deadly crash with a passenger plane over Washington was flying above its height limit",
      "Incorrect altitude readings on the Army helicopter that collided with a passenger plane over Washington, D.C., in January contributed to the aircraft getting too close, but air traffic controllers warned about the hazards helicopter traffic presented years before the crash.",
      "Those warnings came even before the 85 near misses near the airport in the three years before the crash. But despite the concerns that were raised about the route the Black Hawk helicopter followed that night, the Federal Aviation Administration didn\u2019t make changes to it or warn pilots about it.",
      "The details came out of the first day of National Transportation Safety Board hearings in Washington, where investigators highlighted several of the factors that contributed to the crash between the American Airlines plane from Wichita, Kansas, and the Black Hawk helicopter near Ronald Reagan National Airport that was the deadliest aviation disaster in America since November 2001.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s so bureaucratic,\u201d NTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy said. \u201cI mean we heard it in the testimony today: \u2018Oh you could bring it up in another symposium or another group. or you could take this option or we said no.\u2019 But then I asked did you provide an alternative? That\u2019s why people are so critical of the federal government because you can\u2019t ensure safety.\u201d",
      "Representatives of the Army and Federal Aviation Administration tried to deflect responsibility throughout the hearing. The Army acknowledged that their Black Hawks altimeters might be more than 100 feet (30 meters) off, but they seemed to say that was acceptable because their pilots\u2019 goal is to maintain altitude within 100 feet of a limit.",
      "Army officials instead raised concerns about the lack of separation between landing aircraft and helicopters flying on approved FAA routes near the airport. But later in the day, FAA and Army officials both implied that those routes were never supposed to ensure separation. Instead they suggested that it was up to the air traffic controller to keep helicopters from flying on that route anytime planes were taking off or landing from that runway.",
      "Aviation lawyer Bob Clifford, who is representing several of the victims\u2019 families said there was a lot of \u201cfinger pointing\u201d and \u201cno acceptance of responsibility and accountability\u201d during the hearing.",
      "The board\u2019s final report won\u2019t be released until sometime next year, but it became clear Wednesday how small a margin of error there was for helicopters flying the route the Black Hawk took the night of the crash.",
      "The January nighttime incident was the first in a string of crashes and near misses this year that have alarmed officials and the traveling public, despite statistics that still show flying remains the safest form of transportation.",
      "A video animation showed where the helicopter and airliner were leading up to the collision. It showed how the helicopter flew above the 200 feet (61 meters) altitude limit on the helicopter route along the Potomac River before colliding with the plane.",
      "Investigators said Wednesday the flight data recorder showed the helicopter was actually 80 feet to 100 feet (24 to 30 meters) higher than the barometric altimeter the pilots relied upon showed they were flying. So the NTSB conducted tests on three other helicopters from the same unit in a flight over the same area and found similar discrepancies in their altimeters.",
      "Dan Cooper with Sikorsky helicopters said that when the older Black Hawk helicopter involved in the crash was designed in the 1970s, it used a style of altimeter that was common at the time. Newer helicopters have air data computers that help provide more accurate altitude readings.",
      "Army Chief Warrant Officer Kylene Lewis told the board that she wouldn\u2019t find an 80 to 100 foot discrepancy between the different altimeters on a helicopter alarming because at lower altitudes she would be relying more on the radar altimeter than the barometric altimeter. Below 500 feet (152 meters), Lewis said she would be checking both instruments and cross referencing them, although that's not something every Army pilot is trained to do.",
      "Army officials said the greater concern is that the FAA approved routes around Reagan airport that included such separation distances as small as 75 feet between helicopters and planes when planes are landing on a certain runway at Reagan.",
      "\u201cThe fact that we have less than 500 foot separation is a concern for me,\u201d said Scott Rosengren, chief engineer in the office that manages the Army\u2019s utility helicopters.",
      "But Rosengren said that \u201cif he was king for a day\u201d he would immediately retire all the older Black Hawk models like the one involved in this crash and replace them with newer versions of the helicopters.",
      "Army officials and the head of a local medevac helicopter company that flies around Washington told the board they believed air traffic controllers would never let them fly the helicopter route involved in the crash anytime a plane was approaching the runway.",

      "Chief Warrant Officer David Van Vetchen said after the crash that he talked to many of his fellow pilots and everyone had the same assumption that controllers would never allow them to fly across the path of the runway the American plane was approaching before the crash. But Homendy said other pilots in the unit told investigators they were allowed to fly underneath landing planes.",
      "Citing the numbers for runways, Van Vetchen said that \u201c100% of the time when I was on route four and 33/15 was active\u201d he would be instructed to hold until after the plane landed or took off from that runway.",
      "During the two minutes before the crash, one air traffic controller was directing airport traffic and helicopters in the area, a task that involved speaking to or receiving communications from several different aircraft on two different frequencies, according to the NTSB\u2019s History of Flight Performance Study released Wednesday.",
      "The air traffic controller had spoken to or received communications from the Black Hawk helicopter, an airplane that was taking off, an Air Force helicopter, an airplane on the ground, a medical helicopter and an inbound flight that was not the American Airlines plane that would crash.",
      "\u201cAll aircraft could hear the controller, but helicopters could only hear other helicopters on their frequency and airplanes only other airplanes,\u201d the report stated. \u201cThis resulted in a number of stepped on transmissions as helicopters and airplanes were not aware when the other was communicating.\u201d",
      "Stepped on transmissions are those that are unheard or blocked because of other transmissions. The NTSB report provides a list of 29 separate communications between the airport tower and other aircraft during approximately the 1 minute and 57 seconds before the collision.",
      "Previously disclosed air traffic control audio had the helicopter pilot telling the controller twice that they saw the airplane and would avoid it. Officials on Wednesday also raised the use of night vision goggles, which limit the wearer's field of view, on the helicopter as a factor.",
      "Investigations have already shown the FAA failed to recognize a troubling history of 85 near misses around Ronald Reagan National Airport in the years before the collision, and that the Army's helicopters routinely flew around the nation's capital with a key piece of locating equipment, known as ADS-B Out, turned off.",
      "On Wednesday, it came out that even if they had been turned on, the ADS-B Out systems on most of the helicopters in the same unit as the one that crashed wouldn't work because they had been installed incorrectly. When the NTSB uncovered that problem, the Army sent out an alert about it and worked to quickly reprogram the units so they would work.",
      "Homendy highlighted that an FAA working group raised concerns about all the helicopter traffic around Reagan airport and the risk of a collision in 2022, but the FAA refused to add a warning to helicopter charts urging pilots to use caution when this runway was in use.",
      "Homendy said \u201cevery sign was there that there was a safety risk and the tower was telling you that.\u201d But after the accident the FAA transferred managers out of the tower instead of acknowledging that they had been warned.",
      "\u201cWhat you did is you transferred people out instead of taking ownership over the fact that everybody in FAA in the tower was saying there was a problem,\u201d Homendy said. \u201cBut you guys are pointing out, \u2018Welp, our bureaucratic process. Somebody should have brought it up at some other symposium.\u2019 Are you kidding me? 67 people are dead. How do you explain that?\u201d",
      "U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, a Republican, introduced legislation Tuesday to require all aircraft operators to use both forms of ADS-B, or Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast, the technology to broadcast aircraft location data to other planes and air traffic controllers. Most aircraft today are equipped with ADS-B Out equipment but the airlines would have to add the more comprehensive ADS-B In technology to their planes.",
      "The legislation would revoke an exemption on ADS-B transmission requests for Department of Defense aircrafts.",
      "Homendy said her agency has been recommending that move for decades after several other crashes.",
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said that while he\u2019d like to discuss \u201ca few tweaks,\u201d the legislation is \u201cthe right approach.\u201d He also suggested that the previous administration \u201cwas asleep at the wheel\u201d amid dozens of near-misses in the airspace around Washington's airspace.",

      "Officials and workers in the textile industry of the small African nation of Lesotho are holding their breath as a key deadline for U.S.-imposed tariffs approaches",
      "MASERU, Lesotho -- The deafening roar of hundreds of sewing machines has gone silent. Spools of thread in every color are covered in dust. The warehouse is dark and empty.",
      "In the tiny African nation of Lesotho, clothing manufacturer Tzicc's business has dried up in the face of tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump's administration. A few months ago, work was steady. The factory's 1,300 employees have made and exported sportswear to American stores, including JCPenney, Walmart and Costco.",
      "But when Trump announced sweeping new tariffs on nearly all U.S. trading partners in April, Lesotho found itself topping the list, with a rate of 50% \u2014 higher even than that of China, where the economy is 8,000 times larger. Officials here and economic experts said they were baffled.",
      "Since then, Trump backed off \u2014 temporarily. During a monthslong pause for trade talks, the U.S. has charged a baseline 10% tariff and announced new rates for dozens of countries starting Friday. Lesotho\u2019s rate will be set at Trump\u2019s whim, with aides suggesting that tariffs charged on goods from smaller African countries could top 10%.",
      "Many nations have received letters laying out a new tariff. With the pause set to expire Friday, Lesotho officials say they've not received one and they find themselves among the countries where Trump says officials simply don\u2019t have time for one-on-one negotiations. Leaders \u2014 and the 12,000 people employed by garment factories exporting to the U.S. market \u2014 are still waiting.",
      "The damage has already rippled through Lesotho\u2019s economy, where textile manufacturing comprises the largest private industry with more than 30,000 workers in 2024.",
      "For Tzicc and its customers, the threat and apparent singling out of Lesotho were enough. Management decided to rush to deliver preexisting orders before tariffs resumed. But American buyers stopped placing new orders. With no work left, virtually all the factory's employees were sent home \u2014 potentially permanently.",
      "\u201cWell, unfortunately, we finished,\u201d factory compliance manager Rahila Omar said, pointing out the irony of the strategy as she walked among rows of silenced and covered machines. \u201cThat is why now we don't have any work.\u201d",
      "Omar is one of a handful of employees left in the eerily quiet factory. A few remain in the accounting department; others empty leftover stock to a warehouse elsewhere.",
      "Officials and workers fear this may be a sign of what's to come for other factories in Lesotho, where poverty is widespread among the population of 2 million and most textile workers single-handedly support their families.",
      "In March, a month before slapping Lesotho with the 50% tariff, Trump described it as a place \u201cnobody has ever heard of,\" struggling to pronounce the nation's name in a speech criticizing U.S. foreign aid.",
      "It's true Lesotho is a \u201cvery minuscule economy,\" as its own trade minister, Mokhethi Shelile, described it.",
      "But its relationship with Washington dates back decades. The U.S. was the first country to open an embassy in the capital, Maseru, after Lesotho declared independence from the United Kingdom in 1966. The military received U.S. training, and hundreds of millions in U.S. funds were sent to Lesotho to fight the HIV/AIDS epidemic via the now defunctUSAID office and the PEPFAR program.",
      "As textiles grew to become Lesotho's main export, some 75% of its product went to the U.S. Lesotho became known as Africa's denim capital. If an American purchased jeans from a U.S. brand such as Wrangler or Levi's, they may have been \u201cMade in Lesotho,\u201d as tags still note.",
      "In 2000, the U.S. signed the African Growth and Opportunity Act, allowing Lesotho and other African nations to export goods to the U.S. duty free.",
      "Shelile said he was in the process of negotiating AGOA\u2019s September renewal when he was awakened in the middle of the night by texts from aides bearing news of the 50% U.S. tariffs.",
      "\u201cNo, this cannot be real,\u201d Shelile remembers thinking. \u201cWhat did we do to deserve this?\u201d",
      "According to the Trump administration, Lesotho charges a 99% tariff on U.S. goods. The government here said it doesn\u2019t know how the U.S. calculated that.",
      "In theory, the tariff decision was based on trade deficit: Lesotho\u2019s exports to the U.S. were around $240 million last year \u2014 mainly clothing and diamonds \u2014 and imports from the U.S. were only $2.8 million. But in practice, the math is more complicated than that. And in reality, Lesotho simply cannot afford to import more U.S. products. Nearly half the population lives below the poverty line.",
      "\u201cThe trade deficit that exists between Lesotho and the U.S. is a natural trade deficit that can happen when you have these types of disparities between two economies,\" Shelile said. \"It cannot be breached and certainly cannot be breached by imposing tariffs.\u201d",
      "Last year, Lesotho's overall unemployment rate was about 30%, national data shows. For those 35 and younger, it was nearly 50%.",

      "The National Transportation Safety Board has opened public hearings on a January midair collision between an Army Black Hawk helicopter and a commercial jet",
      "The National Transportation Safety Board enters a second day of public hearings Thursday on the January midair collision between an Army Black Hawk helicopter and a passenger plane that killed all 67 people aboard the aircrafts.",
      "On the first day, investigators highlighted a number of factors that may have contributed to the crash and the warnings about helicopter traffic that FAA received years before the tragedy over the Potomac River.",
      "It\u2019s too early for the board to identify what exactly caused the crash. The board\u2019s final report won\u2019t be released until sometime next year. But it became clear Wednesday how small a margin of error there was for helicopters flying the route the Black Hawk took the night of the nation\u2019s deadliest plane crash since November 2001.",
      "The January incident was the first in a string of crashes and near misses this year that have alarmed officials and the traveling public, despite statistics that still show flying remains the safest form of transportation.",
      "NTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy said an FAA working group raised concerns about all the helicopter traffic around Reagan airport and the risk of a collision in 2022, but the FAA refused to add a warning to helicopter charts urging pilots to use caution when this runway was in use.",
      "\u201cThis is the very event that this would have been the cautionary note for,\u201d she said.",
      "Video and animation presented during the proceeding's first day showed the helicopter flying above the 200 feet (61 meters) altitude limit before colliding with the plane.",
      "Investigators said Wednesday the flight data recorder showed the helicopter was actually 80 feet to 100 feet (24 to 30 meters) higher than the barometric altimeter the pilots relied upon showed they were flying. So the NTSB conducted tests on three other helicopters from the same unit in a flight over the same area and found similar discrepancies in their altimeters.",
      "Dan Cooper with Sikorsky helicopters said that when the Black Hawk helicopter involved in the crash was designed in the 1970s, it used a style of altimeter that was common at the time. Newer helicopters have air data computers that didn\u2019t exist back then that help provide more accurate altitude readings.",
      "Chief Warrant Officer Kylene Lewis told the board that she wouldn\u2019t find an 80 to 100 foot discrepancy between the different altimeters on a helicopter alarming because at lower altitudes she would be relying more on the radar altimeter than the barometric altimeter. Below 500 feet (152 meters), Lewis said she would be checking both instruments and cross referencing them.",
      "Army officials said a discrepancy of 70 to 100 feet (21 to 30 meters) between the Black Hawk\u2019s altimeters is within the acceptable range because pilots are expected to maintain their altitude plus or minus 100 feet.",
      "The greater concern is that the FAA approved routes around Reagan airport that included such small separation distances between helicopters and planes when planes are landing.",

      "During the two minutes before the crash, one air traffic controller was directing airport traffic and helicopters in the area, a task that involved speaking to or receiving communications from several different aircraft, according to the NTSB\u2019s History of Flight Performance Study.",
      "The air traffic controller had spoken to or received communications from the Black Hawk helicopter, an airplane that was taking off, an Air Force helicopter, an airplane on the ground, a medical helicopter and an inbound flight that was not the American Airlines plane that would crash.",
      "\u201cAll aircraft could hear the controller, but helicopters could only hear other helicopters on their frequency and airplanes only other airplanes,\u201d the report stated. \u201cThis resulted in a number of stepped on transmissions as helicopters and airplanes were not aware when the other was communicating.\u201d",
      "Stepped on transmissions are those that are unheard or blocked because of other transmissions. The NTSB report provides a list of 29 separate communications between the airport tower and other aircraft during approximately the 1 minute and 57 seconds before the collision.",
      "Previously disclosed air traffic control audio had the helicopter pilot telling the controller twice that they saw the airplane and would avoid it.",
      "The animation ended with surveillance video showing the helicopter colliding with the plane in a fiery crash.",
      "Investigations have already shown the FAA failed to recognize a troubling history of 85 near misses around Ronald Reagan National Airport in the years before the collision, and that the Army\u2019s helicopters routinely flew around the nation\u2019s capital with a key piece of locating equipment, known as ADS-B Out, turned off.",

      "President Donald Trump says the United States and India are still negotiating on trade despite new tariffs slated to begin in a few days",
      "WASHINGTON -- The United States will impose a 25% tariff on goods from India, plus an additional import tax because of India\u2019s purchasing of Russian oil, President Donald Trump said Wednesday.",
      "The new tariffs were part of a flurry of trade activity that included a series of executive actions regarding Brazil, copper and shipments of goods worth less than $800, as well as a reduced 15% tax on imports from South Korea, including its autos. It was all a prelude to Friday when Trump's new tariff regime is scheduled to start, an event the White House has portrayed as a testament to Trump's negotiating skills even as concerns persist about the taxes hurting growth and increasing inflationary pressures.",
      "India \u201cis our friend,\u201d Trump said on his Truth Social platform announcing the taxes, but its tariffs on U.S. products \u201care far too high.\u201d",
      "The Republican president added India buys military equipment and oil from Russia, enabling Moscow's war in Ukraine. As a result, he intends to charge an additional \u201cpenalty\u201d starting on Friday as part of the launch of his administration\u2019s revised tariffs on multiple countries.",
      "Trump told reporters on Wednesday the two countries were still in the middle of negotiations on trade despite the tariffs slated to begin in a few days.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re talking to India now,\" the president said. \"We\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d",
      "The Indian government said Wednesday it's studying the implications of Trump's tariffs announcement.",
      "India and the U.S. have been engaged in negotiations on concluding a \u201cfair, balanced and mutually beneficial\u201d bilateral trade agreement over the last few months, and New Delhi remains committed to that objective, India's Trade Ministry said in a statement.",
      "Trump on Wednesday also signed separate orders to tax imports of copper at 50% and justify his 50% tariffs on Brazil due to their criminal prosecution of former President Jair Bolsonaro and treatment of U.S. social media companies. Trump also signed an order saying that government now had the systems in place to close the tariff loophole on \u201cde minimis\u201d shipments, which had enabled goods priced under $800 to enter America duty-free, largely from China.",
      "The South Korea agreement will impose a 15% tariff, instead of the 25% Trump had threatened. South Korea would also buy $100 billion in energy resources from the U.S. and provide $350 billion for \u201cinvestments owned and controlled by the United States, and selected by myself, as president,\u201d Trump said.",
      "There is also an agreement with Pakistan that includes the development of its oil reserves. Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent briefed Trump on trade talks with China.",
      "Trump's announcement comes after a slew of negotiated trade frameworks with the European Union, Japan, the Philippines and Indonesia \u2014 all of which he said would open markets for American goods while enabling the U.S. to raise tax rates on imports. The president views tariff revenues as a way to help offset the budget deficit increases tied to his recent income tax cuts and generate more domestic factory jobs.",
      "While Trump has effectively wielded tariffs as a cudgel to reset the terms of trade, the economic impact is uncertain as most economists expect a slowdown in U.S. growth and greater inflationary pressures as some of the costs of the taxes are passed along to domestic businesses and consumers.",
      "There's also the possibility of more tariffs coming on trade partners with Russia as well as on pharmaceutical drugs and computer chips.",

      "This summer, President Donald Trump has begun to chisel back Medicaid and food stamps",
      "WASHINGTON -- On this day in 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed legislation into law that launched Medicaid, creating a U.S. health care safety net for millions of low-income Americans in what would become one of the crowning achievements of his domestic legacy.",
      "A year earlier, he did the same for food stamps, drawing on President John F. Kennedy\u2019s first executive order for the development of \u201ca positive food and nutrition program for all Americans.\u201d",
      "This summer, with the stroke of a pen, President Donald Trump began to chisel them back.",
      "The Republican Party's big tax and spending bill delivered not just $4.5 trillion in tax breaks for Americans but some of the most substantial changes to the landmark safety net programs in their history. The trade-off will cut more than $1 trillion over a decade from federal health care and food assistance, largely by imposing work requirements on those receiving aid and by shifting certain federal costs onto the states.",
      "While Republicans in Congress argue the trims are needed to rightsize the federal programs that have grown over the decades and to prevent rising federal deficits, they are also moving toward a long-sought GOP goal of shrinking the federal government and the services it provides.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re making the first changes to the welfare state in generations,\u201d House Speaker Mike Johnson said in a recent podcast interview.",
      "As the tax breaks and spending cuts law begins to take shape, it is unleashing a new era of uncertainty for the safety net programs that millions of people in communities across the nation have grown to depend on, with political ramifications to come.",
      "Polling shows most U.S. adults don\u2019t think the government is overspending on the programs. Americans broadly support increasing or maintaining existing levels of funding for popular safety net programs, including Social Security and Medicare, according to the poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.",
      "Local governments are scrambling to figure out how they will comply with the new landscape, calculating whether they will need to raise their own taxes to cover costs, trim budgets elsewhere or cut back the aid provided to Americans.",
      "\u201cThe cuts are really big, they are really broad and they are deeply damaging,\u201d said Sharon Parrott, president of the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a research institute in Washington.",
      "\u201cThe consequences are millions of people losing health care coverage,\u201d she said. \u201cMillions of people losing food assistance. And the net result of that is higher poverty, more hardship.\u201d",
      "At the same time, certain people who receive aid, including parents of teenagers and older Americans up to age 64, will have to prepare to work, engage in classes or do community service for 80 hours a month to meet new requirements.",
      "All told, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates 10 million more people will end up without health insurance. Some 3 million fewer people will participate in the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program, known as SNAP.",
      "\u201cPeople are really concerned what this means for their fiscal health,\u201d said Mark Ritacco, chief governmental affairs officer at the National Association of Counties, which held its annual conference the week after Trump signed the bill into law.",
      "The organization had pushed senators to delay the start dates for some Medicaid changes, and it hopes that further conversations with lawmakers in Congress can prevent some of them from ever taking hold. At its conference, questions swirled.",

      "And it quickly took off. Almost every state signed on to participate in Medicaid by 1970, according to the KFF, an organization focused on health policy. It soon went beyond covering its core population to include pregnant women, school-age children and not just the very poor but also those with incomes just over the federal poverty limit, which is now about $15,650 annually for a single person and $26,650 for a family of three.",

      "Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, who delivered the longest speech in House history while trying to stall the bill, said the changes will hurt households and communities nationwide.",
      "\u201cWho are these people?\u201d Jeffries said. \u201cRipping health care away from the American people. The largest cuts in Medicaid in American history. Ripping food out of the mouths of children, seniors and veterans who are going to go hungry as a result of this one big, ugly bill.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve is expected to leave its short-term interest rate unchanged on Wednesday for the fifth straight meeting, a move that will likely underscore the deep divide between how Chair Jerome Powell and his chief critic, President Donald Trump, see the economy.",
      "The Fed itself, to be sure, is increasingly divided over its next steps, and many economists expect that two members of the Fed's governing board \u2014 both appointed by Trump \u2014 could dissent on Wednesday in favor of cutting rates. If so, that would be the first time two governors vote against the chair since 1993.",
      "Even so, the gap between the views of the Fed's interest-rate setting committee, chaired by Powell, and the White House is unusually large. In several areas, Trump's views sharply contrast with that of the Fed's leadership, setting up likely clashes for years to come, even after Powell's term as chair ends in May 2026.",
      "For example, Trump says that because the U.S. economy is doing well, the Fed should cut rates, as if the U.S. is a blue-chip company that should pay less to borrow than a risky start-up.",
      "But Fed officials \u2014 and nearly all economists \u2014 see it the other way: A solid economy means rates should be relatively high, to prevent overheating and a burst of inflation.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d argue that our interest rates are higher because our economy\u2019s doing fairly well, not in spite of it,\u201d said Gennadiy Goldberg, head of U.S. rates strategy at TD Securities.",
      "Trump argues that the Fed in general and Powell in particular are costing U.S. taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars in interest payments by not reducing borrowing costs. Yet Fed officials don't think it's their job to reduce rates the government pays on Treasury notes and bonds.",
      "Most economists worry that if they did, they would risk failing at one of the key jobs Congress gave them: fighting inflation.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s using monetary policy to ease pressure on fiscal policymakers, and that way points to higher inflation and bigger problems down the road,\" said William English, an economist at the Yale School of Management and former senior Fed staffer.",
      "If financial markets see that the Fed is focused on keeping borrowing costs low to help the government \u2014 rather than focusing on its congressionally-mandated goals of stable prices and maximum employment \u2014 Wall Street investors, worried about future inflation, will likely demand higher interest rates to hold Treasury bonds, economists say, pushing up borrowing costs across the economy.",
      "For his part, Trump says there is \u201cno inflation\u201d and so the Fed should reduce its short-term rate, currently at about 4.3%, which was ramped up in 2022 and 2023 to fight rising prices. The Fed\u2019s rate often \u2014 but not always \u2014 influences longer-term borrowing costs for mortgages, car loans, and credit cards.",
      "Inflation has fallen sharply and as a result Fed officials have signaled they will cut rates by as much as a half-percentage point this year. Yet it has picked up a bit in the last two months and many of those policymakers, including Powell, still want to make sure that tariffs aren't going to lift inflation much higher before they make a move.",
      "Inflation accelerated to 2.7% in June from 2.4% in May, the government said earlier this month, above the Fed's 2% target. Core prices, which exclude the volatile food and energy categories, rose to 2.9% from 2.8%.",
      "Last week, Trump and several White House officials ramped up their attacks on Powell over rates. They also criticized the ballooning costs of the Fed's renovation of two of its buildings, raising questions over whether the president was looking to fire Powell for cause rather than policy differences.",

      "Some economists expect that the Fed will reduce its key rate by a quarter-point in September, rather than July, and say that the two-month delay will make little difference to the economy.",
      "Yet beyond just the timing of the first cut, there is still a huge gulf between what Trump wants and what the Fed will even consider doing: Fed officials in June penciled in just two reductions this year and one in 2026. They forecast that their key rate will still be 3.6% at the end of next year. Trump is pushing them to cut it to just 1%.",
      "\u201cThat's not going to happen with anything like the current people on the committee,\u201d English said.",
      "Wall Street investors also expect relatively few cuts: Two this year and two in 2026, according to futures pricing tracked by CME's Fedwatch.",

      "But the damage was limited, the IMF said, partly because many U.S. importers scrambled to bring in foreign goods before Trump\u2019s tariffs took effect and partly because Trump ended up suspending his biggest levies (including a 145% duty on Chinese goods).",
      "\u201cThis modest decline in trade tensions, however fragile, has contributed to the resilience of the global economy so far,\u201d IMF chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas said at a press conference Tuesday. \"This resilience is welcome, but it is also tenuous. While the trade shock could turn out to be less severe than initially feared, it is still sizeable, and evidence is mounting that it is hurting the global economy.''",

That is up from the 1.7% it had predicted in April and reflects a surge in shipments as exporters tried to beat the tariff crunch. But eventually the higher U.S. levies are expected to take a toll. The IMF sees trade growing just 1.9% next year, down from the 2.5% it had forecast in April.",
      "Trump has also unsettled financial markets by openly and repeatedly criticizing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for the Fed's reluctance to cut American interest rates. Powell has said that the central bank must wait to better understands the impact of Trump's tariffs on inflation.",
      "That same message was delivered last week by the European Central Bank, which is also holding off on rate calls to measure the impact of Trump's tariffs.",
      "At the press conference Tuesday, IMF chief economist Gourinchas spoke up in favor of keeping central banks like the Fed independent from political pressure. \"The evidence is overwhelming that independent central banks, with a narrow mandate to pursue price and economic stability, are essential'' to containing inflationary pressure, he said.",
      "The Fed and other central banks raised rates after inflation flared up in 2021 and 2022. They managed a so-called soft landing \u2014 bringing inflation down without causing a recession. \u201cThat central banks around the world achieved a successful \u2018soft landing\u2019 despite the recent surge in inflation owes a great deal to their independence and hard-earned credibility,\u201d Gourinchas said.",

      "Chinese stock indexes, meanwhile, were mixed as top trade officials from the world\u2019s two largest economies headed into a second day of talks about tariffs. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng were meeting in Sweden\u2019s capital and working against an Aug. 12 deadline. If they don\u2019t reach a deal or at least an extension on their truce by then, triple-digit tariffs are set to resume.",
      "Later this week, another deadline is looming on Friday for many of Trump\u2019s proposed tariffs on other countries. And if that weren\u2019t enough, several highly anticipated economic reports are also on the way, including the latest monthly update on the job market.",
      "This jam-packed week could prove pivotal in determining whether the U.S. stock market can keep climbing to more records or succumb to criticism that it\u2019s grown too expensive following its quick leap in recent months.",

      "BULAWAYO, Zimbabwe -- Fast bowler Matt Henry\u2019s triple strike on Wednesday provided New Zealand with a perfect start in its first test match against Zimbabwe in almost nine years.",

      "Santner, captaining the Black Caps for the first time in the absence of injured Tom Latham, hoped his three fast bowlers get most out of a soft pitch after he lost the toss and was asked to field first.",
      "And Henry didn\u2019t disappoint his skipper.",
      "Bennett and Curran, recovered from a broken hand, both were caught by Will Young at the third slip as Henry consistently challenged the openers with his immaculate line and length. Welch and Ervine seemed to have settled down in the last half hour with their sweeps and reverse sweeps against the spinners before Henry returned and had Welch caught in the second slip.",
      "New Zealand has won 11 of its 17 test matches against Zimbabwe and drawn six. This is the first match between the two teams since 2016 in cricket\u2019s traditional format. Zimbabwe has a poor home test record with its last win coming against Pakistan in 2013.",
      "New Zealand, playing its first test of the year, is without several regulars with Latham still recovering from a shoulder injury and Glenn Phillips ruled out of the two-match series because of a groin strain sustained during the Major League Cricket competition in the U.S.",

    "story": [
      "College coaches are racing to master retention as revenue sharing and NIL opportunities steer athletes toward the transfer portal",
      "Whether it was an ACC, SEC, Big Ten or Big 12 coach taking the podium at media days, one theme remained consistent: In an era where revenue sharing and NIL opportunities can swiftly steer athletes toward the transfer portal, programs across the country are racing to master the art of player retention.",
      "Its importance is clear to Arkansas coach Sam Pittman, who has seen all but five players from his 2023 recruiting class leave for different programs.",
      "\u201cHere\u2019s what it\u2019s not because of: the way they\u2019re treated, because of the way they\u2019re developed, because of the way they\u2019re taught,\" he said. \"That\u2019s not the reason. It could be playing time. It could be finances. Probably the majority of it is finances, but you\u2019d have to ask those guys.\u201d",
      "More than 3,000 Bowl Subdivision players reportedly entered the transfer portal this past spring, which would average out to about 22 players per team. For the Razorbacks, 10 starters will be back and one of them is senior defensive lineman Cam Ball. He has remained with Arkansas his entire career, a somewhat rare occurrence for an NFL hopeful these days.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just a loyal guy. I\u2019m loyal to the state of Arkansas; Arkansas has been loyal to me,\" Ball said.",
      "Arkansas, like many schools, is also trying to scare up more money from donors as it faces the financial ramifications of the $2.8 billion House settlement; last fall, the athletic director said the school needed some $12 million more annually to \u201cbe in the NIL game from a football perspective.\u201d Besides the money, the Razorbacks have to find talented players; Ball grew up in Atlanta, just barely within the regional footprint in which Pittman prefers to recruit.",
      "\u201cWe have to go outside our state,\" Pittman said. \u201cIn-state recruiting has changed over the last three or four years because of NIL. So you have to think about the talent \u2014 who it is versus what pay is expected. So that\u2019s been a little bit more difficult in our state.\u201d",
      "Pittman isn\u2019t the only coach who wants prospects to be familiar with what their college experience will look like before making any life-changing decisions. Florida coach Billy Napier paints a clear picture of life in Gainesville and the challenges and perks that come with it.",
      "\u201cWe present our product in a way where we\u2019re selling the degree, the alumni network, the Gator-made program, and you have to be up for the challenge of trying to get Florida back to where it\u2019s been before,\" he said. \"And I think that\u2019s one of the reasons we\u2019ve been able to keep it together.\u201d",
      "Florida\u2019s 2023 recruiting class remains mostly intact, and from Napier\u2019s perspective, hungrier than ever. Compared to other SEC teams, the Gators have had more success with retention. Napier doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a coincidence.",
      "\u201cWe told them when they came in, you know, look, it\u2019s not going to be all sunshine and rainbows here. We\u2019re in this thing for the long haul,\u201d Napier said. \u201cI think a lot of this is how you pitch it in recruiting. We\u2019re going to continue to do that, and retention is more important than it\u2019s ever been.\u201d",
      "Coaches scrambling to prevent transfers and maintain consistency isn\u2019t exclusive to the SEC. The approval of the House settlement is a double-edged sword when it comes to retention, and Power Four schools and beyond are feeling the effects. Third-party NIL deals are no longer the only negotiation tactic schools need to worry about.",
      "Complex contracts are becoming common and legal risks grow for athletes and programs alike as college football increasingly resembles the pros. Some deals are being negotiated solely by athletes as young as 18.",

      "Fans at the Tampa Bay Buccaneers\u2019 indoor practice facility roared.",
      "They\u2019re used to Evans making all the plays but No. 13 still manages to impress everyone watching.",
      "The six-time Pro Bowl wide receiver makes it look so effortless the way he glides after the ball. His routes are smooth and precise, his hands soft. At 6-foot-5, 231 pounds, he has a powerful frame so he can outmuscle defenders or outfinesse them when he needs to.",
      "Evans is the only player in NFL history to start his career with 11 consecutive 1,000-yard receiving seasons. Only Jerry Rice had that many at any point. Evans is aiming for 12 in a row in a year when the Buccaneers celebrate the franchise\u2019s 50th season. There are no signs the 31-year-old is slowing down and his team goals are bigger than his personal ones.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just happy that we have a really great team and we\u2019re using this training camp to put everything together to have one of the best seasons for the 50th,\u201d Evans said Tuesday. \u201cI\u2019m excited to put on a great show for y\u2019all.\u201d",
      "At a position known for players with look-at-me personalities \u2014 Tyreek Hill, Michael Irvin, Terrell Owens, Chad Johnson \u2014 Evans lets his performance do most of the talking. He\u2019s quiet, humble and community-oriented. Evans is a four-time NFL Walter Payton Man of The Year nominee for the work he does along with his wife, Ashli, through their foundation, which empowers youth, encourages education and stands against domestic violence.",
      "Evans joined the Buccaneers in 2014 as the seventh overall pick and has become one of the greatest players in franchise history. Evans and Chris Godwin were a big reason why Tom Brady chose Tampa Bay in 2020 and the Buccaneers ended up winning a Super Bowl that season.",
      "From catching passes from Josh McCown and Mike Glennon as a rookie to Jameis Winston to Brady to Baker Mayfield, Evans continues to produce. He has 836 career catches for 12,684 yards and 105 touchdowns.",
      "Evans missed three games last season due to injury and didn\u2019t reach 1,000 yards until he caught a 9-yard pass on the final play of a 27-19 victory over the Saints that the Buccaneers needed to secure their fourth straight NFC South title.",
      "The reaction from Evans\u2019 teammates and the fans after that catch showed how much he\u2019s loved.",

      "Ohtani struck out in his first four plate appearances Tuesday night against the Cincinnati Reds, the first time he has done that in his eight seasons and 981 games in the majors.",
      "Against the Seattle Mariners on July 17, 2021, while playing for the Los Angeles Angels, Ohtani popped up to the shortstop in his first at-bat and then struck out in his next four times at the plate.",

And I think he just got into swing mode,\" manager Dave Roberts said. \"When he\u2019s (at his) best, he\u2019s getting the baseball up, and he\u2019s using the big part of the field. And especially in this ballpark where he doesn\u2019t need to go to right field. But tonight, just one of those nights that he just couldn\u2019t help him help himself from swinging.\u201d",

      "Lodolo became the 13th pitcher to strike out Ohtani three times in a game. The Reds left-hander got Ohtani to chase a curveball out of the strike zone in the first and fifth innings, and got him looking on a 94.6 mph fastball in the third.",
      "\u201cI was going right after him. I definitely threw some good heaters in some good spots and I was able to spin the ball well too as well,\u201d Lodolo said.",

      "Ohtani was one strike away from his first five strikeout game before he flew out to right field on a 2-2 count in the ninth inning of a 4-4 game. Smith was the next batter and delivered the game-winning hit.",

      "Colorado defensive back Carter Stoutmire sees Deion Sanders as more than just a coach",
      "BOULDER, Colo. -- To Colorado defensive back Carter Stoutmire, Deion Sanders is more than just a coach. He's like an uncle who's been in his life since pretty much the day he was born.",
      "So hearing his coach's booming voice back in meetings and seeing his coach's swagger at camp this week, well, it lifted his spirits. Not just for him, but the entire team in the wake of Sanders announcing news of his private battle with bladder cancer.",
      "\u201cWhatever hardship trials he goes through, he always makes it through,\u201d Stoutmire said after practice Wednesday. \u201cSeeing him back, just a breath of fresh air for the whole team.\u201d",
      "It's been a few months since they've seen their coach after Sanders stepped away to deal with his health. He revealed Monday that doctors removed his bladder to ward off an aggressive form of cancer. He had a section of his intestine reconstructed to function as a bladder.",
      "\"Honestly, just having Coach Prime\u2019s presence back in the building is an amazing feeling,\u201d said safety DJ McKinney, whose team opens the season Aug. 29 against Georgia Tech at Folsom Field. \u201cI feel like everybody just has a chip on their shoulder.\u201d",
      "Namely, to work as hard they can for him.",
      "\u201cI mean, it hit different for me, just because that\u2019s like family to me,\u201d Stoutmire said. \u201cThat was like real, genuine concern.\u201d",
      "Stoutmire's father, Omar, played for the Dallas Cowboys with Sanders in the 1990s. His dad and Sanders have been longtime friends, which is why he considers him an uncle.",
      "\"First time I met him? I don\u2019t remember \u2014 he was in my birth room,\u201d Carter Stoutmire said of Sanders. \u201cWe\u2019ve just got a whole lot of history, so it\u2019s hard to remember the first genuine time I really met him.\u201d",
      "He\u2019s had a big impact, too. So much so that Carter Stoutmire was part of Sanders\u2019 inaugural high school recruiting class at Colorado.",
      "Asked if his coach's bravado was indeed back at practice, Stoutmire simply responded, \"Oh yeah. Ain\u2019t no question about that.\u201d",
      "Upon his return to campus, Sanders tried to pick up right where he left off. Defensive coordinator Robert Livingston said he met with Sanders last week and the first thing Sanders inquired about was Livingston's family. He wanted to know about his son, Luke, who's playing baseball.",
      "Sanders, a Pro Football Hall of Famer who also played Major League Baseball, wanted to hear all about it.",
      "\u201cPrime\u2019s talking about his stance and all these things, and he wants to know how that\u2019s going,\u201d Livingston recounted. \u201cHis leadership is one of one. He\u2019s the Pied Piper \u2014 the world will follow him if they just listen to him.\"",

      "A 16-year-old\u2019s Roblox game, Grow a Garden, has shattered records for the most concurrent players in history",
      "Whether it serves as a chill escape from the onslaught of the real world or simply a way to beat vacation doldrums, a viral Roblox game about gardening has become the surprise hit of the summer.",
      "Grow a Garden, created by a 16-year-old in a few days, has shattered records for the most concurrent players of any game in history, beating out video games that take years and millions of dollars to develop.",
      "And there\u2019s no one to shoot, fight or race. If your last attempt at cultivating vegetables was FarmVille in 2010, don't worry \u2014 your tomatoes will grow even if you never water them.",
      "Grow a Garden is as simple as its name suggests \u2014 players can fill a plot of land with plants and animals, harvest and sell, trade or steal each others' bounty. The game is low stress, with an aesthetic reminiscent of Minecraft and a soundtrack of soothing classical tunes such as Mozart's Rondo Alla Turca playing in the background. Its popularity has further cemented Roblox' place not just in the gaming world but in popular culture \u2014 for better or for worse, it's where the kids hang out.",
      "\u201cThe word I keep hearing used over and over to describe this particular game is that it\u2019s chill, which is just such a nice alternative. I get a lot of sort of that Animal Crossing vibe from it. You know, like you can check in, you can check your gardens, you can get some new seeds, you can plant them,\u201d said Becky Bozdech, editorial director at the nonprofit Common Sense Media. \u201cI have an 11-year-old son who (plays it) and he says to him the big difference is that a lot of games have a big giant objective that you have to do, but in Grow a Garden, you can just kind of hang out and do what you want.\u201d",
      "Coincidence or not, Grow a Garden soared to popularity around the same time that Take-Two Interactive announced it would delay the launch of its wildly anticipated Grand Theft Auto 6 until next year. In late June, the gardening game logged 21.6 million concurrent players, surpassing Fortnite\u2019s previous record of 15.2 million according to Roblox. Analysts who follow Roblox's stock say Grow a Garden is helping boost the company's revenue and will push the company's quarterly earnings numbers above Wall Street's expectations.",
      "While it's not clear if the GTA audience flocked to this simple gardening game to pass the time until then, the timing reignited the age-old debate about who gamers are and what titles are taken seriously by the video game establishment. It happened with Candy Crush, with puzzle games, with Animal Crossing. Are people who play cozy games true gamers? Or is the title reserved for the folks who shoot enemies in Call of Duty or drive around creating mayhem in GTA?",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a huge percentage of gamers that play Roblox and the actual industry just views it as like this esoterically immature platform of weird gameplay habits,\u201d said Janzen Madsen, the New Zealand-based CEO and founder of Splitting Point studios, which acquired the game from its teenage creator. \u201cWell, I actually think in five years this is what player expectation is gonna be. And because you guys haven\u2019t embraced it, like you\u2019re not gonna know how to make games.\u201d",
      "To start growing your garden, you'll need a Roblox account. The game will start you out with an empty plot and some money \u2014 sheckles \u2014 and a starter seed. From there, you can plant seeds, harvest and sell your crops and buy more seeds, animals or tools for your garden. While it is possible to play the game without spending real-world money, it will take longer. Once you sell enough crops, you earn money to buy more expensive seeds beyond basic carrots and blueberries.",

      "The amoeba enters the brain through the olfactory nerve in the nose. Once inside, it causes an infection called primary amebic meningoencephalitis.",
      "Symptoms start as a fairly standard headache and nausea. By the time the pain becomes severe, it is almost always too late to save the infected person. Of the 167 cases reported in the U.S. between 1962 and 2024, only four people have survived, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most of the deaths happened within five days of getting sick, according to the CDC.",
      "One infection in a body of water doesn\u2019t increase the chances of another infection in the same body of water, the agency said. The amoeba cannot move from one person to another.",
      "It was the first death from the amoeba in South Carolina since 2016, the CDC said.",
      "Jaysen Carr went swimming at Lake Murray about 15 miles (24 kilometers) west of Columbia over the July Fourth weekend.",
      "He got sick several days later and died on July 18.",
      "His father and mother had never heard of the amoeba before a doctor in tears told them what tests of his spinal fluid had found.",
      "Clarence Carr said he was shocked to learn South Carolina, like most other U.S. states, has no law requiring public reporting of deaths or infections from the amoeba. The lake wasn\u2019t closed and no water testing was performed.",
      "\u201cMy son was a very smart individual. If he had one warning, he would have thought swimming in the lake was a bad idea,\u201d Carr said.",

      "Researchers are trying to figure out why the infections are so rare. Some people have been found to have had antibodies, signaling they may have survived exposure. Others may die from brain swelling and other problems without the amoeba ever being detected.",

      "Last year, the CDC started a pilot program of giving infected patients an antibiotic approved for use in Europe that has killed the amoeba in lab studies",
      "The amoeba can show up in hot springs, rivers and, on rare occasions, in tap water. That\u2019s why doctors recommend using sterile water for cleaning nasal passages with a neti pot.",
      "The only way to be completely safe is to not swim in lakes or rivers and, if you do, keep your head above water. Pinching your nose or using nose clips when diving or swimming can keep water out of your nose.",
      "There are other dangers in swimming in lakes and rivers instead of pools, where chemicals can kill off dangerous bacteria and other organisms.",
      "A mouthful of water could contain E.coli bacteria. And while the bacteria normally live in the intestines of healthy people and animals, some strains can cause a range of conditions, including urinary tract infection, cystitis, intestinal infection and vomiting, with the worst cases leading to life-threatening blood poisoning, according to the Mayo Clinic.",
      "Algae can also cause illnesses. Cyanobacteria \u2014 also referred to as blue-green algae \u2014 are plant-like organisms that live in water.",

      "The organisms can quickly grow out of control, or \u201cbloom,\" in warm weather, helped along by excessive nutrients in fertilizers and pet waste carried along by stormwater.",
      "Some of the algae produce toxins that can cause symptoms including skin irritation, stomach cramps, vomiting, nausea, diarrhea, fever, sore throat, headache, muscle and joint pain, mouth blisters, seizures, and acute liver damage, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",

Data centers, demanding vast amounts of energy and water, have aroused strong opposition in some communities.",

      "Signed into law by President Richard Nixon in 1970, NEPA requires federal agencies proposing actions such as building roads, bridges or energy projects to study how their project will affect the environment. Private companies are also frequently subject to NEPA standards when they apply for a permit from a federal agency.",
      "In recent years, the law has become increasingly important in requiring consideration of a project's possible contributions to climate change.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a really important function because otherwise we\u2019re just operating with blinders just to get the project done, without considering whether there are alternative solutions that might accomplish the same objective, but in a more environmentally friendly way,\" Park said.",
      "But business groups say NEPA routinely blocks important projects that often take five years or more to complete.",
      "\u201cOur broken permitting system has long been a national embarrassment,'' said Marty Durbin, president of the U.S. Chamber\u2019s Global Energy Institute. He called NEPA \u201ca blunt and haphazard tool\u201d that too often is used to block investment and economic development.",
      "The White House proposal comes as Congress is working on a permitting reform plan that would overhaul NEPA, addressing long-standing concerns from both parties that development projects -- including some for clean energy -- take too long to be approved.",
      "NEPA's strength \u2014 and usefulness \u2014 can depend on how it's interpreted by different administrations.",
      "Trump, a Republican, sought to weaken NEPA in his first term by limiting when environmental reviews are required and limiting the time for evaluation and public comment. Former Democratic President Joe Biden restored more rigorous reviews.",
      "In his second term, Trump has again targeted the law.",
      "An executive order that touched on environmental statutes has many agencies scrapping the requirement for a draft environmental impact statement. And the CEQ in May withdrew Biden-era guidance that federal agencies should consider the effects of planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions when conducting NEPA reviews.",

      "John Ruple, a research professor of law at the University of Utah, said sidelining NEPA could actually slow things down. Federal agencies still have to comply with other environmental laws, like the Endangered Species Act or Clean Air Act. NEPA has an often overlooked benefit of forcing coordination with those other laws, he said.",
      "A botanist by training, Mary O\u2019Brien was working with a small organization in Oregon in the 1980s to propose alternative techniques to successfully replant Douglas fir trees that had been clear-cut on federal lands. Aerially sprayed herbicides aimed at helping the conifers grow have not only been linked to health problems in humans but were also killing another species of tree, red alders, that were beneficial to the fir saplings, O\u2019Brien said.",
      "The U.S. Forest Service had maintained that the herbicides' impact on humans and red alders wasn\u2019t a problem. But under NEPA, a court required the agency to redo their analysis and they ultimately had to write a new environmental impact statement.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a fundamental concept: \u2018Don\u2019t just roar ahead.\u2019 Think about your options,\u201d O\u2019Brien said.",
      "O\u2019Brien, who later worked at the Grand Canyon Trust, also co-chaired a working group that weighed in on a 2012 Forest Service proposal, finalized in 2016, for aspen restoration on Monroe Mountain in Utah. Hunters, landowners, loggers and ranchers all had different opinions on how the restoration should be handled. She said NEPA\u2019s requirement to get the public involved made for better research and a better plan.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s one of the laws that\u2019s the most often used by the public without the public being aware,\u201d said Stephen Schima, senior legislative counsel at environmental law nonprofit Earthjustice. \u201cNEPA has long been the one opportunity for communities and impacted stakeholders and local governments to weigh in.\u201d",
      "Schima said rolling back the power of NEPA threatens the scientific integrity of examining projects' full impacts.",
      "\u201cDecisions are going to be less informed by scientific studies, and that is one of the major concerns here,'' he said.",
      "Ruple said uncertainty from NEPA changes and competing opinions on how to comply with the law's requirements may invite even more litigation.",
      "\"And all of this will fall on the shoulder of agencies that are losing the staff needed to lead them through these changes,\" he said.",

      "Fishing for krill near Antarctica has surged to a record high, nearing a seasonal catch limit that could close the fishery early",
      "MIAMI -- Trawling near Antarctica for krill \u2014 a crustacean central to the diet of whales and a critical buffer to global warming \u2014 has surged to a record and is fast approaching a never before reached seasonal catch limit that would trigger the unprecedented early closure of the remote fishery, The Associated Press has learned.",
      "The fishing boom follows the failure last year of the U.S., Russia, China and two dozen other governments to approve a new management plan that would have mandated spreading out the area in which krill can be caught and creating a California-sized reserve along the environmentally sensitive Antarctic Peninsula.",
      "In the first seven months of the 2024-25 season, krill fishing in Antarctica reached 518,568 tons, about 84% of the 620,000-ton limit that, once reached, will force the fishery to automatically close. In one hot spot, the catch through June 30 was nearly 60% higher than all of last year\u2019s haul, according to a report from the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, or CCAMLR, the international organization that manages the world's southernmost fishery.",
      "The report, which has not been publicly released and CCAMLR said contains confidential data, was shared with The AP by someone concerned about overfishing in Antarctica on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to release the information.",
      "\u201cThe vast majority of the krill take is from an increasingly smaller area,\u201d said Capt. Peter Hammarstedt, campaign director for conservation group Sea Shepherd Global, which this year made its third voyage to Antarctica to document the fishery. \u201cIt\u2019s the equivalent of a hunter saying that they\u2019re only killing 1% of the U.S.\u2019 deer population but leaving out that all of the deer were shot in Rhode Island.\u201d",
      "Krill is one of the most abundant marine species in the world, with an estimated biomass of 63 million metric tons. But advances in fishing, climate change and growing demand for krill\u2019s Omega-3 rich oil \u2013 for fishmeal, pet food and human dietary supplements \u2014 have increased pressure on the krill stocks. In the 2023-24 season, a fleet of 12 industrial trawlers from mostly Norway and China caught 498,350 tons of krill \u2014 until now the largest harvest since CCAMLR began collecting catch data in 1973.",
      "AP journalists traveled to the icy waters around Antarctica in 2023 and observed how factory ships trawl in close proximity to whales whose numbers are still recovering from a century of industrial culling that nearly drove them to extinction.",
      "Underscoring the competition between humans and whales, three humpback whales were found dead or seriously injured last year in the long, cylindrical nets deployed by the vessels to vacuum up the paper-clip sized crustacean.",
      "Officials have been negotiating for years a new management plan that would balance the growing market for krill with calls for greater protection of the Antarctic Peninsula, the continent's northernmost point and an area teeming with whales and, increasingly, tourists. Currently, less than 5% of the Southern Ocean is protected \u2014 well behind CCAMLR\u2019s target and a United Nations goal to preserve 30% of the world\u2019s oceans by 2030.",
      "But a tentative deal fell apart at last year\u2019s CCAMLR meeting over a last minute proposal by the United Kingdom and Australia for an even lower catch limit than the one agreed to during talks, AP reported last year. China, objecting to the persistent Western demands, then withdrew its support for the marine reserve and refused to renew the existing management system.",
      "\u201cThe truth was it was the UK,\u201d Matts Johansen, chief executive of Norway's Aker BioMarine, the world's largest supplier of krill-based products, said at the United Nations Oceans conference in June. \u201cJust a couple days before the vote, the UK threw another suggestion and that's when the Chinese backed off.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for the UK Foreign Office rejected that characterization and said the British government continues to push for a krill management strategy that better safeguards Antarctic marine species and vulnerable ecosystems.",
      "In the absence of a deal, restrictions adopted 15 years ago to spread out the catch limit expired, allowing the krill fleet to essentially fish anywhere at any time, including in smaller habitats preferred by whales and other animals such as penguins and seals.",

Activity in one popular fishing ground, denoted Sub-Area 48.1, appears to have more than doubled so far this season compared to the entire 2023-2024 season, according to the the U.S.-based group, which supports sustainable fishing.",
      "Javier Arata, the executive director the Association of Responsible Krill harvesting companies, whose members are responsible for 95% of the krill taken from Antarctica, said the catch limit that lapsed was always intended as an interim measure.",

      "Scientists in Mexico are testing innovative methods they hope can be employed to locate the overwhelming number of people missing due to cartel violence",
      "ZAPOPAN, Mexico -- First the scientists dress dead swine in clothes, then they dispose of the carcasses. Some they wrap in packing tape, others they chop up. They stuff the animals into plastic bags or wrap them in blankets. They cover them in lime or burn them. Some are buried alone, others in groups.",
      "Then they watch.",
      "The pigs are playing an unlikely role as proxies for humans in research to help find the staggering number of people who have gone missing in Mexico during decades of drug cartel violence.",
      "Families of the missing are usually left to look for their loved ones with little support from authorities. But now, government scientists are testing the newest satellite, geophysical and biological mapping techniques \u2014 along with the pigs \u2014 to offer clues that they hope could lead to the discovery of at least some of the bodies.",
      "The ranks of Mexico\u2019s missing exploded in the years following the launch of then-President Felipe Calder\u00f3n\u2019s war against drug cartels in 2006. A strategy that targeted the leaders of a handful of powerful cartels led to a splintering of organized crime and the multiplication of violence to control territory.",
      "With near complete impunity, owing to the complicity or inaction of the authorities, cartels found that making anyone they think is in their way disappear was better than leaving bodies in the street. Mexican administrations have sometimes been unwilling to recognize the problem and at other times are staggered by the scale of violence their justice system is unprepared to address.",
      "Mexico\u2019s disappeared could populate a small city. Official data in 2013 tallied 26,000 missing, but the count now surpasses 130,000 \u2014 more than any other Latin American nation. The United Nations has said there are indications that the disappearances are \u201cgeneralized or systematic.\u201d",
      "If the missing people are found \u2014 dead or alive \u2014 it is usually by their loved ones. Guided by information from witnesses, parents and siblings search for graves by walking through cartel territory, plunging a metal rod into the earth and sniffing for the scent of death.",
      "Around 6,000 clandestine graves have been found since 2007, and new discoveries are made all the time. Tens of thousands of remains have yet to be identified.",
      "Jalisco, which is home to the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, has the largest number of people reported missing in Mexico: 15,500. In March, human bone fragments and hundreds of items of clothing were discovered at a cartel ranch in the state. Authorities denied it was the site of a mass grave.",
      "Jos\u00e9 Luis Silv\u00e1n, a coordinator of the mapping project and scientist at CentroGeo, a federal research institute focused on geospacial information, said Jalisco\u2019s disappeared are \u201cwhy we\u2019re here.\u201d",
      "The mapping project, launched in 2023, is a collaboration by Guadalajara University, Mexico\u2019s National Autonomous University and the University of Oxford in England, alongside the Jalisco Search Commission, a state agency that organizes local searches with relatives.",
      "\u201cNo other country is pushing so strongly, so creatively\" to test and combine new techniques, said Derek Congram, a Canadian forensic anthropologist, whose expertise in geographic information systems inspired the Mexican project.",
      "Still, Congram warns, technology \u201cis not a panacea.\u201d",
      "\u201cNinety percent of searches are resolved with a good witness and digging,\u201d he said.",
      "Silv\u00e1n walks by a site where scientists buried 14 pigs about two years ago. He says they may not know how well the technology works, where and when it can be used, or under what conditions, for at least three years.",
      "\u201cFlowers came up because of the phosphorous at the surface, we didn\u2019t see that last year,\u201d he said as he took measurements at one of the gravesites. \u201cThe mothers who search say that that little yellow flower always blooms over the tombs and they use them as a guide.\u201d",

      "A big Colombian drone mounted with a hyperspectral camera flies over the pig burial site. Generally used by mining companies, the camera measures light reflected by substances in the soil, including nitrogen, potassium, phosphorus, and shows how they vary as the pigs decompose. The colorful image it produces offers clues of what to look for in the hunt for graves.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t pure science,\u201d Silv\u00e1n said. \u201cIt is science and action. Everything learned has to be applied immediately, rather than wait for it to mature, because there\u2019s urgency.\u201d",

      "Triggered by the disappearance of 43 students in 2014, Silv\u00e1n and his colleagues started gathering information about ground-penetrating radar, electric resistivity and satellite imagery from around the world. They studied University of Tennessee research on human corpses buried at a \u201cbody farm.\u201d They looked at grave-mapping techniques used in the Balkans, Colombia and Ukraine.",
      "\u201cWhat good is science or technology if it doesn\u2019t solve problems?\u201d he said.",
      "They learned new applications of satellite analysis, then began their first experiments burying pigs and studying the substances criminals use to dispose of bodies. They found lime is easily detected, but hydrocarbons, hydrochloric acid and burned flesh are not.",
      "Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s team worked to combine the science with what they knew about how the cartels operate. For example, they determined that disappearances in Jalisco commonly happened along cartel routes between Pacific ports, drug manufacturing facilities and the U.S. border, and that most of the missing are found in the same municipality where they disappeared.",
      "The experience of the families of the missing also informs the research.",
      "Some observed that graves are often found under trees whose roots grow vertically, so those digging the graves can remain in the shade. Mothers of missing loved ones invited by researchers to visit one of the pig burial sites were able to identify most of the unmarked graves by sight alone, because of the plants and soil placement, Silv\u00e1n said.",
      "\u201cThe knowledge flows in both directions,\u201d he said.",
      "Maribel Cede\u00f1o, who has been looking for her missing brother for four years, said she believes the drones and other technology will be helpful.",
      "\u201cI never imagined being in this situation, finding bodies, becoming such an expert,\u201d she said of her quest.",
      "H\u00e9ctor Flores has been searching for his son since 2021. He questions why so much time and effort has been invested in methods that have not led to concrete discoveries, when the families have proven track records with little official support.",
      "Although the research has not yet concluded, the Jalisco Search Commission is already using a thermal drone, a laser scanner and a multispectral camera to help families look for their missing relatives in some cases. But it is unclear whether authorities across Mexico will ever be willing to use, or able to afford, the high-tech aides.",
      "Congram, the forensic scientist, said researchers are aware of the limitations of technology, but that \u201cyou always have to try, fail, fail again and keep trying.\u201d",

      "HONOLULU -- Lawmakers on Maui passed legislation Thursday aimed at eliminating a large percentage of the Hawaiian island's vacation rentals to address a housing shortage exacerbated by the wildfire that destroyed most of Lahaina two years ago.",
      "It's the latest action by a top global tourist destination to push back against the infiltration of vacationers into residential neighborhoods and tourism overwhelming their communities. In May, Spain ordered Airbnb to block more than 65,000 holiday listings on its platform for having violated rules. Last month, thousands of protesters in European cities like Barcelona and Venice, Italy, marched against the ills of overtourism.",
      "The Maui County Council's housing committee voted 6-3 to pass the bill, which would close a loophole that has allowed owners of condos in apartment zones to rent their units for days or weeks at a time instead of a minimum of 180 days. The mandate would take effect in the West Maui district that includes Lahaina in 2028. The rest of the county would have until 2030 to comply.",
      "The council still needs to vote on the bill, but the committee's result is a strong indication of the final outcome because all nine council members sit on the housing panel. The mayor is expected to sign the bill, which he proposed.",
      "\"Bill 9 is a critical first step in restoring our commitment to prioritize housing for local residents \u2014 and securing a future where our keiki can live, grow, and thrive in the place they call home,\u201d Maui Mayor Richard Bissen said in a statement, using the Hawaiian word for children.",
      "Vacation rentals currently account for 21% of all housing in the county, which has a population of about 165,000 people.",
      "An analysis by University of Hawaii economists predicted the measure would add 6,127 units to Maui\u2019s long-term housing stock, increasing supply by 13%.",

      "The mayor said such economic analysis failed to tell a full story, noting families are torn apart when high housing costs drive out relatives and that cultural knowledge disappears when generations leave Maui.",
      "The mayor told the council the bill was one part of a broader housing strategy that would include building new housing, investing in infrastructure and stopping illegally operated vacation rentals. He said there were limits to how much new housing could be built because of constraints on water supplies and sewer infrastructure.",
      "Tourism would continue on Maui but must do so in a way \u201cthat doesn't hollow out our neighborhoods,\u201d the mayor said.",
      "The mayor's staff told council members that visitor spending would decline with the measure but most of the drop would be on lodging. Because 94% of those who own vacation rentals in apartment zones don't live on Maui, they said much of this income already flows off-island. They predicted the county budget could withstand an estimated $61 million decline in annual tax revenue resulting from the measure.",

      "A dozen Democratic members of Congress who have been blocked from making oversight visits at immigration detention centers filed a federal lawsuit Wednesday against the Trump administration that seeks to ensure they are granted entry into the facilities, even without prior notice.",
      "The lawsuit, filed in the District of Columbia\u2019s federal court, said the Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement are obstructing Congressional oversight of the centers at a time when there's been an increase in ICE arrests, with reports of raids across the country and people taken into custody at immigration courts.",
      "By law, members of Congress are allowed to visit ICE facilities and don\u2019t have to give any notice, but increasingly, the members have been stopped at the door. ICE officials have said a new rule requires a seven-day waiting period and they prohibit entry to the ICE field offices. The lawsuit asks the court for full and immediate access to all ICE facilities.",
      "ICE Director Todd Lyons told a congressional committee in May that he recognized the right of members of Congress to visit detention facilities, even unannounced. But DHS Secretary Kristi Noem told a different committee that members of Congress should have requested a tour of an immigration detention facility in New Jersey where a skirmish broke out in May.",
      "As President Donald Trump's immigration agenda plays out, detention facilities have become overcrowded and there have been reports of mistreatment, food shortages, a lack of medical care and unsanitary conditions, the lawsuit said. Congress has a duty to make sure the administration is complying with the law while operating the facilities, the lawsuit said.",
      "The recently passed budget bill allocates $45 billion for ICE detention \u2014 more than 13 times ICE\u2019s current annual detention budget, the lawsuit said. Members of Congress must ensure those funds are spent efficiently and legally, the suit said.",
      "But recent attempts by House members to visit facilities were blocked, the lawsuit said.",
      "\u201cThese members of Congress could have just scheduled a tour; instead, they\u2019re running to court to drive clicks and fundraising emails,\" DHS Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin told the AP in an email.",
      "Requests for visits to detention centers should be made \u201cwith sufficient time to prevent interference with the President\u2019s Article II authority to oversee executive department functions\u2014a week is sufficient to ensure no intrusion on the President\u2019s constitutional authority,\u201d she said.",
      "Also, ICE has seen a surge in assaults, disruptions and obstructions to law enforcement so any requests for tours of ICE processing centers and field offices must be approved by Secretary Noem, McLaughlin said.",
      "When Rep. Veronica Escobar tried to visit the El Paso center on July 9, ICE told her that they could not accommodate her attendance and said it is \u201cnow requiring requests to be made seven calendar days in advance,\u201d the lawsuit said.

      "But the list of administration officials who have drawn Loomer's ire and swiftly thereafter gotten the axe from Trump has been growing.",
      "Among the latest is Dr. Vinay Prasad, the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s polarizing vaccine chief, who announced this week he was leaving the agency after a brief tenure that drew the ire of biotech executives, patient groups and conservative allies of Trump.

Trump, meanwhile, has long praised Loomer while distancing himself at times from her most controversial comments and downplaying her direct impact on his choices.",
      "Here\u2019s a rundown on connections between Loomer's criticism and Trump administration departures:",

      "Driscoll's directive that West Point remove Easterly, shared on X, came just a day after she was announced as the Robert F. McDermott Distinguished Chair in West Point\u2019s social sciences department. Easterly had served as director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, facing harsh criticism from Republicans who argued that her work to counter misinformation about elections and the COVID-19 pandemic amounted to censorship.",

      "A day later, Trump said he had fired \u201csome\u201d White House National Security Council officials, downplaying Loomer\u2019s influence on the moves.

Tim Haugh, who also oversaw the Pentagon\u2019s Cyber Command, along with Haugh\u2019s civilian deputy at the NSA, Wendy Noble.",

      "DETROIT -- It was September 2012 and dozens of residents looked on as police cordoned off the area around a shed just northeast of Detroit.",
      "Low whispers about what \u2014 or who \u2014 officers were searching for grew to more excited chatter when the name Jimmy Hoffa started floating around the normally quiet street.",
      "By that time, the name had become sort of mythical in and around Detroit.",
      "Wednesday marks 50 years since the iron-fisted former Teamsters union boss disappeared from a restaurant about 10 miles (16 kilometers) north of the city. Presumed dead long before being legally declared deceased in 1982, Hoffa's remains were not found beneath the concrete shed floor in Roseville in 2012.",
      "Nor were they uncovered eight years earlier, below floorboards in a Detroit house. Neither were they found in 2013 at a horse farm miles northwest of the city.",
      "In 2013, digging equipment found mostly dirt as authorities excavated a field in Oakland Township, about 25 miles (40 kilometers) north of Detroit. And no signs of Hoffa were found in 2022 during a search of land beneath the Pulaski Skyway in New Jersey.",
      "Hoffa, the son of a coal miner who died when he was 7, was born in Brazil, Indiana, but moved with his mother to Detroit while still a boy. He quit school at 14 and went to work, landing a job on a grocery warehouse loading dock.",
      "In 1932, Hoffa led a workers\u2019 strike over poor labor conditions and unfair treatment of workers by the store, according to a post about him on the International Brotherhood of Teamsters website.",
      "He joined the union a year later and became a business agent for Local 299 in Detroit, the website said.",
      "Hoffa was elected the local's president in 1937 and would become a union organizer. He often found himself on the other end of the law. In 1937, he was convicted of assault and battery. In 1940, he pleaded no contest to charges of conspiring with unionized waste-paper companies to prevent non-union competitors from selling their products. Seven years later, he was arrested for attempted extortion. Each time, Hoffa only received fines.",
      "He continued to rise in the union's ranks. From 1957 to 1971, he served as the Teamsters general president.",

      "On July 30, 1975, Hoffa, now 62, was to meet reputed Detroit mob enforcer Anthony \u201cTony Jack\u201d Giacalone and alleged New Jersey mob figure Anthony \u201cTony Pro\u201d Provenzano at the Machus Red Fox restaurant in Oakland County\u2019s Bloomfield Township.",
      "Hoffa called his wife, Josephine, about 2:15 p.m. from a pay phone to tell her no one showed up for the meeting. He has not been seen or heard from since despite scores of tips and multiple searches spanning several states.",
      "A grand jury later was convened in Detroit, but no one ever has been directly charged in Hoffa's disappearance or death.",
      "\u201cI think it confirms in my mind ... somebody did a pretty good hit job on him,\u201d Wayne State University educator Marick Masters said of Hoffa.",
      "Masters, professor emeritus at the university's Mike Ilitch School of Business in Detroit, told The Associated Press on Wednesday that Hoffa was considering getting back into Teamsters' leadership at the time of his disappearance.",
      "\u201cHe still, obviously, was very much passionately involved in the union and he wanted to find a way of moving forward in it,\u201d Masters said. \u201cWhatever the circumstances were, he was tragically prevented from doing that.\u201d",
      "Hoffa was inducted into Labor\u2019s International Hall of Fame in 1999, according to the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which refers to Hoffa on its website as \u201ca worker's hero.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe was viewed as a very passionate champion of the Teamsters,\u201d Masters said. \u201cOn the other hand, he had problematic associations which besmirched the image of organized labor. He was a very controversial figure. He was capable of accomplishing things and also capable of having associations that raised questions about his integrity.\u201d",

As the director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, Easterly faced harsh criticism from Republicans who argued that her work to counter misinformation about elections and the COVID-19 pandemic amounted to censorship.",
      "CISA secures the nation\u2019s critical infrastructure, including the nation\u2019s dams, banks and nuclear power plants. It also secures voting systems \u2014 work that became controversial as Trump has made false claims to create doubt about the integrity of elections in recent years.",

      "Driscoll's directive came after far-right activist Laura Loomer posted about Easterly\u2019s new role on X, saying \u201cBiden holdovers\u201d at the Defense Department were \u201cundermining\u201d Trump\u2019s administration.

      "JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. -- The U.S. Treasury is seeking to recoup COVID-19 pandemic relief funds from hundreds of local governments that received millions of dollars but never complied with requirements to report how they used the money.",
      "The federal government distributed $350 billion to state, local, territorial and tribal governments as part of the American Rescue Plan approved by Congress and President Joe Biden in 2021. More than 30,000 governments, from the largest state to the tiniest town, were to get a share.",
      "Governments had until the end of 2024 to obligate the money for specific projects and were supposed to file either quarterly or annual progress reports, depending on their population and how much money they received. Most complied. But as of January, about 1,000 mostly smaller governments had failed to file any reports with the Treasury detailing how they used a total of $139 million, according to an analysis by the U.S. Government Accountability Office.",
      "A GAO report released last week said the Treasury sent notices to the local governments seeking to recoup the money.",
      "As of June 24, a total of 740 local governments subsequently filed reports and will no longer be subject to repaying their funds, the Treasury said in a letter attached to the GAO report. Thirteen governments returned their funds to the Treasury. But that still left 235 local governments that had never filed a report nor returned their pandemic relief funds.",
      "The GAO told The Associated Press it does not have list of the specific governments that haven't complied with the reporting requirements. The Treasury has not responded to an AP request for a list of the 13 governments that returned their funds and those that still haven't reported how they used it.",

The Treasury at that time declined to provide the noncompliance letters to the AP. So the AP in January 2024 submitted a Freedom of Information Act request seeking copies of the noncompliance notices and related correspondence. The Treasury still has not fulfilled that request.",
      "In its most recent report, the GAO said the failure of local governments to file regular progress reports is limiting the Treasury\u2019s ability to determine whether they are spending the funds on allowable uses.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration is pushing an initiative for millions of Americans to upload personal health data and medical records on new apps and systems run by private tech companies, promising that will make it easier to access health records and monitor wellness.",
      "Leaders from more than 60 companies, including major tech companies such as Google and Amazon, as well as prominent hospital systems like the Cleveland Clinic, will convene at the White House on Wednesday afternoon to discuss what the administration is calling a \u201cdigital health ecosystem.\" The new system will focus on diabetes and weight management, conversational artificial intelligence that helps patients, and digital tools such as QR codes and apps that register patients for check-ins or track medications.",
      "The initiative, spearheaded by an administration that has already freely shared highly personal data about Americans in ways that have tested legal bounds, could put patients' desires for more convenience at their doctor\u2019s office on a collision course with their expectations that their medical information be kept private.",
      "\u201cThere are enormous ethical and legal concerns,\u201d said Lawrence Gostin, a Georgetown University law professor who specializes in public health. \u201cPatients across America should be very worried that their medical records are going to be used in ways that harm them and their families.\u201d",
      "Officials at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, in charge of maintaining the system, have said patients will need to opt in for the sharing of their medical records and data, which will be kept secure.",
      "Officials say patients will benefit from a system that lets them quickly call up their own records without the hallmark difficulties, such as requiring the use of fax machines to share documents, that have prevented them from doing so in the past.",
      "\u201cWe have the tools and information available now to empower patients to improve their outcomes and their healthcare experience,\u201d Dr. Mehmet Oz, the administrator for CMS, said in a statement Wednesday.",
      "Once the system is set up, popular weight loss and fitness subscription service Noom, which has signed onto the initiative, will be able to pull medical records, including labs or tests, of its users into its AI-driven analysis of what might help users lose weight, CEO Geoff Cook told The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cRight now you have a lot of siloed data,\u201d Cook said.",
      "Patients who travel across the country for treatment at the Cleveland Clinic often have a hard time obtaining all their medical records from various providers, said the hospital system's CEO, Tomislav Mihaljevic. He said the new system would eliminate that barrier, which sometimes delays treatment or prevents doctors from making an accurate diagnosis because they do not have a full view of a patient's medical history.",
      "Having seamless access to health app data, such as what patients are eating or how much they are exercising, will also help doctors manage obesity and other chronic diseases, Mihaljevic said.",

      "Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders is set to headline a major Republican event in South Carolina",
      "COLUMBIA, S.C. -- Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders is set to headline the latest iteration of an event previously billed as the largest annual gathering of Republicans in South Carolina, a state traditionally key to picking the GOP's presidential nominees, and one in which she already has deep relationships.",
      "Rep. Sheri Biggs of South Carolina\u2019s 3rd District told The Associated Press that Sanders would be the featured speaker at her Salute to Liberty, slated to take place Aug. 18 in Anderson. In an interview last week, Biggs said she felt the governor \u201crepresents what the people in the 3rd District believe in, our morals, just down-to-earth hardworking people that love the Lord and want to live in peace with their families and uphold our conservative values.\u201d",
      "Historically a catalyst for Republican White House hopefuls, the South Carolina venue provides Sanders a chance to introduce herself to a large number \u2014 typically around 2,000 \u2014 of party activists. It\u2019s also a crowd with which President Donald Trump \u2014 whom she served as press secretary during his first administration \u2014 remains popular.",
      "Sanders, whose name comes up among potential 2028 presidential contenders, has been making trips to South Carolina since her father, former Arkansas governor and current U.S. ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee, sought the 2008 GOP nomination. She's recently been in other early-voting states herself, including a speech earlier this month at the Family Leadership Summit in Iowa, an annual event held by a conservative Christian group.",
      "For years, the South Carolina occasion was billed as Rep. Jeff Duncan's Faith & Freedom BBQ, a fundraiser benefiting his reelection campaign. In a conservative-rich area, it became a showcase for future White House contenders, including then-Vice President Mike Pence, Sens. Ted Cruz, Tim Scott and Marco Rubio, and former U.N. Ambassador and South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley.",
      "The barbecue was upended just weeks after the 2023 event, when Duncan's wife filed for divorce, saying the congressman left her, was having a sexual relationship with a lobbyist and had been unfaithful before during their 35-year marriage. Last year, Duncan opted not to seek reelection to an eighth term, following the 2023 diminishment of his reputation for conservative family values.",
      "In her first political run, Biggs \u2014 a nurse practitioner and Air National Guard officer \u2014 defeated a Trump-backed primary opponent last year. Mark Burns, a Black pastor who has been by Trump\u2019s side for nearly a decade, had unsuccessfully run for Congress twice before.",

      "Biggs easily won the general election in the district, which has been in GOP hands since Republican Lindsey Graham, who is now seeking his fifth U.S. Senate term, won it in 1994. Six months into her first term, Biggs said that she knew she wanted a district-unifying event of her own, as well as one that could continue to act as a showcase for potential GOP presidential candidates seeking to get to know its voters.",
      "\u201cI do want people to know that I'm here to serve this district, and that means making myself available and being out front and accessible to our voters, and hearing their needs,\u201d she said. \u201cI'm here to serve the district, and that doesn't just mean everybody who voted for me.\u201d",
      "In some ways, Biggs\u2019 event will be familiar. It\u2019s being held in the same venue as Duncan\u2019s barbecue, a civics center in Anderson, and there will still be $1 tickets for law enforcement officers and first responders. As for the menu, Biggs said she\u2019ll be shifting away from the buffet line of barbecue, baked beans and rolls, with a catered, \u201cmore of a sit-down type of dinner.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not so much that I don\u2019t think the barbecue was great, I just want my own identity,\u201d Biggs said. \u201cI want people to realize that it\u2019s a new ballgame, and I want to move forward on my own accord.\u201d",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/michael-feinstein-on-passing-his-love-of-great-songs-to-the-next-generation/",
    "published": "Sun, 27 Jul 2025 09:53:42 -0400",
    "summary": "The singer's love for the Great American Songbook goes far beyond standards written by Gershwin or Porter.",
    "story": [
      "For most of his 50-year career, Michael Feinstein has shown his love for the great American songs by performing them. \"There was something I connected to with the harmonic invention of the songs, the melodic ideas,\" he said. \"They express fundamental emotions in a very eloquent way that people can still relate to.\"",
      "He got his start early, as a little boy In Columbus, Ohio: \"When I was five, my father said, 'Let's get a piano.' I sat down and started playing 'Do-Re-Mi' from 'The Sound of Music' with both hands. My mother came in from the kitchen and said, 'Who taught you that?' And I said, 'Nobody!' And she sent me to my room for lying!\"",
      "He was playing by ear at five years old. Of his childhood he said, \"I always felt weird. I always felt different than everybody else. I was a lonely kid. I didn't have many friends. The first classical record I bought was the Rachmaninoff Second Piano Concerto, while my friends were all listening to Elton John and Carole King and Carly Simon.\"",
      "But his \"unpopular\" hobby soon made him a popular entertainer. For 12 years, he played in piano bars, five or six hours a night. \"It was mainly gay bars,\" he said, \"'cause those are the places where I could play show tunes without anybody complaining about it.\"",
      "He didn't go to college, but he did get an amazing education. For example, \"I learned that I had to program what I was doing as if I was programming a show, with an emotional arc. I learned what to say between the songs that I learned \u2013 patter and jokes and shtick and things that keep people engaged.\"",
      "Feinstein moved to L.A. when he was 20, where he met one of his idols: 80-year-old Ira Gershwin, George Gershwin's lyric-writing brother. Ira was so impressed by the young man's encyclopedic knowledge of Gershwin material that he gave him a job. \"I was only supposed to be there for a couple of weeks to catalog the phonograph records,\" Feinstein said. \"But I ended up spending six years as Ira's musical companion, an amanuensis, which is a nice word for stooge! It was an incredible time, the most exciting time in my life.\"",
      "In 1986, Feinstein got the invitation that changed his life: to perform in the Oak Room at New York's Algonquin Hotel. \"And from that, everything started popping,\" he said.",
      "At 29 years old, Feinstein's career was launched. Decades of glory days lay ahead \u2013 on stage, on PBS, on his 86 albums, and in his lifelong friendship with Liza Minnelli. (He's collaborating with her on her new memoir.) But he didn't just want to sing the Great American Songs; he also wanted to collect them.",
      "He's amassed a vast collection of memorabilia, recordings and scores, such as the first printing of \"Rhapsody in Blue.\"",
      "In recent years Feinstein has become increasingly dedicated to passing his love of the great songs to the next generation. He said, \"I'm carrying the weight of the responsibility to present these songs in a way that hopefully will appeal to them. Every time these songs are introduced to a younger person, it's like planting a seed, because it becomes part of them, and it goes on.\"",
      "In that spirit, Feinstein has established the Great American Songbook Foundation in Carmel, Indiana. There's a museum of songwriter artifacts \u2026 a performing arts center \u2026 and a weeklong Songbook Academy, in which 40 students from around the U.S. are selected to intensively learn about interpreting this music. \"And it's right alongside Taylor Swift or Adele or whoever else they're listening to,\" he said.",
      "For Feinstein the Great American Songbook isn't just music from before 1950: \"I think that Carole King and Billy Joel and Neil Sedaka and Elton John, they're all part of the American Songbook,\" he said. \"It's not just the 1910s and the '20s and the '30s; it is evolving.\"",
      "Michael Feinstein still performs live all over the country, including a concert of Tony Bennett classics (which you can watch on the streaming service Carnegie Hall+ on August 3) \u2013 because maybe the best way of all to keep the classics alive is to keep singing them.",

    "summary": "The Oscar-nominated star of \"The English Patient\" and \"Slow Horses\" has directed and co-written her first film: the heartfelt \"My Mother's Wedding,\" about three daughters who come together to attend their mom's third nuptials \u2013 a story inspired by Thomas' own childhood losses.",
    "story": [
      "She may be Dame Kristin Scott Thomas, but you're just as likely to find her living in Paris as you might in London. \"My blood is English, but my culture is French,\" she said.",
      "There is a duality about her. She can be as heartwarming in English (\"Darkest Hour\") as she can be heartwrenching in French (\"I've Loved You So Long\"). Many of her foreign films have been showcased at the Cine Lumiere, a French art house in London. \"A little slice of Paris,\" she said.",
      "It's convenient, now that she's back in London, playing the deputy director of MI5 in the Apple TV+ series \"Slow Horses.\"",
      "A chilly, stiff upper-lip has often been a calling card for Thomas \u2013 too stiff, she admits, early on: \"I think it was Sydney Pollock \u2013 or it might have been Robert Redford, take your pick,\" she laughed. \"One of them said to me, 'You know, you have to be generous. Forget what you're trying to defend. Forget trying to hide. Be more generous.' And I'm not sure I really understood what he meant by that. He just planted a seed, and then I was able to kind of unzip a bit more.\"",
      "And she about to unzip even more, creatively digging into something intensely personal in her past. She said, \"When I was five, my father was killed, and my mother remarried. And tragically, he was killed five years later. And I know that a lot of the time when I was a younger woman, I had this feeling of something missing, this piece of my puzzle missing having grown up with only one parent.\"",
      "Both had been pilots in the Royal Navy's Fleet Air Arm; both were lost in remarkably similar training accidents; and both left a hole that had her climbing out into her imagination. When she was a little girl she wrote and illustrated stories: \"A mommy and a daddy and two children, just doing ordinary things, like going away on holiday and things like that\" \u2013 a family experience she never knew.",
      "The memories of her dad were incomplete, fuzzy, like sketches she played out in her head. But those images became the seeds for what grew into a screenplay, and then came to life as the first movie she's ever directed: \"My Mother's Wedding.\"",
      "It garnered an all-star cast: Scarlett Johansson, Sienna Miller and Emily Beecham play Thomas' daughters who are each struggling in different ways  with the loss of a father or stepfather, just as their mother prepares to marry again.",
      "To watch a trailer for \"My Mother's Wedding\" click on the video player below:",
      "Thomas has already done movie weddings, of course, as in \"Four Weddings and a Funeral.\" Early on, she had a sarcastic confidence about her. She didn't have the most lines in that 1994 film, but in brevity she was brilliant:",
      "That demeanor might have been a surprise to those who knew her when she was bouncing around Royal Naval bases, a bit of a wallflower as a child, even into adulthood. \"I was excruciatingly shy,\" she said. \"I don't know when it changed, to be honest.\"",
      "She's hardly shy anymore, if her character in \"Fleabag\" is any indication. Perhaps it's fitting she was discovered by another admittedly shy success story, Prince. You'd think that would make her a pretty cool mom (she has three children with her first husband), but it turns out \u2026 not so much.",
      "\"I hadn't watched it with them, but as I was leaving my teenage children alone one evening, and they were having pizza and a friend 'round, I said, 'Watch \"Under the Cherry Moon,\" it's on the telly! Come on, it'll be fun!' And when I got back, they weren't actually very polite about it.\"",
      "She has more than made up for it, later starring opposite Robert Redford (\"The Horse Whisperer\"), Harrison Ford (\"Random Hearts\"), and Tom Cruise (\"Mission: Impossible\").",
      "\"I'm so proud to be in 'Mission: Impossible,' I cannot even get over it!\" she said. \"I'm in this thing, which is this enormous monster, and you know, these kids, they have no idea about 'Gosford Park.' They have no idea about 'Four Weddings,' but they've all seen 'Mission: Impossible'! And they have no idea I speak French or do all these other kind of slightly murkier films in France, you know?\"",
      "And then, of course, there was \"The English Patient,\" which earned her an Academy Award nomination for best actress. \"It's quite moving actually, when you see yourself at sort of 30 acting your socks off,\" she said.",
      "Another place she acted her socks off is at the Royal Court Theatre, where she won an Olivier Award for her performance in \"The Seagull,\" a role she later took to Broadway. \"New York audiences, when they are enjoying themselves, I mean it's electric \u2013 you can really, really feel it,\" she said.",
      "And London audiences? \"We are much more kind of passive, perhaps. Reserved. Of course we are!\" she laughed.",
      "But even while talking at the Royal Court, she found herself thinking about her film. As intimate as the stage may be, for her, \"My Mother's Wedding\" is more so. \"I love working on stage, as you can probably tell. I really, really love it. But the joy and satisfaction and exhaustion that comes from filmmaking when you are being a director, that is not far off. Pretty good. It's just extraordinary.\"",
      "At 65, and now a grandmother, she's working as hard as ever, not taking a lot of time to smell the roses per se, but she'll surely stop for someone who has a kind word or two: \"A lady came up to me the other day and said, 'I know you hate this, but I just wanted to say...' \u00a0and I said, 'I don't hate this at all! Keep it coming!'\"",

    "story": [
      "Louise Nevelson's artwork looks right at home at the Whitney Museum of American Art, mingling with the skyscrapers of Manhattan. She found inspiration in the city as early as the 1920s, yet it would take the art world decades to recognize her and her iconic sculptures.",
      "\"She was given her first respective at the Whitney in 1967,\" said Maria Nevelson, the artist's granddaughter, who runs the Louise Nevelson Foundation. \"I was seven years old. And there was a line of people all the way around the block, up to the front door. I really did get chills. It was the first time I responded to artwork in general, and to my grandmother's artwork.\"",
      "Nearly six decades later, the Whitney is holding a new Nevelson exhibition, which is open until August 10.",
      "Asked what Louise was like as a grandmother, Maria laughed: \"Oh, she was intimidating and unconventional. What comes to mind first is her atmospheric dressing. Anything could have been pulled into this assemblage and this layering of rich brocades and silks.\"",
      "That fancy wardrobe didn't stop Nevelson from getting her hands dirty: \"She'd dumpster dive, she'd get into the garbage can, she'd pull out filthy pieces of wood, and we'd have to take 'em home,\" said Maria. \"I would say the streets of New York weren't paved with gold for her; it was paved with garbage. And she loved it!\"",
      "Nevelson's attraction to wood may have grown from her family tree \u2013 her family owned lumber yards in present-day Ukraine, where she was born in 1899. Louise was a young girl who spoke no English when her father decided to move the family to Rockland, Maine.",
      "\"It was a bustling seaport town,\" said Maria. \"They got off the train and, she said, rednecks threw mud at them. And she said, 'I knew I was a Jew, I knew I was different.' She was about five, six years old then. That's her greeting to America.\"",
      "Undaunted, Nevelson learned English, and at age nine, announced she was going to be a sculptor.",
      "\"She knew always what she wanted to be and do, and she pursued it fiercely,\" said Brooke Minto, executive director and CEO of the Columbus Museum of Art, where Nevelson's work is also currently on display. \"It was a decade's long journey, and she just kept at it.\"",
      "Nevelson would choose a monochromatic palette to unify her materials. Minto said, \"She really understood that she could create an all-over, immersive experience in her sculpture by pairing them down to a single color. It's this wonderful accumulation of very simple and humble objects into something that's quite monumental and immediately historical.\"",
      "According to Maria Nevelson, Louise did her best work when she was in her 70s and 80s, \"right up to when she passed away at 88.\"",
      "In 1979, Charles Osgood, of \"Sunday Morning,\" spoke to Louise when she was 79 years old and, arguably, at the height of her career. The artist remarked, \"You see, dear, if you are doing your creative work, you don't have age or time as such, and consequently you're not caught in it. So, you go on.\"",

      "Albuquerque, New Mexico \u2014 Dr. Matt Campen studies the health effects of environmental pollutants. His lab at the University of New Mexico has, for the first time,\u00a0found plastics\u00a0in human brain tissue.",
      "He says his research estimates that the amount of plastic in the brain could be roughly equal to the size of a plastic spoon.",
      "\"That is a lot,\" Campen explains to CBS News. \"...The fact that it's getting worse over time is really the issue.\"",
      "Scientists believe these microscopic particles, called nanoplastics, come from all the plastic people use and throw away. When plastic breaks down over time, it winds up in the food supply, the water we drink, and even the air we breathe.",
      "A study last month in the Journal of the American Heart Association finds that people living near nanoplastic-polluted oceans are more likely to suffer from type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and stroke compared to those that lived near waters that have low levels of nanoplastics.",
      "Campen's lab has found more plastic in the brains of people with dementia than those without dementia.",
      "Now, research on these nanoplastics is moving out of the lab and into long-term clinical studies.  \u00a0 \"We have more evidence now for the effects of plastic on children's chronic disease then we do on food dyes,\" said Dr. Leonardo Trasande, a professor of pediatrics at New York University's Grossman School of Medicine. \"And if we use the same evidence standard, we should be acting as fiercely on plastics in the food supply as we are on food dyes.\" \u00a0 Trasande is tracking plastics' impact on over 64,000 children, from pregnancy to adolescence, including on 8-year-old Jack Glaser.",
      "\"The amount of information that they're collecting is remarkable,\" Glaser's mother, Tammy Fried-Glaser, said. \"They did cognitive studies on Jack, you know, height and weight and sonograms, and beyond.\"",
      "So far, Trasande's research has linked plastics to health problems like hormonal issues with fertility, premature birth, cognitive abnormalities and cardiovascular disease.",
      "\"Literally the particle is a problem \u2014 because it's a foreign body in a tissue,\" Trasande said. \"It might thrash the lining of the coronary artery, contributing to clogging...These are toxic drug delivery systems.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump announced Wednesday he has struck a trade deal with South Korea.",
      "Mr. Trump wrote on\u00a0Truth Social\u00a0that South Korean goods will face a 15% tariff \u2014\u00a0lower than\u00a0the 25% he threatened earlier this month \u2014 while U.S. imports to South Korea will not face tariffs. He said South Korea will be \"OPEN TO TRADE\" and will accept U.S. automobiles.",
      "South Korea is the latest key U.S. trading partner to reach an agreement with the Trump administration, ahead of a Friday deadline when Mr. Trump says he'll impose hefty tariffs on dozens of countries.",
      "South Korean President Lee Jae-myung confirmed his country had reached a deal with the U.S. in a Facebook post.",
      "In addition to the 15% tariff, Mr. Trump said South Korea agreed to \"give to the United States $350 Billion Dollars for Investments owned and controlled by the United States, and selected by myself.\" Lee said the fund will help South Korean companies enter the U.S. market, especially in industries like semiconductors and biotech, and $150 billion of the total $350 billion will focus on shipbuilding.",
      "South Korea will also buy $100 billion dollars' worth of liquified natural gas or other energy products, and will \"invest a large sum of money for their investment purposes,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "South Korea was the U.S.'s sixth-largest trading partner last year, not including multi-country blocs like the European Union, according to Census Bureau data. The U.S. imported $131.5 billion worth of South Korean goods, and South Korea bought $65.5 billion in American goods.",
      "More than $45 billion worth of U.S. imports from South Korea were cars and car parts, according to federal statistics. Cars from South Korea will be subject to the 15% tariffs, rather than the blanket 25% rate that Mr. Trump has imposed on foreign cars and car parts from other countries, Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick said on X.",
      "The president also\u00a0announced a deal with Japan last week\u00a0and a deal with the 27-nation EU on Sunday. Deals are still outstanding with the U.S.'s three largest single trading partners:\u00a0Canada, Mexico and\u00a0China.",
      "Trump strikes trade deals as tariff threats loom",
      "Mr. Trump has spent much of his first six months in office pressing U.S. trading partners to agree to trade deals \u2014 and floating large-scale tariffs if they don't correct what he views as imbalanced trading practices.",
      "Most countries, including South Korea, have faced 10% tariffs since April, when Mr. Trump delayed a set of higher \"reciprocal tariffs\" for 90 days to buy his administration time to negotiate. Then this month, the president sent letters to South Korea and around two dozen other trading partners telling them to expect higher tariffs starting Friday, Aug. 1, unless deals are reached.",
      "Mr. Trump has stood behind that deadline, writing on Wednesday: \"THE AUGUST FIRST DEADLINE IS THE AUGUST FIRST DEADLINE \u2014 IT STANDS STRONG, AND WILL NOT BE EXTENDED.\"",
      "Trading partners like Indonesia, the Philippines, the EU and Japan have struck trade deals before then \u2014 generally agreeing to tariffs that are lower than the ones threatened by Mr. Trump but higher than the 10% baseline.",
      "Meanwhile, negotiations with China, Canada and Mexico remain ongoing. Higher tariffs on Chinese goods are set to take effect on Aug. 12 unless the two countries strike a deal, though an extension is possible, U.S. officials have said.",
      "All told, the president said this week he expects that most imports to the U.S. will face a baseline tariff of 15% to 20%. By comparison, the average tariff rate on U.S. imports in 2023 was around 2.5%, according to figures from the\u00a0Yale Budget Lab, a non-partisan policy research center.",
      "Mr. Trump has argued his tariff strategy is necessary to correct what he views as unfair trading practices and revive American manufacturing. But many economists warn tariffs can lead to higher inflation and more sluggish economic growth, and some of the president's early trade moves rattled financial markets.",
      "Consumer prices have been relatively stable so far this year \u2014 though above the Federal Reserve's 2%-per-year target. Some economists say that's partly because companies have taken steps to prevent short-term shocks from tariffs.",

    "summary": "The Fed is maintaining its benchmark interest rate in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%, where it's been parked since December.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve\u00a0said\u00a0Wednesday it's keeping its benchmark interest rate unchanged, citing elevated uncertainty over the nation's economic outlook.",
      "The decision to hold rates steady marks a continuation of the Fed's \"wait-and-see\" strategy this year, as it monitors the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs on consumer prices. But Wednesday's policy statement also underscored that the growth remains steady despite concerns about slowing economic activity.",
      "\"Although swings in net exports continue to affect the data, recent indicators suggest that growth of economic activity moderated in the first half of the year,\" the Federal Open Market Committee, the 12-person central bank's rate-setting panel, said in its statement. \"The unemployment rate remains low, and labor market conditions remain solid. Inflation remains somewhat elevated.\"",
      "Two voting FOMC members, Fed Governors Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller, voted in favor of lowering the central bank's short-term rate \u2014 a rare show of dissent at the Fed, where monetary policy is generally set by consensus. It is the first time since 1993 that two member of the Fed's Board of Governors have voted against the chair, according to Capital Economics.",
      "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has faced pressure in recent months from President Trump to lower rates, with the president arguing that inflation remains relatively tame.",
      "In a press conference on Wednesday, Powell said most FOMC members voted in favor of maintaining the current rate because inflation remains above the Fed's 2% annual target, while also describing the economy as remaining in good shape.",
      "\"The economy is not performing as though restrictive policy were holding it back inappropriately,\" he said.",
      "Powell added, \"The economy is in good shape, but it's an unusual situation in that you have risks to both sides of the mandate,\" referring to the Fed's dual goal of keeping both prices and unemployment low.",
      "By the numbers",
      "The central bank on Wednesday said it would maintain the federal funds rate at its current range of 4.25% to 4.5%. The last time the central bank cut interest rates was in December 2024, when it trimmed rates by 0.25 percentage points.",
      "Wall Street had anticipated the Fed's decision, with economists pegging the probability the central bank would hold rates steady at 96%, according to financial data firm FactSet.",
      "Why is the Fed holding rates steady?",
      "The Fed's Powell has signaled the Fed remains cautious about lowering rates given the potential impact of the Trump administration's tariffs, which he has said could dent economic growth and reignite inflation.",
      "Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, thinks the dissents by Bowman and Waller represent a minority opinion on the FOMC, with most of the rate-setting panel's voting members preferring to hold rates steady amid amid concern about inflation.",
      "Inflation remains above the Fed's 2% target, with the Consumer Price Index rising\u00a0in June to an annualized rate of 2.7%. At the same time, the economy remains solid. The economy grew at a stronger-than-expected 3% rate between April and June, according to data released Wednesday, with economists saying the rebound in growth from earlier this year supports the Fed's argument for keeping rates steady.",
      "\"This [GDP] report is unlikely to shift the Federal Reserve's stance,\" said Gina Bolvin, president of Bolvin Wealth Management Group, in an email prior to the Fed's decision. The central bank will \"wait for more consistent signals before considering rate cuts.\"",
      "When could the Fed cut rates?",
      "Economists currently predict a 63% likelihood the Fed will cut rates at its two-day meeting on Sept. 16-17, according to FactSet. The FOMC, the central bank's rate-setting panel, doesn't meet in August, making the September meeting the next chance for a rate cut.",
      "Although the economy has proved resilient despite concerns about the impact of U.S. tariffs, some economists expect growth to lag and inflation to accelerate over the next few months. Following the latest Fed statement, Pantheon Macroeconomics chief U.S. economist Samuel Tombs forecast that the Fed will ease its benchmark rate by a total of 0.75 percentage points by year-end, starting in September.",
      "Asked whether the Fed could cut rates at the September meeting, Powell demurred, saying that the decision will be based on economic data that is released between now and the central bank's next meeting on Sept. 16-17. In the lead-up to that decision, the Fed will assess two monthly job reports from the Department of Labor and two additional months' of CPI data.",
      "Mr. Trump on Wednesday announced a 25% tariff rate on imports from India ahead of his administration's Aug. 1 deadline to strike trade deals with dozens of other countries. American importers such as Walmart are on the hook for paying the tariffs, although many companies stocked up on goods earlier this year to try to avoid hiking prices for inflation-weary customers.",
      "\"We know from surveys that companies have every intention of putting [the tariff costs] through to consumers,\" Powell said. \"A reasonable base case is these are one-time price effects.\"",
      "He added, \"We will make sure this doesn't move from being a one-time price increase to serious inflation.\"",
      "Powell's remarks emphasizing the solid U.S. economy, as well as the risks from tariffs, signaled to some economists that a September rate cut might not be in the cards.",
      "\" For [a September rate cut] to happen, the rest of the FOMC will need to become either less concerned about the inflation outlook or more concerned about the economic and labor market outlook,\" said Capital Economics deputy chief North American economist Stephen Brown in a report.",

    "summary": "The country's GDP increased at an annual rate of 3%, a sharp turnaround from earlier this year when it fell 0.5%.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. economy surged between April and June after shrinking in the first three months of the year, driven by a large shift in imports tied to President Trump's trade policies.",
      "By the numbers",
      "The country's GDP increased at an annual rate of 3% in the second quarter, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. That's higher than the 2% pace forecast for the April-to-June period, according to economists polled by financial data firm FactSet.",
      "The number represents a turnaround from the first three months of 2025, when GDP fell 0.5%, the worst quarterly performance for the economy since early 2022. The new data also shows consumers increased spending since the last quarter, with growth of 1.4%, up from 0.5% from January to March. The number is still down significantly from 4% in the\u00a0final\u00a0quarter of 2024.",
      "When it comes to assessing the strength of the economy, a more revealing number tucked into the GDP report is what is known as \"final sales to private domestic purchasers,\" which excludes government spending, inventories and net exports. That number rose at only a 1.2% annual rate from April to May \u2014 the weakest since late 2022 and a sign that demand is weakening.",
      "What the numbers mean",
      "GDP data offers a broad yardstick for measuring the overall health of the economy, with periods of fast growth typically coinciding with robust consumer spending, ample job growth and healthy corporate profits. This year, however, experts say the Trump administration's tariffs on U.S. economic partners have complicated the picture.",
      "\"As was the case in Q1, volatile trade flows are skewing the GDP performance (the 3% growth primarily reflects a decrease in imports and an acceleration in consumer spending that were partially offset by a downturn in investment),\" Adam Crisafulli, head of investment research firm Vital Knowledge, said in a report.",
      "Thomas Ryan, North America economist at investor advisory firm Capital Economics, said in a note that the surge in GDP \"overstates the economy's underlying strength\" because the growth spurt in the second quarter was largely driven by a 30% decline in imports after U.S. tariffs took effect.",
      "GDP slumped in the first quarter, falling 0.5% from January to March, largely due to a surge in U.S. imports as consumers and businesses rushed to buy goods from abroad before stepped-up tariffs took effect.",
      "In calculating GDP, imports are seen as reducing growth because they reflect purchases from overseas, rather than goods and services produced in the U.S. By contrast, exports boost a country's GDP because they reflect domestic goods and services that were sold abroad.",
      "The upshot: Through the first half of 2025, the economy grew at an average rate of 1.25%. That's markedly slower than the pace of growth in 2024, when GDP for the full year rose 2.8%, noted Dean Baker, a senior economist at Center for Economic and Policy Research.",
      "Where the economy is headed",
      "Although the 3% GDP rate in Wednesday's report may be skewed by the president's trade policies, experts say the overall economy remains solid and shows no signs of crumbling.",
      "\"Beneath the topline figure, the economy is switching to a lower gear but not going in reverse,\" Bernard Yaros, lead US economist at Oxford Economics, said in a research note.",
      "Yaros added that consumers are slowing \u2014 but not switching off \u2014 their spending, which accounts for roughly two-thirds economic activity.",
      "Still, EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco notes that economic activity is slowing as inflationary pressures rise \u2014 a trend likely to persist throughout the summer. He predicts real GDP growth to slow to a rate of 0.9% year over year by the fourth quarter.",
      "Another indicator of the health of the economy will come Wednesday afternoon, when the Federal Reserve announces its rate decision. The central bank is again expected to hold rates steady. The Labor Department is also scheduled to release its monthly jobs report on Friday, offering a snapshot of how the labor market is faring.",

      "President Trump on Wednesday signed an executive order suspending what's known as a de minimis exemption allowing low-value parcels that are shipped to the United States to avoid tariffs.",
      "The White House said it's closing what it called a \"catastrophic loophole\" that shippers use to \"evade tariffs and funnel deadly synthetic opioids or below-market products\" into the U.S. The order goes into effect Aug. 29.",
      "The exemption had applied to parcels valued at $800 or less, and allowed overseas retailers to ship inexpensive goods to consumers in the U.S. tax-free.",
      "\"President Trump is putting an end to the proliferation of shippers worldwide that, among other things, deceptively exploit the de minimis privilege in an effort to evade duties, inspection, and U.S. law,\" the White House said in a fact sheet outlining the new policy.",

Shipments from China and Hong Kong account for most de minimis shipments to the U.S. according to the White House.",
      "The de minimis provision, which was added to the Tariff Act of 1930 several years after that law's passage, was intended to facilitate trade by eliminating the administrative burden of collecting modest import duties on low-cost goods.",

    "story": [
      "More high-income Americans around the U.S. are falling behind on their credit cards and auto loans, a sign that even people earning more than six figures are more likely to struggle financially amid shifts in the economy.",
      "Delinquencies across all loan products for households earning more than $150,000 have more than doubled since 2023. That compares with a 60% increase in delinquencies during that time for households earning between $45,000 and $150,000, and a 22% increase for people earning less than $45,000, according to data from credit-scoring company VantageScore.",
      "High-income households had weathered the post-pandemic years better than lower-earning Americans because they had more of a cushion to absorb soaring inflation and other shocks, according to VantageScore chief economist Rikard Bandebo.",
      "But these Americans are now feeling the impact of several economic changes, including a weaker job market for white-collar workers and higher housing costs, he told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"For white-collar workers, it's probably tougher than it has been,\" Bandebo said. \"This trend has been consistent and seems to be continuing \u2014 it's not abetting.\"",
      "About 38% of all new jobs created in the five years before the pandemic paid above-average wages, VantageScore's data shows. But this year that share has fallen to 7%, signaling that companies are creating fewer white-collar positions. That poses a challenge to higher-income Americans who suffer a job loss because it may be tougher to find new employment than in previous years.",
      "\"This group is being hit from a number of different aspects, which is making it harder for them to make ends meet,\" Bandebo said.",
      "To be sure, the overall rate of loan delinquencies in the U.S. remains higher for low- and middle-income consumers than for high-income earners, according to VantageScore. For instance, the delinquency rate for households earning at least $150,000 now stands at about 0.34%, versus 1.75% for low-income households. But the rise in delinquencies has accelerated faster for higher-income households than for other groups, the firm's data shows.",
      "A worrying sign?",
      "A key question for the U.S. is whether the financial challenges facing high-income Americans could portend a broader economic downturn. Notably, consumption by wealthier Americans now contributes about half of all consumer spending, the main engine for economic growth. By comparison, in 1990 spending by Americans higher up the economic ladder accounted for about one-third of all spending.",
      "At the same time, low- and middle-income households are also facing stiffer financial headwinds with about six in 10 middle-income consumers saying they're financially stressed, according to a recent survey from financial services company Primerica.",
      "More than one-third of middle-income households, or those earning between $30,000 to $130,000, say they've increased their credit card usage, the survey found.",
      "Retailers and major consumer brands have also been warning that some consumers are cutting back or are more cautious in their purchases.",
      "Shoppers are \"looking for value, either in smaller packs and promotions or in larger pack sizes in the club channel and online,\" Procter & Gamble Chief Financial Officer Andre Schulten said on an earnings conference call Tuesday. \"That's the behavior we've been outlined before, but it's not stopped. It continued.\"",
      "Widespread consumer frustration with high prices is thought to have boosted President Trump during the 2024 electoral campaign against Joe Biden, when Mr. Trump vowed to end\u00a0the \"inflation nightmare.\" So far, inflation has remained relatively muted in 2025, although June's 2.7% annualized rate remains higher than the Federal Reserve's goal of reaching a 2% rate.",
      "Yet more consumers are now expressing frustration with the Trump administration's economic policies, according to a new CBS News poll that found nearly 64% of Americans now disapprove of how the president is handling inflation. The survey was conducted from July 16-18 and polled 2,343 adults.",
      "As for Americans who are struggling to keep up with credit-card debt and auto loans, they aren't likely to see relief anytime soon. Although Mr. Trump has been pushing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to lower interest rates, economists think the central bank is very likely to stand pat when officials announce their latest policy move on Wednesday.",

    "story": [
      "Have you ever found yourself repeating the words \"speak to a human please\" while on the phone with customer service? If so, you're among the roughly 70% of Americans who find interacting with automated phone systems, versus human customer support representatives, frustrating.",
      "That's in part why Senator Ruben Gallego wants to ensure that consumers who find themselves on the phone with a customer service agent are in fact speaking to a human, and one who is in the U.S., if that's their preference. He's also well aware of the threat artificial intelligence poses to American workers, and is committed to protecting the roughly three million Americans who work in call centers across the country, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.",
      "A new bipartisan bill, called the \"Keep Call Centers in America Act of 2025,\" introduced by Sen. Gallego and Sen. Jim Justice of West Virginia on Wednesday, proposes to ensure such jobs remain in the U.S. by limiting federal benefits for companies who ship them overseas.",
      "What does the bill require of companies?",
      "The bill would require businesses that decide to ship call centers overseas to notify the Department of Labor at least 120 days before making such a move. It would also direct the DOL to maintain a public list of employers that have relocated call center work overseas. Under the bill, employers would remain on the list for five years, absent efforts to return call center jobs to the U.S.",
      "Companies on such a list would be ineligible for new federal grants and federal guaranteed loans, under the proposed bill, while nonlisted companies would be given preference for federal contracts. Additionally, the DOL would be required to track any call center job losses related to AI.",
      "How would it protect consumers?",
      "To protect consumers, the bill would mandate that call center workers immediately disclose their physical locations to callers, and disclose whether AI is being used. Also, customers would be able to request to be transferred to a U.S.-based call center, if they so desired, under the proposed piece of legislation.",
      "\"People want to have the option of speaking to a human or AI. This isn't new \u2014who hasn't pressed zero repeatedly to try to skip the automated systems because they want to talk to a human? This is a consumer check people want to see,\" Sen. Gallego told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "In addition to supporting domestic jobs, keeping call center work in the U.S. helps safeguard American consumers' data, he said.",
      "\"We are concerned about what it means for American consumers if they're not talking to a human based in the U.S., when it comes to security around their private information,\" Sen. Gallego said.",
      "On the topic of AI taking over work currently performed by humans, Gallego acknowledged that the technology will inevitably bring about some job displacement.",
      "\"There will be changes and AI will cause some unemployment,\" he said. \"We can't stop it entirely.\"",
      "The senator added that he is not completely opposed to AI taking over some customer service work, either. \"If someone has a really good experience with an AI bot, there won't be a problem as long as that person knows they're talking to AI versus to a human,\" Gallego said.",
      "The Communications Workers of America (CWA) endorsed the proposed bill.",
      "\"This much-needed legislation protects U.S. call center jobs and addresses the growing threats posed by artificial intelligence and offshoring,\" (CWA) Director of Government Affairs, Dan Mauer said in a statement. \"Historically, companies have offshored customer service jobs to avoid paying good union wages and benefits. Now companies are using AI to de-skill and speed up work and displace jobs, which undermines worker rights and degrades service quality for consumers.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump announced Wednesday that the U.S. would impose tariffs of 25% on imports from India \u2014 in addition to an unspecified \"penalty\" \u2014 for what he said were its high tariffs and trade barriers, and for its large purchases of military equipment and energy from Russia.",
      "Mr. Trump posted about the tariffs on India on social media Wednesday morning, saying, \"Remember, while India is our friend, we have, over the years, done relatively little business with them because their Tariffs are far too high, among the highest in the World, and they have the most strenuous and obnoxious non-monetary Trade Barriers of any Country.\"",
      "The president criticized India for buying energy products from Russia \"at a time when everyone wants Russia to STOP THE KILLING IN UKRAINE.\"",
      "In a separate post, the president said, \"WE HAVE A MASSIVE TRADE DEFICIT WITH INDIA!!!\"",
      "Although U.S. exports to India rose in 2024, its trade deficit also rose by 5.4%, to $45.7 billion. The director of the National Economic Council, Kevin Hassett, told reporters Wednesday morning, \"India has had a market that's been pretty much closed to American products, and we've been wide open to theirs. And I think President Trump is frustrated with the progress we've made with India, but feels that a 25% tariff will address and remedy the situation in a way that's good for the American people.\"",
      "When Mr. Trump met with\u00a0Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u00a0at the White House in February, he said the U.S. would be increasing military sales to India and that the two countries had reached an agreement on oil and gas that would make the U.S. India's leading supplier.",

    "summary": "President Trump has pressured Fed Chair Jerome Powell to lower interest rates. Here's what the experts think will happen at today's monetary policy meeting.",
    "story": [
      "During a\u00a0meeting last week between President Trump and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, the president sought to underscore what he said is a \"very simple\" request: \"Interest rates have to come down.\"",
      "That wish isn't likely to be granted when the Fed announces its next interest rate decision today. Economists put the probability of the central bank holding rates steady at 96%, according to FactSet. The Fed has maintained its benchmark rate in a range of 4.25% to 4.5% since December 2024, prior to Mr. Trump's second-term inauguration in January, as policy makers try to douse the flickering embers of inflation.",
      "Mr. Trump has for months\u00a0derided Powell  over the Fed's caution in lowering borrowing costs, which experts say would boost economic growth but could cause consumer prices to flare. Upping the pressure, Trump administration officials also have said the Fed chair's handline of a\u00a0building renovation\u00a0at the Fed could be grounds for firing.",
      "Despite such criticism, Powell has maintained his stance that no immediate rate cuts are necessary given that the economy remains solid. The Fed chair, who Mr. Trump nominated to head the central bank in 2017, has also suggested he wants to keep its powder dry in case the Trump administration's steep new tariffs cause inflation to reignite.",
      "\"With the labor market holding up and the impact of tariffs on inflation starting to rear its ugly head, the Federal Reserve has plenty of ammunition to justify keeping interest rates unchanged at the July meeting,\" Oxford Economics chief U.S. economist Ryan Sweet said in a July 24 research note.",
      "In making his case for lowering interest rates, Mr. Trump has pointed to rate cuts\u00a0earlier this year by the European Central Bank and the Bank of England, while also pointing out that U.S. inflation so far in 2025 has remained relatively low.",
      "However, the Consumer Price Index \u2014 a key gauge for tracking inflation \u2014 in June rose to an annualized rate of 2.7%, well above the Fed's 2% annual target and a sign that that tariffs could be pushing some prices higher.",
      "Fed policy makers are meeting this week to discuss what to do on interest rates. Here's what to know.",
      "When is the Fed making its rate cut decision?",
      "The Federal Reserve will make its next rate cut decision at 2 p.m. ET on Wednesday, July 30, followed by a 2:30 p.m. ET press conference with Powell, when he will offer his view on the the state of the economy and answer questions from financial journalists about the Fed's economic outlook.",
      "Who makes decisions on interest rates?",
      "The decision is made by the 12-person Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, with a voting majority deciding whether the central bank should cut, hike or maintain the benchmark rate. In other words, no single person, including Fed Chair Powell, determines the central bank's monetary policy.",
      "Lately, at least two members of the FOMC \u2014 Federal Reserve governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman \u2014 have signaled their belief that it is time to cut rates.",
      "\"[I]f there were a pair of dissents in July, it would match the most since 1993,\" Sweet of Oxford Economics noted.. \"From our perspective, dissents are normal and a good thing as it highlights that the Fed isn't falling into the trap of groupthink.\"",
      "Could the Fed cut rates today?",
      "It's not impossible, but highly unlikely. Economists estimate the chances of a rate cut at just 4%, according to FactSet. CME FedWatch, a closely watched monetary policy tracker, also suggests only a very remote probability of a cut.",
      "For now, data continues to shows steady, if slowing, economic growth, with employers in June\u00a0hiring more workers than forecast and inflation remaining relatively muted.\u00a0On Wednesday, the Commerce Department said second-quarter GDP rose at an annual rate of 3%, far outpacing the forecast for 2% growth.",
      "The threat from tariffs as well as stronger-than-expected GDP data means \"the Fed is all but certain to keep rates unchanged again this week, with futures markets pricing in effectively no chance of a cut,\" Matthew Ryan, head of market strategy at global financial services firm Ebury, in an email.",
      "The Fed is likely to hold off on cutting rates to give them room to maneuver if conditions deteriorate, economists note.",
      "Interest rates are the Fed's most powerful tool for nudging growth forward when the economy slows and cooling activity when inflation jumps. A rate hike makes it more expensive for consumers and businesses to borrow, curbing spending and putting the brakes on inflation. By contrast, cuts make it cheaper to borrow, fueling spending and corporate investment, which can spark inflation.",
      "\"Policymakers remain cautious, navigating persistent inflationary risks tied to trade policy along with cooling labor market conditions and growing political pressure from the administration to accelerate rate cuts,\" EY-Parthenon Chief Economist Gregory Daco said in an email.",
      "How has Powell responsed to pressure from Mr. Trump?",
      "Powell has repeatedly stated that the Federal Reserve's decisions are based solely on economic data as it pursues its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and ensuring full employment.",
      "Because Mr. Trump has been pushing for lower rates, Powell is likely to face questions at his press conference Wednesday press about political pressure. Powell may also be asked about the president's remarks about\u00a0replacing him as Fed chair, he added. Powell's current term as chair ends in May 2026.",
      "\"The odds are that [Powell] sticks with his mantra that it doesn't impact monetary policy and he isn't resigning while dodging questions about a shadow Fed chair,\" Sweet said, referring to the possibility that Mr. Trump could decide to nominate Powell's successor months before he is due to step down in hopes of influencing investor expectations for monetary policy.",
      "When is the Fed more likely to lower interest rates?",
      "The Fed is more likely to lower its benchmark rate at its Sept. 16-17 meeting, according to FactSet, with economists pegging the likelihood of a cut at 63%. The FOMC doesn't meet in August, making the September meeting the next chance for a rate cut.",
      "Economists who predict a rate cut at the September meeting are forecasting a 0.25 percentage point reduction, which would take the federal funds rate down to a range of 4% to 4.25%.",
      "\"With no imminent need to act.. the Fed will likely wait until September to deliver the next 25 [basis point] rate cut,\" Daco said. \"We continue to expect two rate cuts in 2025, followed by a further 100bps of easing in 2026 as economic and labor market conditions deteriorate more visibly.\"",

The EU decided neither to retaliate nor to increase its tariffs, and is even expected to reduce them. The EU agreed to a bad deal rather than risk trade war escalation.\"",
      "The average tariff on U.S. imports from the EU will surge from 1.2% in 2024 to 17.5%, according to investor advisory firm Capital Economics. That will reduce the EU's annual gross domestic product by 0.2%, the investment advisory firm forecast.",
      "EU countries annually ship more than $300 billion in goods to the U.S., accounting for more than 20% of total U.S. imports. Mexico ranks second among America's trade partners at roughly 15% of U.S. imports, while Canada accounts for 11% (see chart at bottom.)",
      "The deal, announced Sunday by President Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, imposes a 15% U.S. tariff on most EU imports, while American goods exported to the union's 27 member countries will face no tariffs. Previously, U.S. exports to the EU faced an average tariff of roughly 1%, according to Goldman Sachs analysts.",
      "The EU also pledged to buy $750 billion worth of energy from the U.S., up from about $80 billion a year, and to invest $600 billion by 2028.",
      "The trade agreement will boost Americans by increasing access to the EU's vast market and supporting the U.S. manufacturing sector, according to the Trump administration.",
      "\"This colossal deal will enable U.S. farmers, ranchers, fishermen and manufacturers to increase U.S. exports, expand business opportunities and help reduce the goods trade deficit with the European Union,\" the White House said Monday in a\u00a0fact sheet about the pact.",
      "The White House didn't immediately respond to a request for additional comment.",
      "Reducing uncertainty",
      "Although the agreement sharply raises U.S. tariffs, economists said the deal will also help ease some of the uncertainty around trade relations with a key trading partner. Perhaps most important, it is better than the alternative given that Mr. Trump had threatened to slap a 30% tariff on EU imports.",
      "More broadly, the EU deal and the Trump administration's framework agreement with Japan last week \u2014 both of which set 15% as a baseline tariff \u2014 also could help pave the way for trade agreements with Canada, Korea, Mexico and other countries, including on key sectors like autos, experts said.",
      "\"[C]ompared to expectations we had a few weeks before, in particular when pharmaceuticals and semiconductors could have been subject to higher tariffs, it looks like this deal is better than feared,\" Michel Martinez, head Europe economist at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "European auto exports would face a 15% levy, down from 25%, according to Goldman Sachs. Von der Leyen also said the U.S. would eliminate tariffs on some products, including aircraft and parts, semiconductor manufacturing gear, natural resources, some farm products, and certain chemicals and generic drugs. Likewise, the EU would abolish tariffs on those products.",
      "Neither the U.S. nor the EU has released details of the pact, and lobbying by some industries is expected to continue. For example, Unione Italiana Vini, an Italian trade group representing winemakers, said in a\u00a0statement\u00a0on Monday that a 15% tariff on EU imports will result in a a $371 million hit for exporters.",
      "\"We are now calling on the Italian government and the EU to consider appropriate measures to safeguard a sector that has grown significantly thanks to U.S. buyers,\" the group's president, Lamberto Frescobaldi, said in a statement, while acknowledging that the\u00a0 deal \"at least resolved the uncertainty that was stalling the market.\"",
      "According to the group's analysis, a bottle of Italian wine that previously retailed for $11.50 in the U.S. will now cost nearly $15 under the new tariff agreement.",
      "The German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA), which represents German automakers, also said a 15% U.S. tariff on the country's automotive products will hurt its car manufacturers, while noting that the new tariff rate amounts to a reprieve from the 25% automobile levies EU nations have faced since April.",
      "Wayne Winegarden, an economist at the Pacific Research Institute, a think tank that support free market policies, expects the U.S.-EU deal is to raise prices for consumers and lower corporate profits.",
      "\"Going forward, we are going to start to see these impacts either through lower profitability for corporations and higher costs for consumers, and most likely a combination of the two,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Despite the Trump administration's recent trade deals with the EU, Japan, U.K. and several other Asian countries, the U.S. still faces a self-imposed Aug. 1 deadline to reach agreements with Canada, Mexico, Korean other key trading partners.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration's trade policy faces a critical test this week as a federal court weighs the legality of its sweeping tariffs.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, D.C., is scheduled to hear oral arguments on Thursday in V.O.S. Selections v. Trump, a case brought by five small business owners and 12 states who allege they have been harmed by President\u00a0Trump's import taxes. V.O.S., the lead plaintiff in the case, is a New-York based wine importer.",
      "The lawsuit challenges President Trump's claim that he has authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 (IEEPA) to issue tariffs, a process that normally requires congressional approval.",
      "A victory by the plaintiffs could deal a blow to Mr. Trump as he seeks to negotiate trade deals with U.S. economic partners. The U.S. and the European Union on Sunday\u00a0announced a pact, easing tension over a brewing trade war. But the White House has yet to reach deals with other major trading partners, including Canada, Mexico, South Korea and China.",
      "What both sides are arguing",
      "The plaintiffs in the V.O.S. case argue that Mr. Trump exceeded his authority when he bypassed congressional approval and invoked IEEPA as the legal\u00a0basis\u00a0for imposing his \"Liberation Day\" tariffs on April 2. Mr. Trump also drew on IEEPA in deploying a separate set of\u00a0tariffs\u00a0in February against Canada, Mexico and China that he said was aimed at stemming the flow of undocumented immigrants and fentanyl.",
      "\"This case is about more than high tariffs,\" Brent Skorup, a legal fellow at the Cato Institute, a Washington, D.C., nonpartisan think tank, said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. \"It's about whether a president can stretch a vague statute beyond recognition to sidestep Congress.\"",
      "IEEPA, among other things, gives the president authority to regulate transactions with foreign countries during national emergencies. However, no U.S. president has ever invoked IEEPA as a justification for imposing tariffs.",
      "\"It's limited to emergencies where there is an 'unusual and extraordinary threat' \u2014 and the trade deficit is hardly an emergency. It's been with us for basically 50 years\" said Jeffrey Schwab, senior counsel and director of litigation at the Liberty Justice Center, a nonpartisan public interest law representing the five businesses that have filed suit in the case.",
      "The White House has defended President Trump's use of IEEPA to impose tariffs.",
      "\"The administration is legally and fairly using tariff powers that have been granted to the executive branch by the Constitution and Congress to level the playing field for American workers and safeguard our national security,\" White House spokesperson Kush Desai told CBS MoneyWatch in a statement.",
      "Why the case is important",
      "Mr. Trump has said tariffs are necessary to eliminate trade imbalances with other countries, which he said constitutes an \"unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and economy of the United States.\"",
      "But a ruling in favor of the plaintiffs could have broader implications for trade policy, forcing Mr. Trump to seek congressional approval in imposing tariffs, Schwab said.",
      "\"If the court holds that the President's Liberation Day and fentanyl tariffs are unlawful, then he would not have authority to set those tariff rates, but still Congress could approve these deals \u2014 just like it did the NAFTA renegotiation in the first Trump term,\" Schwab said in an email.",
      "Presidents can draw on\u00a0other statutes, such as Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, to authorize the use of tariffs.",
      "How we got here",
      "The U.S. Court of International Trade in May\u00a0struck down Mr. Trump's tariffs, with a three-judge panel ruling that the levies exceeded \"any authority granted to the president by IEEPA to regulate importation by means of tariffs.\"",
      "At the time, the trade court said the 10% reciprocal tariffs are designed to deal with trade imbalances, which the judges said did not constitute an emergency under IEEPA. But a federal appeals court in May\u00a0blocked the trade court ruling\u00a0and reinstated the tariffs after the Trump administration appealed.",
      "After the trade court ruling in May, Desai\u00a0said\u00a0Mr. Trump would use \"all tools at his disposal to advance trade policy that works for all Americans.\"",
      "The case now heads to the federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., where lawyers from both parties will present their arguments. The court could issue a decision as early as August, Schwab told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "That decision likely won't be the end of the road for the case, with Schwab expecting the losing party to appeal to the Supreme Court.",

      "Novo Nordisk shares plunged over 20% on Tuesday after the company named a new CEO and lowered its profit expectations, citing weaker sales of its popular weight-loss drug Wegovy due to competition from copycat drugs.",
      "In a statement on Tuesday, Novo Nordisk said\u00a0it expects its sales for 2025 to grow 8%-14%, down from projections of 13%-21% in May. It also lowered its expectations for operating profit growth to 10%-16%, down from 16%-24% in May.",
      "The updated outlook \"reflects the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition,\" the company said. Glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists (GLP-1s), a class of drugs used to manage diabetes,\u00a0have upended the weight-loss industry.",
      "The Danish pharmaceutical company also announced on Tuesday the appointment of Maziar Mike Doustdar as president and CEO. Doustdar, who has worked at Novo Nordisk for over 30 years, will take the helm starting on Aug. 7.",
      "Doustdar will succeed Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen, who announced his departure as CEO of Novo Nordisk in May, following a steep decline in the company's share price, which has dropped nearly 37% since the start of this year.",

      "Copycat drugs pervade market",
      "While global sales of Wegovy are growing, sales of the weight-loss drug are expected to weaken in certain markets due to increased competition from compounded versions of the drug.",
      "Compounded weight-loss drugs have the same active ingredients as Wegovy and other popular brands such as Ozempic, and are used as substitutes when the name-brand drugs aren't available. However, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in April said there is no longer a shortage of GLP-1s and\u00a0ordered compounding pharmacies to stop selling their copycat versions of the popular weight-loss drugs.",
      "Despite efforts to stymie them, however, compounded versions of the drugs continue to penetrate the market, giving consumers a cheaper option to name-brands like Wegovy, which can cost more than\u00a0$1000 per package for those without insurance.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/young-people-trumps-job-handling-cbs-news-analysis/",
    "published": "Tue, 29 Jul 2025 12:51:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Most Americans under 30 approved at the start of President Trump's second term but are dissatisfied with the economy's direction.",
    "story": [
      "Since Donald Trump took office for his second term, his job ratings have markedly\u00a0declined\u00a0\u2014 and more with young people than any other age group. What has made so many young Americans change their minds so quickly?",
      "For context, President Trump's electoral performance with voters under 30 improved a lot in 2024: While he lost this group to former Vice President Kamala Harris, it was by a much smaller margin than in 2020. And men under 30 ended up splitting roughly evenly between Trump and Harris. These trends prompted some observers to marvel at how conservative Gen Z had become, especially young men, and to wonder whether it marked a durable change.",
      "About half a year on from Inauguration Day, many young people have changed their minds on Trump. It looks more like many young voters gave him the benefit of the doubt when he took office, but their evaluations of him quickly started to sink. Among Americans ages 18-29, his job approval rating has fallen from a high of 55% just after he was inaugurated to 28% now. That means that half of his former approvers now disapprove. In percentage-point terms, the size of that drop is more than double what we've seen in any other age group.",
      "Which young voters have dropped off?",
      "Among young people, it's the less partisan and politically engaged who have seen the steepest drops. For example, about half of independents under 30 approved of Mr. Trump in February, but that has dropped to about one in five now. The same is true of young people who didn't vote in the 2024 election. Party identifiers and '24 voters have fallen off, too, but not to the same extent.",
      "There are also differences by gender, with young men starting out more approving of Mr. Trump than young women were. Women's ratings of the president had already begun dipping by March, while it was not until April\u00a0\u2014 and the downturn in the U.S. stock market \u2014 that young men's ratings started to decline. Both have fallen steadily since then, but a faster drop among young men in the last few months has meant the gender gap in approval of Mr. Trump has shrunk. (See the bottom of this article for statistical details on estimating these smaller subgroups.)",
      "CBS News polling over the past few months offers several clues as to what young people are unhappy about these days.",
      "A majority now say Mr. Trump is doing different things than he promised during the 2024 campaign. That's a reversal in sentiment from early February, when seven in 10 said he's doing what he said he would. And it's young men who have been the most likely to flip on this question.",
      "On top of that, the administration is experiencing low points on several economic evaluations:",
      "The share of young people saying the economy is getting worse has risen to six in 10. And young Americans are less likely than older ones to see the job market as good.\u00a0Over time, young people have increasingly rated it as fairly or very bad.",
      "The share of young people saying the economy is getting worse has risen to six in 10. And young Americans are less likely than older ones to see the job market as good.\u00a0Over time, young people have increasingly rated it as fairly or very bad.",
      "Six in 10 also tell us that Mr. Trump's policies are making them worse off financially. That is the highest we've seen to date, and it represents a complete change from what young people expected when he was inaugurated. Back then, they were much more likely to say his policies would make them better off than worse off.",

That is the highest we've seen to date, and it represents a complete change from what young people expected when he was inaugurated. Back then, they were much more likely to say his policies would make them better off than worse off.",
      "And majorities feel the Trump administration is focusing too much on tariffs (72%), deportations (64%), and ending DEI programs (55%). These shares have all grown significantly over time. By contrast, seven in 10 say the administration isn't focusing enough on lowering prices, which was a key campaign issue.",

By contrast, seven in 10 say the administration isn't focusing enough on lowering prices, which was a key campaign issue.",
      "Looking back and ahead ...",
      "Instead of marking a permanent rightward shift, Mr. Trump's better-than-expected performance with young voters last year is beginning to look more like a temporary reaction. Indeed, less partisan voters tend to be more responsive to short-term forces, like the economic conditions that drove many to the ballot box in 2024. And when Trump was inaugurated, many young people hoped he would turn the economy around, with his initial ratings likely reflecting some optimism. This honeymoon period quickly faded. His 18-29 rating is now below Joe Biden's when he left office.",
      "Looking ahead to 2026, Republicans' electoral success may depend on both the president's numbers and youth turnout. If views of Mr. Trump's job handling don't improve over the next year, they could be a drag on GOP congressional candidates. And while young voters are less likely to turn out in non-presidential years, both the 2018 and 2022 midterms saw record numbers go to the polls, including voters under 30. In fact, in 2022, young voters turned out at a rate that came close to saving the Democrats' majority. In a tight contest, they could be pivotal again.",
      "Estimating small subgroups in polls",
      "To more precisely estimate trends in approval among young people, I aggregated our polls and ran a statistical model that controls for respondents' race, education level, 2024 vote, and survey date.",
      "Why take this approach? All polls have a margin of error, and the margin of error is greater for subgroups within the poll, as a function of sample size and routine weighting. So, even though young people are represented proportionate to their share of the population, estimating what percentage of them approve of the president naturally comes with a higher margin of error. It's driven by random variation in which types of young people respond to a given poll, and margins of error grow as you slice data more thinly \u2014 for instance, in disaggregating young people by gender.",
      "Since a single poll can only do so much, we can combine data across polls to boost sample sizes and gain confidence in our estimates. Aggregating surveys yields sample sizes of over 1,200 men and 1,300 women under 30 to analyze. And the model smoothens out poll-to-poll randomness within these subgroups.",
      "The modeled estimates for any given time point are consistently within range of the unmodeled survey data, typically within a few points. And importantly, they tell the same story: both young men and young women's views of Trump have worsened, and the gender gap has decreased.",

    "summary": "Union Pacific is seeking to buy Norfolk Southern in a $85 billion deal that would create the first transcontinental railroad in the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "Union Pacific wants to buy Norfolk Southern in a $85 billion deal that would create the first transcontinental railroad in the U.S, and potentially trigger a final wave of rail mergers across the country.",
      "The proposed merger, announced Tuesday, would marry Union Pacific's vast rail network in the West with Norfolk's rails that snake across 22 Eastern states, and the District of Columbia.",
      "The nation was first linked by rail in 1869, when a golden railroad spike was driven in Utah to symbolize the connection of East and West Coasts. Yet no single entity has controlled that coast-to-coast passage.",
      "The railroads argue a merger would streamline deliveries of raw materials and goods nationwide by eliminating delays when shipments are handed off between railroads. The AP first reported the merger talks earlier this month a week before the railroads confirmed the discussions last week.",
      "Any deal would be closely scrutinized by antitrust regulators that have set a very high bar for railroad deals after previous consolidation in the industry led to massive backups and snarled traffic.",
      "Pressure on remaining railroads",
      "If the deal is approved, the two remaining major American railroads \u2014 BNSF and CSX \u2014 will face tremendous pressure to merge to create a second transcontinental railroad so they can compete. The continent's two other major railroads \u2014 Canadian National and CPKC \u2014 may also get involved. The Canadian rails span all of that nation and feed into America. CPKC rails stretch south into Mexico",
      "Some big shippers like chemical plants in the Gulf may be wary of the deal due to fears of a monopoly that could would wield immense influence over rates, but other major rail customers, like Amazon and UPS, may be in favor if it means packages will arrive more quickly and reliably. Those big companies, along with unions and communities across the country that the railroads cross, will have a chance to weigh before the U.S. Surface Transportation Board.",
      "Consumers could benefit if the transcontinental rail does reduce shipping rates and delivery times. Union Pacific said that combined, the railroads would improve delivery times.",
      "There's speculation that this deal might win approval under the pro-business Trump administration, but the STB is currently evenly split between two Republicans and two Democrats. The board is led by a Republican, and Trump will appoint a fifth member before this deal will be considered.",
      "Union Pacific is offering $20 billion cash and one share of its stock to complete the deal. Norfolk Southern shareholders would receive one UP share and $88.82 in cash for each one of their shares as part of the deal that values NS at roughly $320 per share. Norfolk Southern closed at just over $260 a share earlier this month before the first reports speculating about a deal.",
      "Union Pacific's stock fell nearly 2% to $224.98 in premarket trading, while Norfolk Southern's stock dipped more than 3% to $277.40.",
      "Union Pacific CEO Jim Vena, who has championed a merger, said lumber from the Pacific Northwest and plastics produced on the Gulf Coast and steel made in Pittsburgh will all reach their destinations more seamlessly.",
      "\"It builds upon President Abraham Lincoln's vision of a transcontinental railroad from nearly 165 years ago, and will usher in a new era of American innovation,\" Vena told investors Tuesday.",
      "From 30 to 6",
      "U.S. railroads have already undergone extensive consolidation. There were more than 30 major freight railroads in the early 1980s. Today, six major railroads handle the majority of shipments nationwide.",
      "Western rival BNSF, owned by Berkshire Hathaway, has the war chest to pursue an acquisition of CSX, to the east, if it chooses. CEO Warren Buffett is sitting on more than $348 billion cash and the consummate dealmaker may want to swing for the fences one last time before stepping down as planned at the end of the year.",
      "Buffett recently threw cold water on reports that he had enlisted Goldman Sachs to advise him on a potential rail deal in an interview with CNBC, but he rarely uses investment bankers anyway. Buffett reached an agreement to buy the parts of the BNSF railroad he didn't already own for $26.3 billion after a private meeting with its CEO more than a decade ago.",
      "Yet there's widespread debate over whether a major rail merger would be approved by the Surface Transportation Board, which has established a high bar for consolidation in the crucial rail industry.",
      "That's largely due to the aftermath of a consolidation in the U.S nearly 30 years ago that involved Union Pacific. It merged with Southern Pacific in 1996 and the tie-up led to an extended period of snarled traffic on U.S. rails. Three years later, Conrail was divvied up by Norfolk Southern and CSX, which led to more backups in the East.",
      "\"We're committed to making sure that doesn't happen in this case,\" said Norfolk CEO Mark George. He added that the railroads will spend the next two years planning for a smooth integration before this deal might get approved.",
      "Just two years ago, the STB approved the first major rail merger in more than two decades. In that deal, which was supported by big shippers, Canadian Pacific acquired Kansas City Southern for $31 billion to create the CPKC railroad.",
      "There were compelling factors in that deal, however, that combined the two smallest major freight railroads. The combined railroad, regulators reasoned, would benefit trade across North America. The deal announced Tuesday would merge the nation's largest freight railroad, with the smallest.",
      "Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern said they expect to submit their application for approval within the next six months and hope the deal would get approved by early 2027. They predict that they would be able to eliminate $1 billion in costs annually, but Vena said that every union worker at both railroads should still have a job. The railroads also predict they would be able to boost revenue by at least $1.75 billion each year by winning more business from trucking companies and other railroads.",
      "On Tuesday, Norfolk Southern reported a $768 million second-quarter profit, or $3.41 per share, as volume grew 3%. That's up from $737 million, or $3.25 per share, a year ago, but the results were affected by insurance payments from its 2023 East Palestine derailment and restructuring costs.",
      "Without the one-time factors, Norfolk Southern made $3.29 per share, which was just below the $3.31 per share that analysts surveyed by FactSet Research predicted.",

    "summary": "Automaker warns of massive hits to earnings from President Trump's tariffs, as it take steps to build more vehicles in U.S.",
    "story": [
      "Stellantis on Tuesday said that President Trump's tariffs will cost the auto manufacturer 1.5 billion euros, or about $1.7 billion, in 2025.",
      "The parent company of brands like Chrysler, Fiat, Jeep and Peugeot announced the projected earnings hit as Mr. Trump clinches deals with U.S. trade partners that include steep tariffs on U.S. imports. Stellantis expects most of the earnings decline to materialize in the second half of 2025.",
      "\"Stellantis updates its estimate of 2025 net tariff impact to approximately \u20ac1.5 billion, of which \u20ac0.3 billion was incurred in H1 2025. The Company remains highly engaged with relevant policymakers, while continuing long-term scenario planning,\" the company said in a statement Tuesday as it reported financial results for the first half of 2025.",
      "The automaker acknowledged that Mr. Trump's 25% tariffs on imports of autos and auto parts to the U.S. are hurting its business, particularly in North America. Stellantis builds its Chrysler, Dodge and Jeep brand vehicles in factories in Canada and Mexico, meaning they're subject to the new levies.",
      "While Mr. Trump's deal with the EU, calling for 15% tariffs across the board will make BMW and Mercedes-Benz vehicles more expensive for U.S. consumers, according to analysts. Stellantis is largely unaffected by the EU agreement.",
      "\"Stellantis isn't much affected by the EU/US tariff news \u2014 the question for STLA is if the Detroit-3 will want to renegotiate the [U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA)] tariff after the EU and Japan got a better deal,\" UBS analysts said in a research note.",
      "Other automobile manufacturers, including General Motors, have been bracing for impact from tariffs. GM CEO Mary Barra said the company took a $1.1 billion hit from tariffs in the second quarter, and that the company is taking steps to reduce its tariff exposure by investing in U.S. assembly plants.",
      "European automaker Volkswagen also said last week that tariffs cost the company $1.5 billion in the first half of 2025.",

    "summary": "Trump says he's \"very disappointed\" with Vladimir Putin, and he's shortening the deadline for the Russian leader to agree a ceasefire with Ukraine.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump announced Monday a significant tightening of his deadline for Russia's Vladimir Putin to agree to a ceasefire with Ukraine. He said as he met with U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer during his visit to Scotland that the 50-day deadline he announced earlier this month would be reduced to less than two weeks, citing a lack of progress in negotiations.",
      "Mr. Trump said as he headed in for his meeting with Starmer that he was \"very disappointed\" in Russia's leader over the ongoing bombing of Ukrainian cities, and that the deadline he gave Russia a couple weeks ago to agree to a truce would be reduced.",
      "Mr. Trump said earlier this month that if Russia failed to agree to a ceasefire within the 50-day timeframe, the U.S. would impose secondary tariffs of up to 100% on goods sold by countries that continue to do business with Russia. That would have meant a deal agreed by around the end of August.",
      "But Mr. Trump told reporters on Monday, as he sat down with Starmer, that he was \"going to make a new deadline of about 10 or 12 days from today.\"",
      "\"There's no reason in waiting,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We just don't see any progress being made.\"",
      "\"I've spoken to President Putin a lot, I've gotten along with him very well,\" Mr. Trump said earlier, before sitting down with Starmer.",
      "But he lamented that the Russian leader, \"goes out and starts launching rockets into some city, like Kyiv, and kills a lot of people in a nursing home or whatever, you have bodies lying all over the street.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said he was \"very disappointed in Putin,\" adding: \"I'm going to reduce that 50 days that I gave him to a lesser number, because I think I already know the answer what's going to happen.\"",
      "Russia rejected the deadline when the White House first announced it, calling it \"unacceptable.\"",
      "\"I'm not so interested in talking anymore,\" Mr. Trump said of Putin, explaining that he and Putin will have a nice conversation, and then the following day, the Russians killed more Ukrainians.",
      "Seated alongside Starmer, Mr. Trump also addressed the situation in Gaza, saying the U.S. will be providing food to the people of Gaza and working to eliminate barriers to humanitarian aid.",
      "\"Some of those kids are, that's real starvation stuff,\" Mr. Trump said Monday. \"I see it. And you can't fake that. So we're going to be even more involved.\"",
      "While ostensibly a private trip, marked by multiple rounds of golf on his own luxury courses in Scotland, Mr. Trump has also done business \u2013 including nailing down a long-sought-after\u00a0U.S.-European Union trade agreement.",
      "After meeting for just over one hour with EU leader Ursula von der Leyen on Sunday, Mr. Trump emerged to say, \"We have good news. We've reached a deal.\"",
      "When considered as a combined economy, the EU bloc is the second largest in the world behind the U.S. Including goods and services, U.S.-EU trade is worth about $2 trillion per year.",
      "\"I think it's great that we made a deal today, instead of playing games,\" Mr. Trump said of the framework trade agreement. \"I think it's the biggest deal ever made.\"",
      "\"It's a big deal, it's a huge deal,\" agreed Von der Leyen. \"It will bring stability. It will bring predictability.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's meeting with Starmer is also touching on trade, though the U.S. and the U.K. already\u00a0agreed on a framework trade deal\u00a0last month. Starmer has made it clear he wants to keep pushing Mr. Trump to further ease tariffs on British steel and other imports as the details of the agreement are hashed out.",
      "Mr. Trump said his meeting with Starmer would provide a chance to celebrate the U.S.-U.K. agreement, along with the new EU deal.",
      "Most EU member nations' governments voiced support for that agreement on Monday, though some of them unenthusiastically \u2013 and the French Prime Minister even took a jab at the bloc, accusing it of \"submission\" to Mr. Trump.",
      "Mr. Trump said the tariff rate for the EU's 27 member countries would be 15% for most imports, including vehicles. The EU, meanwhile, agreed to purchase U.S. military hardware, $750 billion of American energy, and to increase its collective investment in the U.S. by $600 billion.",
      "There was good news for U.S. companies that sell products into the EU market, too, as Mr. Trump announced that all 27 EU nations \"will be opened up to trade with the United States at zero tariff.\"",
      "The agreement was made at Mr. Trump's luxury golf resort in Turnberry, on the Scottish coast, where the president spent the weekend teeing off.",
      "The deal avoids a trans-Atlantic trade war that could have unfolded on Friday, when Mr. Trump had threatened to impose a blanket 30% tariff on all goods imported from the EU, which had vowed to retaliate.",
      "That deadline remains in place for countries that have yet to make a deal with the U.S., including Mexico, Canada, and most consequentially, China. On Monday, Mr. Trump said tariffs for countries that don't reach a deal with the U.S. will be \"somewhere in the 15% to 20% range,\" which differs from the 15% to 50% range he floated last week.",
      "Trade talks between Beijing and Washington were taking place Monday in Stockholm, and U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in interviews over the weekend that the Aug. 1 deadline for deals to be reached wasn't flexible.",
      "\"No extensions, no more grace periods. August 1, the tariffs are set. They'll go into place. Customs will start collecting the money, and off we go,\" Lutnick said.",

      "The new normal for U.S. tariffs on foreign goods starts at 15%. Even as President Trump seeks to forge new terms of trade\u00a0with Japan, the European Union and other global economic partners, he is raising the floor for tariffs to their highest level in decades.",
      "Speaking\u00a0at an AI summit on Wednesday, Mr. Trump said \"we'll have a straight, simple tariff of anywhere between 15% and 50%,\" conditioning the lower rate on countries opening their economies to the U.S.",
      "The White House has said sharply higher tariffs could take effect on dozens of countries as soon as Aug. 1 unless they ink new trade deals. The Trump administration has a separate negotiating timeline with China, which faces an Aug. 12 deadline for an agreement.",
      "As these new rules of international commerce take shape, companies across a range of industries are emphasizing that higher tariffs translate into higher operational costs \u2014 and higher prices for consumers.",

The same day, Italian fashion brand Moncler said it has already hiked prices for its apparel to offset additional tariff-related costs. And General Electric said this week that proposed U.S. tariffs, should they take effect, would cost the company around $500 million in 2025, noting that it would move to offset those taxes through \"cost controls and pricing actions.\"",

      "\"The administration has consistently maintained that the cost of tariffs will be borne by foreign exporters who rely on access to the American economy, the world's biggest and best consumer market,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai told CBS MoneyWatch in a statement.",

      "\"Up to now there has been only limited passthrough from tariffs into final consumer prices, but we still expect the impact to gradually mount in the second half of this year,\" Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist with Capital Economics, told investors in a research note. \"Now that the Trump administration is concluding deals that would see the tariff rate facing most trading partners settling at between 15% and 20%, with even higher rates levied on Chinese imports, we suspect retailers will be forced to finally raise the prices paid by consumers.\"",
      "Inflation in the early part of 2025 remained fairly contained. That's because many companies and consumers accelerated their purchases of imported goods to avoid the risk of paying more if, or when, steep new tariffs take effect.",
      "Meanwhile, in the short-term, sharply higher prices are unlikely across the board, according to trade experts.",
      "\"When you open up the hood of that, it's not going to be even across all categories of spending,\" Ernie Tedeschi, director of economics at the Budget Lab at Yale, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It's categories of spending where we import more that are going to be more sensitive to tariffs.\"",

The nation's deficit could rise by $3.4 trillion over the next 10 years because of the impact of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the Bipartisan Policy Center\u00a0said, citing estimates from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation.",
      "Mr. Trump added that the rebate could be \"for people of a certain income level,\" although he didn't specify the threshold that he's considering.",
      "The federal government has collected about $100 billion in tariff revenue since the Trump administration instituted its higher import duties earlier this year, which could increase to $300 billion per year, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox Business' \"Mornings with Maria\" on Tuesday.",
      "Tariffs vary from country to country, but they're paid by U.S. importers, such as Walmart, or manufacturers that import materials and components from other countries, like Ford Motor. So far, some companies have been\u00a0swallowing the higher costs\u00a0rather than passing them on to consumers, although the\u00a0latest inflation report\u00a0signaled that higher tariff rates may be edging into consumer prices.",
      "Rebate checks have been floated by Mr. Trump previously, with the president saying in February he was considering using 20% of the savings from Elon Musk's cost-cutting task force, the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, to provide direct payments to taxpayers. During the pandemic, taxpayers received three rebate checks \u2014 two under the first Trump administration, and the third under the Biden administration \u2014 aimed at offsetting the economic impact of the crisis.",
      "Typically, such rebates are issued through the tax code, which would require Congress to pass new tax legislation authorizing the Treasury Department to issue checks.",
      "Lawmakers earlier this month passed a massive tax and spending bill that was signed into law by Mr. Trump on July 4, which authorizes some new tax breaks, but doesn't include a rebate based on tariffs.",
      "Some of the bill's new tax cuts are limited to low- and middle-income taxpayers. For instance, its new $6,000 deduction for senior citizens phases out for single taxpayers with incomes over $75,000 and married filers with earnings over $150,000.",

    "summary": "Top Texas Democrats are sounding the alarm over a GOP plan \u2014 endorsed by President Trump \u2014 to redraw Texas' congressional maps.",
    "story": [
      "Top Texas Democrats are sounding the alarm over a GOP plan to redraw Texas' congressional maps, warning in interviews with CBS News it would dramatically dilute minority representation in the Lone Star State and set off a nationwide ripple effect.",
      "Republican state lawmakers unveiled a draft congressional map on Wednesday that would turn five U.S. House districts currently held by Democrats into GOP-leaning seats \u2014 an idea blessed by President Trump as Republicans angle to hold onto their narrow congressional majority in next year's midterms.",
      "One Democratic member of Congress whose district could be impacted called the proposed map \"grossly unfair,\" arguing Black and Latino communities are being \"scrambled\" and intentionally fractured for political gain.",
      "\"They've already gerrymandered the map \u2014 and now they're trying to make it 30 to 8 in favor of Republicans,\" the lawmaker told CBS News, referencing the state's congressional delegation. \"This is grossly unfair and starts a dangerous domino effect. If Texas lights the fire, it will spread to other states like California and New York. It's going to be a mess across the country.\"",
      "The Democratic representative also argued that Texas Republicans are banking on maintaining the historic margins they saw among Hispanic voters in November's election, but warned that recent polling shows a softening in GOP support among Latino voters \u2014 particularly in the wake of backlash over the Trump administration's deportation policies.",
      "Those voters \"may not be there,\" the lawmaker said, cautioning the strategy could backfire and jeopardize Republican gains.",
      "Another top Democrat who has previously run statewide in Texas echoed the concern, calling the proposal \"deeply undemocratic.\"",
      "\"We're seeing losses of representation for people of color in Texas,\" the Democrat said. \"Five of the affected districts are Latino-majority seats. They're not just stacking the deck \u2014 they're doing it without any expectation of being held accountable. But they will be held accountable.\"",
      "New congressional map could expand GOP's House edge",
      "Mr. Trump has publicly encouraged Texas Republicans to reshape the state's congressional districts, predicting to reporters earlier this month a \"simple redrawing\" could net five extra seats for his party. The GOP currently controls 25 of Texas' 38 House districts, which were last redrawn after the 2020 Census.",
      "House Republicans are defending a razor-thin seven-seat majority in next year's congressional elections \u2014 a challenging task since the party that controls the White House almost always loses upwards of a dozen seats in the midterms.",
      "Texas' Republican Gov. Greg Abbott called the state legislature into a special session, and on Wednesday, lawmakers released an early draft map \u2014 though changes could be made. It will need to pass the GOP-controlled state House and Senate.",
      "The map would improve the GOP's edge by tilting two Democratic seats in the Rio Grande Valley to the right, making a pair of districts in the Dallas and Houston area redder and merging two Democratic seats near Austin into one.",
      "For example, Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar \u2014 who already represents a district won by Mr. Trump in 2024 \u2014 would lose parts of the San Antonio suburbs under the new map. And the Dallas-area district held by Democratic Rep. Julie Johnson would be redrawn to stretch more than 100 miles from Dallas County to deep-red parts of rural North Texas.",
      "Texas Republicans have pledged to ensure the redistricting plans are constitutional. Abbott has argued the maps need to be redrawn due to \"constitutional concerns\" raised by the Justice Department. CBS News has reached out to the Texas GOP for comment.",
      "But Democrats have blasted the map, which Democratic National Committee chair Ken Martin called a \"blatant gerrymander\" and a \"likely violation of the Voting Rights Act.\" Rep. Greg Casar \u2014 whose Austin-area district would be merged with that of fellow Democratic Rep. Lloyd Doggett \u2014 called the move \"illegal voter suppression of Black and Latino Central Texans.\"",
      "The governors of some Democratic states, including California and New York, have floated launching their own mid-decade redistricting processes, with an eye to creating more blue seats. But those plans could require constitutional amendments since, unlike Texas, those two states have put independent commissions in charge of redistricting.",
      "Johnson \u2014 whose Texas district is set to be redrawn \u2014 says other states should redraw their maps in response.",
      "\"This is an all-out war,\" she told CBS News senior White House correspondent Ed O'Keefe. \"I am for fair and independent redistricting across the country, so long as we all do it. But if we're going to do partisan gerrymandering, then game on, we all should.\"",
      "Meanwhile, some experts have suggested Texas' plan to create five extra GOP-leaning districts could make some of those newfound red seats more competitive, by distributing Republican voters across more districts.",
      "The state has also undergone significant demographic changes in recent elections. The fast-growing Dallas and Houston suburbs have shifted toward Democrats, but the once reliably blue Rio Grande Valley has become redder with more Hispanic voters supporting Republican candidates. Those shifts could complicate efforts to rearrange the congressional map.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Ghislaine Maxwell, who was convicted of aiding sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, is willing to provide information to a congressional committee next month during a deposition but only if she is granted immunity or is pardoned, according to a letter from her attorney obtained by CBS News.",
      "Last week, the GOP-led House Oversight Committee subpoenaed Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence, to sit for a deposition as fallout over the Trump administration's handling of the case continues to intensify. A deposition was scheduled for Aug. 11 at a federal prison in Tallahassee, where Maxwell is serving her sentence.",
      "However, in a letter Tuesday addressed to House Oversight chairman Rep. James Comer, Maxwell's attorney David Markus said she is willing to sit before the committee but only after certain legal appeals are finalized or his client is granted clemency or a pardon by President Trump.",
      "\"Public reports \u2014 including your own statements \u2014 indicate that the Committee intends to question Ms. Maxwell in prison and without a grant of immunity. Those are non-starters. Ms. Maxwell cannot risk further criminal exposure in a politically charged environment without formal immunity,\" Markus wrote.",
      "Markus wrote that any questions to Maxwell would have to be given to her in advance to \"ensure accuracy and fairness,\" and that conducting the deposition in prison would create \"security risks and undermines the integrity of the process.\"",
      "Maxwell was convicted in 2021 for her role in helping Epstein recruit, groom and abuse underage girls. She is serving a 20-year prison sentence. Epstein died in federal custody in 2019 as he faced sex trafficking charges. His death was ruled a suicide.",
      "Markus wrote that because Maxwell's ongoing appeal to the Supreme Court to overturn her conviction and other legal issues are currently pending, \"any testimony she provides now could compromise her constitutional rights, prejudice her legal claims, and potentially taint a future jury pool.\"",
      "However, Markus wrote, if President Trump were to pardon Maxwell or commute her sentence, \"she would be willing\u2014and eager\u2014to testify openly and honestly, in public, before Congress in Washington, D.C.\"",
      "If those conditions are not agreed to, Markus wrote, Maxwell \"will have no choice but to invoke her Fifth Amendment rights.\"",
      "A spokesperson for the House Oversight Committee said in a statement that the committee will respond to Markus' letter \"soon,\" but said it \"will not consider granting congressional immunity for her testimony.\"",
      "In a letter to Maxwell informing her of the subpoena, Comer wrote that the committee is seeking Maxwell's testimony \"to inform the consideration of potential legislative solutions to improve federal efforts to combat sex trafficking and reform the use of non-prosecution agreements and/or plea agreements in sex-crime investigations.\"",
      "Todd Blanche, the second highest-ranking Justice Department official, met with Maxwell in Tallahassee on July 24 and 25\u00a0 to discuss Epstein.",
      "After the questioning had ended, Markus declined to comment \"on the substance\" of the meeting, but told reporters outside the office that \"there were a lot of questions and we went all day.\"",
      "Neither President Trump nor Markus have ruled out the possibility of a pardon for Maxwell, but on Monday Mr. Trump said he is \"allowed\" to pardon Maxwell but that nobody has asked him to issue one, yet.",
      "Virginia Giuffre's relatives say Maxwell should \"rot in prison\"",
      "Several family members of Virginia Giuffre \u2014 one of the most prominent people to accuse Epstein and Maxwell of abuse \u2014 said in a statement Wednesday that the government should \"never consider giving Ghislaine Maxwell any leniency,\" calling her a \"monster who deserves to rot in prison for the rest of her life.\"",
      "\"Maxwell destroyed many young lives, and she was convicted for only a fraction of the crimes she actually committed. She must remain in prison \u2013 anything less would go down in history as being one of the highest travesties of justice,\" read the statement, which was penned by two of Giuffre's siblings and their spouses.",
      "The relatives also criticized the decision to meet with Maxwell.",
      "\"If our sister could speak today, she would be most angered by the fact that the government is listening to a known perjurer. A woman who repeatedly lied under oath and will continue to do so as long as it benefits her position,\" they wrote.",
      "Giuffre\u00a0died by suicide earlier this year.",
      "Federal prosecutors charged Maxwell with perjury as part of her 2020 sexual abuse case, accusing her of lying in a deposition for a civil lawsuit. Those charges were separated out of the main case.",
      "Mr. Trump said last week\u00a0that he \"hasn't thought about\" pardoning Maxwell.",
      "\"No leniency is being given or discussed. That's just false. The President himself has said that clemency for Maxwell is not something he is even thinking about at this time,\" a senior administration official said.",
      "Trump says Epstein \"stole\" employees from him \u2014 possibly including Virginia Giuffre",
      "Separately, Mr. Trump told reporters Tuesday he cut ties with Epstein in the early 2000s because the financier \"stole\" employees from his business \u2014 reiterating his comments from a day earlier.",
      "The president said the workers in question were young women who worked in the spa at Mar-A-Lago. Asked whether Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre was one of the employees, Mr. Trump said, \"I think that was one of the people.\"",
      "Giuffre has alleged in civil court\u00a0that she was a 16-year-old employee at Mar-A-Lago when Maxwell first met her and \"recruited\" her \"into Epstein's sex trafficking activities.\" Giuffre was among the most prominent people to accuse Epstein of sexual abuse. Mr. Trump noted Tuesday that Giuffre \"had no complaints about us.\"",
      "Mr. Trump was friends with Epstein for years before their relationship ended in the 2000s. In the past, the White House has said the president \"kicked [Epstein] out of his club for being a creep.\" Asked Tuesday about whether Epstein was cut off for being a \"creep\" or for stealing employees, Mr. Trump said, \"maybe they're the same thing.\"",
      "\"He took people. And because he took people, I said, 'Don't do it anymore, you know, they work for me,'\" Mr. Trump said Tuesday, while flying back to the U.S. on Air Force One after a trip to Scotland. \"Beyond that, he took some others. And once he did that, that was the end of him.\"",
      "Giuffre's family members called Mr. Trump's comments \"shocking.\"",
      "\"We would like to clarify that it was convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell who targeted and preyed upon our then 16-year-old sister, Virginia, from Mar-a-Lago, where she was working in 2000, several years before Epstein and President Trump had their falling out,\" they wrote.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement: \"President Trump was directly responding to a question posed by a reporter about Ms. [Giuffre] - he did not bring her up. The fact remains that President Trump kicked Jeffrey Epstein out of his club for being a creep to his female employees.\"",

Since Harris' defeat in her truncated 2024 presidential run, which followed then-President Joe Biden's decision to drop his reelection bid, the Democratic Party has wondered what Harris' next political move will be. In May, sources familiar with Harris' thinking said she was weighing a campaign to be California's chief executive, a third run for the White House or not seeking elected office.",
      "A source close to Vice President Kamala Harris told CBS News that while Harris \"seriously considered\" a run for California governor in 2026, she ultimately decided against it \u2014 concluding she can have more impact for her party on a national stage and that her \"heart wasn't into running for governor\".",
      "\"She grappled with it,\" the source said about a possible gubernatorial bid. \"There were a lot of conversations over the last few months. But she's been a public servant for her whole career.\" The source said she wants to take time to experience life as a private citizen.",

    "story": [
      "A dozen Democratic members of Congress sued the Trump administration on Wednesday over its effort to limit their access to detention centers housing immigrants suspected of being in the U.S. illegally, accusing the White House of inhibiting lawmakers' oversight responsibilities.",
      "The lawsuit alleged the Trump administration had blocked attempts by Democratic lawmakers in states throughout the U.S. to enter Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention centers and sought to delay plans to visit and inspect such facilities.",
      "The lawmakers argued in their complaint that the actions by the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, violate a provision of federal law that guarantees members of Congress access to facilities holding those awaiting deportation.",
      "\"These illegal actions have harmed each Plaintiff's right as an individual member of Congress to conduct oversight and obtain information about DHS facilities and the conditions of immigration detention,\" the lawmakers said in their lawsuit, which was filed by lawyers from the groups Democracy Forward and American Oversight.",
      "The complaint asked the federal district court in Washington, D.C., to require DHS to give members of Congress unfettered access to ICE holding facilities \u2014 even during unannounced visits \u2014 for the purposes of conducting congressional oversight.",
      "Democratic lawmakers have sparred with the Trump administration for months over access to ICE facilities. One May\u00a0clash with ICE officials\u00a0at a Newark detention center led the Justice Department to charge Rep. LaMonica McIver of New Jersey with assaulting law enforcement officers. She has\u00a0pleaded not guilty. Six Maryland Democrats said they were\u00a0denied access to an ICE facility in Baltimore\u00a0earlier this week, and Rep. Jason Crow of Colorado\u00a0said he couldn't get into a facility\u00a0in a Denver suburb last week.",
      "The complaint noted that appropriations law dating back to 2019 says DHS cannot use funds allocated by Congress to \"prevent\" members of Congress from entering detention facilities housing immigration detainees for the purposes of oversight. The Fiscal Year 2024 Appropriations Act also included a provision that states DHS should not require members of Congress to \"provide prior notice of the intent\" to inspect such facilities.",
      "But DHS assistant secretary for public affairs Tricia McLaughlin said the department is now requiring lawmakers to give a week of prior notice before any oversight visit to an ICE detention facility, citing President Trump's constitutional powers to oversee the executive branch. She said requests to shorten that time must be approved by DHS Secretary Kristi Noem.",
      "\"As for visits to detention facilities, requests should be made with sufficient time to prevent interference with the President's Article II authority to oversee executive department functions \u2014 a week is sufficient to ensure no intrusion on the President's constitutional authority,\" McLaughlin said.",
      "DHS has also taken the position that lawmakers don't automatically have access to visit ICE field offices and other short-term processing facilities, since they are not long-term detention centers. Some ICE field offices, however, have been used as makeshift detention centers recently, with holding facilities in New York and other cities housing detainees for days.",
      "Citing an increase in threats and attacks against ICE officers, McLaughlin said any visits by lawmakers to ICE field officers or processing sites that are not detention centers would need to be approved by Noem.",
      "McLaughlin said the members of Congress who sued the administration Wednesday \"could have just scheduled a tour.\" Instead, she said, \"they're running to court to drive clicks and fundraising emails.\"",
      "The dozen Democrats who joined the lawsuit were Reps. Joe Neguse and Jason Crow of Colorado; Adriano Espaillat and Dan Goldman of New York; Bennie Thompson of Mississippi; Jamie Raskin of Maryland; Veronica Escobar of Texas; and Robert Garcia, Luis Correa, Jimmy Gomez, Raul Ruiz and Norma Torres of California.",
      "Wednesday's lawsuit comes as the Trump administration escalates its aggressive crackdown on illegal immigration. In recent weeks, ICE has transferred a record number of detainees to its sprawling detention system. As of this week, the agency was holding 57,000 individuals facing deportation, according to internal government data.",
      "As the number of those in ICE custody has ballooned since the start of the year, some detainees have reported unsanitary and substandard conditions in facilities across the country. A recently released video showed detainees lying on the floor at an ICE holding facility in New York in what advocates called \"inhumane\" conditions. The Trump administration has categorically denied all claims of subpar conditions at ICE facilities.",

    "story": [
      "Former NBA star Gilbert Arenas and five other defendants, including a suspected high-level member of an Israeli transnational organized crime group, were arrested Wednesday for allegedly operating an illegal gambling and poker ring out of a California home that Arenas owned, according to unsealed court documents.",
      "According to an indictment that was filed on July 15, federal prosecutors in the Central District of California allege that between September 2021 and July 2022, Arenas allegedly rented out a mansion in the Encino neighborhood of Los Angeles so he and his co-conspirators could run illegal high-stakes poker games out of the house.",
      "Prosecutors allege that Arenas ordered one of the co-defendants to stage the mansion to host the poker games and collect rent, while another co-conspirator Yevgeni Gershman, a suspected Israeli organized crime member, hired women, who allegedly in exchange for tips, served drinks, provided massages, and \"offered companionship\" to the poker players.",
      "Arenas, nicknamed \"Agent Zero\" from his playing days as an all-star guard in the NBA, was charged with one count of conspiracy to operate an illegal gambling business, one count of operating an illegal gambling business, and one count of making false statements to investigators.",
      "Arenas pleaded not guilty Wednesday in United States District Court in Los Angeles and was released on $50,000 bond, the U.S. Attorney's Office in Los Angeles said. His trial is scheduled for Sept. 23.",
      "Arenas' successes on the court, including being a three-time All-NBA team player and making three NBA All-Star game appearances as a member of the Washington Wizards, were overshadowed by his off-the-court issues, including multiple incidents involving firearms.",
      "In January 2010, Arenas was charged with felony gun possession in Washington, D.C. after allegedly getting into a card-game dispute with a former teammate in December 2009, which resulted in both men drawing guns on each other in the Wizards locker room.",
      "As a result of the incident, D.C. prosecutors charged Arenas with one count of carrying a pistol without a license, which Arenas pleaded guilty. He was sentenced to two years' probation and 30 days of time in a halfway house and was suspended by the NBA during the investigation. Arenas, now 43, played his last NBA game in 2012.",
      "Since leaving the NBA, he has hosted a range of daily sports shows and podcasts.",
      "Arenas' five co-conspirators were charged with conspiracy to operate an illegal gambling business and one count of operating an illegal gambling business.",
      "Separately, Gershman, an Israeli citizen, was charged with three additional charges relating to immigration and marriage fraud.",

    "story": [
      "Brown University has cut a deal with the Trump administration to restore research grant funding to the school, in exchange for commitments on women's sports, antisemitism and admissions practices and a promise to donate $50 million to workforce development programs.",
      "The Rhode Island-based school is now the third Ivy League university to reach a deal with the administration, which has lashed out at a range of colleges. Columbia University agreed to pay the federal government a $200 million settlement earlier this month, and the University of Pennsylvania reached a deal with the government over transgender athletes.",
      "Brown announced the deal in a statement Wednesday and shared a copy of a nine-page agreement with the federal government. The Department of Education also confirmed in a statement that it had struck a deal with Brown.",
      "Under the terms of the three-year deal released by Brown, the federal government agreed to restore frozen Health and Human Services grants to the school and close pending federal non-discrimination investigations into the university.",
      "The school said Wednesday it has lost dozens of federal grants and hasn't been reimbursed for over $50 million in expenses related to National Institutes of Health grants \u2014 and that total is growing by over $3 million a week.",
      "In exchange for the end to the grant freeze, Brown agreed to pay $50 million to local workforce programs over the next decade. It also promised to provide female student-athletes with locker rooms \"strictly separated on the basis of sex,\" define male and female for athletic purposes in a way that's consistent with President Trump's executive orders and not offer gender-affirming medical care to minors.",
      "Brown also said it will not promote \"unlawful DEI goals,\" would commission a campus survey that asks about \u2014 among other things \u2014 issues of antisemitism and give the government access to admissions and discrimination complaint data. The school promised not to offer racial preferences in admissions \u2014 though the Supreme Court previously barred affirmative action policies in 2023.",
      "The agreement says Brown did not admit to wrongdoing and \"expressly denies liability regarding the United States' allegations,\" and specifies that the government does not have the \"authority to dictate Brown's curriculum or the content of academic speech.\"",
      "In a message to the school community, Brown President Christina Paxson also says Brown will not promise to make any direct payments to the government. She described it as a voluntary agreement.",
      "Paxson says Brown was under \"threat\" \u2014 Ed. Secretary assails \"woke\" policies",
      "In her message, Paxson argued that many parts of Wednesday's agreement line up with commitments Brown had already made to \"ensure compliance with federal laws prohibiting discrimination.\" She said the provisions on gender and sports are \"consistent with NCAA requirements and Brown's current policies,\" and the government is already entitled to ask for demographic data. She also noted that the agreement doesn't define the term \"unlawful DEI.\"",
      "But the university president noted that some parts of the deal stemmed from \"priorities of the federal administration in resolving the funding freeze.\" She said the school \"took great care to balance these interests with the core needs of the institution.\"",
      "Paxson said the deal \"preserves the integrity of Brown's academic foundation, and it enables us as a community to move forward after a period of considerable uncertainty.\" She wrote that the school's mission was \"under threat\" from financially painful grant cancellations and a \"growing push for government intrusion into the fundamental academic operations of colleges and universities.\"",
      "In a statement, Education Secretary Linda McMahon said the administration is \"successfully reversing the decades-long woke-capture of our nation's higher education institutions,\" and pointed to the agreement's measures on antisemitism and women's sports.",
      "\"Because of the Trump Administration's resolution agreement with Brown University, aspiring students will be judged solely on their merits, not their race or sex,\" she wrote.",
      "The White House called the deal a \"historic settlement with Brown University to restore fairness, merit, and safety in higher education.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 30 Jul 2025 18:23:47 -0400",
    "summary": "The Trump administration filed a complaint this week against Judge James Boasberg, an unusual move that follows tension over President Trump's deportation policies.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration filed a complaint Monday against Judge James Boasberg, an unusual move that follows clashes in court between the D.C.-based federal judge and the government over President Trump's deportation policies.",
      "It's rare for the Justice Department to formally accuse judges of misconduct. The move will kick off a long, complex review process \u2014 though some legal experts say the Trump administration could have a difficult time demonstrating that Boasberg violated judicial rules.",
      "Why did the Trump administration file a complaint against Boasberg?",
      "The complaint accuses Boasberg of \"making improper public comments\" about Mr. Trump, and criticizes the judge's rulings in a high-profile case involving Venezuelan migrants who were deported to El Salvador, according to a copy obtained by CBS News.",
      "Much of the complaint focuses on a March session of the Judicial Conference of the United States, a panel of federal judges led by Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts that weighs in on how the judicial branch is run.",
      "The Justice Department accused Boasberg of speaking up during one part of the biannual meeting to warn that the Trump administration could \"disregard rulings of federal courts,\" leading to a \"constitutional crisis.\"",
      "The source of those quotes is unclear, but they were first reported earlier this month by The Federalist, a conservative digital outlet that says it obtained a memo summarizing the meeting. CBS News has reached out to the Justice Department for further details.",
      "Those comments, the government argues, violated rules requiring judges to avoid publicly comment on cases and to \"act at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary.\"",
      "The complaint also takes issue with Boasberg's handling of Venezuelan migrants who were rapidly flown to a Salvadoran prison under the wartime Alien Enemies Act in mid-March, less than a week after the Judicial Conference meeting.",
      "Boasberg verbally ordered the government to return the migrants to the U.S., even if officials needed to \"turn the planes around,\" but the deportees were still sent to El Salvador. Since then, the judge has accused the administration of defying his orders, and has threatened to hold the government in contempt.",
      "The Justice Department argued Monday that Boasberg \"rushed the government through complex litigation, sometimes giving the Trump Administration less than 48 hours to respond.\"",
      "\"Judge \u202fBoasberg publicly forecasted his baseless predictions of presidential lawlessness, then issued erroneous rulings based on that preconceived notion,\" says the complaint, which was signed by Attorney General Pam Bondi's chief of staff, Chad Mizelle.",
      "In April, the Supreme Court halted a ruling by Boasberg blocking deportations under the Alien Enemies Act, deciding the lawsuit should have been brought in Texas, not Washington, D.C.",
      "Legal experts say Boasberg complaint is misdirected",
      "Several legal experts told CBS News the complaint could face a tough path.",
      "Federal law defines judicial misconduct as \"conduct prejudicial to the effective and expeditious administration of the business of the courts.\" That covers everything from harassment to making partisan statements and treating people in a \"demonstrably egregious and hostile manner.\"",
      "Several law professors say that the parts of Monday's complaint that focus on Boasberg's handling of the deportation case are misdirected.",
      "In general, if a party in a federal case has issues with how a judge has ruled, they're expected to file an appeal \u2014 not a complaint against a judge \u2014 said Jeffrey Bellin, a law professor at Vanderbilt University who has served as a judicial ethics investigator.",
      "\"You're not supposed to use the misconduct process to complain about the judge's behavior in the case that you're involved in,\" Bellin told CBS News.",
      "The parts of the complaint that criticize Boasberg for warning the Trump administration may defy court orders are less straightforward, says Charles Geyh, an Indiana University law professor.",
      "The government accused the Obama-appointed judge of violating a section of the code of conduct for federal judges that says they \"should not make public comment on the merits of a matter pending or impending in any court.\"",
      "Geyh said that in some circumstances, Boasberg's comments could be \"a potential problem.\"",
      "But he still doesn't believe Boasberg deserves disciplinary action. He said courts have been \"overwhelmed\" by Trump-era executive actions, \"many of which are of dubious constitutionality,\" and need to figure out how to preserve their legitimacy and ensure their rulings are followed.",
      "\"They need to talk about it somehow,\" said Geyh.",
      "Also, while public comments about cases aren't allowed, if Boasberg's remarks were made in a session of the normally private Judicial Conference, \"you could make a pretty good argument, I think, that that is something different,\" Geyh said.",
      "Laurie Levenson, a professor at Loyola Law School, said remarks at Judicial Conference meetings typically aren't meant for public consumption.",
      "She also argued Boasberg's alleged comments about the risk of the Trump administration skirting court orders are based on \"very real concerns.\"",
      "\"This is not a novel issue being raised by one particular judge about, 'what if the administration doesn't comply,'\" said Levenson.",
      "What happens next?",
      "It's a complicated process that can take months.",
      "When a complaint is filed, the first step is usually for the region's chief appellate court judge \u2014 in this case, Judge Sri Srinivasin of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit \u2014 to review the issue and decide how to proceed.",
      "In the vast majority of situations, the misconduct complaint is dismissed at that stage, Geyh said, noting that many complaints are from \"disgruntled litigants who don't like how their case went, and so they kvetch about what went on in their case.\"",
      "The appeals court judge can also privately take corrective action before the issue escalates. For example, they can encourage the judge to admit their mistake, said Geyh.",
      "If the appellate judge decides a complaint has merit, they can refer it to a special committee of judges to conduct an investigation and make recommendations. Then, the region's judicial council \u2014 yet another committee of judges \u2014 decides whether to punish them.",
      "\"The quickest thing is if they dismiss it,\" Bellin said. \"If they don't dismiss it \u2026 we won't hear about it for a while.\"",
      "How can judges be punished for misconduct?",
      "First off, district court judges can't be fired \u2014 unless they're impeached by the House and convicted by the Senate, which requires two-thirds of senators to vote in favor.",
      "\"It's very hard to discipline a sitting federal judge because they have life tenure,\" said Bellin.",
      "Short of that, a judge found to have engaged in misconduct can be publicly censured or reprimanded, or barred from taking on any new cases. The judicial conference can also choose to refer a judge to Congress for impeachment proceedings.",
      "How common are judicial misconduct complaints?",
      "They're not unheard of, though punishments are rare.",
      "Last year, Boston-based U.S. District Judge Michael Ponsor was the subject of a misconduct complaint after he criticized Supreme Court Justice Alito in a New York Times op-ed. An appellate judge didn't take further action because Ponsor apologized.",
      "Bellin said it's \"pretty common\" for parties in cases to file complaints about judges, but \"these are not usually done by people who are professional litigators.\" Instead, most attorneys just work their issues with judges into their appeals.",
      "It's especially unusual for the Justice Department to file complaints.",
      "\"You just don't have a history of the Justice Department having an acrimonious relationship with the judiciary,\" said Geyh. \"Historically, it's just a dumb thing to do. You want an amicable relationship with the judges who are going to be deciding your cases. You don't want to be suing them. You don't want to be filing complaints against them.\"",
      "Still, Mr. Trump has been more openly critical of judges than his predecessors.",
      "Besides Boasberg, the Trump administration filed a misconduct complaint in February against D.C. District Judge Ana Reyes, accusing her of \"hostile and egregious misconduct\" during a hearing. The D.C. appeals court has not addressed the complaint.",
      "The administration also sued every judge in Maryland over a standing order in that court district blocking the immediate deportation of migrants challenging their removal.",
      "Meanwhile, Mr. Trump and his staff have lashed out at judges who have ruled against the government. The president has called for Boasberg to be impeached.",
      "\"It strikes me as a bit of posturing, as an aggressive pushback by the administration against the federal judges,\" Levenson said of the complaint against Boasberg. \"I think it's a real uphill battle for the administration, but the mere filing of the complaint is sort of the shot across the bow.\"",
      "Jacob  Rosen\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

      "In an 8-7 vote, Hawley and Senate Democrats on the U.S. Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs voted the legislation out of committee, with all other Republicans on the committee voting against it. It's not yet clear if the legislation, which Hawley introduced, will receive a floor vote in the Republican-controlled Senate.",
      "\"I practice what I preach,\" Hawley said in an awkward exchange with fellow Republicans on the panel. \"I don't have individual stocks, I don't trade in stocks. I'm not a billionaire, unlike others on this committee. And what I think is, the American people are sending us a clear message.\"",
      "Republican Sen. Rick Scott, who was not born wealthy but is now worth hundreds of millions of dollars, according to his public filings, said he agrees lawmakers shouldn't be trading stocks. But he defended the ability for members of Congress to be rich, and called attacks on the wealthy \"disgusting.\"",
      "\"He made a reference to billionaires, okay?\" Scott said of Hawley. \"I don't know when in this country it became a negative to make money. But somehow, if you've made money, you're supposedly \u2014 I think Senator Hawley suggests \u2014 you shouldn't be serving, because you might trade stocks.\"",
      "\"Anybody want to be poor? I don't.\" Scott continued. \"Right? So this idea that we're going to attack people because they make money is wrong. Is absolutely wrong. We should cherish all of our different backgrounds. ... So, I think it's disgusting what is going on here.\"",
      "Some Republicans on the Senate Homeland Security Committee insisted that blind trusts are sufficiently restrictive. But Hawley said blind trusts are \"often workarounds,\" and members can still influence decisions.",
      "The measure, originally called the Preventing Elected Leaders from Owning Securities and Investments (PELOSI) Act, would prohibit members of Congress and their spouses from trading or holding individual stocks, giving them 180 days to sell their stocks. Members would also have to supply their House or Senate ethics committee with written certification of compliance each year, and the Government Accountability Office would conduct a compliance audit every two years. Hawley, as a part of negotiations with Democrats, agreed to call it the Honest Act.",

      "\"While I appreciate the creativity of my Republican colleagues in drafting legislative acronyms, I welcome any serious effort to raise ethical standards in public service,\" Pelosi said.",
      "Hawley also said the legislation would ban the next president and vice president from holding or trading individual stocks while in office, meaning the legislation wouldn't affect President Trump. A reporter asked the president if he supports Hawley's bill.",
      "\"Well, I like it conceptually,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I don't know about it. But I like it conceptually.\"",
      "But later in the afternoon, Mr. Trump went off on Hawley on Truth Social with a very different tone than he took only hours earlier, calling him a \"second-tier Senator.\"",

      "The United States has repatriated an American child separated from their family from a sprawling camp in northeastern Syria that houses tens of thousands of people with alleged ties to the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, the State Department said Tuesday.",
      "The department estimates that some 30,000 people from 70 countries remain in al-Hol Camp and one other similar camp, most of them wives and children of ISIS fighters as well as supporters of the extremist group. They include Iraqis as well as nationals of Western countries who traveled to join the U.S.-designated foreign terrorist group.",

      "Washington \u2014 Senate Republicans are mulling a possible rule change to allow them to more swiftly confirm President Trump's nominees amid Democrats' efforts to slow the process in protest to the president's policies.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters Wednesday that interest is \"growing quickly\" among Senate Republicans for a change to the rules governing the nominations process as he's bemoaned an \"unprecedented level of obstruction and delay\" by Democrats in recent days.",
      "\"There's certainly interest in looking at options that might enable us to break the logjam and expedite consideration of nominees in a way that, in the end, would benefit both parties when their party has the presidency,\" Thune said.",
      "With around 1,300 positions requiring Senate confirmation, the process is an arduous one that has become more cumbersome in recent years. The average time to confirm a president's nominee has nearly quadrupled during the last six administrations, according to the Center for Presidential Transition. And Democrats have taken their slow-walking of Mr. Trump's nominees to new extremes in recent months, putting up procedural hurdles to delay the confirmations nearly across the board.",
      "Still, the opposition by Democrats has not been universal, since any single senator can effectively stall the path to swift confirmation.",
      "In recent years, both Democrats and Republicans have made pushes to change the confirmation process, like by cutting down the time requirements for the nominations and reducing the number of votes needed to a simple majority.",
      "Senate Republicans have been tight-lipped about the possible new changes to the process, which would represent a further change to the institution that has traditionally been resistant to change. Sen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, told CBS News that Senate Republicans are \"actively discussing\" possible changes, calling the obstruction of Mr. Trump's nominees \"unconscionable.\" He noted that he would say the same if the dynamic was occurring under a Democrat.",
      "Sen. Markwayne Mullin, an Oklahoma Republican, told CBS News that \"we are actually not looking to do reforms, but we don't have a choice.\"",
      "\"This is Chuck Schumer's fault. He's the one that's forcing this. And, and so I don't know what he expects to happen, but we will have to have some reforms if this is the way they continue to operate,\" Mullin added.",
      "Sen. Tommy Tuberville, an Alabama Republican who during the Biden administration delayed the nominations of hundreds of military officers, argued that the chamber should remain in session to get the nominations done. \"We ought to stay if we don't get as many as we want to get,\" he said.",
      "\"President Trump says he wants us here,\" Tuberville said. \"We work for him.\"",
      "Earlier this month, Mr. Trump called for Senate Republicans to stay in session into their August recess to get the nominations done. And some other Senate Republicans, like Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, have echoed the sentiment. Lee has argued that the GOP should either \"exhaust\" Democrats by working through August \u2014 or give Mr. Trump the ability to make recess appointments.",
      "Asked about recess appointments, which afford the president the ability to temporarily fill vacancies while the Senate is in recess, Thune suggested that Senate Republicans would be more likely to \"make a modification to our rules\" to sidestep Democrats' delay.",
      "\"At some point, we may need to look at doing things differently on nominees generally, if the Democrats continue this path of obstruction that they're on right now,\" Thune said.",
      "Meanwhile, Mr. Trump took aim at another facet of the Senate's confirmation process late Tuesday in a post on Truth Social, urging Sen. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican who leads the Senate Judiciary Committee, to end blue slips \u2014 a practice that gives senators veto power over judicial nominations in their home state.",
      "Thune told reporters that the blue slip process is \"something that's been used for a long time by both sides, and neither side has violated its usage in the past.\"",
      "\"I don't sense any rush to change it, and I think the key is to make sure that we're making good headway on moving the list of judges that are on the President's list,\" he added.",

      "It is not unusual for law enforcement to be the only witnesses testifying in front of a grand jury.",
      "The new information comes after President Trump directed Bondi and the Justice Department to move to unseal \"any and all pertinent grand jury testimony,\" related to the federal investigations into Epstein and Maxwell in an attempt to quiet the political storm that has ensnared the Trump administration since the Justice Department and FBI said a review of the investigation related to disgraced financier found that there was no \"client list\" or evidence that he blackmailed prominent figures.",
      "Epstein died in federal custody in 2019 as he faced sex trafficking charges, with investigators ruling his death a suicide. Maxwell is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for helping him recruit, groom and abuse underage girls.",
      "This latest filing again urged the New York court to release the records, and tried to convince the judges overseeing the case that the release of more information would not harm Epstein and Maxwell's victims.",
      "\"There is undoubtedly a clearly expressed interest from the public in Jeffrey Epstein's and Ghislaine Maxwell's crimes. Beyond that, there is abundant public interest in the investigative work conducted by the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation into those crimes,\" Justice Department leadership wrote in its argument that the transcripts should be released, adding that its goal in unsealing the material would \"provide information to the public while remaining sensitive to protecting the rights of victims.\"",
      "The Justice Department also said in the filing that they have submitted a fuller list under seal of witnesses whose accounts were conveyed in the grand jury proceedings and another list of which witnesses testified at trial to the judges, and have informed notice to all but one victim who is referenced in the grand jury transcripts of their attempts to unseal them.",
      "\"The Government has attempted to contact the remaining victim, but such efforts have been unsuccessful.\u00a0 In addition, the Government is in the process of providing notice to any other individuals identified in the transcripts,\" the Justice Department wrote.",
      "Last week, a federal judge in Florida denied the Justice Department's request to unseal grand jury material stemming from investigations in 2005 and 2007 into Epstein in the state. That ruling only applied to transcripts of proceedings by federal grand juries that were convened in Florida, and did not apply to the transcripts in New York.",

      "The sanctions announced by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent target Alexandre de Moraes, who has served on the Brazilian Supreme Federal Court since 2017. The Trump administration accused de Moraes of abusing his authority to target political opponents, including Bolsonaro, an ally of Mr. Trump's.",

      "\"Alexandre de Moraes has taken it upon himself to be judge and jury in an unlawful witch hunt against U.S. and Brazilian citizens and companies,\" Bessent said in a statement. \"De Moraes is responsible for an oppressive campaign of censorship, arbitrary detentions that violate human rights, and politicized prosecutions \u2014 including against former President Jair Bolsonaro. Today's action makes clear that Treasury will continue to hold accountable those who threaten U.S. interests and the freedoms of our citizens.\"",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the U.S. is sanctioning de Moraes for \"serious\" human rights abuses, including detaining people without bringing charges and for infringing on freedom of expression.",
      "Rubio said de Moraes also \"abused his authority by engaging in a targeted and politically motivated effort designed to silence political critics through the issuance of secret orders compelling online platforms, including U.S. social media companies, to ban the accounts of individuals for posting protected speech.\"",
      "\"The United States will use all appropriate and effective diplomatic, political, and legal instruments to protect the speech of Americans from foreign malign actors who would seek to undermine it,\" he said in a statement.",
      "Bolsonaro is on trial for allegedly orchestrating a scheme to remain in office after Brazil's 2022 election. He was indicted in November, and prosecutors accused Brazil's former leader and seven others of seeking to \"violently overthrow the democratic order.\" Bolsonaro lost the 2022 race to his left-wing opponent President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. He has denied the allegations and called the prosecution a \"witch hunt.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has publicly defended Bolsonaro and called the treatment of him an \"international disgrace.\" In a July 9 letter to Lula posted to social media, the president said the trial involving Bolsonaro is a \"witch hunt that should end IMMEDIATELY!\"",
      "Mr. Trump also slapped 50% tariffs on Brazilian products imported into the U.S. on Wednesday. In an executive order imposing the levies, the president said the actions of Brazil's government are \"repugnant to the moral and political values of democratic and free societies and conflict with the policy of the United States to promote democratic governments throughout the world, the principle of free expression and free and fair elections, the rule of law, and respect for human rights.\"",
      "The directive mentioned de Moraes by name and said his actions \"chill and limit expression in the United States, violate human rights, and undermine the interest that the United States has in protecting its citizens and companies at home and abroad.\"",
      "The president had said in a letter to Lula earlier this month warning of the tariffs that his administration concluded that the U.S. \"must move away from the longstanding, and very unfair trade relationship engendered by Brazil's tariff, and non-tariff, policies and trade barriers.\"",
      "The U.S. has a trade surplus with Brazil and exported roughly $49 billion worth of goods to the country last year, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Brazil exported roughly $42 billion in products to the U.S. in 2024.",

      "Washington \u2014 Senate Democrats are trying to force the Justice Department to release the Jeffrey Epstein files using a little-known law that directs executive agencies to turn over information to congressional oversight committees, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer announced Wednesday.",
      "\"Today Senate Democrats take additional action to try and uncover the truth about the Epstein files,\" Schumer said on the Senate floor, and he proceeded to describe the nearly century-old law the minority would use to try to compel the release of the \"full and complete Epstein files.\"",
      "The federal law, known as Section 2954 and referred to as the \"Rule of Five,\" allows five members on the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs to submit an information request on matters within its jurisdiction to a federal agency. Enacted in 1928, the obscure law is part of Congress' ability to wield influence over executive branch agencies, and gives minority members of the oversight committees the ability to request information without the help of the committee chairman.",
      "The move comes as controversy has swirled around the Epstein files in recent weeks, after the Justice Department issued the findings of an internal review that was met with anger from many of Mr. Trump's supporters. The review found no \"client list\" or evidence that Epstein, a well-connected financier who was convicted of sex trafficking and died in federal custody in 2019, had blackmailed prominent figures. But the issue has divided Mr. Trump's base, with many in both parties calling for more transparency as the president has called the controversy a \"hoax.\" And Democrats have sought to capitalize on the GOP infighting.",
      "\"The situation with the Epstein files is very simple \u2014 Donald Trump promised transparency and he has broken that promise,\" Schumer said. \"As a candidate, Trump said on many occasions he would release the Epstein files if elected, and yet he has refused to do so.\"",
      "Schumer accused Republicans of choosing to \"hide\" on the Epstein files, saying, \"if there's nothing to hide, why all the evasiveness?\"",
      "The rule has rarely been used. In 2017, Democrats tried to force the release of documents relating to the leasing of the Old Post Office building in Washington, D.C., which became the site of a Trump hotel. And in 2001, Democrats under former President George W. Bush attempted to compel documents about the 2000 census. Still, with infrequent use, whether the rule could be enforced in court remains to be seen.",
      "Schumer said the request covers \"all documents, files, evidence or other materials in the possession of the Department of Justice or the FBI related to the case of United States v. Jeffrey Epstein.\" He noted the request includes records related to Epstein and his clients, while \"ensuring that the private information of any victims is protected.\" The minority leader said the Democrats expect the Justice Department to provide the information by Aug. 15.",

      "During a\u00a0meeting last week between President Trump and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, the president sought to underscore what he said is a \"very simple\" request: \"Interest rates have to come down.\"",
      "That wish isn't likely to be granted when the Fed announces its next interest rate decision today. Economists put the probability of the central bank holding rates steady at 96%, according to FactSet. The Fed has maintained its benchmark rate in a range of 4.25% to 4.5% since December 2024, prior to Mr. Trump's second-term inauguration in January, as policy makers try to douse the flickering embers of inflation.",
      "Mr. Trump has for months\u00a0derided Powell  over the Fed's caution in lowering borrowing costs, which experts say would boost economic growth but could cause consumer prices to flare. Upping the pressure, Trump administration officials also have said the Fed chair's handline of a\u00a0building renovation\u00a0at the Fed could be grounds for firing.",
      "Despite such criticism, Powell has maintained his stance that no immediate rate cuts are necessary given that the economy remains solid. The Fed chair, who Mr. Trump nominated to head the central bank in 2017, has also suggested he wants to keep its powder dry in case the Trump administration's steep new tariffs cause inflation to reignite.",
      "\"With the labor market holding up and the impact of tariffs on inflation starting to rear its ugly head, the Federal Reserve has plenty of ammunition to justify keeping interest rates unchanged at the July meeting,\" Oxford Economics chief U.S. economist Ryan Sweet said in a July 24 research note.",
      "In making his case for lowering interest rates, Mr. Trump has pointed to rate cuts\u00a0earlier this year by the European Central Bank and the Bank of England, while also pointing out that U.S. inflation so far in 2025 has remained relatively low.",
      "However, the Consumer Price Index \u2014 a key gauge for tracking inflation \u2014 in June rose to an annualized rate of 2.7%, well above the Fed's 2% annual target and a sign that that tariffs could be pushing some prices higher.",
      "Fed policy makers are meeting this week to discuss what to do on interest rates. Here's what to know.",
      "When is the Fed making its rate cut decision?",
      "The Federal Reserve will make its next rate cut decision at 2 p.m. ET on Wednesday, July 30, followed by a 2:30 p.m. ET press conference with Powell, when he will offer his view on the the state of the economy and answer questions from financial journalists about the Fed's economic outlook.",
      "Who makes decisions on interest rates?",
      "The decision is made by the 12-person Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, with a voting majority deciding whether the central bank should cut, hike or maintain the benchmark rate. In other words, no single person, including Fed Chair Powell, determines the central bank's monetary policy.",
      "Lately, at least two members of the FOMC \u2014 Federal Reserve governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman \u2014 have signaled their belief that it is time to cut rates.",
      "\"[I]f there were a pair of dissents in July, it would match the most since 1993,\" Sweet of Oxford Economics noted.. \"From our perspective, dissents are normal and a good thing as it highlights that the Fed isn't falling into the trap of groupthink.\"",
      "Could the Fed cut rates today?",
      "It's not impossible, but highly unlikely. Economists estimate the chances of a rate cut at just 4%, according to FactSet. CME FedWatch, a closely watched monetary policy tracker, also suggests only a very remote probability of a cut.",
      "For now, data continues to shows steady, if slowing, economic growth, with employers in June\u00a0hiring more workers than forecast and inflation remaining relatively muted.\u00a0On Wednesday, the Commerce Department said second-quarter GDP rose at an annual rate of 3%, far outpacing the forecast for 2% growth.",
      "The threat from tariffs as well as stronger-than-expected GDP data means \"the Fed is all but certain to keep rates unchanged again this week, with futures markets pricing in effectively no chance of a cut,\" Matthew Ryan, head of market strategy at global financial services firm Ebury, in an email.",
      "The Fed is likely to hold off on cutting rates to give them room to maneuver if conditions deteriorate, economists note.",
      "Interest rates are the Fed's most powerful tool for nudging growth forward when the economy slows and cooling activity when inflation jumps. A rate hike makes it more expensive for consumers and businesses to borrow, curbing spending and putting the brakes on inflation. By contrast, cuts make it cheaper to borrow, fueling spending and corporate investment, which can spark inflation.",
      "\"Policymakers remain cautious, navigating persistent inflationary risks tied to trade policy along with cooling labor market conditions and growing political pressure from the administration to accelerate rate cuts,\" EY-Parthenon Chief Economist Gregory Daco said in an email.",
      "How has Powell responsed to pressure from Mr. Trump?",
      "Powell has repeatedly stated that the Federal Reserve's decisions are based solely on economic data as it pursues its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and ensuring full employment.",
      "Because Mr. Trump has been pushing for lower rates, Powell is likely to face questions at his press conference Wednesday press about political pressure. Powell may also be asked about the president's remarks about\u00a0replacing him as Fed chair, he added. Powell's current term as chair ends in May 2026.",
      "\"The odds are that [Powell] sticks with his mantra that it doesn't impact monetary policy and he isn't resigning while dodging questions about a shadow Fed chair,\" Sweet said, referring to the possibility that Mr. Trump could decide to nominate Powell's successor months before he is due to step down in hopes of influencing investor expectations for monetary policy.",
      "When is the Fed more likely to lower interest rates?",
      "The Fed is more likely to lower its benchmark rate at its Sept. 16-17 meeting, according to FactSet, with economists pegging the likelihood of a cut at 63%. The FOMC doesn't meet in August, making the September meeting the next chance for a rate cut.",
      "Economists who predict a rate cut at the September meeting are forecasting a 0.25 percentage point reduction, which would take the federal funds rate down to a range of 4% to 4.25%.",
      "\"With no imminent need to act.. the Fed will likely wait until September to deliver the next 25 [basis point] rate cut,\" Daco said. \"We continue to expect two rate cuts in 2025, followed by a further 100bps of easing in 2026 as economic and labor market conditions deteriorate more visibly.\"",

      "Richards has heard Trump administration officials suggest that food dyes and pediatric vaccines cause autism and ADHD. That stance, she said, unfairly blames parents.",
      "\"There's no evidence to support it,\" said Richards, 44, a marketing director in Richmond, Virginia. \"As a parent, it's infuriating.\"",
      "In their zeal to \"Make America Healthy Again,\" Trump administration officials are making statements that some advocacy and medical groups say depict patients and the doctors who treat them as partly responsible for whatever ails them.",
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and agency leaders have attributed a panoply of chronic diseases and other medical issues \u2014 such as autism, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, depression, diabetes, and obesity \u2014 to consumers and their lifestyle choices, according to a review of 15 hours of recorded interviews, social media statements, and federal reports.",
      "He said at a news conference on April 16 that autism is preventable and that rates are rising because of toxic substances in the environment, despite a lack of evidence there is any link.",
      "\"These are kids who will never pay taxes. They'll never hold a job. They'll never play baseball. They'll never write a poem. They'll never go out on a date,\" he said. \"Many of them will never use a toilet unassisted.\"",
      "The vast majority of people on the spectrum do not have those severe challenges.",
      "The statements are more than rhetoric. These attitudes, ranging from judgments about individual behaviors to criticism of the chronically poor, are shaping policies that affect millions of people. The sentiments have been a factor behind decisions to cut Medicaid, keep federal insurance programs from covering anti-obesity drugs, and impose new barriers to COVID-19 vaccines for healthy people, say public health leaders and doctors. GOP lawmakers and federal health officials, they say, hold a reproachful stance toward chronic illnesses and the estimated 129 million people in the U.S. affected by them.",
      "\"This is at the heart of so much of our national problem with health,\" said Robert Califf, who led the Food and Drug Administration during the Obama and Biden administrations. \"It's these two extreme views. It's every health decision is up to the 'rugged individual,' versus the other extreme view that it's all controlled by environment and social determinants of health. The truth is, it's on a continuum.\"",
      "The blame game",
      "Self-reliance is a common theme among adherents of MAHA, an informal movement for which Kennedy has fashioned himself the figurehead that promotes medical freedom, skepticism of vaccines, and a focus on nontraditional medicine to treat disease.",
      "Taking medication to manage diabetes? FDA Commissioner Marty Makary suggested on Fox News in late May that it would be effective to \"treat more diabetes with cooking classes\" instead of \"just throwing insulin at people.\"",
      "People with Type 1 diabetes must take insulin because their pancreases don't produce it, according to the National Institutes of Health, which also notes that many with Type 2 diabetes \"need to take diabetes medicines as well.\"",
      "Taking birth control pills? Casey Means, President Trump's nominee to be U.S. surgeon general, has said that's a \"disrespect of life\" for short-term gain and efficiency.",
      "\"We are prescribing them like candy,\" she said last year on \"The Tucker Carlson Show,\" adding that birth control medications \"are literally shutting down the hormones in the female body that create this cyclical, life-giving nature of women.\"",
      "Have a child on ADHD meds? Calley Means, who is an adviser to Kennedy and is Casey Means' brother, said on the same show that Adderall is prescribed as the standard of care when children get a little fidgety because they're in sedentary environments with limited sunlight and eat too much ultraprocessed food.",
      "As a society, he said, \"we're really committing mass child abuse in many ways, and we're normalizing that and we're not speaking out about that. And then we're giving people stimulants developed by Nazi Germany.\"",
      "Calley Means was probably referring to Pervitin, a methamphetamine-based drug administered to Adolf Hitler's forces in World War II. Adderall is a prescription drug containing amphetamine, a stimulant that's not the same as methamphetamine.",
      "The Department of Health and Human Services didn't respond to messages seeking comment from Means.",
      "Some conservatives and MAHA adherents argue that people need to take more responsibility for their health. But comments that shift blame to patients and physicians risk perpetuating stigmas, fostering the spread of misinformation, and eroding trust in modern medicine, say medical groups, doctors, and patient advocacy groups.",
      "The statements assume consumers and patients have control over improving their health and preventing chronic disease when the reality is more complex, according to some public health leaders. Lower-income people, they say, often lack access to grocery stores and healthy food, may juggle too many jobs to have time to cook from scratch, and may live in dangerous areas where it's harder to get outside and exercise.",
      "Jerome Adams, surgeon general during the previous Trump administration, told KFF Health News that he worries efforts to promote health will be undone by \"the return of vaccine-preventable diseases, increasing mistrust in the health care system, and the tearing down of social supports which are critical for making healthy choices.\"",
      "Tough talk",
      "The attitudes held by top Trump health officials have affected policy decisions, some doctors and public health leaders say.",
      "Kennedy and other Trump administration health leaders have been especially outspoken, targeting issues they consider especially egregious in recent federal actions, research, or policy.",
      "For example, the Biden administration proposed a rule in November that would let Medicare cover weight loss medications such as Wegovy and Zepbound. But Kennedy and other political appointees at HHS and its agencies have criticized the drugs and the people who take them.",
      "\"I think it's very dark,\" Calley Means told Carlson, referring to the weight loss drugs. \"I think it's a stranglehold on the U.S. population, almost like solidifying this idea that there is a magic pill.\"",
      "He added: \"Where is the urgency on saying 'Hey parents, maybe we shouldn't feed our kids toxic food?'\"",
      "Kennedy, too, has criticized the medications and people who use them, saying in October on Fox News that drugmakers \"are counting on selling it to Americans because we're so stupid and so addicted to drugs.\"",
      "In April, the Trump administration announced it would not finalize the Biden-era coverage rule.",
      "\"It's impacting the kind of care and treatments patients will have,\" said Andrea Love, a biomedical scientist and founder of ImmunoLogic, a science communication organization. \"It sends the message that it's your fault. It's very much victim-blaming. It creates the idea that scientific progress is the devil, demonizes things that aren't individually harming health, while avoiding addressing systemic issues that play a much larger role in health.\"",
      "Kennedy and HHS didn't return messages seeking comment.",
      "Data shows that the medications are effective. People who took the highest dose of Zepbound in clinical trials lost an average of 48 pounds, and 1 in 3 on that dose lost more than 58 pounds, or 25% of their body weight.",
      "Kennedy and other agency leaders also oppose many COVID-era health restrictions and rules. Some physicians and public health leaders note these officials downplayed COVID risks while criticizing vaccines developed during the previous Trump administration.",
      "Kennedy has said that people who died from COVID actually fell victim to chronic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, or asthma.",
      "\"That's really what killed them,\" Kennedy said on \"Dr. Phil Primetime\" in April. \"These were people who were so sick they were basically hanging from a cliff, and COVID came along and stamped on their fingers and dropped them off. But they were already living lives that were burdened by sickness.\"",
      "COVID was the underlying cause of death for more than 940,000 people in the U.S. from Aug. 1, 2021, to July 31, 2022, according to a 2023 report in JAMA Network, an open-access journal on biomedical sciences published by the American Medical Association.",
      "COVID ranked first among deaths caused by infectious or respiratory diseases for youths under age 19, based on the report. Infants under a year old may be at higher risk of experiencing severe illness from COVID compared with older children, studies show, and risks are also higher for infants under 6 months and those with underlying medical conditions.",
      "\"Vaccination during pregnancy can help protect infants after birth,\" according to the CDC.",
      "But Kennedy announced in May that the federal government would no longer recommend COVID vaccines for pregnant people and children who are healthy. Medical groups such as the American Academy of Pediatrics opposed this decision and filed a lawsuit.",
      "Kennedy also helped promote beliefs that many childless adults on Medicaid, the federal-state program for low-income people, don't work and thereby drain resources from the program.",
      "At a May hearing of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Kennedy said the program was in jeopardy because of \"all the able-bodied people who are not working [or] looking for jobs.\"",
      "It's a view embraced by Republican lawmakers who portrayed adults enrolled in Medicaid as lazy or shirking work as they advanced a budget bill estimated to cut federal spending on the program by about $1 trillion over a decade, in part by imposing work requirements on many adult beneficiaries.",
      "\"Thirty-five-year-olds sitting at home playing video games, they're going to now have to go get a job,\" said House Majority Leader Steve Scalise of Louisiana.",
      "The legislation, which Mr. Trump signed into law this month, will cause about 10 million more people to be without health insurance by 2034, the Congressional Budget Office estimates.",
      "Some health leaders who criticized the legislation say the statements inaccurately maligned Medicaid enrollees, who by law cannot hold high-paying jobs and remain in the program.",
      "Nonetheless, nearly two-thirds of adults ages 19 to 64 covered by Medicaid in 2023 were working. For about 3 in 10, caregiving responsibilities, an illness or disability, or school attendance prevented them from working, according to KFF, the health policy organization that includes KFF Health News.",
      "\"It's using anti-welfare tropes for something that is basic health care, not a cash benefit,\" said Anthony Wright, executive director at Families USA, which supports the Affordable Care Act and expanded health coverage. He summarized the Republican message: \"We're going to make it harder to get the help you need by imposing a bunch of paperwork, and if you don't get it, it's your fault.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Environmental Protection Agency has decided to revoke a key scientific finding it published 16 years ago that six greenhouse gases are a threat to public health and must be regulated under the Clean Air Act.",
      "Known as the \"endangerment finding,\" it is the 2009 scientific basis for which the EPA has regulated greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles, as well as other sources of climate pollution, but Administrator Lee Zeldin announced on a conservative podcast Tuesday that the agency is revoking the finding, calling it, \"the largest deregulatory action in the history of America.\"",
      "Since it was signed by then-Administrator Lisa Jackson in 2009, the finding has been used by the EPA to regulate sources of climate change-causing pollution from cars, power plants and other sources of transportation like planes, as well as oil and gas operations.",
      "But Tuesday, the EPA issued a press release saying if the draft to revoke the finding is finalized, it would \"repeal all resulting greenhouse gas emissions regulations for motor vehicles and engines, thereby reinstating consumer choice and giving Americans the ability to purchase a safe and affordable car for their family while decreasing the cost of living on all products that trucks deliver.\"",
      "During his appearance on the \"Ruthless Podcast,\" Zeldin criticized the endangerment finding, saying it put too many regulatory restrictions on transportation and stationary sources of greenhouse gas pollution.",
      "\"There are people, who in the name of climate change, are willing to bankrupt the country,\" he said.",
      "Zeldin also said regulating climate pollution costs Americans too much money. If the proposed finding is finalized, it \"is expected to save Americans $54 billion in costs annually through the repeal of all greenhouse gas standards,\" according to the EPA press release.",
      "But the EPA's own regulatory impact report says limiting emissions for cars and trucks is expected to generate more than $2.1 trillion in net benefits over the next 30 years, including $820 billion in fuel savings and $1.8 trillion in public health and climate benefits.",
      "Repealing the finding comes at a time when climate change impacts appear to be reaching new heights as 2024 was the hottest year on record, and natural disasters are growing more intense, destructive and deadly. Since 2010, there have been 246 billion-dollar disasters striking every U.S. state, causing more than $1.7 trillion in damages, and killing more than 7,700 people, according to archived data from NOAA.",
      "\"For the EPA to repeal the 2009 finding borders on criminal negligence,\" said Robert Howarth, a professor of ecology and environmental biology at Cornell University, in a statement. \"The science was clear in 2009 and has become much stronger and clearer since: climate disruption is a large and growing problem; it is caused primarily from our use of fossil fuels and the resultant emissions of carbon dioxide and methane; and it is a deadly problem.\"",
      "Legality of the endangerment finding",
      "In 2007, the Supreme Court ruled in Massachusetts v. EPA that greenhouse gases are a form of air pollution that can be regulated under the Clean Air Act, but it tasked the EPA with making a scientific finding about whether the gases harm public health.",
      "Two years later, the EPA published the endangerment finding, relying on extensive scientific evidence and public input to definitively state that greenhouse gases, which cause climate change, threaten health and the welfare of current and future generations.",
      "\"I think it's the most impactful thing I worked on in my career,\" said a former EPA employee who was a key author on the 2009 endangerment finding and requested anonymity because of current contractual obligations with the federal government.",
      "\"This body of scientific evidence met the endangerment test of the Clean Air Act,\" they told CBS News. \"It has stood the test of time and the science has only gotten stronger.\"",
      "The EPA's new proposal aims to question the agency's ability to set standards for car emissions, according to the press release. The full draft of the rule is not yet accessible on the EPA website or federal register to review.",
      "The release also said the EPA will \"update scientific data and challenge the assumptions\" of the 2009 finding with\u00a0a study\u00a0from the Department of Energy's 2025 Climate Work Group, which was not peer-reviewed, but says greenhouse gases \"appear to be less damaging economically than commonly believed.\"",
      "Plenty of conservative groups and attorneys general have tested the legality of the finding and were pleased with Tuesday's announcement.",
      "\"Over the last four years, conservative state attorneys general were the last line of defense in fighting back against the Biden administration's federal overreach and green new scam agenda,\" said Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita in a statement.",
      "The finding has previously been challenged in court, most recently in 2023, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. circuit upheld the finding and the Supreme Court refused to hear the case.",
      "The EPA highlighted subsequent Supreme Court rulings since the finding was signed in 2009 and said, in its press release, those cases \"have significantly clarified the scope of EPA's authority under the CAA,\" indicating the agency may be open to testing whether today's court has an appetite to revisit and overturn the 2007 ruling that greenhouse gases should be regulated under the Clean Air Act by the EPA.",
      "\"The administration's move to jettison these standards flies in the face of the Supreme Court's landmark decision directing the EPA to follow the science,\" said Christy Goldfuss, executive director of the Natural Resources Defense Council, in a statement. \"If EPA finalizes this illegal and cynical approach, we will see them in court.\"",
      "Impacts of the endangerment finding",
      "Since it was signed in 2009, the most crucial impacts of regulating greenhouse gasses have been to the U.S. transportation sector, which if it were its own country, would be the fourth largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the world, according to the European Commission and data from the EPA.",
      "New passenger vehicles today emit 24% less climate pollution than they did in 2011, the year before the first tailpipe regulations went into effect, according to the EPA's own estimates. The EPA tightened the tailpipe emissions standards for cars and trucks in 2024, which was expected to cut 7.2 billion tons of climate pollution by 2055 and save $13 billion in annual health benefits.",
      "But according to the EPA's press release, if the proposed draft is finalized it will, \"undo the underpinning of $1 trillion in costly regulations (and) save more than $54 billion annually,\" although no regulatory analysis has been provided to confirm those numbers.",
      "In addition to removing regulations on cars, the EPA has already jettisoned similar rules to limit emissions for power plants, has encouraged the development of fossil fuel-based energy and has promised to rollback dozens of additional environmental regulations that hamper the development of American energy and manufacturing.",
      "\"Trump's EPA is trying every trick in the book to deny and avoid their mission to protect people and the environment from the ravages of unchecked climate pollution. Instead of doing their job, this EPA is putting the safety of our loved ones at risk while ratcheting up grid instability, energy bills, and disaster costs,\" said former EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy, in a statement.",

    "summary": "From vaccines to fluoride, here's what the newly confirmed CDC director Susan Monarez has said about some key health topics.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Senate voted Tuesday along party lines, 51 to 47, to confirm Susan Monarez as the new director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "President Trump nominated her for the role in March, praising her as \"an incredible mother and dedicated public servant\" who \"understands the importance of protecting our children, our communities, and our future.\"",
      "Monarez has been serving as the acting head of the CDC since January, and previously worked as the head of the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. She was viewed as somewhat surprising pick for the CDC role because unlike most recent CDC directors, she holds a Ph.D. but is not a medical doctor.",
      "The CDC\u00a0said\u00a0Monarez \"brings decades of distinguished experience in health innovation, disaster preparedness, global health, and biosecurity\" to the agency, and will help advance the \"mission to Make America Healthy Again.\"",
      "At her confirmation hearing before the Senate's Health, Education, Labor and Pension (HELP) committee on July 9, Monarez garnered praise from the Republican chairman, Sen. Bill Cassidy, who is a physician, for her commitment to rebuilding public trust in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Democrats on the committee grilled her about the impact of cuts in federal funding for health programs and medical research, and expressed concern about the CDC's role under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "Monarez was questioned by committee members about a range of health topics. Here are some of those highlights.",
      "Monarez on vaccines",
      "Monarez faced a number of questions about vaccine recommendations.\u00a0Kennedy\u00a0has been a longtime vaccine critic who has pushed a discredited theory linking routine childhood shots to autism, but during her hearing, Monarez refuted that view and stated that she has \"not seen a causal link between vaccines and autism.\"",
      "Amid a growing measles outbreak this year, Kennedy has\u00a0acknowledged the vaccine's efficacy\u00a0against the disease while still saying he supports individual choice. In a March interview with CBS News, Kennedy publicly encouraged people to get the measles vaccine.",
      "\"If I'm confirmed as CDC director, I look forward to supporting the secretary with science and evidence, and making sure that I am giving him the best information possible,\" Monarez said at her confirmation hearing. \"Measles is an important health threat and we have to make sure we are doing everything that we can to prevent and mitigate it.\"",
      "Monarez was also asked about the continued availability and affordability of vaccines if the CDC's vaccine advisory panel, made up of new RFK Jr. appointees, makes changes to recommendations.",
      "\"Vaccines absolutely save lives, and if I'm confirmed as CDC director, I commit to making sure we continue to prioritize vaccine availability,\" she said.",
      "Monarez on fluoride",
      "Fluoride, another topic Kennedy has spotlighted, was also a subject of discussion during Monarez's hearing. This year, two states, Utah and Florida, became the first to ban the use of fluoride in drinking water, where it's been added for decades to help prevent tooth decay.",
      "\"Fluoride is an important component to oral health, and there are various aspects of using fluoride to improve oral health \u2014 a direct application can be very valuable,\" Monarez said.",
      "Democratic Sen. Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland specifically asked Monarez whether the water in Potomac, Maryland, which has fluoridation, is safe for families.",
      "Monarez replied: \"I believe the water in Potomac, Maryland is safe.\"",
      "Monarez on RFK Jr. and the measles outbreak",
      "Measles came up repeatedly as senators questioned Monarez about how she would interact with Kennedy in her role at the CDC.",
      "\"The CDC director can't perform this critical role unless they are politically independent. Which means that you must be willing to disagree with political leaders based on scientific evidence,\" Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire said. \"So, is there anything that you disagree with Secretary Kennedy about?\"",
      "\"If I'm confirmed as CDC director, I look forward to having technical discussions with the secretary. He has said he values and prioritizes independent thinking and using science to drive decision making,\" Monarez replied. \"I am an independent thinker, and I am a scientist, and I will welcome the opportunity to share my opinions based on science and evidence with him as he makes some of these very difficult decisions.\"",
      "After Monarez sidestepped a question from Hassan about whether she disagrees with anything Kennedy has done, the senator got more specific, asking about Kennedy's claim that it's \"very difficult for measles to kill a healthy person.\" This year's measles outbreak, centered in West Texas, killed two children who doctors said did not have previous health conditions.",
      "Monarez replied that measles is an \"important public health threat\" that can be lethal.",

      "The heated exchange arose after Booker objected to a motion from Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, a Democrat from Nevada, to swiftly pass a package of bills related to law enforcement. Booker said he wanted to make a change to the bloc of measures to ensure resources are distributed equally among law enforcement agencies in response to the Justice Department's changes to grant programs and cancellation of awards.",
      "\"We are standing at a moment where our president is eviscerating the Constitution of the United States of America, and we're willing to go along with that today,\" he said. \"No, no.

      "Booker said in his remarks from the Senate floor that the Justice Department has been weaponizing public safety grants to punish state and local jurisdictions that oppose Mr. Trump's second-term agenda, and it is withholding funds from law enforcement agencies across the country when they were approved by Congress with bipartisan backing.",
      "\"It is disgraceful, it is unfair, it is unjust and it is dangerously reckless toward the officers whose well-being they are jeopardizing,\" Booker said. \"Federal funds should not be used for partisan political gains.\"",
      "The New Jersey Democrat lambasted his colleagues and accused them of effectively blessing Mr. Trump's decision to rescind grant funds by approving the legislative package.",
      "\"For us as a body to move forward right now is being complicit in what Donald Trump is doing,\" Booker said. \"I say no. I say we stand. I say we fight. I say we reject this, and that in a bipartisan way, we demand an end to this kind of constitutionally unjust carving up of the resources we approve.\"",
      "Booker had put forward an amendment to the bloc of bills that he said would prevent politicization and ensure resources are spread evenly among law enforcement agencies, regardless of the state they are in.",
      "\"This to me is the problem with Democrats in America right now, is we're willing to be complicit to Donald Trump, to let this pass through when we have all the leverage right now there is, to say, 'if you're as passionate about police as we are, then pass bills out of this body that will help the police officers in Washington, that will help the police officers in Illinois, that will help the police officers in New Jersey,'\" he said. \"Don't be complicit to the president of the United States.\"",
      "In response, Cortez Masto said the measures had been approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee with bipartisan support \u2014 including by Booker. She criticized him for not putting forth his proposed amendment when the bills were before the panel and said his suggested change doesn't apply to her legislation.",
      "\"This is ridiculous,\" she said, adding that Booker should have raised his concerns weeks ago. \"Is this the right venue to fight for what he is seeking?\"",
      "Klobuchar, in her own remarks on the Senate floor, also defended the package and suggested Booker had missed the committee meeting when they were marked up. Booker is a member of the Judiciary Committee.",
      "\"I can't help it if someone couldn't change their schedule to be there,\" she said.",
      "Klobuchar said Booker has had issues with her policing bill that predate Mr. Trump's return to the White House, adding, \"One of the things I don't understand here is that we have committees for a reason, and we have hearings for a reason. And you can't do one thing on Police Week and not show up and not object and let these bills go through, and then say another a few weeks later on the floor.\"",
      "The tense back-and-forth came as Democrats have struggled to coalesce around a strategy for pushing back against Mr. Trump's second-term agenda.

    "title": "Six months in, young people have soured on Trump's job handling",
    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/young-people-trumps-job-handling-cbs-news-analysis/",
    "published": "Tue, 29 Jul 2025 12:51:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Most Americans under 30 approved at the start of President Trump's second term but are dissatisfied with the economy's direction.",
    "story": [
      "Since Donald Trump took office for his second term, his job ratings have markedly\u00a0declined\u00a0\u2014 and more with young people than any other age group. What has made so many young Americans change their minds so quickly?",
      "For context, President Trump's electoral performance with voters under 30 improved a lot in 2024: While he lost this group to former Vice President Kamala Harris, it was by a much smaller margin than in 2020. And men under 30 ended up splitting roughly evenly between Trump and Harris. These trends prompted some observers to marvel at how conservative Gen Z had become, especially young men, and to wonder whether it marked a durable change.",
      "About half a year on from Inauguration Day, many young people have changed their minds on Trump. It looks more like many young voters gave him the benefit of the doubt when he took office, but their evaluations of him quickly started to sink. Among Americans ages 18-29, his job approval rating has fallen from a high of 55% just after he was inaugurated to 28% now. That means that half of his former approvers now disapprove. In percentage-point terms, the size of that drop is more than double what we've seen in any other age group.",
      "Which young voters have dropped off?",
      "Among young people, it's the less partisan and politically engaged who have seen the steepest drops. For example, about half of independents under 30 approved of Mr. Trump in February, but that has dropped to about one in five now. The same is true of young people who didn't vote in the 2024 election. Party identifiers and '24 voters have fallen off, too, but not to the same extent.",
      "There are also differences by gender, with young men starting out more approving of Mr. Trump than young women were. Women's ratings of the president had already begun dipping by March, while it was not until April\u00a0\u2014 and the downturn in the U.S. stock market \u2014 that young men's ratings started to decline. Both have fallen steadily since then, but a faster drop among young men in the last few months has meant the gender gap in approval of Mr. Trump has shrunk. (See the bottom of this article for statistical details on estimating these smaller subgroups.)",
      "CBS News polling over the past few months offers several clues as to what young people are unhappy about these days.",
      "A majority now say Mr. Trump is doing different things than he promised during the 2024 campaign. That's a reversal in sentiment from early February, when seven in 10 said he's doing what he said he would. And it's young men who have been the most likely to flip on this question.",
      "On top of that, the administration is experiencing low points on several economic evaluations:",
      "The share of young people saying the economy is getting worse has risen to six in 10. And young Americans are less likely than older ones to see the job market as good.\u00a0Over time, young people have increasingly rated it as fairly or very bad.",
      "The share of young people saying the economy is getting worse has risen to six in 10. And young Americans are less likely than older ones to see the job market as good.\u00a0Over time, young people have increasingly rated it as fairly or very bad.",
      "Six in 10 also tell us that Mr. Trump's policies are making them worse off financially. That is the highest we've seen to date, and it represents a complete change from what young people expected when he was inaugurated. Back then, they were much more likely to say his policies would make them better off than worse off.",

Back then, they were much more likely to say his policies would make them better off than worse off.",
      "And majorities feel the Trump administration is focusing too much on tariffs (72%), deportations (64%), and ending DEI programs (55%). These shares have all grown significantly over time. By contrast, seven in 10 say the administration isn't focusing enough on lowering prices, which was a key campaign issue.",

By contrast, seven in 10 say the administration isn't focusing enough on lowering prices, which was a key campaign issue.",
      "Looking back and ahead ...",
      "Instead of marking a permanent rightward shift, Mr. Trump's better-than-expected performance with young voters last year is beginning to look more like a temporary reaction. Indeed, less partisan voters tend to be more responsive to short-term forces, like the economic conditions that drove many to the ballot box in 2024. And when Trump was inaugurated, many young people hoped he would turn the economy around, with his initial ratings likely reflecting some optimism. This honeymoon period quickly faded. His 18-29 rating is now below Joe Biden's when he left office.",
      "Looking ahead to 2026, Republicans' electoral success may depend on both the president's numbers and youth turnout. If views of Mr. Trump's job handling don't improve over the next year, they could be a drag on GOP congressional candidates. And while young voters are less likely to turn out in non-presidential years, both the 2018 and 2022 midterms saw record numbers go to the polls, including voters under 30. In fact, in 2022, young voters turned out at a rate that came close to saving the Democrats' majority. In a tight contest, they could be pivotal again.",
      "Estimating small subgroups in polls",
      "To more precisely estimate trends in approval among young people, I aggregated our polls and ran a statistical model that controls for respondents' race, education level, 2024 vote, and survey date.",
      "Why take this approach? All polls have a margin of error, and the margin of error is greater for subgroups within the poll, as a function of sample size and routine weighting. So, even though young people are represented proportionate to their share of the population, estimating what percentage of them approve of the president naturally comes with a higher margin of error. It's driven by random variation in which types of young people respond to a given poll, and margins of error grow as you slice data more thinly \u2014 for instance, in disaggregating young people by gender.",
      "Since a single poll can only do so much, we can combine data across polls to boost sample sizes and gain confidence in our estimates. Aggregating surveys yields sample sizes of over 1,200 men and 1,300 women under 30 to analyze. And the model smoothens out poll-to-poll randomness within these subgroups.",
      "The modeled estimates for any given time point are consistently within range of the unmodeled survey data, typically within a few points. And importantly, they tell the same story: both young men and young women's views of Trump have worsened, and the gender gap has decreased.",

    "summary": "\"It's not one that's going to cause mass devastation. But it will cause coastal flooding and it will cause damage and it does put lives at risk if people don't move to high ground,\" an oceanography professor says.",
    "story": [
      "An 8.8-magnitude earthquake, one of the strongest ever recorded, struck Russia's Far East early Wednesday, prompting tsunami warnings in coastal towns in multiple countries.",
      "The earthquake was \"on what we call the Pacific Ring of Fire. This is a region around the entire Pacific Rim renowned for significant earthquakes,\" Simon Boxall, lecturer in oceanography at the University of Southampton, told The Associated Press.",
      "\"The Earth is made up of these sort of geology plates, these geophysical plates, and the Earth where these plates rub, where they sort of join, we get stresses building up, and then every so often we get a sudden release of pressure and part of the seabed flips up,\" Boxall said. \"And so it's that flip that causes the tsunami. And not all flips, not all earthquakes will generate these.\"",
      "Boxal said the tsunami generated by this earthquake was \"not huge. It's not one that's going to cause mass devastation. But it will cause coastal flooding and it will cause damage and it does put lives at risk if people don't move to high ground.\"",
      "Two magnitude 9.1 earthquakes - the Tohoku earthquake in 2011 in Japan and the 2004 Sumatra earthquake in Indonesia - caused massive tsunamis that killed thousands of people.",
      "Earthquake scientist Grace Sethanant said there was a reason those temblors caused much more devastating tsunamis than Wednesday's quake.",
      "While a magnitude 9.1 quake \"might seem not so far off from the magnitude 8.8 \u2026 in terms of energy, it's three times stronger,\" Sethanant said.",
      "\"Imagine the 8.8 is, as I drop a rock in the lake, and you see the ripples. That's the energy,\" Sethanant said. \"Imagine you have that rock like three times bigger. So, in terms of the earthquake movement magnitude, the energy of the 2011 and 2004 earthquakes in Sumatra and in Japan, it's actually three to four times bigger. ... And that's why the tsunamis in those events were much more devastating.\"",
      "National Tsunami Warning Center  Tsunami Warning Coordinator Dave Snider said tsunamis should be thought of more as \"ocean floods\" than waves.",
      "\"The most important thing to understand about a tsunami is this is not a surf wave, it's not a wind wave,\" Snider said. \"A tsunami is the entire ocean column that is being lifted above that high tide level there because of that extreme movement of the Earth's crust with the earthquake there, so this is a significant planetary event that we've just witnessed.\"",

    "summary": "The Crew 11 flight include three fliers headed for space after reassignments in the wake of problems with Boeing's Starliner capsule.",
    "story": [
      "NASA is ready to send a fresh crew to the International Space Station Thursday aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule, including three fliers who were assigned to the flight after NASA ran into problems with Boeing's troubled Starliner capsule last year.",
      "Liftoff from pad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center is set for 12:09 p.m. EDT, roughly the moment Earth's rotation carries the Falcon 9 rocket into alignment with the space station's orbit \u2014 a requirement for rendezvous missions. If all goes well, the Crew Dragon will dock with the lab complex early Saturday.",
      "Crew 11 commander Zena Cardman originally expected to fly to the space station last fall, but she and Crew 9 crewmate Stephanie Wilson were bumped from the flight to free up two seats to bring Starliner astronauts Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and pilot Sunita Williams back to Earth after an extended stay in space.",
      "Wilmore and Williams flew to the orbital lab complex last June in the first piloted flight of a Starliner. But their stay in space was extended because of Starliner propulsion system problems. NASA managers eventually opted to bring them down earlier this year aboard the Crew 9 Dragon, using the seats given up by Cardman and Wilson.",
      "\"If I think about it only as an individual, and how it affected me, yes, of course, it was an unexpected change,\" Cardman said. \"But space flight is not about me or about any individual. It's about what we can do together. None of us can do this by ourselves.",
      "\"Now I have the opportunity to train with this wonderful, amazing crew. Life is a journey. It takes many turns, and I'm just grateful to be here.\"",
      "Cardman's co-pilot for the Crew 11 mission is NASA's Michael Fincke, a 58-year-old three-flight veteran who trained to fly aboard Boeing's Starliner as did Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui. In the wake of the problems encountered last year during the Starliner test flight, and the expected long delay before it's launched again, both ended up assigned to Crew 11.",
      "The fourth crew member is Russian cosmonaut Oleg Platonov, a space rookie. Like his crewmates, he also expected to fly aboard another spacecraft, in his case, a Russian Soyuz.",
      "But he ended up assigned to Crew 11 as part of a joint U.S.-Russian seat-swap program intended to ensure at least one representative of each country is always on board the ISS even if one crew ferry ship has to depart in an emergency, taking all of its crew members with it. Platonov is the seventh cosmonaut to fly aboard a Crew Dragon under theagreement.",
      "Fincke said the crew is more than ready for launch.",
      "\"Space has been calling my name ever since I returned from my last mission in 2011,\" he posted on the social media platform X. \"Our crew is ready. Let's do this! Go Falcon, Go Dragon, Go Crew-11!\"",
      "Their ride to the station \u2014 the Crew Dragon Endeavour \u2014 is making its sixth flight, a new record for NASA and SpaceX.",
      "Steven Stich, manager of NASA's commercial crew program, said SpaceX is working to certify Crew Dragons for up to 15 flights. The SpaceX ferry ships currently are certified for five flights, but Stich said a detailed analysis of Endeavour's flight history, performance and test results allowed NASA to clear the ship for a sixth flight.",
      "\"Our focus here is to really get to this particular launch, to make sure that we have everything cleared for six flights, and then down the road, we may have a little bit more work to do depending on the specific vehicle and how many flights it is.",
      "\"The overall goal was 15 flights, and we've gotten there on many components. Now we're just down to a handful that really are there (confirmed good) for only six flights.\"",
      "Catching up with the space station",
      "It will take the Crew Dragon 39 hours to catch up with the station early Saturday.",
      "After passing about 1,200 feet directly below the outpost, Endeavour will loop up, cross in front of the lab and then on up to a point directly above the forward Harmony module's space-facing port. From there, it will move straight down for docking around 3 a.m.",
      "The crew will be welcomed aboard by Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, pilot Nichole Ayers, Japanese station commander Takuya Onishi and cosmonaut Kirill Peskov, who were launched to the station on March 14. Also on hand will be Soyuz MS-27/73S cosmonauts Sergey Ryzhikov and Alexey Zubritsky along with NASA's Jonny Kim, launched from Kazakhstan on April 8.",
      "Also on board: clothing and personal items for Cardman that were launched last year before her expected Crew 9 flight. Included in those personal items were birthday cards, including one from her father, a physicist, who passed away last August just before NASA bumped Cardman from Crew 9.",
      "She will celebrate her next birthday, turning 38, in October.",
      "\"My parents knew that I would be on the space station for my birthday last year, we thought, so they sent a few items in advance so that I could feel at home while I was up there. And now I'll have the chance to see them,\" Cardman told CBS News.",
      "\"My whole history, the people who have brought me to where I am today, I think it's going to feel really special to feel that connection to my dad, to my parents on my birthday in space.\"",
      "Cardman and her crewmates are replacing the Crew 10 fliers, who plan to undock Aug. 6, splashing down in the Pacific Ocean off the southern California coast to close out a 145-day mission. Highlights included a spacewalk by McClain and Ayers and a non-stop schedule of research and station maintenance.",
      "\"I'm kind of looking forward to doing nothing for a couple of days,\" McClain joked when asked what she looked forward to the most about returning to Earth. Onishi said he was looking forward to seeing his family again, \"and also taking a hot shower on the ground!\"",
      "Added Ayers, who said she'll miss the opportunity to photograph Earth from the vantage point of space: \"In addition to what Anne and Tak said, I'm actually looking forward to a big, juicy burger on the beach.\"",
      "Planning for\u00a0months in orbit",
      "It's not yet known how long Crew 11 will be on board the space station.",
      "Up to this point, long-duration crews, U.S. and Russian, have typically spent around six months in orbit. But starting with the Soyuz MS-27/73S mission, the Russians have switched to eight-month stays. NASA may follow suit starting with the Crew 12 mission next year.",
      "The Trump administration's proposed budget for fiscal 2026 would reduce NASA funding by nearly 25 percent while directing the agency to scale back work aboard the ISS in favor of more aggressive planning for eventual crewed missions to Mars.",
      "NASA managers are now considering lengthening crew stays and possibly reducing Dragon crews from four to three and perhaps just two, one American and one Russian. A reduced crew would need fewer resupply missions, saving additional money. But it would sharply reduce the amount of research that could be carried out.",
      "No final decisions have been made.",
      "\"When we launch ... we have a six-month mission duration that we baseline,\" said Stich. \"We can extend the mission in real time as needed as we better understand the reconciliation bill and the appropriations process and what that means relative to the overall station manifest.\"",
      "For her part, Cardman said she would welcome an additional two months in orbit.",
      "\"I can't wait to be in space, and two extra months would be a gift,\" she said. \"Yes, we're baselined for six months right now, with the ability to extend that pending further analysis. For me, it would be an absolute privilege to stay for even longer.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 30 Jul 2025 11:53:00 -0400",
    "summary": "A new proposed bill would protect both workers and American consumers from bad experiences with AI.",
    "story": [
      "Have you ever found yourself repeating the words \"speak to a human please\" while on the phone with customer service? If so, you're among the roughly 70% of Americans who find interacting with automated phone systems, versus human customer support representatives, frustrating.",
      "That's in part why Senator Ruben Gallego wants to ensure that consumers who find themselves on the phone with a customer service agent are in fact speaking to a human, and one who is in the U.S., if that's their preference. He's also well aware of the threat artificial intelligence poses to American workers, and is committed to protecting the roughly three million Americans who work in call centers across the country, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.",
      "A new bipartisan bill, called the \"Keep Call Centers in America Act of 2025,\" introduced by Sen. Gallego and Sen. Jim Justice of West Virginia on Wednesday, proposes to ensure such jobs remain in the U.S. by limiting federal benefits for companies who ship them overseas.",
      "What does the bill require of companies?",
      "The bill would require businesses that decide to ship call centers overseas to notify the Department of Labor at least 120 days before making such a move. It would also direct the DOL to maintain a public list of employers that have relocated call center work overseas. Under the bill, employers would remain on the list for five years, absent efforts to return call center jobs to the U.S.",
      "Companies on such a list would be ineligible for new federal grants and federal guaranteed loans, under the proposed bill, while nonlisted companies would be given preference for federal contracts. Additionally, the DOL would be required to track any call center job losses related to AI.",
      "How would it protect consumers?",
      "To protect consumers, the bill would mandate that call center workers immediately disclose their physical locations to callers, and disclose whether AI is being used. Also, customers would be able to request to be transferred to a U.S.-based call center, if they so desired, under the proposed piece of legislation.",
      "\"People want to have the option of speaking to a human or AI. This isn't new \u2014who hasn't pressed zero repeatedly to try to skip the automated systems because they want to talk to a human? This is a consumer check people want to see,\" Sen. Gallego told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "In addition to supporting domestic jobs, keeping call center work in the U.S. helps safeguard American consumers' data, he said.",
      "\"We are concerned about what it means for American consumers if they're not talking to a human based in the U.S., when it comes to security around their private information,\" Sen. Gallego said.",
      "On the topic of AI taking over work currently performed by humans, Gallego acknowledged that the technology will inevitably bring about some job displacement.",
      "\"There will be changes and AI will cause some unemployment,\" he said. \"We can't stop it entirely.\"",
      "The senator added that he is not completely opposed to AI taking over some customer service work, either. \"If someone has a really good experience with an AI bot, there won't be a problem as long as that person knows they're talking to AI versus to a human,\" Gallego said.",
      "The Communications Workers of America (CWA) endorsed the proposed bill.",
      "\"This much-needed legislation protects U.S. call center jobs and addresses the growing threats posed by artificial intelligence and offshoring,\" (CWA) Director of Government Affairs, Dan Mauer said in a statement. \"Historically, companies have offshored customer service jobs to avoid paying good union wages and benefits. Now companies are using AI to de-skill and speed up work and displace jobs, which undermines worker rights and degrades service quality for consumers.\"",

      "Indeed and Glassdoor, the job search and employee review firms, are slashing a total of roughly 1,300 jobs as their parent company, Japan's Recruit Holdings, embraces artificial intelligence.",
      "In an email to employees Thursday, Recruit Holdings CEO Hisayuki \"Deko\" Idekoba said that \"AI is changing the world\" and that the company must adapt accordingly. The layoffs represent about 6% of Recruit Holdings' HR technology workforce.",
      "The cuts will target the companies' research and development, as well as \"people & sustainability,\" teams in the U.S., but other areas and regions will also be affected, according to Recruit Holdings. The company will send notices to employees who are losing their jobs on Thursday.",
      "The move reflects Recruit Holdings' focus on using AI to transform how job-seekers look for work and how employers handle recruitment. As part of that effort, the company will fold Glassdoor operations into Indeed, the company told CBS MoneyWatch. Glassdoor CEO Christian Sutherland-Wong is stepping down.",
      "\"[W]hen we think about HR industry, which is $300 billion-plus industry, but it includes like 60% or 65% of human labor manual cost. It's very difficult to find that big industry with such a high percentage of human labor manual cost,\" Idekoba said in May at a JPMorgan Chase technology conference. \"And so what we believe is, basically, how can we simplify hiring with using AI and technology and data to reduce manual work. That's what we are focusing on.\"",
      "He added that about one-third of the company's new programming code is written by AI, and that he expects that figure to jump to one-half. \"It's going to be 50% pretty soon,\" he said.",
      "The layoffs come as corporate leaders tout AI's capabilities, while some experts warn that the technology could lead to job losses. Speaking in June at the the Aspen Ideas Festival, for example, Ford CEO Jim Farley said AI is likely to replace half of all white-collar workers in the U.S.",

    "story": [
      "One of the strongest earthquakes ever recorded struck Russia's Far East early Wednesday, sending tsunami waves into Hawaii, the U.S. West Coast and Japan. Several people were injured, none gravely, and no major damage has been reported so far.",
      "The 8.8 magnitude temblor struck off the coast of the Kamchatka Peninsula, an isolated strip along the Pacific Ocean, overnight. Residents of the peninsula fled inland as 16-foot waves caused flooding.",
      "Immediately after the earthquake, Hawaii issued a tsunami warning and evacuation orders, but by Wednesday morning, the warning was downgraded to an advisory and evacuation orders were lifted on the Big Island and Oahu. Japan's Meteorological Agency also lowered its alerts to advisories.",
      "Hawaii emergency officials gave an all-clear by the afternoon and canceled the the tsunami advisory. The alerts remained in effect along Japan's east coast and southern islands.",
      "States on the U.S. West Coast were placed under a tsunami advisory that remained in effect until Wednesday morning. Many of the warnings in California had been lifted by Wednesday afternoon, with just an area near the California-Oregon border and Ripped Point, in the southern part of the state, under an advisory.",
      "U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem said the worst was over.",
      "\"We were fully deployed and ready to respond if necessary but grateful that we didn't have to deal with the situation that this could have been,\" she told reporters in Chile, where she is meeting officials.",
      "Alerts along South America's Pacific coast, including Chile, forced evacuations and closed beaches.",
      "Experts had warned earlier that the effects of the earthquake may continue through Wednesday.",
      "\"A tsunami is not just one wave,\" said Dan Snider, the tsunami warning coordinator with the National Tsunami Warning Center in Alaska. \"It's a series of powerful waves over a long period of time. Tsunamis cross the ocean at hundreds of miles an hour \u2014 as fast as a jet airplane \u2014 in deep water. But when they get close to the shore, they slow down and start to pile up. And that's where that inundation problem becomes a little bit more possible there.\"",
      "\"In this case, because of the Earth basically sending out these huge ripples of water across the ocean, they're going to be moving back and forth for quite a while,\" which is why some communities may feel effects longer, he said.",
      "Hawaii sees minor flooding and small waves",
      "The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, which lifted the Hawaii warning, had forecast that the estimated arrival time of the first tsunami waves there would be 7:17 p.m. Tuesday local time (1:17 a.m. Wednesday ET). Officials urged people to move inland and shelters were opened in many parts of Hawaii. Hawaii Gov. Josh Green said that Black Hawk helicopters had been activated and high-water vehicles were on standby in case authorities needed to conduct rescue operations.",
      "So far no damage has been recorded, but it will take two to three hours of observation before authorities will be able to determine whether the event has passed, Green said.",
      "Green said data from Midway Atoll, a small island between Japan and Hawaii, measured waves that were about 6 feet from peak to trough. He warned that waves hitting Hawaii could be bigger or smaller.",
      "Cars jammed streets and highways in Honolulu, even in areas away from the shore, as people tried to evacuate. Jimmy Markowski, who was visiting Honolulu's Waikiki Beach, said that the roads on the island were packed.",

      "The PTSC said the Hilo, Hawaii, gauge recorded a tsunami height of 4.9 feet relative to normal sea levels and the Kahului, Maui, gauge recorded a tsunami height of 4 feet.",
      "At around 10 p.m. local time, Pacific Tsunami Warning Center director Chip McCreery said wave heights appeared to have peaked.",
      "West Coast feels some effects",
      "The Oregon Department of Emergency Management said on Facebook at around 3 a.m. local time that small tsunami waves were expected along the coast and urged people to stay away from beaches, harbors and marinas and to remain in a safe location away from the coast until the advisory is lifted.",
      "\"This is not a major tsunami, but dangerous currents and strong waves may pose a risk to those near the water,\" the department said.",
      "A tsunami warning was posted for a portion of the California coast near the border with Oregon. It was later lowered to an advisory. California Gov. Gavin Newsom posted a\u00a0statement on X\u00a0saying the state's Office of Emergency Services was coordinating with local officials in Northern California, from Cape Mendocino to the Oregon border.",
      "By Wednesday afternoon, most advisories along the California coast were lifted. The alert for Washington state was also lifted.",

      "Check out this time lapse of the Pillar Point Harbor in Half Moon Bay. Notice the abrupt up and down motion of the boats. A tsunami is not just one wave. It's a packet of waves that can last for several hours. This rapid surging of water can create dangerous currents.#tsunami pic.twitter.com/qu5joaFgLG",
      "The National Weather Service said on X that tsunami waves arrived in Monterey around 12:48 a.m. PT. Other cities along the California coast reported small to moderate-sized tsunami waves. A video shared by the National Weather Service Bay Area showed boats bobbing up and down in a harbor as they were rocked by small tsunami waves.",
      "The National Weather Service in Eureka, California,\u00a0said around 4 a.m. local time that Crescent City had seen tsunami waves of about 3.5 feet, with activity building as the region approached a minor high tide. High tide could lead to more flooding. Crescent City has seen dozens of tsunamis since the 1930s, including a 1964 event that killed 11 people and destroyed hundreds of buildings.",
      "The National Weather Service Bay Area warned that even if the waves are small, they can cause \"seriously dangerous\" currents. The first waves also may not be the highest, the agency said, warning people to avoid coastal areas until told it's safe.",
      "On Alaska's Aleutian Islands, officials recorded waves up to 1.4 feet above tide levels.",
      "Kamchatka sees flooding, volcanic activity",
      "The quake was centered about 74 miles east-southeast of the Russian city of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, which has a population of 180,000. Multiple aftershocks as strong as 6.9 magnitude followed and experts predict aftershocks of up to 7.5 for at least a month, according to the Russian News agency TASS.",
      "The temblor appeared to be the strongest anywhere in the world since the 9.1 magnitude earthquake off northeastern Japan in March 2011 that caused a massive tsunami that set off meltdowns at a nuclear power plant. Only a few stronger earthquakes have ever been measured around the world.",
      "Earlier this month, five powerful quakes \u2014 the largest with a magnitude of 7.4 \u2014 struck in the sea near Kamchatka. The largest was at a depth of 12.4 miles and was 89 miles east of the city of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky.",
      "The Kremlin said regional authorities on Kamchatka were well prepared for the quake. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov noted that the warnings were issued timely and people were quickly evacuated from dangerous areas. He added that the buildings proved resilient to shocks.",
      "A video released by a Russian media outlet showed a team of doctors at a cancer clinic on Kamchatka holding a patient and clutching medical equipment as the quake rocked an operating room, before continuing with surgery after the shaking stopped. Officials said the doctors will receive decorations.",
      "Tsunami heights of about 9 to 13 feet were recorded in Kamchatka. Severokurilsk Mayor Alexander Ovsyannikov said the port in the city was flooded by tsunami waves, washing fishing boats into the sea. He said no major damage was recorded. Authorities on the Kamchatka peninsula lifted the tsunami warning for the area, some 11 hours after the quake hit. Russian authorities said several people were injured, without giving a figure. The risk of aftershocks and waves remains, officials said.",
      "On Wednesday, lava began to flow from Klyuchevskaya Sopka, the largest active volcano in the northern hemisphere. The 15,584-foot volcano, located in the east of Kamchatka, last erupted in 2023. Observers heard explosions and saw streams of lava on the volcano's western slopes, the Kamchatka branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences' geophysical service said.",
      "Scientists have anticipated an eruption, with the volcano's crater filling with lava for several weeks and the mountain spitting out plumes of ash.",
      "\"The Klyuchevskoy is erupting right now,\" the Russian Geophysical Survey said on Telegram, posting photos of an orange blaze on top of the volcano and adding that \"red-hot lava is observed flowing down the western slope. There is a powerful glow above the volcano and explosions.\"",
      "Sometimes described as the \"land of fire and ice,\" Kamchatka is one of the most active volcanic regions in the world. It has about 300 volcanoes, of which 29 are active, according to NASA Earth Observatory.",
      "Earthquake sparks international response",
      "The quake had a preliminary magnitude of 8.0, Japanese and U.S. seismologists said. The U.S. Geological Survey later updated its strength to 8.8 magnitude and a depth of 13 miles.",
      "People went to evacuation centers in affected areas of Japan, with memories fresh of the 2011 earthquake and tsunami that caused reactor meltdowns at a nuclear power plant. The tsunami alert disrupted transportation, with ferries, trains and airports in the affected area suspending or delaying some operations.",
      "Waves of about 2 feet were recorded on Japan's northern island of Hokkaido, and at least one person was injured.",
      "Japan's Fire and Disaster Management Agency said nearly 2 million residents are now under evacuation advisories in more than 220 municipalities along the Pacific coast as of midday Wednesday. Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said waves could remain high for at least one day, and he urged evacuees to take precautions and stay well hydrated in the summer heat. He told evacuees they might not be able to return home by the end of the day on Wednesday.",
      "No abnormalities in operations at Japan's nuclear plants were reported on Wednesday. The operator of the Fukushima Daiichi plant, heavily damaged by the 2011 tsunami, said about 4,000 workers are taking shelter on higher ground at the plant complex while monitoring remotely to ensure safety.",
      "China's Ministry of Natural Resources' Tsunami Warning Center issued an alert for parts of the country's east coast along Shanghai and Zhejiang provinces. The warning forecasted that waves could reach between one to three feet. The provinces are already under an alert as Typhoon CoMay is expected to land in the Zhejiang province on Wednesday.",
      "Some tiny and low-lying Pacific island chains are among the world's most imperiled by tsunamis and rising seas due to\u00a0climate change. People were urged to stay away from coastlines until any wave surges passed late Wednesday in Fiji, Samoa, Tonga, Federated States of Micronesia and Solomon Islands. Philippine authorities advised people to stay away from the beach and coastal areas.",
      "\"It may not be the largest of waves, but these can continue for hours and expose people swimming in the waters to danger,\" Teresito Bacolcol of the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology told The Associated Press.",
      "Elsewhere, a tsunami of under a foot was forecast to hit parts of Vancouver Island, British Columbia. Mexico's navy warned that tsunami waves will start reaching the northern coast in Ensenada, near California, at around 2:22 a.m. Wednesday local time, and waves could progress along the Pacific coast to Chiapas state, around 7:15 a.m. local time.",
      "In Chile, tsunami warnings were upgraded to their highest level on Wednesday morning. The alert covers most of the nation's 4,000-mile Pacific coastline. The country's Education Ministry also canceled classes along much of the coast.",
      "Colombian officials ordered the complete closure and evacuation of beaches and low-tide areas while maritime traffic was being restricted.",
      "Education officials in Ecuador canceled classes at schools in the Galapagos Islands as well as communities along the coast.",
      "New Zealand authorities warned of \"strong and unusual currents and unpredictable surges\" along all coastlines of the South Pacific island nation. The emergency management agency said people should move out of the water, off beaches and away from harbors, marinas, rivers and estuaries.",
      "How are tsunami probabilities categorized?",
      "There are four levels of tsunami alerts: warning, advisory, watch and information statement, according to the\u00a0National Weather Service.",
      "A tsunami warning is the most severe. It means residents should take action due to a coming tsunami that may cause widespread flooding.",
      "A tsunami advisory means there's the potential for \"strong currents or waves dangerous to those in or very near the water,\" according to the NWS.",
      "A tsunami watch advises those to be prepared because a distant earthquake has occurred and a tsunami is possible.",
      "The lowest level of alert is a tsunami information statement from the NWS, which advises people to \"relax\" since an earthquake has occurred, but there is no threat or it was very far away.",

      "A New Mexico judge has dismissed a lawsuit filed by actor Alec Baldwin for malicious prosecution and civil rights violations in the 2021 fatal shooting of a cinematographer on the set of the Western movie \"Rust.\"",
      "The judge in a ruling made public Wednesday dismissed the case without prejudice for lack of any significant action with the claim, which was filed in state district court earlier this year. Baldwin's attorneys will have 30 days to file a motion seeking reinstatement.",
      "Luke Nikas, Baldwin's lead attorney, told The Associated Press in an email that the dismissal amounted to a nonevent since his team has been waiting to prosecute the case.",
      "\"We have been in good-faith settlement discussions with the parties to the lawsuit and will be refiling promptly if those discussions are not promptly and favorably resolved,\" he said.",

The trial was upended by revelations that ammunition was brought into the Santa Fe County sheriff's office months earlier by a man who said it could be related to the killing of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins.",
      "The allegations in Baldwin's tort claim include defamation, with his attorneys saying that prosecutors and investigators targeted the actor and coproducer for professional or political gain.",

    "published": "Wed, 30 Jul 2025 20:37:04 -0400",
    "summary": "The National Transportation Safety Board released new surveillance video during investigative hearings on January's deadly midair collision over Washington, D.C.",
    "story": [
      "The first day of the three-day investigative hearings on the deadly midair collision over Washington, D.C., in January ended with more questions about what caused the crash between a passenger plane and an Army helicopter.",
      "The American Airlines flight from Wichita, Kansas, collided with a\u00a0Black Hawk helicopter\u00a0while coming in for a landing at Ronald Reagan National Airport on Jan. 29, killing all\u00a067 people\u00a0aboard both aircraft. The National Transportation Safety Board on Wednesday questioned witnesses from the Federal Aviation Administration and the Army about how the actions of air traffic controllers and Army officials may have contributed to the nation's deadliest plane crash since November 2001.",
      "\"This hearing is a critical part of our ongoing investigation,\" NTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy said in her opening remarks in the nation's capital. Addressing family members of some of the crash victims attending the hearing, she said, \"Please know that we are working diligently to make sure we know what occurred, how it occurred, and to prevent it from ever happening again.\"",
      "The hearing began around 9 a.m. and stretched into 7 p.m. In the last half hour, Homendy became upset, saying, \"Every sign was there that there was a safety risk\" in the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport airspace.",
      "Newly released video of midair impact",
      "The NTSB's lead investigator began by presenting an 11-minute animation that recreated events leading up to the collision. At the end, it included newly released surveillance video with a clear view of the Black Hawk helicopter approaching the path of American Airlines Flight 5342, followed by the midair impact. Before the video was played, families attending the hearing were allowed to leave the room.",
      "The plane's cockpit voice recorder showed that approximately 20 seconds before the collision, the pilots received an audible warning from the Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) noting \"traffic,\" but not giving them a resolution advisory to take action. Just one to two seconds before the collision, there's a sound of a click and one of the pilots exclaims, \"Oh,\" followed by an expletive. From another document released in the investigation, it appears the pilots pulled back fully on the yoke to try to avoid the collision.",
      "Tim Lilley, whose son Sam was the plane's first officer, told CBS News he hopes the hearing will help him learn more about those final moments.",
      "\"I know that my son saw that helicopter one second before impact, and they tried very hard to avoid it,\" Lilley said. \"Sam was a good pilot, and he would have been trying to fly that aircraft all the way, all the way to the bottom.\"",
      "The cockpit voice recorder transcript also shows that as the pilots approached for landing, they had a visual on runway 1 when air traffic controllers asked them to take runway 33 instead. The pilots discussed it between themselves, with one saying, \"I really don't want to but I guess\u2026,\" then said, \"it's fine,\" adding, \"tell 'em we're fine we'll do three-three, we'll do it.\"",
      "The collision, which sent wreckage plummeting into the Potomac River, was the first in a string of crashes and near\u00a0misses this year that have alarmed officials and the traveling public, despite statistics that still show flying remains the safest form of transportation.",
      "Investigations have already shown the FAA failed to recognize a troubling history of 85 near misses around Reagan airport in the years before the collision, and that the Army's helicopters routinely flew around the nation's capital with a key piece of locating equipment, known as ADS-B Out, turned off.",
      "Multiple sources told CBS News in February that top officials at the FAA pushed last summer to close one of three runways at Reagan airport following two close calls between airliners still on the ground.",
      "In April, the FAA brought in a new management team to the air traffic control tower at Reagan National Airport, replacing three senior managers. Homendy blasted FAA officials at the hearing on Wednesday over the move.",
      "\"What you did is you transferred people out instead of taking ownership over the fact that everybody in FAA, in the tower, was saying there was a problem,\" Homendy said. \"Are you kidding me? Sixty-seven people are dead. How do you explain that? Our bureaucratic process?\"",
      "Aviation attorney Bob Clifford, who is working to file one of the first lawsuits against the government next month, said he hopes NTSB will look beyond the immediate factors that caused this crash to highlight the bigger ongoing concerns in the crowded Washington airspace.",
      "\"In this particular instance, there's a much broader picture. And that is the known problems that were being ignored about an unsafe environment for the commercial aircraft to be navigating with the military aviation helicopters in the area,\" Clifford said.",
      "Legislation to require upgraded technology",
      "Even though the final NTSB report won't be released until sometime next year, Sen. Ted Cruz isn't waiting to propose changes. He introduced legislation Tuesday that would require all aircraft operators to use both forms of ADS-B, or Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast, the technology to broadcast aircraft location data to other planes and air traffic controllers. Most aircraft today are equipped with ADS-B Out equipment but the airlines would have to add the more comprehensive ADS-B In technology to their planes.",
      "\"There cannot be a double standard in aviation safety,\" Cruz said. \"We should not tolerate special exceptions for military training flights, operating in congested air space.\"",
      "The legislation would revoke an exemption on ADS-B transmission requests for Department of Defense aircrafts. It also would require the FAA to evaluate helicopter routes near airports and require the Army Inspector General to review the Army's aviation safety practices.",
      "Homendy said her agency has been recommending that move for decades after several other crashes.",
      "\"In 2008, we sent a letter to FAA stating the board believes that the equipage of aircraft with ADS-B In capability will provide \u2014 and I want to stress this \u2014 an immediate and substantial contribution to safety, especially during operations in and around airports,\" she said.",
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said that while he'd like to discuss \"a few tweaks,\" the legislation is \"the right approach.\" He also suggested that the previous administration \"was asleep at the wheel\" amid dozens of near-misses in the airspace around Washington's airspace.",
      "\"In the past, people became complacent \u2014 leaders became complacent,\" Duffy said.",
      "A \"fact-finding proceeding\"",
      "Homendy said the hearings over the next few days will be a \"fact-finding proceeding.\" In addition, the NTSB is also posting thousands of pages of evidence from the crash investigation online.",
      "FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford said that he expects \"we're going to have some very uncomfortable conversations over the next two and a half days\" but that \"they need to be had in the clear light of day \u2014 and simply put the best interest of the traveling public ahead of any of our personal interests, perhaps.\"",
      "The hearings in Washington involve NTSB board members, investigators and witnesses for organizations involved in the crash. Panels will focus on military helicopter routes in the Washington area, collision avoidance technology and training for air traffic controllers at Ronald Reagan National Airport, among other subjects.",
      "Federal officials have also raised concerns over the nation's outdated and understaffed air traffic control system. During January's midair crash above Washington, one controller was handling both commercial airline and helicopter traffic at the busy airport.",
      "Duffy has announced a multibillion-dollar plan to overhaul the system controllers use that relies on old technology like floppy disks.",
      "Kris  Van Cleave and \n                                                  \n                      Kathryn  Krupnik\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

      "The decision to hold rates steady marks a continuation of the Fed's \"wait-and-see\" strategy this year, as it monitors the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs on consumer prices. But Wednesday's policy statement also underscored that the growth remains steady despite concerns about slowing economic activity.",
      "\"Although swings in net exports continue to affect the data, recent indicators suggest that growth of economic activity moderated in the first half of the year,\" the Federal Open Market Committee, the 12-person central bank's rate-setting panel, said in its statement. \"The unemployment rate remains low, and labor market conditions remain solid. Inflation remains somewhat elevated.\"",

      "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has faced pressure in recent months from President Trump to lower rates, with the president arguing that inflation remains relatively tame.",
      "In a press conference on Wednesday, Powell said most FOMC members voted in favor of maintaining the current rate because inflation remains above the Fed's 2% annual target, while also describing the economy as remaining in good shape.",
      "\"The economy is not performing as though restrictive policy were holding it back inappropriately,\" he said.",
      "Powell added, \"The economy is in good shape, but it's an unusual situation in that you have risks to both sides of the mandate,\" referring to the Fed's dual goal of keeping both prices and unemployment low.",

      "The Fed's Powell has signaled the Fed remains cautious about lowering rates given the potential impact of the Trump administration's tariffs, which he has said could dent economic growth and reignite inflation.",
      "Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, thinks the dissents by Bowman and Waller represent a minority opinion on the FOMC, with most of the rate-setting panel's voting members preferring to hold rates steady amid amid concern about inflation.",
      "Inflation remains above the Fed's 2% target, with the Consumer Price Index rising\u00a0in June to an annualized rate of 2.7%. At the same time, the economy remains solid. The economy grew at a stronger-than-expected 3% rate between April and June, according to data released Wednesday, with economists saying the rebound in growth from earlier this year supports the Fed's argument for keeping rates steady.",
      "\"This [GDP] report is unlikely to shift the Federal Reserve's stance,\" said Gina Bolvin, president of Bolvin Wealth Management Group, in an email prior to the Fed's decision. The central bank will \"wait for more consistent signals before considering rate cuts.\"",
      "When could the Fed cut rates?",
      "Economists currently predict a 63% likelihood the Fed will cut rates at its two-day meeting on Sept. 16-17, according to FactSet. The FOMC, the central bank's rate-setting panel, doesn't meet in August, making the September meeting the next chance for a rate cut.",
      "Although the economy has proved resilient despite concerns about the impact of U.S. tariffs, some economists expect growth to lag and inflation to accelerate over the next few months. Following the latest Fed statement, Pantheon Macroeconomics chief U.S. economist Samuel Tombs forecast that the Fed will ease its benchmark rate by a total of 0.75 percentage points by year-end, starting in September.",
      "Asked whether the Fed could cut rates at the September meeting, Powell demurred, saying that the decision will be based on economic data that is released between now and the central bank's next meeting on Sept. 16-17. In the lead-up to that decision, the Fed will assess two monthly job reports from the Department of Labor and two additional months' of CPI data.",
      "Mr. Trump on Wednesday announced a 25% tariff rate on imports from India ahead of his administration's Aug. 1 deadline to strike trade deals with dozens of other countries. American importers such as Walmart are on the hook for paying the tariffs, although many companies stocked up on goods earlier this year to try to avoid hiking prices for inflation-weary customers.",
      "\"We know from surveys that companies have every intention of putting [the tariff costs] through to consumers,\" Powell said. \"A reasonable base case is these are one-time price effects.\"",
      "He added, \"We will make sure this doesn't move from being a one-time price increase to serious inflation.\"",
      "Powell's remarks emphasizing the solid U.S. economy, as well as the risks from tariffs, signaled to some economists that a September rate cut might not be in the cards.",
      "\" For [a September rate cut] to happen, the rest of the FOMC will need to become either less concerned about the inflation outlook or more concerned about the economic and labor market outlook,\" said Capital Economics deputy chief North American economist Stephen Brown in a report.",

    "summary": "The country's GDP increased at an annual rate of 3%, a sharp turnaround from earlier this year when it fell 0.5%.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. economy surged between April and June after shrinking in the first three months of the year, driven by a large shift in imports tied to President Trump's trade policies.",
      "By the numbers",
      "The country's GDP increased at an annual rate of 3% in the second quarter, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. That's higher than the 2% pace forecast for the April-to-June period, according to economists polled by financial data firm FactSet.",
      "The number represents a turnaround from the first three months of 2025, when GDP fell 0.5%, the worst quarterly performance for the economy since early 2022. The new data also shows consumers increased spending since the last quarter, with growth of 1.4%, up from 0.5% from January to March. The number is still down significantly from 4% in the\u00a0final\u00a0quarter of 2024.",
      "When it comes to assessing the strength of the economy, a more revealing number tucked into the GDP report is what is known as \"final sales to private domestic purchasers,\" which excludes government spending, inventories and net exports. That number rose at only a 1.2% annual rate from April to May \u2014 the weakest since late 2022 and a sign that demand is weakening.",
      "What the numbers mean",
      "GDP data offers a broad yardstick for measuring the overall health of the economy, with periods of fast growth typically coinciding with robust consumer spending, ample job growth and healthy corporate profits. This year, however, experts say the Trump administration's tariffs on U.S. economic partners have complicated the picture.",
      "\"As was the case in Q1, volatile trade flows are skewing the GDP performance (the 3% growth primarily reflects a decrease in imports and an acceleration in consumer spending that were partially offset by a downturn in investment),\" Adam Crisafulli, head of investment research firm Vital Knowledge, said in a report.",
      "Thomas Ryan, North America economist at investor advisory firm Capital Economics, said in a note that the surge in GDP \"overstates the economy's underlying strength\" because the growth spurt in the second quarter was largely driven by a 30% decline in imports after U.S. tariffs took effect.",
      "GDP slumped in the first quarter, falling 0.5% from January to March, largely due to a surge in U.S. imports as consumers and businesses rushed to buy goods from abroad before stepped-up tariffs took effect.",
      "In calculating GDP, imports are seen as reducing growth because they reflect purchases from overseas, rather than goods and services produced in the U.S. By contrast, exports boost a country's GDP because they reflect domestic goods and services that were sold abroad.",
      "The upshot: Through the first half of 2025, the economy grew at an average rate of 1.25%. That's markedly slower than the pace of growth in 2024, when GDP for the full year rose 2.8%, noted Dean Baker, a senior economist at Center for Economic and Policy Research.",
      "Where the economy is headed",
      "Although the 3% GDP rate in Wednesday's report may be skewed by the president's trade policies, experts say the overall economy remains solid and shows no signs of crumbling.",
      "\"Beneath the topline figure, the economy is switching to a lower gear but not going in reverse,\" Bernard Yaros, lead US economist at Oxford Economics, said in a research note.",
      "Yaros added that consumers are slowing \u2014 but not switching off \u2014 their spending, which accounts for roughly two-thirds economic activity.",
      "Still, EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco notes that economic activity is slowing as inflationary pressures rise \u2014 a trend likely to persist throughout the summer. He predicts real GDP growth to slow to a rate of 0.9% year over year by the fourth quarter.",
      "Another indicator of the health of the economy will come Wednesday afternoon, when the Federal Reserve announces its rate decision. The central bank is again expected to hold rates steady. The Labor Department is also scheduled to release its monthly jobs report on Friday, offering a snapshot of how the labor market is faring.",

      "When Angela Craig went on life support on March 15, 2023, in Aurora, Colorado, police assigned a homicide detective to investigate her case \u2014 even as she was still alive. Three days later, and only hours after Angela Craig was declared dead, her husband, Dr. James Craig would be arrested and charged with her murder. James Craig has pleaded not guilty.",
      "The story of why police allege James Craig murdered his wife and why police made that arrest so quickly all traces back to a package that police say was delivered to James Craig's dental office just five days before Angela Craig died.",
      "That story of the dentist, his wife's death and that suspicious package is told by \"48 Hours\" contributor Natalie Morales in an encore of \u00a0\"Who Poisoned Angela Craig?\" \u2014 airing Saturday, Jan. 4, 2025 at 9/8c on CBS and streaming on Paramount+.",
      "The Craigs married in 1999 and moved to Aurora where they would raise their six children. Their lives were steeped in their community\u2014their church, their children and James Craig's dental practice, Summerbrook Dental, which was well known in Aurora.",
      "The podcast and the podcaster",
      "Steffan Tubbs, a former radio host and podcaster, first met James Craig when he was a patient at Summerbrook Dental. So when Tubbs saw the news in March 2023 that Dr. Craig had been arrested for Angela's murder, he was stunned. \"I couldn't believe the allegations \u2026 I couldn't believe the mugshot. There's my dentist. A mugshot,\" Tubbs told \"48 Hours.\"",
      "Tubbs reported on James Craig's arrest in his radio show, and within days had launched a podcast to explore the alleged facts of the case. In that podcast, Tubbs reviewed the\u00a052-page arrest warrant that police released when they charged James Craig with murder. Tubbs said of that warrant, \"In nearly 34 years of being a newsman, the most unbelievable and seemingly thorough arrest affidavit I have ever read.\"",
      "Tubbs had first known James Craig as his dentist, but he got to know Craig better while working on radio ads for Summerbrook Dental, at Tubbs' former radio station. Tubbs had also met Angela Craig at those meetings and says her energy and intelligence stood out. \"She was not somebody to just sit there and stay quiet. She was engaged in the dental practice,\" Tubbs said, adding that Angela Craig \"was somebody who was talking about ideas, and their marketing, their message.\" Tubbs thought it was great to see such a successful family business seemingly thriving in Colorado.",
      "Angela Craig was 43 years old when she died, and mother to those six children with James Craig. Former employees and friends told \"48 Hours\" that she had always seemed happy and healthy. In that warrant, police note that Angela and Jim Craig were known to work out together in the mornings, and that James would make Angela a morning protein shake as part of that daily routine.",
      "Angela Craig's mysterious illness begins",
      "Angela Craig's medical troubles had begun on March 6, 2023, when she first started feeling sick. According to that arrest warrant, she texted her husband that morning, writing, \"I don't feel right in my head.\" James Craig texted her back asking, \"do I need to come home?\" and Angela Craig replied \"No\u2026this is just weird. I'm dizzy in my head and my eyes are working slowly and my body is responding slowly.\"",
      "The warrant shows James Craig texted, \"Do you get lightheaded when you stand up?\" and that Angela Craig texted back, \"It feels more like I feel when I take heavy meds and everything adjusts and moves slowly. Like I'm moving in thick gel. My eyes are struggling to stay focused.\" She later texted James Craig, \"I feel drugged\" and soon he did come home and took Angela Craig to the ER.",
      "The warrant says Angela Craig was released from the ER that same day but was back at the hospital three days later, this time as an admitted patient. Angela Craig underwent a series of tests and treatments, but doctors were still struggling to figure out what was wrong. It was during that second hospital visit when a curious thing happened at Summerbrook Dental. It would become a key piece of evidence in a murder investigation.",
      "A package arrives",
      "According to the warrant, James Craig had told his office manager that he was expecting a \"personal package\" and \"not to open it.\" That package arrived on March 13, while Angela Craig was still in the hospital, and, according to the warrant, a staff member, not knowing about those instructions, had opened it. The warrant says that the office manager, closing the box back up for Dr. Craig, saw it contained a canister labeled \"potassium cyanide.\" Police say the package was then hand delivered to Dr. Craig.",
      "Angela Craig was released from her second hospital visit on March 14, the day after that package is alleged to have been delivered to Summerbrook Dental. She had still not been diagnosed but seemed well enough at that moment.",
      "Unfortunately, that moment would not last. The next morning, on March 15, 2023, Angela Craig was back in the hospital, seemingly sicker than ever. She would never come out.",
      "Police say James Craig arrived at the hospital on March 15 soon after Angela Craig but didn't stay long. The warrant says he soon went home and returned roughly an hour-and-a-half later, carrying food. Police say he then went into Angela Craig's room alone and that soon after she had a seizure and her vital signs crashed.",
      "That's when James Craig took photos of his wife, sending them to their friend Michelle Redfearn, a trained nurse married to James Craig's business partner and friend from dental school, Ryan Redfearn. When the Redfearns got those photos and James Craig's text \u2014 that read in part, \"crash. intubated. doc says she's 'very very worried'\" \u2014 they raced to the hospital.",
      "On their way, Ryan Redfearn would later tell police, he got a phone call from the office. That phone call was to alert Ryan Redfearn about that package marked \"potassium cyanide\" that a staffer said had been delivered and opened. That same employee, hearing of Angela Craig's symptoms, had Googled them, and, according to the warrant, was worried Angela Craig may have been poisoned. When the employee saw that Angela's symptoms lined up with the symptoms for cyanide poisoning, she made a phone call.",
      "After arriving at the hospital, Ryan Redfearn would later tell police he saw James Craig crying after talking to a doctor. But Ryan Redfearn did not seem convinced those tears were real. He took a nurse aside and shared the story about that package marked \"potassium cyanide\" that had been delivered to James Craig just two days prior.",
      "The warrant says that nurse, being a mandatory reporter, called police and within hours members of the homicide unit from the Aurora Police Department had launched an investigation. By this time, Angela Craig was on life support, and the outlook was grim.",
      "A phone call between partners",
      "Later that same day, the warrant says, Ryan Redfearn was with Michelle Redfearn in the hospital parking lot when they got a phone call from James Craig. Ryan Redfearn said James Craig asked him if he had spoken to police. Ryan Redfearn told him that he had and that he had heard about that package allegedly marked \"potassium cyanide.\"",
      "According to the warrant, James Craig then told Ryan Redfearn that the package contained a ring for Angela. Ryan Redfearn says he told James Craig that someone had opened that package and seen that container marked cyanide. And, according to the warrant, Ryan Redfearn soon ended that phone call, telling James Craig to \"stop talking and get a lawyer.\"",
      "The next morning, the warrant says, James Craig sent Ryan Redfearn \u00a0a lengthy text, writing, in part: \"I want to make an urgent plea to you,\" it went on \"Please don't talk to anyone \u2026 including any law enforcement officers. You are under no obligation to answer their questions unless you are served a subpoena and you will do more damage than good to my family by continuing to insert yourself into this.\"",
      "In an interview with Natalie Morales, former Arapahoe County District Attorney George Brauchler, when asked about that text said, \"I'm trying to think of all the innocent applications of the phrase, please don't talk to the police. I can't come up with any.\"",
      "Still, as James Craig is awaiting trial, the defense has not yet had the chance to present its case to a jury. At a preliminary hearing in July 2023, Craig's attorney stated that he had struggled with depression in the past and had sought counseling.",
      "Utah-based defense attorney Skye Lazaro is not a part of this case, but has worked on other cases involving poison, and reviewed the records available at the time. Lazaro told Morales it's possible James Craig's defense could argue he was looking for poison not to kill Angela Craig but to kill himself. Lazaro also said she thinks the defense could argue that James Craig's arrest was rushed and that police didn't take the time to explore other theories of how Angela Craig may have died, including the possibility that Angela may have sought to die by suicide \u2014 or that James Craig had.",
      "Lazaro also noted that during that preliminary hearing, the defense emphasized that the lead detective had acknowledged that police had not yet found evidence of poison in the materials they had tested\u2014including bottles and syringes from the Craig's home.",
      "At trial, jurors will likely hear how that accidental discovery at Summerbrook Dental led to a murder investigation and James Craig's arrest. Brauchler told Morales that what happened from there \"is a testament to Ryan Redfearn\" and what he told the nurse that day.",

      "George Brauchler: Ryan Redfearn went to dental school with Jim Craig all those 20-plus years ago. He'd known him all that time. \u2026 He was a close confidant.",
      "And with Angela Craig so sick, according to the warrant, James Craig also texted with Ryan's wife, Michelle Redfearn, trained as a nurse.",
      "Natalie Morales: What were they texting about?",
      "George Brauchler: The texts were really the kinds of things you would exchange with someone who's another medical professional. I mean, he was talking about blood pressure. He was talking about concerns the doctors had expressed about symptomology \u2026 that should have resolved by now.",
      "But one of James Craig's texts, in retrospect, seemed odd, as it appeared he was making light of Angela's mysterious illness.",

      "Steffan Tubbs: I have thought about every agonizing minute that Angela Craig was in.",
      "But over the next day Angela Craig seemed to stabilize. And on March 14,\u00a0 still with no answers as to why she was sick, Angela was released from Parker Adventist. Once again, Angela Craig came home to her husband of 23 years. But she wouldn't be home for long. Within a day she started feeling sick again.",

Police say he then went into Angela Craig's room, alone. Soon after, Angela Craig had a seizure and once again her vital signs crashed.",

      "But according to police, Ryan Redfearn was far from convinced those tears were real. That's because, on his way to the hospital, he had gotten a call from a staff member at the office. The call was to alert Ryan Redfearn about that package marked potassium cyanide that had arrived at Summerbrook Dental \u2014 allegedly addressed and later given to James Craig.",

      "Just a week before Angela Craig got sick, according to the warrant, James Craig set up a new email account using the alias \"Jim and Waffles\" and used it to research multiple poisons \u2014 all part of his plan, according to investigators, to murder Angela Craig.",

      "James Craig, investigators say, also found videos online with titles like \"Top 5 Undetectable Poisons That Show No Sign Of Foul Play.\"",
      "And police say on the same day he did that online research, James Craig made a purchase \u2014 arsenic \u2014 and had it delivered straight to his family's mailbox.",

      "Natalie Morales: Let's start with arsenic.",

      "Natalie Morales: How much would kill a person?",
      "Dr. Jeff LaPoint: It does not take very much.",
      "But police say there was more. A week after he purchased that arsenic, they allege James Craig \u2014 as \"Jim and Waffles\"\u2014 went back online. He ordered a second poison.",
      "Natalie Morales: Oleandrin, what is that?",
      "Dr. Jeff LaPoint: So, oleandrin is a toxin found in oleander.",
      "Natalie Morales: I'm thinking of those white flowers.",
      "Jeff LaPoint: Yeah, they're really beautiful.",
      "As lovely as a rose. Only deadly.",
      "Dr. Jeff LaPoint: It prevents the heart from beating very efficiently.",
      "But after three days, the oleandrin hadn't been delivered. That's when investigators say James Craig upped the ante. Police say he placed an order with a medical supply company for his strongest toxin yet: potassium cyanide.",
      "Dr. Jeff LaPoint: Cyanide is one of the most effective poisons that exist.",
      "Natalie Morales: Just a microdose could kill you then?",
      "Dr. Jeff LaPoint: Yeah, a very small amount per kilogram and you're not gonna live. \u2026 When you are poisoned with cyanide, you're being suffocated on a cellular level. \u2026 It's a very potent poison. \u2026 Your victim would die very rapidly.",
      "Cyanide is so deadly that you need a medical license to buy it. And police say that when Dr. James Craig placed his order from a medical supply company, he stated he needed it for a complex dental procedure.",
      "Dr. Jeff LaPoint: There's no use for potassium cyanide in my practice or I can't think of many medical practices.",
      "Natalie Morales: So, a dentist ordering arsenic, potassium cyanide and oleandrin \u2026 What does that suggest to you?",
      "Dr. Jeff LaPoint: Someone is trying to collect poison.",

      "Detectives suspected James Craig had bought all those poisons to kill his wife, but they wanted to know why. They would find a lead miles away from Aurora on a trip James Craig made \u2014 and a woman he met \u2014 just before Angela Craig got sick.",
      "Steffan Tubbs: Doesn't it just always seem like there's another woman involved? Always, almost always.",
      "\"What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas.\" It's a rule of the road there, but investigators allege it is yet one more rule James Craig didn't think he had to play by, when he met Karin Cain.",
      "Steffan Tubbs: Karin Cain, an orthodontist from Austin, Texas \u2026 She meets James Craig at a dental conference in Las Vegas.",
      "It was Feb. 23, a week-and-a-half before Angela Craig first went to the hospital. The doctor was traveling alone. And he rolled the dice.",
      "George Brauchler: They strike up a relationship.",
      "Steffan Tubbs: They hit it off \u2026 it's a whirlwind.",
      "A few weeks later, according to the warrant, Cain would fly to Colorado and rendezvous at a hotel with James Craig. He would use that newly created email, \"Jim and Waffles,\" to flirt with her.",
      "Skye Lazaro: It's not illegal to have affairs.",
      "Skye Lazaro is an experienced defense attorney familiar with cases involving poison. James Craig and his attorney declined our request for an interview. Lazaro reviewed the case against James Craig for \"48 Hours.\" And she identified potential weaknesses.",
      "Skye Lazaro: Is it reasonable that you would kill your wife to be with someone that you had had a 10-day relationship with?",
      "Natalie Morales: The common defense strategy is affairs do not make a murderer.",
      "Skye Lazaro: Right. \u2026 One doesn't automatically mean you did the other.",
      "At the time she visited James Craig in Colorado, Cain did seem to know Angela Craig was very sick and in the hospital. In fact, she had sent a concerned e-mail to James Craig. It read in part: \"Hi honey, I am so sorry for what has transpired this week in your world. \u2026 I am praying for you and seeking God's wisdom for this time. I love you.\"",
      "But there is no evidence to suggest Cain knew anything more.",
      "George Brauchler:\u00a0 Nothing that I have seen \u2026 gives any indication that she knew that Jim was trying to kill his wife.",
      "And according to investigators, James Craig lied to Cain, telling her that he \"filed for divorce and was living separate in an apartment.\"",
      "Steffan Tubbs: He gives the standard male, typical, \"I'm going through a divorce.\" No, he's not.",
      "And a detective said she told them her relationship with James Craig was \"intimate but not sexual.\" Cain sent \"48 Hours\" an email, writing: \"I had absolutely nothing to do with this horrific 'crime' and 'my heart is absolutely broken for Angela Craig and her family.'\" And she says she is \"cooperating fully with the police and prosecution.\"",
      "Steffan Tubbs: Karin Cain \u2026 met the wrong guy at the wrong time. \u2026 She didn't know anything.",
      "Tubbs and Brauchler imply maybe no one knew anything about who James Craig really was. His pristine image \u2014 loving parent, church member, dedicated husband\u2014now all being questioned. And as cops continued to investigate, another possible motive emerged.",
      "Steffan Tubbs: One of the things that surprised me in this story \u2026 is the financial duress that Summerbrook Dental was under.",
      "In fact, James Craig's business had filed for bankruptcy in 2020, and shortly after, his then-friend Ryan Redfearn signed on as a partner.",
      "Natalie Morales: Financial problems?",
      "George Brauchler: Financial problems.",
      "Natalie Morales: He was way in over his head then, in debt?",
      "George Brauchler: Way in over his head.",
      "And at a preliminary hearing in 2023, prosecutors argued that James Craig had \"about 3.4 million reasons to kill his wife\" \u2014 the value of Angela Craig's life insurance.",
      "George Brauchler: Jim had liabilities in excess of $2 million and we know that from some of the bankruptcy filings.",
      "But Lazaro says she's not convinced those financial problems give James Craig a motive for murder.",
      "Natalie Morales: Is this sort of the portrait of a desperate man?",
      "Skye Lazaro: Not necessarily.",
      "Skye Lazaro: We see businesses go through bankruptcy all the time and come out the other side.",
      "And, as for any poisons he may have ordered, Lazaro states those purchases may not even be illegal.",
      "Skye Lazaro: He can legitimately purchase it because he has a DEA number.",
      "Natalie Morales: As a doctor. As a dentist, right.",
      "Skye Lazaro: Right.",
      "Skye Lazaro: Just having it isn't murder.",
      "Natalie Morales: Mm-hmm. Administering it. Right.",
      "But according to the arrest paperwork, James Craig might have thought he had that figured out, too. Authorities say he could have slipped the poison into one of those protein shakes he so often made.",
      "Natalie Morales: A morning routine at home for example.",
      "George Brauchler: Yeah.",
      "On that morning of March\u00a0 15 \u2014 the day Angela Craig would finally crash before she was taken to the hospital, she was home with James Craig. Investigators say that's when he may have made her one of those protein shakes and laced it with potassium cyanide.",
      "George Brauchler: It is tasteless. It is odorless. It is colorless. It is really hidable inside something like a shake.",
      "Natalie Morales: And highly lethal.",
      "George Brauchler: Highly lethal.",
      "But attorney Lazaro counters the evidence may not be there. She has reviewed the transcripts from that July 2023 preliminary hearing and says there's nothing there that shows James Craig put poison in Angela Craig's shakes.",
      "Skye Lazaro: They went and tested everything in the house and didn't find any trace evidence of there being arsenic or cyanide or anything in the protein powder, in the protein bottles.",
      "Skye Lazaro: The state hasn't presented you any evidence that the poison was actually in the drinks.",
      "And Lazaro says the defense can paint a picture of James Craig as a kind and attentive partner.",
      "Skye Lazaro: Jim's text messages to Angela are extremely loving and extremely caring. He repeatedly asks her how she's doing. He tells her he loves her.",
      "So if James Craig didn't poison his wife, who did? He had a story to tell about that.",
      "WHAT ANGELA CRAIG'S AUTOPSY SHOWED",
      "As Steffan Tubbs reported on his podcast, there may be another story to tell about James Craig and what happened to Angela Craig. The story wasn't about murder; it was about suicide.",
      "STEFFAN TUBBS (podcast): Craig says to the business partner on the phone \u2026 she was just playing chicken.",
      "According to the warrant, when Ryan Redfearn confronted James Craig about the cyanide, James Craig allegedly said that Angela Craig asked him to order it for her. That it was all a dare\u2014kind of a deadly game of \"chicken.\"",
      "Steffan Tubbs: According to Jim Craig \u2026 She's been threatening suicide. And this game of chicken is \u2026 Now \u2026 are you gonna take it?",
      "But according to that 52-page warrant, none of Angela Craig's family members told police she was suicidal. A more likely argument for the defense, says Lazaro, is that James Craig had been looking for cyanide not to kill Angela \u2014 but to kill himself.",
      "Skye Lazaro: There was some statements that he, in fact, was suicidal, not her.",
      "At that preliminary hearing in 2023, James Craig's defense team said he had spoken to a friend about his own past plans to die by suicide, and that \"Dr. Craig had made a statement\" to that friend that he was going to die by \"suicide with something that was not traceable.\" The defense pointed out that James Craig \"suffered from depression\" and went to counseling in the past.",
      "And, the defense indicated, James Craig told Angela Craig at one point that he had actually drugged her years earlier, when he had tried to kill himself \u2014 hoping that while she was drugged, she wouldn't be able stop him.",
      "Natalie Morales: It sounds like there had been something that he had tried before with her.",
      "Skye Lazaro: Mm-hmm. ... That he had drugged her, so that she would fall asleep, so that he could go \u2026 essentially kill himself. And she wouldn't be there to render any aid or call for help.",
      "And remember when Angela Craig first started feeling sick, and she texted James Craig: \"I feel drugged\"? James Craig's defense points out that he texted back, \"Given our history, I know that must be triggering. Just for the record, I didn't drug you.\" The defense said this text supports the story of James Craig's past depression and suicide attempts.",
      "But Lazaro says it's unlikely the defense would try to tell a jury that Jim and Angela Craig were both trying to die by suicide.",
      "Skye Lazaro: You have to pick one at some point.",
      "Natalie Morales: Mm-hmm.",
      "Skye Lazaro: And it's either she's suicidal \u2026 or that he's suicidal \u2026 and this is why he bought the drugs.",
      "But perhaps the most compelling evidence authorities say they have is what Angela Craig left behind in her own blood. That autopsy revealed something investigators find remarkable\u2014the levels of cyanide in Angela Craig's body actually increased while she was in the hospital on that final day. The possible implication?",
      "Tubbs wonders if prosecutors will contend James Craig gave his wife more poison in the hospital.",
      "Steffan Tubbs: If the allegations are true, this is about as cruel as it gets. Period.",
      "James Craig's defense has hired its own toxicologist. And, come his trial for murder, Lazaro says James Craig, innocent until proven guilty, may himself be portrayed as a victim \u2014   of cops too eager to make a fast arrest.",
      "Skye Lazaro: It's essentially a three-day investigation.",
      "James Craig's quick arrest, she says, could be a weakness for the state.",
      "Skye Lazaro: You decided from the get-go that this had to be poisoning \u2026 This was the foregone conclusion. \u2026 So you never went and looked for anything else.",
      "And as for that idea that poison might be the key to someone trying to commit the perfect crime, toxicologist Dr. Jeff LaPoint says that is just plain wrong.",
      "Jeff LaPoint: You're going to get caught.",
      "Natalie Morales: That's an important message.",
      "Jeff LaPoint: Yeah, very.",
      "Natalie Morales: There are ways that these will be traced, and you will be found.",

      "Former NBA star Gilbert Arenas and five other defendants, including a suspected high-level member of an Israeli transnational organized crime group, were arrested Wednesday for allegedly operating an illegal gambling and poker ring out of a California home that Arenas owned, according to unsealed court documents.",
      "According to an indictment that was filed on July 15, federal prosecutors in the Central District of California allege that between September 2021 and July 2022, Arenas allegedly rented out a mansion in the Encino neighborhood of Los Angeles so he and his co-conspirators could run illegal high-stakes poker games out of the house.",
      "Prosecutors allege that Arenas ordered one of the co-defendants to stage the mansion to host the poker games and collect rent, while another co-conspirator Yevgeni Gershman, a suspected Israeli organized crime member, hired women, who allegedly in exchange for tips, served drinks, provided massages, and \"offered companionship\" to the poker players.",
      "Arenas, nicknamed \"Agent Zero\" from his playing days as an all-star guard in the NBA, was charged with one count of conspiracy to operate an illegal gambling business, one count of operating an illegal gambling business, and one count of making false statements to investigators.",
      "Arenas pleaded not guilty Wednesday in United States District Court in Los Angeles and was released on $50,000 bond, the U.S. Attorney's Office in Los Angeles said. His trial is scheduled for Sept. 23.",
      "Arenas' successes on the court, including being a three-time All-NBA team player and making three NBA All-Star game appearances as a member of the Washington Wizards, were overshadowed by his off-the-court issues, including multiple incidents involving firearms.",
      "In January 2010, Arenas was charged with felony gun possession in Washington, D.C. after allegedly getting into a card-game dispute with a former teammate in December 2009, which resulted in both men drawing guns on each other in the Wizards locker room.",
      "As a result of the incident, D.C. prosecutors charged Arenas with one count of carrying a pistol without a license, which Arenas pleaded guilty. He was sentenced to two years' probation and 30 days of time in a halfway house and was suspended by the NBA during the investigation. Arenas, now 43, played his last NBA game in 2012.",
      "Since leaving the NBA, he has hosted a range of daily sports shows and podcasts.",
      "Arenas' five co-conspirators were charged with conspiracy to operate an illegal gambling business and one count of operating an illegal gambling business.",
      "Separately, Gershman, an Israeli citizen, was charged with three additional charges relating to immigration and marriage fraud.",

      "Brown University has cut a deal with the Trump administration to restore research grant funding to the school, in exchange for commitments on women's sports, antisemitism and admissions practices and a promise to donate $50 million to workforce development programs.",
      "The Rhode Island-based school is now the third Ivy League university to reach a deal with the administration, which has lashed out at a range of colleges. Columbia University agreed to pay the federal government a $200 million settlement earlier this month, and the University of Pennsylvania reached a deal with the government over transgender athletes.",
      "Brown announced the deal in a statement Wednesday and shared a copy of a nine-page agreement with the federal government. The Department of Education also confirmed in a statement that it had struck a deal with Brown.",
      "Under the terms of the three-year deal released by Brown, the federal government agreed to restore frozen Health and Human Services grants to the school and close pending federal non-discrimination investigations into the university.",
      "The school said Wednesday it has lost dozens of federal grants and hasn't been reimbursed for over $50 million in expenses related to National Institutes of Health grants \u2014 and that total is growing by over $3 million a week.",
      "In exchange for the end to the grant freeze, Brown agreed to pay $50 million to local workforce programs over the next decade. It also promised to provide female student-athletes with locker rooms \"strictly separated on the basis of sex,\" define male and female for athletic purposes in a way that's consistent with President Trump's executive orders and not offer gender-affirming medical care to minors.",
      "Brown also said it will not promote \"unlawful DEI goals,\" would commission a campus survey that asks about \u2014 among other things \u2014 issues of antisemitism and give the government access to admissions and discrimination complaint data. The school promised not to offer racial preferences in admissions \u2014 though the Supreme Court previously barred affirmative action policies in 2023.",
      "The agreement says Brown did not admit to wrongdoing and \"expressly denies liability regarding the United States' allegations,\" and specifies that the government does not have the \"authority to dictate Brown's curriculum or the content of academic speech.\"",
      "In a message to the school community, Brown President Christina Paxson also says Brown will not promise to make any direct payments to the government. She described it as a voluntary agreement.",
      "Paxson says Brown was under \"threat\" \u2014 Ed. Secretary assails \"woke\" policies",
      "In her message, Paxson argued that many parts of Wednesday's agreement line up with commitments Brown had already made to \"ensure compliance with federal laws prohibiting discrimination.\" She said the provisions on gender and sports are \"consistent with NCAA requirements and Brown's current policies,\" and the government is already entitled to ask for demographic data. She also noted that the agreement doesn't define the term \"unlawful DEI.\"",
      "But the university president noted that some parts of the deal stemmed from \"priorities of the federal administration in resolving the funding freeze.\" She said the school \"took great care to balance these interests with the core needs of the institution.\"",
      "Paxson said the deal \"preserves the integrity of Brown's academic foundation, and it enables us as a community to move forward after a period of considerable uncertainty.\" She wrote that the school's mission was \"under threat\" from financially painful grant cancellations and a \"growing push for government intrusion into the fundamental academic operations of colleges and universities.\"",
      "In a statement, Education Secretary Linda McMahon said the administration is \"successfully reversing the decades-long woke-capture of our nation's higher education institutions,\" and pointed to the agreement's measures on antisemitism and women's sports.",
      "\"Because of the Trump Administration's resolution agreement with Brown University, aspiring students will be judged solely on their merits, not their race or sex,\" she wrote.",
      "The White House called the deal a \"historic settlement with Brown University to restore fairness, merit, and safety in higher education.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Senate Republicans are mulling a possible rule change to allow them to more swiftly confirm President Trump's nominees amid Democrats' efforts to slow the process in protest to the president's policies.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters Wednesday that interest is \"growing quickly\" among Senate Republicans for a change to the rules governing the nominations process as he's bemoaned an \"unprecedented level of obstruction and delay\" by Democrats in recent days.",
      "\"There's certainly interest in looking at options that might enable us to break the logjam and expedite consideration of nominees in a way that, in the end, would benefit both parties when their party has the presidency,\" Thune said.",
      "With around 1,300 positions requiring Senate confirmation, the process is an arduous one that has become more cumbersome in recent years. The average time to confirm a president's nominee has nearly quadrupled during the last six administrations, according to the Center for Presidential Transition. And Democrats have taken their slow-walking of Mr. Trump's nominees to new extremes in recent months, putting up procedural hurdles to delay the confirmations nearly across the board.",
      "Still, the opposition by Democrats has not been universal, since any single senator can effectively stall the path to swift confirmation.",
      "In recent years, both Democrats and Republicans have made pushes to change the confirmation process, like by cutting down the time requirements for the nominations and reducing the number of votes needed to a simple majority.",
      "Senate Republicans have been tight-lipped about the possible new changes to the process, which would represent a further change to the institution that has traditionally been resistant to change. Sen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, told CBS News that Senate Republicans are \"actively discussing\" possible changes, calling the obstruction of Mr. Trump's nominees \"unconscionable.\" He noted that he would say the same if the dynamic was occurring under a Democrat.",
      "Sen. Markwayne Mullin, an Oklahoma Republican, told CBS News that \"we are actually not looking to do reforms, but we don't have a choice.\"",
      "\"This is Chuck Schumer's fault. He's the one that's forcing this. And, and so I don't know what he expects to happen, but we will have to have some reforms if this is the way they continue to operate,\" Mullin added.",
      "Sen. Tommy Tuberville, an Alabama Republican who during the Biden administration delayed the nominations of hundreds of military officers, argued that the chamber should remain in session to get the nominations done. \"We ought to stay if we don't get as many as we want to get,\" he said.",
      "\"President Trump says he wants us here,\" Tuberville said. \"We work for him.\"",
      "Earlier this month, Mr. Trump called for Senate Republicans to stay in session into their August recess to get the nominations done. And some other Senate Republicans, like Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, have echoed the sentiment. Lee has argued that the GOP should either \"exhaust\" Democrats by working through August \u2014 or give Mr. Trump the ability to make recess appointments.",
      "Asked about recess appointments, which afford the president the ability to temporarily fill vacancies while the Senate is in recess, Thune suggested that Senate Republicans would be more likely to \"make a modification to our rules\" to sidestep Democrats' delay.",
      "\"At some point, we may need to look at doing things differently on nominees generally, if the Democrats continue this path of obstruction that they're on right now,\" Thune said.",
      "Meanwhile, Mr. Trump took aim at another facet of the Senate's confirmation process late Tuesday in a post on Truth Social, urging Sen. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican who leads the Senate Judiciary Committee, to end blue slips \u2014 a practice that gives senators veto power over judicial nominations in their home state.",
      "Thune told reporters that the blue slip process is \"something that's been used for a long time by both sides, and neither side has violated its usage in the past.\"",
      "\"I don't sense any rush to change it, and I think the key is to make sure that we're making good headway on moving the list of judges that are on the President's list,\" he added.",

    "summary": "A new proposed bill would protect both workers and American consumers from bad experiences with AI.",
    "story": [
      "Have you ever found yourself repeating the words \"speak to a human please\" while on the phone with customer service? If so, you're among the roughly 70% of Americans who find interacting with automated phone systems, versus human customer support representatives, frustrating.",
      "That's in part why Senator Ruben Gallego wants to ensure that consumers who find themselves on the phone with a customer service agent are in fact speaking to a human, and one who is in the U.S., if that's their preference. He's also well aware of the threat artificial intelligence poses to American workers, and is committed to protecting the roughly three million Americans who work in call centers across the country, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.",
      "A new bipartisan bill, called the \"Keep Call Centers in America Act of 2025,\" introduced by Sen. Gallego and Sen. Jim Justice of West Virginia on Wednesday, proposes to ensure such jobs remain in the U.S. by limiting federal benefits for companies who ship them overseas.",
      "What does the bill require of companies?",
      "The bill would require businesses that decide to ship call centers overseas to notify the Department of Labor at least 120 days before making such a move. It would also direct the DOL to maintain a public list of employers that have relocated call center work overseas. Under the bill, employers would remain on the list for five years, absent efforts to return call center jobs to the U.S.",
      "Companies on such a list would be ineligible for new federal grants and federal guaranteed loans, under the proposed bill, while nonlisted companies would be given preference for federal contracts. Additionally, the DOL would be required to track any call center job losses related to AI.",
      "How would it protect consumers?",
      "To protect consumers, the bill would mandate that call center workers immediately disclose their physical locations to callers, and disclose whether AI is being used. Also, customers would be able to request to be transferred to a U.S.-based call center, if they so desired, under the proposed piece of legislation.",
      "\"People want to have the option of speaking to a human or AI. This isn't new \u2014who hasn't pressed zero repeatedly to try to skip the automated systems because they want to talk to a human? This is a consumer check people want to see,\" Sen. Gallego told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "In addition to supporting domestic jobs, keeping call center work in the U.S. helps safeguard American consumers' data, he said.",
      "\"We are concerned about what it means for American consumers if they're not talking to a human based in the U.S., when it comes to security around their private information,\" Sen. Gallego said.",
      "On the topic of AI taking over work currently performed by humans, Gallego acknowledged that the technology will inevitably bring about some job displacement.",
      "\"There will be changes and AI will cause some unemployment,\" he said. \"We can't stop it entirely.\"",
      "The senator added that he is not completely opposed to AI taking over some customer service work, either. \"If someone has a really good experience with an AI bot, there won't be a problem as long as that person knows they're talking to AI versus to a human,\" Gallego said.",
      "The Communications Workers of America (CWA) endorsed the proposed bill.",
      "\"This much-needed legislation protects U.S. call center jobs and addresses the growing threats posed by artificial intelligence and offshoring,\" (CWA) Director of Government Affairs, Dan Mauer said in a statement. \"Historically, companies have offshored customer service jobs to avoid paying good union wages and benefits. Now companies are using AI to de-skill and speed up work and displace jobs, which undermines worker rights and degrades service quality for consumers.\"",

Officials urged people to move inland and shelters were opened in many parts of Hawaii. Hawaii Gov. Josh Green said that Black Hawk helicopters had been activated and high-water vehicles were on standby in case authorities needed to conduct rescue operations.",

      "The National Weather Service in Eureka, California,\u00a0said around 4 a.m. local time that Crescent City had seen tsunami waves of about 3.5 feet, with activity building as the region approached a minor high tide. High tide could lead to more flooding. Crescent City has seen dozens of tsunamis since the 1930s, including a 1964 event that killed 11 people and destroyed hundreds of buildings.",
      "The National Weather Service Bay Area warned that even if the waves are small, they can cause \"seriously dangerous\" currents. The first waves also may not be the highest, the agency said, warning people to avoid coastal areas until told it's safe.",
      "On Alaska's Aleutian Islands, officials recorded waves up to 1.4 feet above tide levels.",
      "Kamchatka sees flooding, volcanic activity",
      "The quake was centered about 74 miles east-southeast of the Russian city of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, which has a population of 180,000. Multiple aftershocks as strong as 6.9 magnitude followed and experts predict aftershocks of up to 7.5 for at least a month, according to the Russian News agency TASS.",
      "The temblor appeared to be the strongest anywhere in the world since the 9.1 magnitude earthquake off northeastern Japan in March 2011 that caused a massive tsunami that set off meltdowns at a nuclear power plant. Only a few stronger earthquakes have ever been measured around the world.",
      "Earlier this month, five powerful quakes \u2014 the largest with a magnitude of 7.4 \u2014 struck in the sea near Kamchatka. The largest was at a depth of 12.4 miles and was 89 miles east of the city of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky.",
      "The Kremlin said regional authorities on Kamchatka were well prepared for the quake. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov noted that the warnings were issued timely and people were quickly evacuated from dangerous areas. He added that the buildings proved resilient to shocks.",
      "A video released by a Russian media outlet showed a team of doctors at a cancer clinic on Kamchatka holding a patient and clutching medical equipment as the quake rocked an operating room, before continuing with surgery after the shaking stopped. Officials said the doctors will receive decorations.",
      "Tsunami heights of about 9 to 13 feet were recorded in Kamchatka. Severokurilsk Mayor Alexander Ovsyannikov said the port in the city was flooded by tsunami waves, washing fishing boats into the sea. He said no major damage was recorded. Authorities on the Kamchatka peninsula lifted the tsunami warning for the area, some 11 hours after the quake hit. Russian authorities said several people were injured, without giving a figure. The risk of aftershocks and waves remains, officials said.",
      "On Wednesday, lava began to flow from Klyuchevskaya Sopka, the largest active volcano in the northern hemisphere. The 15,584-foot volcano, located in the east of Kamchatka, last erupted in 2023. Observers heard explosions and saw streams of lava on the volcano's western slopes, the Kamchatka branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences' geophysical service said.",
      "Scientists have anticipated an eruption, with the volcano's crater filling with lava for several weeks and the mountain spitting out plumes of ash.",
      "\"The Klyuchevskoy is erupting right now,\" the Russian Geophysical Survey said on Telegram, posting photos of an orange blaze on top of the volcano and adding that \"red-hot lava is observed flowing down the western slope. There is a powerful glow above the volcano and explosions.\"",
      "Sometimes described as the \"land of fire and ice,\" Kamchatka is one of the most active volcanic regions in the world. It has about 300 volcanoes, of which 29 are active, according to NASA Earth Observatory.",
      "Earthquake sparks international response",
      "The quake had a preliminary magnitude of 8.0, Japanese and U.S. seismologists said. The U.S. Geological Survey later updated its strength to 8.8 magnitude and a depth of 13 miles.",
      "People went to evacuation centers in affected areas of Japan, with memories fresh of the 2011 earthquake and tsunami that caused reactor meltdowns at a nuclear power plant. The tsunami alert disrupted transportation, with ferries, trains and airports in the affected area suspending or delaying some operations.",
      "Waves of about 2 feet were recorded on Japan's northern island of Hokkaido, and at least one person was injured.",
      "Japan's Fire and Disaster Management Agency said nearly 2 million residents are now under evacuation advisories in more than 220 municipalities along the Pacific coast as of midday Wednesday. Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said waves could remain high for at least one day, and he urged evacuees to take precautions and stay well hydrated in the summer heat. He told evacuees they might not be able to return home by the end of the day on Wednesday.",
      "No abnormalities in operations at Japan's nuclear plants were reported on Wednesday. The operator of the Fukushima Daiichi plant, heavily damaged by the 2011 tsunami, said about 4,000 workers are taking shelter on higher ground at the plant complex while monitoring remotely to ensure safety.",
      "China's Ministry of Natural Resources' Tsunami Warning Center issued an alert for parts of the country's east coast along Shanghai and Zhejiang provinces. The warning forecasted that waves could reach between one to three feet. The provinces are already under an alert as Typhoon CoMay is expected to land in the Zhejiang province on Wednesday.",
      "Some tiny and low-lying Pacific island chains are among the world's most imperiled by tsunamis and rising seas due to\u00a0climate change. People were urged to stay away from coastlines until any wave surges passed late Wednesday in Fiji, Samoa, Tonga, Federated States of Micronesia and Solomon Islands. Philippine authorities advised people to stay away from the beach and coastal areas.",
      "\"It may not be the largest of waves, but these can continue for hours and expose people swimming in the waters to danger,\" Teresito Bacolcol of the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology told The Associated Press.",
      "Elsewhere, a tsunami of under a foot was forecast to hit parts of Vancouver Island, British Columbia. Mexico's navy warned that tsunami waves will start reaching the northern coast in Ensenada, near California, at around 2:22 a.m. Wednesday local time, and waves could progress along the Pacific coast to Chiapas state, around 7:15 a.m. local time.",
      "In Chile, tsunami warnings were upgraded to their highest level on Wednesday morning. The alert covers most of the nation's 4,000-mile Pacific coastline. The country's Education Ministry also canceled classes along much of the coast.",
      "Colombian officials ordered the complete closure and evacuation of beaches and low-tide areas while maritime traffic was being restricted.",
      "Education officials in Ecuador canceled classes at schools in the Galapagos Islands as well as communities along the coast.",
      "New Zealand authorities warned of \"strong and unusual currents and unpredictable surges\" along all coastlines of the South Pacific island nation. The emergency management agency said people should move out of the water, off beaches and away from harbors, marinas, rivers and estuaries.",
      "How are tsunami probabilities categorized?",
      "There are four levels of tsunami alerts: warning, advisory, watch and information statement, according to the\u00a0National Weather Service.",
      "A tsunami warning is the most severe. It means residents should take action due to a coming tsunami that may cause widespread flooding.",
      "A tsunami advisory means there's the potential for \"strong currents or waves dangerous to those in or very near the water,\" according to the NWS.",
      "A tsunami watch advises those to be prepared because a distant earthquake has occurred and a tsunami is possible.",
      "The lowest level of alert is a tsunami information statement from the NWS, which advises people to \"relax\" since an earthquake has occurred, but there is no threat or it was very far away.",

      "\"The deepening suffering of civilians leaves no room for delay in co-ordinated international action to support peace, security, and the dignity of all human life,\" Carney said in a statement Wednesday.",
      "Canada has had a long-standing position supporting the idea of an independent Palestinian state existing alongside Israel, but has said recognition should come as part of a negotiated two-state solution to the conflict. Carney said Wednesday that prospects of a two-state solution \"have been steadily and gravely eroded.\"",
      "\"Preserving a two-state solution means standing with all people who choose peace over violence or terrorism, and honouring their innate desire for the peaceful co-existence of Israeli and Palestinian states as the only roadmap for a secure and prosperous future,\" Carney said.",

      "\"Canada will always steadfastly support Israel's existence as an independent state in the Middle East living in peace and security.

      "\"Israel rejects the statement by the Prime Minister of Canada,\" the Israeli Foreign Ministry said on social media. \"The change in the position of the Canadian government at this time is a reward for Hamas and harms the efforts to achieve a ceasefire in Gaza and a framework for the release of the hostages.\"",

      "The United Kingdom\u00a0and\u00a0France\u00a0each made the decision this month to recognize a Palestinian state in September at the U.N. General Assembly, as pressure has mounted on Israel to allow more aid into Gaza.",
      "Starmer said the U.K. will recognize Palestine as a state unless Israel takes \"substantive steps\" to end the \"appalling situation in Gaza,\" including the establishment of a ceasefire in Gaza, a commitment to halting the annexation of territory in the West Bank and a pledge to work toward a peace process involving a two-state solution. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu criticized the decision, saying in a statement posted on X that \"Starmer rewards Hamas's monstrous terrorism & punishes its victims.\"",
      "\"Consistent with its historic commitment to a just and lasting peace in the Middle East, I have decided that France will recognize the State of Palestine,\" French President Emmanuel Macron said. \"The urgent priority today is to end the war in Gaza and to bring relief to the civilian population.\" Netanyahu said Israel \"strongly\" condemned France's decision and that it \"rewards terror and risks creating another Iranian proxy, just as Gaza became.\"",

      "The United States has repatriated an American child separated from their family from a sprawling camp in northeastern Syria that houses tens of thousands of people with alleged ties to the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, the State Department said Tuesday.",
      "The department estimates that some 30,000 people from 70 countries remain in al-Hol Camp and one other similar camp, most of them wives and children of ISIS fighters as well as supporters of the extremist group. They include Iraqis as well as nationals of Western countries who traveled to join the U.S.-designated foreign terrorist group.",
      "Human rights groups for years have cited poor living conditions and pervasive violence in the al-Hol camp, which the U.S.-backed and Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces have administered for years. The SDF are Washington's key ally in combating ISIS in Syria and its sleeper cells, and for years have run large swaths of northeastern Syria.",
      "CBS News' senior foreign correspondent Holly Williams visited the al-Hol camp in 2019 and spoke with the camp's residents. Many of them expressed remorse for their prior ties to ISIS and said they wanted to return to their home countries \u2014 often in Western Europe \u2014 but some others defended the group's terror attacks.",
      "The State Department did not give any details about the repatriation, except to say in a statement that the child \"has known nothing of life outside of the camps\" and will be reunified with their family.",
      "The U.S. military for years has been pushing for countries to repatriate their citizens from al-Hol and the smaller, separate Roj Camp. Iraq has taken back an increasing number in recent years, but many other countries have remained reluctant.",
      "\"The only durable solution to the humanitarian and security crisis in these displaced persons camps in northeast Syria is for countries of origin to repatriate, rehabilitate, reintegrate, and where appropriate, ensure accountability for their nationals,\" the State Department statement read. \"The same goes for former ISIS fighters held in detention centers in northeast Syria,\" it said, using a different abbreviation for IS.",
      "Despite difficult talks to formally merge with the country's new rulers under interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa, Damascus and the SDF in May reached an agreement to repatriate Syrians in the camp. Since the ouster of former Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad in December, Washington has been pushing for the two sides to implement their deal and unify Syrian territory, which would ultimately put the camp under the control of the government.",

      "The sanctions announced by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent target Alexandre de Moraes, who has served on the Brazilian Supreme Federal Court since 2017. The Trump administration accused de Moraes of abusing his authority to target political opponents, including Bolsonaro, an ally of Mr. Trump's.",

      "\"Alexandre de Moraes has taken it upon himself to be judge and jury in an unlawful witch hunt against U.S. and Brazilian citizens and companies,\" Bessent said in a statement. \"De Moraes is responsible for an oppressive campaign of censorship, arbitrary detentions that violate human rights, and politicized prosecutions \u2014 including against former President Jair Bolsonaro. Today's action makes clear that Treasury will continue to hold accountable those who threaten U.S. interests and the freedoms of our citizens.\"",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the U.S. is sanctioning de Moraes for \"serious\" human rights abuses, including detaining people without bringing charges and for infringing on freedom of expression.",
      "Rubio said de Moraes also \"abused his authority by engaging in a targeted and politically motivated effort designed to silence political critics through the issuance of secret orders compelling online platforms, including U.S. social media companies, to ban the accounts of individuals for posting protected speech.\"",
      "\"The United States will use all appropriate and effective diplomatic, political, and legal instruments to protect the speech of Americans from foreign malign actors who would seek to undermine it,\" he said in a statement.",

      "The deep-sea trenches, also called Hadal trenches, are \"some of the Earth's least explored and understood environments,\" the researchers wrote. In these extreme environments, the crushing pressure, scant food and lack of sunlight can make it hard to survive. Scientists know that tiny microbes prosper there, but less is known about evidence of larger marine life.",
      "Researchers traveling along the Kuril\u2013Kamchatka and Aleutian trenches in the northwest Pacific Ocean used a manned submersible to find tubeworms and mollusks flourishing at over 31,000 feet deep. The deepest part of the ocean goes down to about 36,000 feet.",
      "Scientists had surveyed this area before and had hints that larger creatures might live at such depths. The new discovery confirms those suspicions and shows just how extensive the communities are, said Julie Huber, a deep sea microbiologist with Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.",
      "\"Look how many there are, look how deep they are,\" said Huber, who was not involved with the research. \"They don't all look the same and they're in a place that we haven't had good access to before.\"",
      "In the absence of light to make their own food, many trench-dwellers big and small survive on key elements like carbon that trickle down from higher in the ocean.",

The tubeworms and mollusks may survive by eating those tiny creatures or living with them and snacking on the products of their labor, scientists said.",

      "Laura Dahlmeier, a two-time German biathlon Olympic gold medalist, has died after a climbing accident in Pakistan, her management team and local government officials confirmed.",
      "The 31-year-old, who also won seven world championships in biathlon, was climbing Laila Peak in the Karakoram mountain range on Monday when she was struck by falling rocks at about 18,700 feet. Her rope partner, Marina Eva, quickly issued a distress call, launching a massive rescue mission, her management team said. Eva, uninjured, was able to descend to base camp with help from rescuers on Tuesday.",
      "The rescue operation was hampered by low visibility and bad weather.",
      "Rescuers were able to confirm Dahlmeier's death on Wednesday but not retrieve the body because of unfavorable weather, said Faizullah Faraq, a spokesman for the regional Gilgit-Baltistan government.",
      "\"Based on findings from the helicopter flyover and the rope partner's account of the severity of the injuries, it must be assumed that Laura Dahlmeier died instantly,\" her management team said in a statement to German media. A similar statement was shared on Dahlmeier's Instagram account.",
      "A separate post on Instagram honored Dahlmeier as a \"wonderful person\" who \"enriched the lives of many, including our own, with her warm and straightforward manner.\"",
      "\"She showed us that it's worth standing up for your dreams and goals and always staying true to yourself,\" the post continued. \"We are deeply grateful, dear Laura, that we were allowed to share our lives with you. Our shared moments and memories give us the strength and courage to continue on our path.\"",
      "Any final decision on retrieving the body would follow the wishes of Dahlmeier's family, Faraq said. A statement on Dalhmeier's Instagram page said it had been her wish that nobody risk their life to recover her body after an accident. It said Dahlmeier's family thanked the rescue team and climbers, who did their best to make her rescue possible.",
      "German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier offered his condolences to Dahlmeier's parents, writing that she \"was an exceptional sportswoman.\" He recalled that he presented her with the highest honor on German sport, the Silver Laurel Leaf, shortly after she won her first Olympic gold medal in 2018.",
      "\"Laura Dahlmeier was an ambassador for our country in the world, a role model for peaceful, cheerful and fair coexistence across borders,\" he said.",
      "Dahlmeier made her professional debut at the IBU World Cup during the 2012-13 season at age 19. She was chosen to represent team Germany at Sochi 2014, where she placed 13th in the individual, according to Olympics.com.",
      "She went on to win two Olympic gold medals at the PyeongChang Games in 2018, becoming the first female biathlete in history to win sprint and pursuit events at the same Olympic Games. She also picked up a bronze in the individual at those Games.",
      "Dahlmeier won seven gold, three silver and five bronze medals at the Biathlon World Championships, along with 20 World Cup races and the overall World Cup in the 2016-17 season, according to her website.",
      "Dahlmeier retired from competitive biathlon in May 2019 at age 25. She grew up in Garmisch-Partenkirchen in the German Alps and turned to mountaineering challenges after ending her biathlon career. She had been a state-certified mountain and ski guide since 2023 and volunteered for the Garmisch-Partenkirchen mountain rescue team.",

      "The region has also been battered by above-normal seasonal rains, triggering flash floods and landslides. Since last week, at least 20 Pakistani tourists have been missing after floodwaters swept them away near the northern district of Chilas.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump announced Wednesday that the U.S. would impose tariffs of 25% on imports from India \u2014 in addition to an unspecified \"penalty\" \u2014 for what he said were its high tariffs and trade barriers, and for its large purchases of military equipment and energy from Russia.",
      "Mr. Trump posted about the tariffs on India on social media Wednesday morning, saying, \"Remember, while India is our friend, we have, over the years, done relatively little business with them because their Tariffs are far too high, among the highest in the World, and they have the most strenuous and obnoxious non-monetary Trade Barriers of any Country.\"",
      "The president criticized India for buying energy products from Russia \"at a time when everyone wants Russia to STOP THE KILLING IN UKRAINE.\"",
      "In a separate post, the president said, \"WE HAVE A MASSIVE TRADE DEFICIT WITH INDIA!!!\"",
      "Although U.S. exports to India rose in 2024, its trade deficit also rose by 5.4%, to $45.7 billion. The director of the National Economic Council, Kevin Hassett, told reporters Wednesday morning, \"India has had a market that's been pretty much closed to American products, and we've been wide open to theirs. And I think President Trump is frustrated with the progress we've made with India, but feels that a 25% tariff will address and remedy the situation in a way that's good for the American people.\"",
      "When Mr. Trump met with\u00a0Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u00a0at the White House in February, he said the U.S. would be increasing military sales to India and that the two countries had reached an agreement on oil and gas that would make the U.S. India's leading supplier.",

      "One of the three men suspected of an arson attack on a Melbourne synagogue last year was arrested, police said Wednesday.",
      "A 21-year-old Melbourne man, who was not identified, was arrested at a house on suspicion he had set the fire at the Adass Israel Synagogue in December, Victoria Police Deputy Commissioner Wendy Steendam said.",
      "The predawn attack on Dec. 6, 2024, destroyed the synagogue and left a worshipper with minor burns.",
      "The arrest is a major breakthrough for investigators in the Victorian Joint Counter-Terrorism Team that is treating the attack as\u00a0politically motivated.",
      "The team involves Victoria state and federal police, as well as Australia's main domestic spy agency. More than 220 law enforcement officers have devoted more than 50,000 hours to the investigation.",
      "\"Today's arrest is a demonstration of our ongoing efforts to hold those involved to account,\" Steendam said in a statement announcing the arrest. \"We now have charged two people as part of this investigation and I expect there will be more to come.\"",
      "Two weeks ago, a 20-year-old man was charged with stealing the car used in the synagogue attack. But that suspect has not been accused of being one of the masked men who used brooms to spread a liquid accelerant across the floor of the synagogue before igniting it.",
      "An arson conviction carries a potential maximum of 15 years in prison, while the other two offenses are each punishable by 10 years imprisonment. The suspect has yet to be charged.",
      "\"I want to reassure Victorians, particularly those in the Jewish community, that we remain relentless in our pursuit in finding all those responsible for this crime and holding them to account,\" Steendam told reporters.",

      "\"We are \u2026 working closely with our\u00a0Five Eyes\u00a0partners and international partners to ensure our collective powers and capabilities are drawn upon to help bring those responsible to justice,\" she added. Five Eyes is an intelligence-sharing partnership that includes Australia, the United States, Britain, Canada and New Zealand.",
      "Barrett declined to say who the offshore suspects were or identify the countries they were operating in.",
      "\"This crime was despicable as it was dangerous, and it is important to acknowledge that this was not just an arson on a synagogue,\" she added in a statement. \"The effect of this crime has rippled through a community that continues to be targeted by criminals. We will not stand for this.\"",
      "A wave of antisemitic attacks has roiled Australia since the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas assault on Israel triggered the war in Gaza. The synagogue attack is the only incident that has been classified as an act of terrorism, a designation that increases the resources available to the investigation.",
      "Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke welcomed the arrest in connection with what he described as a \"hate crime.\"",
      "Burke noted that his government had promised 30 million Australian dollars ($20 million) to rebuild the synagogue.",
      "\"This arrest cannot undo the pain and fear that it (arson) caused, but it does send the strongest message that this kind of hate and violence has no place in Australia,\" Burke told Parliament.",
      "\"This attack was not simply an attack on Jewish Australians; an attack on a synagogue is an attack on Australia and is treated as such,\" he added.",
      "Daniel Aghion, president of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, the main advocate for the nation's Jewish community, hoped more arrests would be made and that the masterminds of the crime would be quickly brought to justice.",

      "Earlier this month, an arsonist set fire to the door of another synagogue in Melbourne, dousing the double front doors of the downtown East Melbourne Hebrew Congregation and setting it alight. Around 20 worshippers sharing a meal to mark the Shabbat Jewish day of rest evacuated through a rear door, police said. No one was injured.",

      "The earthquake was \"on what we call the Pacific Ring of Fire. This is a region around the entire Pacific Rim renowned for significant earthquakes,\" Simon Boxall, lecturer in oceanography at the University of Southampton, told The Associated Press.",
      "\"The Earth is made up of these sort of geology plates, these geophysical plates, and the Earth where these plates rub, where they sort of join, we get stresses building up, and then every so often we get a sudden release of pressure and part of the seabed flips up,\" Boxall said. \"And so it's that flip that causes the tsunami. And not all flips, not all earthquakes will generate these.\"",
      "Boxal said the tsunami generated by this earthquake was \"not huge. It's not one that's going to cause mass devastation. But it will cause coastal flooding and it will cause damage and it does put lives at risk if people don't move to high ground.\"",
      "Two magnitude 9.1 earthquakes - the Tohoku earthquake in 2011 in Japan and the 2004 Sumatra earthquake in Indonesia - caused massive tsunamis that killed thousands of people.",
      "Earthquake scientist Grace Sethanant said there was a reason those temblors caused much more devastating tsunamis than Wednesday's quake.",
      "While a magnitude 9.1 quake \"might seem not so far off from the magnitude 8.8 \u2026 in terms of energy, it's three times stronger,\" Sethanant said.",
      "\"Imagine the 8.8 is, as I drop a rock in the lake, and you see the ripples. That's the energy,\" Sethanant said. \"Imagine you have that rock like three times bigger. So, in terms of the earthquake movement magnitude, the energy of the 2011 and 2004 earthquakes in Sumatra and in Japan, it's actually three to four times bigger. ... And that's why the tsunamis in those events were much more devastating.\"",
      "National Tsunami Warning Center  Tsunami Warning Coordinator Dave Snider said tsunamis should be thought of more as \"ocean floods\" than waves.",
      "\"The most important thing to understand about a tsunami is this is not a surf wave, it's not a wind wave,\" Snider said. \"A tsunami is the entire ocean column that is being lifted above that high tide level there because of that extreme movement of the Earth's crust with the earthquake there, so this is a significant planetary event that we've just witnessed.\"",

    "story": [
      "The \"worst-case scenario of famine is currently playing out in the Gaza Strip,\" the leading international authority on food crises said in a new alert Tuesday, predicting \"widespread death\" without immediate action.",
      "The alert, still short of a formal famine declaration, follows an outcry over images of emaciated children in Gaza and reports of dozens of hunger-related deaths after nearly 22 months of war.",
      "The international pressure led Israel over the weekend to announce measures, including daily humanitarian pauses in fighting in parts of Gaza and airdrops. The United Nations and Palestinians on the ground say little has changed, and desperate crowds continue to overwhelm and unload delivery trucks before they can reach their destinations.",
      "The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, or IPC, said Gaza has teetered on the brink of famine for two years, but recent developments have \"dramatically worsened\" the situation, including \"increasingly stringent blockades\" by Israel.",
      "\"Mounting evidence shows that widespread starvation, malnutrition, and disease are driving a rise in hunger-related deaths. Latest data indicates that Famine thresholds have been reached for food consumption in most of the Gaza Strip and for acute malnutrition in Gaza City,\" the IPC said. \"Immediate action must be taken to end the hostilities and allow for unimpeded, large-scale, life-saving humanitarian response. This is the only path to stopping further deaths and catastrophic human suffering.\"",
      "A formal famine declaration, which is rare, requires the kind of data that the lack of access to Gaza and mobility within it have largely denied. The IPC has only declared famine a few times \u2014 in Somalia in 2011, South Sudan in 2017 and 2020, and parts of Sudan's western Darfur region last year.",
      "\"Deadly turning point\" reached",
      "But independent experts say they don't need a formal declaration to know what they're seeing in Gaza.",
      "\"Just as a family physician can often diagnose a patient she's familiar with based on visible symptoms without having to send samples to the lab and wait for results, so too we can interpret Gaza's symptoms. This is famine,\" Alex de Waal, author of \"Mass Starvation: The History and Future of Famine\" and executive director of the World Peace Foundation, told The Associated Press.",
      "An area is classified as in famine when all three of the following conditions are confirmed:",
      "At least 20% of households have an extreme lack of food, or are essentially starving. At least 30% of children six months to 5 years old suffer from acute malnutrition or wasting, meaning they're too thin for their height. And at least two people or four children under 5 per 10,000 are dying daily due to starvation or the interaction of malnutrition and disease.",
      "The report is based on available information through July 25 and says the crisis has reached \"an alarming and deadly turning point.\" It says data indicates that famine thresholds have been reached for food consumption in most of Gaza \u2014 at its lowest level since the war began \u2014 and for acute malnutrition in Gaza City. The report says nearly 17 out of every 100 children under the age of 5 in Gaza City are acutely malnourished.",
      "Mounting evidence shows \"widespread starvation,\" the IPC says. Essential health and other services have collapsed.

    "story": [
      "The United Kingdom will recognize Palestine as a state in September unless Israel takes \"substantive steps\" to end the \"appalling situation in Gaza,\" British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Tuesday.",
      "Addressing reporters at Downing Street, the prime minister said the U.K. will recognize Palestine as a state at the United Nations General Assembly in September unless Israel takes a number of steps \u2014 including the establishment of a ceasefire in Gaza, a commitment to halting the annexation of territory in the West Bank, and a pledge to work toward a peace process involving a two-state solution.",
      "\"Meanwhile, our message to the terrorists of Hamas is unchanged and unequivocal. They must immediately release all of the hostages, sign up to a ceasefire, disarm and accept that they will play no part in the government of Gaza,\" Starmer added.",
      "Speaking at the U.N. headquarters in New York moments after Starmer had finished speaking, British Foreign Minister David Lammy said the U.K. government had taken this decision as the \"two-state solution is in peril.\"",
      "\"Let me be clear \u2014 the Netanyahu government's rejection of a two-state solution is wrong. It's wrong morally and it's wrong strategically. It harms the interest of the Israeli people, closing off the only path to a just and lasting peace, and that is why we are determined to protect the viability of a two-state solution,\" Lammy said.",
      "In a statement on X, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu criticized the U.K.'s decision, writing that \"Starmer rewards Hamas's monstrous terrorism & punishes its victims.\"",
      "\"A jihadist state on Israel's border TODAY will threaten Britain TOMORROW. Appeasement towards jihadist terrorists always fails. It will fail you too. It will not happen,\" Netanyahu said.",
      "Israel's Foreign Ministry also condemned the decision by the U.K. and called it a \"reward for Hamas\" that \"harms efforts to achieve a ceasefire in Gaza and a framework for the release of hostages.\"",
      "Speaking to reporters on Air Force One on Tuesday, President Trump said he did not discuss the decision with Starmer during their bilateral meeting in Scotland a day before the announcement.",
      "Seated alongside Starmer on Monday, Mr. Trump addressed the situation in Gaza, saying the U.S. will be providing food to the people of Gaza and working to eliminate barriers to humanitarian aid.",
      "\"Some of those kids are, that's real starvation stuff,\" Mr. Trump said Monday. \"I see it. And you can't fake that. So we're going to be even more involved.",
      "He added: \"I told Israel maybe they have to do it a different way.\"",
      "A Downing Street spokeswoman said in a statement that Starmer spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the phone regarding the announcement on Tuesday.",
      "\"He [Starmer] said that the situation in Gaza was intolerable and that the need for humanitarian access is now more pressing than ever before. He urged the Prime Minister to take immediate action to lift all restrictions on aid access and get those suffering in Gaza the food they need,\" the spokeswoman said.",
      "The spokeswoman for Starmer's office said the prime minister had also spoken over the phone with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, as well as Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, and King Abdullah II of Jordan about the U.K.'s plan to recognize Palestinian statehood.",
      "Last week, French President Emmanuel Macron announced that France would recognize Palestine as a state and would formalize that decision at the U.N. General Assembly in September.",
      "\"Consistent with its historic commitment to a just and lasting peace in the Middle East, I have decided that France will recognize the State of Palestine,\" Macron said at the time. \"The urgent priority today is to end the war in Gaza and to bring relief to the civilian population.\"",
      "Netanyahu said Israel \"strongly\" condemned that decision and said that it \"rewards terror and risks creating another Iranian proxy, just as Gaza became.\"",
      "\"A Palestinian state in these conditions would be a launch pad to annihilate Israel \u2014 not to live in peace beside it. Let's be clear: the Palestinians do not seek a state alongside Israel; they seek a state instead of Israel,\" the Israeli leader said in a post on X.",
      "That announcement came as pressure has mounted on Israel to allow more aid into Gaza as images of starving Palestinian children have garnered widespread global attention over the past week. The international pressure led Israel over the weekend to announce measures, including daily humanitarian pauses in fighting in parts of Gaza and airdrops.",
      "France's top diplomat, Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot, hailed the U.K. prime minister's announcement Tuesday in a social media post.",
      "\"Together, through this pivotal decision and our combined efforts, we break the endless cycle of violence and reopen the prospect of peace in the region,\" Barrot said.",
      "The Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs lists 149 countries that currently recognise the state of Palestine. That number would rise to 151 should France and the U.K. formalize recognition of Palestine as a state in September.",

      "The president, who said in Scotland on Monday that he was shortening his original 50-day deadline for Russia to make peace with Ukraine, spoke to reporters about the revised deadline Tuesday aboard Air Force One\u00a0as he returned to the U.S. Mr. Trump has been in Scotland for the last five days to negotiate trade deals with European leaders and visit his two golf resorts there.",
      "\"Ten days from today. Okay?\" he said on the plane.",
      "\"And then you know, we're going to put on tariffs and stuff, and I don't know if it's going to affect Russia, because he wants to obviously probably keep the war going,\" the president added, seemingly speaking about Russian President Vladimir Putin. \"But we're going to put on tariffs and the various things that you put on. It may or may not affect them, but it could.\"",
      "The U.S. and Ukraine have been pushing for an immediate ceasefire in order to negotiate a lasting peace deal. Earlier in July, Mr. Trump said if Russia doesn't agree to a ceasefire within a 50-day window, the U.S. would impose secondary tariffs of up to 100% on goods sold by countries that do business with Russia.",
      "Mr. Trump has increasingly expressed frustration with Putin, questioning whether the Russian leader really wants to end the war with Ukraine. Mr. Trump has described thinking he'd had a good phone call with the Russian leader, only to find that the next day, more Ukrainians were being killed by Russia.",

    "story": [
      "The new trade agreement between the U.S. and the European Union will lift tariffs on imports of goods from EU countries to their highest level in decades and hurt the trading bloc's economic growth, according to some experts.",
      "\"It is an asymmetric and unbalanced deal,\" economists with investment bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale said in a report. The EU decided neither to retaliate nor to increase its tariffs, and is even expected to reduce them. The EU agreed to a bad deal rather than risk trade war escalation.\"",
      "The average tariff on U.S. imports from the EU will surge from 1.2% in 2024 to 17.5%, according to investor advisory firm Capital Economics. That will reduce the EU's annual gross domestic product by 0.2%, the investment advisory firm forecast.",
      "EU countries annually ship more than $300 billion in goods to the U.S., accounting for more than 20% of total U.S. imports. Mexico ranks second among America's trade partners at roughly 15% of U.S. imports, while Canada accounts for 11% (see chart at bottom.)",
      "The deal, announced Sunday by President Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, imposes a 15% U.S. tariff on most EU imports, while American goods exported to the union's 27 member countries will face no tariffs. Previously, U.S. exports to the EU faced an average tariff of roughly 1%, according to Goldman Sachs analysts.",
      "The EU also pledged to buy $750 billion worth of energy from the U.S., up from about $80 billion a year, and to invest $600 billion by 2028.",
      "The trade agreement will boost Americans by increasing access to the EU's vast market and supporting the U.S. manufacturing sector, according to the Trump administration.",
      "\"This colossal deal will enable U.S. farmers, ranchers, fishermen and manufacturers to increase U.S. exports, expand business opportunities and help reduce the goods trade deficit with the European Union,\" the White House said Monday in a\u00a0fact sheet about the pact.",
      "The White House didn't immediately respond to a request for additional comment.",
      "Reducing uncertainty",
      "Although the agreement sharply raises U.S. tariffs, economists said the deal will also help ease some of the uncertainty around trade relations with a key trading partner. Perhaps most important, it is better than the alternative given that Mr. Trump had threatened to slap a 30% tariff on EU imports.",
      "More broadly, the EU deal and the Trump administration's framework agreement with Japan last week \u2014 both of which set 15% as a baseline tariff \u2014 also could help pave the way for trade agreements with Canada, Korea, Mexico and other countries, including on key sectors like autos, experts said.",
      "\"[C]ompared to expectations we had a few weeks before, in particular when pharmaceuticals and semiconductors could have been subject to higher tariffs, it looks like this deal is better than feared,\" Michel Martinez, head Europe economist at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "European auto exports would face a 15% levy, down from 25%, according to Goldman Sachs. Von der Leyen also said the U.S. would eliminate tariffs on some products, including aircraft and parts, semiconductor manufacturing gear, natural resources, some farm products, and certain chemicals and generic drugs. Likewise, the EU would abolish tariffs on those products.",
      "Neither the U.S. nor the EU has released details of the pact, and lobbying by some industries is expected to continue. For example, Unione Italiana Vini, an Italian trade group representing winemakers, said in a\u00a0statement\u00a0on Monday that a 15% tariff on EU imports will result in a a $371 million hit for exporters.",
      "\"We are now calling on the Italian government and the EU to consider appropriate measures to safeguard a sector that has grown significantly thanks to U.S. buyers,\" the group's president, Lamberto Frescobaldi, said in a statement, while acknowledging that the\u00a0 deal \"at least resolved the uncertainty that was stalling the market.\"",
      "According to the group's analysis, a bottle of Italian wine that previously retailed for $11.50 in the U.S. will now cost nearly $15 under the new tariff agreement.",
      "The German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA), which represents German automakers, also said a 15% U.S. tariff on the country's automotive products will hurt its car manufacturers, while noting that the new tariff rate amounts to a reprieve from the 25% automobile levies EU nations have faced since April.",
      "Wayne Winegarden, an economist at the Pacific Research Institute, a think tank that support free market policies, expects the U.S.-EU deal is to raise prices for consumers and lower corporate profits.",
      "\"Going forward, we are going to start to see these impacts either through lower profitability for corporations and higher costs for consumers, and most likely a combination of the two,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Despite the Trump administration's recent trade deals with the EU, Japan, U.K. and several other Asian countries, the U.S. still faces a self-imposed Aug. 1 deadline to reach agreements with Canada, Mexico, Korean other key trading partners.",

      "A court in the southern city of Ingolstadt convicted the defendants of gang robbery over the museum heist, German news agency dpa reported. A fourth defendant was acquitted of involvement in the museum heist but convicted of other thefts carried out by the group.",
      "The suspects from northern Germany were arrested months after a Nov. 22, 2022, break-in at the Celtic and Roman Museum in the Bavarian town of Manching, in which 483 Celtic coins discovered during a 1999 archaeological dig were stolen. The coins dated to around 100 B.C.",
      "The coins and a lump of unworked gold were originally discovered during excavations of an ancient settlement in Manching, and authorities have said they are considered the biggest trove of Celtic gold found in the 20th century.",
      "The heist took place in just nine minutes, investigators said. At 1:17 a.m., cables were cut at a telecoms hub nearby, leaving the region without communications networks. The museum's door was pried open at 1:26 a.m. The thieves left the building at 1:35 a.m., officials said, leaving them just a few minutes to smash open a display case and take the treasure. No alarms were triggered during the incident. The museum did not have an overnight guard.",
      "Most of the stolen treasure is still missing, but investigators found lumps of gold on one of the suspects when he was arrested that appear to have resulted from part of the treasure being melted down. Rupert Gebhard, the head of the Bavarian State Archaeological Collection in Munich, said in 2022 that seeing the coins melted down would be \"the worst option.\"",
      "The four defendants were accused of a total of 20 break-ins or attempted robberies in Germany and neighboring Austria, starting in 2014. Other cases involved safes or cash machines being broken into.",
      "The defendants didn't address the charges during the roughly six-month trial, but their lawyers called for their acquittal.",

      "\"This has been an unbelievable development,\" the president said before the ceremonial opening. He thanked his son Eric for his work on the project, saying it was \"truly a labor of love for him.\"",

      "It was mostly built around golf \u2014 and walking the new course before it officially begins offering rounds to the public on Aug. 13, adding to a lengthy list of ways the president has used the White House to promote his brand.",
      "Billing itself the \"Greatest 36 Holes in Golf,\" the Trump International Golf Links, Scotland, was designed by Eric Trump. The course is hosting a PGA Seniors Championship event later this week, after Mr. Trump leaves. Signs promoting the event had already been erected all over the course before he arrived on Tuesday and, on the highway leading in, temporary metal signs guided drivers onto the correct road.",
      "Golfers hitting the course at dawn as part of that event had to put their clubs through metal detectors erected as part of the security sweeps ahead of his arrival. Several dozen people, some dressed for golf, including wearing cleats, had filled the sand trap near the tee box to watch the ribbon-cutting ceremony shortly before it was scheduled to start. Another group of people was watching from the other side in tall grass growing on sand dunes flanking the first hole.",

But the trip has featured a lot of golf, and having the president visit is sure to raise the new course's profile.",
      "Mr. Trump's assets are in a trust, and his sons are running the family business while he's in the White House. Any business generated at the course will ultimately enrich the president when he leaves office though.",
      "A press release says the new course features the world's largest natural bunker, dunes and greens overlooking the sea, with a \"focus on environmental sensitivity.\"",
      "Visible from various parts of the new course were towering windmills lining the coast \u2014 some with blades that showed visible dots of rust. They are part of a nearby windfarm that Mr. Trump sued to block construction of in 2013.",
      "He lost that case and was eventually ordered to pay legal costs for bringing it \u2014 and the issue still enrages him. During the meeting with Starmer, Mr. Trump called windmills \"ugly monsters\" and suggested they were part of \"the most expensive form of energy.\"",
      "\"I restricted windmills in the United States because they also kill all your birds,\" the president said. \"If you shoot a bald eagle in the United States, they put you in jail for five years. And windmills knock out hundreds of them. They don't do anything. Explain that.\"",
      "Starmer said in the U.K., \"we believe in a mix\" of energy, including oil and gas and renewables.",
      "The new golf course is the third owned by the Trump Organization in Scotland. Mr. Trump bought Turnberry in 2014 and owns another course near Aberdeen that opened in 2012.",
      "Mr. Trump golfed at Turnberry on Saturday, as protesters took to the streets, and on Sunday. He invited Starmer, who famously doesn't golf, aboard Air Force One so the prime minister could get a private tour of his Aberdeen properties before Tuesday's ceremonial opening.",
      "\"Even if you play badly, it's still good,\" Mr. Trump said of golfing on his course over the weekend. \"If you had a bad day on the golf course, it's OK. It's better than other days.\"",

      "Of the $131 billion in overall losses for 2025, $80 billion was insured, which is the second-highest amount for the first half of any year since recordkeeping began in 1980. The first half of 2011 is the only year where insured losses have been higher, due to a severe earthquake and tsunami in Japan.",
      "The L.A. wildfires have been the costliest natural disaster this year and are estimated to have caused $53 billion in overall losses, with $40 billion insured.",
      "Climate change played a role in the wildfires by increasing the fire weather index conditions, making them more intense and destructive, according to scientists.",
      "\"We need to face it that the losses have been on the rise and make it clear that climate change plays an ever increasing role,\" said Tobias Grimm, chief climate scientist at Munich Re.",
      "As more people move into high-risk climate areas and weather events grow more extreme due to climate change, the damages will likely keep climbing, Grimm said.",
      "Another major global disaster in 2025 was the March 7.7-magnitude earthquake in Myanmar that killed an estimated 4,500 people and caused $12 billion in losses, very little of which was insured.",
      "Weather disasters like wildfires and storms have caused 88% of overall losses and 98% of insured losses, according to Munich Re. Earthquakes accounted for 12% of overall losses and 2% of insured losses in 2025 so far.",
      "In seven out of the last eight years, the industry has seen more than $100 billion in insured losses, Grimm said.",
      "\"Usually the second half of the year is more costly,\" he said, due to the bulk of the hurricane season starting in August and concluding in November.",
      "With hurricanes and wildfires being the costliest disasters on-record, the need to adapt and mitigate these climate impacts is necessary to address rising insurance costs, according to Grimm and other company experts.",
      "\"The best way to avoid losses is to implement effective preventive measures, such as more robust construction for buildings and infrastructure to better withstand natural disasters,\" Thomas Blunck, a member of the Board of Management of Munich Re, said in a statement. \"Such precautions can help to maintain reasonable insurance premiums, even in high-risk areas. And most importantly: to reduce future exposure, new building development should not be allowed in high-risk areas.\"",

      "The \"Make Health Tech Great Again\" event laid out a new voluntary commitment from several major tech and tech-healthcare firms aimed at developing a better process for digital health record sharing, which Trump admin officials said would ultimately improve health outcomes for Americans. In addition to the commitment, the new health tech efforts will also include the development of personalized tools meant to help patients obtain greater control of their health information to make more informed decisions.",
      "\"For decades, America's healthcare networks have been overdue for a high-tech upgrade, and that's what we're doing. The existing systems are often slow, costly, and incompatible with one another,\" Trump said from the White House during the Wednesday afternoon event. \"But with today's announcement, we take a major step to bring health care into the digital age, something that, is absolutely vital. We've got to do it. Moving from clipboards and fax machines into a new era of convenience, profitability and speed and, frankly, better health for people.\"",

      "A long-awaited stock trading ban passed through the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee on Wednesday, with committee Democrats joining with the bill's sponsor, Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., to send the bill to the floor of the Senate.",
      "Hawley originally introduced the \"PELOSI Act\" earlier this year, but what ultimately passed through the dizzying committee markup process on Wednesday was the Honest Act. Both pieces of legislation ban all members of Congress and their spouses from trading stocks while in office, in addition to closing various loopholes around direct trades. The critical difference between the two bills is that the Honest Act also bans the president and vice president from making trades while in office. That provision wouldn't go into effect until after President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance leave office, however.",
      "Media reports Wednesday morning claimed that the White House had pushed back on that provision once they caught wind of it, but Hawley told Fox News Digital in an interview that he never heard any such messaging from the administration and \"certainly not from Trump.\" Hawley was the sole Republican on the committee to vote in favor of the bill, despite a former co-sponsor of the PELOSI Act, Sen. Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio, sitting on the committee as well.",
      "Trump reacted to the Hawley bill's progress during a Wednesday press conference. He reiterated his support for a congressional stock trading ban, but declined to endorse the legislation outright. He did not comment directly on the ban's inclusion of the top executive offices.",

      "\"I like it conceptually,\" Trump said of the bill. \"I don't know about it, but I like it conceptually and, you know, Nancy Pelosi became rich by having inside information. She made a fortune with her husband. And I think that's disgraceful. So in that sense, I'd like it, but I'd have to really see. I'd have, you know \u2014 I study these things very carefully, and this just happened. So I'll take a look at it. But conceptually, I like it.\"",
      "A source familiar with Wednesday's negotiations told Fox News Digital that Hawley negotiated with Democrats while keeping Republicans in the dark, citing multiple pieces of legislation that crossed lawmakers' desks Monday morning that each had different versions of the ban. Hawley faced staunch criticism from his Republican colleagues during the markup process.",

      "\"I don't mind anyone being rich. I mind people getting rich while they\u2019re here and trading stocks,\" Hawley responded.",
      "Following the hearing, reporters asked Hawley about the criticism from his Republican colleagues more broadly.",
      "\"They don't want to ban stock trading. I just think that's a mistake,\" he responded.",
      "Current GOP versions of the stock trading ban moving through the House of Representatives do not include the president and vice president.",
      "Sen. Rick Scott was among the Republicans who criticized Hawley's stock trading ban on Wednesday. (Reuters)",
      "Hawley's ban would prohibit lawmakers, the president, vice president and their spouses from holding, purchasing or selling stocks for the duration of their time in office. Officeholders would be allowed to invest in diversified mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, or U.S. Treasury bonds while in office.",

      "Why lithium-ion batteries need a second life",
      "From your phone to electric vehicles and even power grids, lithium-ion batteries are everywhere. They offer unmatched energy density and can scale to meet large infrastructure demands. However, there's a catch. Even with optimal use, these batteries wear out after a few thousand charge cycles. When they die, they leave behind components such as nickel, cobalt, and manganese, materials that are expensive and environmentally damaging to mine. Without a solid plan for recycling, the clean energy revolution could create a very dirty problem.",
      "The problem with traditional battery recycling",
      "Standard recycling methods aren't quite up to the task. They're energy-intensive, generate significant emissions, and often fail to recover materials in usable form. This means many recycled batteries can't be turned into new, high-performing ones. As a result, manufacturers continue to mine for raw materials, causing further environmental harm. That's why scientists have been searching for a better way to close the loop.",

      "What this means for you",
      "If you rely on a smartphone, drive an EV, or use a laptop daily, this research affects you. The push toward clean energy is not just about wind turbines and solar panels. It's about making the entire system, including batteries, more sustainable. Right now, most of us toss old devices without thinking about where the battery ends up. But that battery contains valuable metals, metals that are expensive to mine and harmful to extract.",
      "This new method from WPI means future batteries in your devices could be made from sustainably recycled materials, without sacrificing performance. That helps keep costs down, reduces toxic waste, and shrinks your personal carbon footprint. These high-performance recycled batteries could soon power electric vehicles, solar-powered homes, and even the devices in your pocket, bringing sustainability directly into your life.

      "Meta's wristband could change how you interact with your devices, whether you have a disability or just want a faster way to get things done. Instead of tapping or typing, your wrist muscles can now act as the controller. This means less strain, more freedom, and a whole new way to stay connected on the go. If you've ever wished for a simpler way to text, scroll, or select items without touching a screen, this tech makes it possible. And because it works without a custom setup, you can start using it almost instantly.",

    "summary": "Long-haul trucks are now being upgraded with a surprising twist, thanks to California-based startup Revoy. Their electric boost doesn&apos;t replace diesel but works alongside it to cut emissions and fuel costs without major disruption.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "If you think electric trucking means buying a brand-new semi, think again. Long-haul trucks are now being upgraded with a surprising twist, thanks to California-based startup Revoy. Their electric boost doesn't replace diesel but works alongside it to cut emissions and fuel costs without major disruption.",
      "In 2025, transportation was the top source of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States. And for the first time, heavy-duty trucks edged out passenger vehicles in how much pollution they produce. That makes freight the low-hanging fruit in the fight to reduce emissions. But electrifying it? That's where things get tricky.",
      "Electric semis are pricey. They're also heavy, have limited range, and take too long to charge. Trucking companies, many of them small operators, run on razor-thin margins and can't afford long downtimes. Public fast-charging for trucks barely exists. And without more demand, investors aren't building new stations. That's the bottleneck.",
      "Revoy's solution flips the equation. Instead of replacing the truck, they simply electrify the space between the cab and trailer.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts, and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide - free when you join my\u00a0CYBERGUY.COM/NEWSLETTER.",
      "A big rig using a high-tech electric dolly with its own motor and a battery pack. (Revoy)",
      "How an electric dolly converts diesel trucks instantly",
      "Imagine your standard diesel rig pulling onto the highway. Nothing looks unusual until you notice something new sandwiched between the truck and trailer. Revoy's innovation is a high-tech electric dolly with its own motor and a massive battery pack.",
      "The dolly carries a 575-kilowatt-hour battery, putting it in the same class as fully electric semis. But here's the clever part: it doesn't just trail along. It pushes the truck forward using its own powered axle, giving the diesel engine a break and saving fuel. All of this happens without modifying the truck or trailer.",
      "It connects to the truck's fifth-wheel hitch using a smart kingpin. It also plugs into the existing air and electrical lines between the cab and trailer. No hardwiring. No overhaul. Revoy designed it for fast installation, just minutes, no tools required.",
      "Illustration of how the Revoy dolly connects to the truck's fifth-wheel hitch. (Revoy)",
      "Electric truck conversion adds smart driving features",
      "This isn't just about range. Revoy's dolly also turns any diesel rig into a smarter, safer machine. Using embedded sensors and cameras, the dolly monitors blind spots and feeds real-time data to a driver's smartphone app. It enhances lane stability, helps correct steering in crosswinds, and delivers regenerative braking that recharges the battery. It also enables automated reversing, especially useful for tight yards and docks.",
      "The best part? Drivers don't need to learn anything new. There's no extra dashboard. The truck drives as it always has, just with extra power, extra control, and extra safety.",
      "EV battery swapping makes truck charging fast and easy",
      "Charging has always been a weak point in electric freight. Even the fastest chargers take 30 minutes or more to top off a truck battery. Revoy dodges that altogether. Instead of plugging in, truckers pull into a Revoy swap station and exchange their depleted dolly for a freshly charged one. The process takes about five minutes, which is faster than refueling a diesel tank.",
      "The first swap stations are already live in Texas and Arkansas, with more coming soon. As the network grows, so does the vision of truly hybrid diesel-electric freight. And if the route doesn't include a Revoy station? No problem. The truck simply runs on diesel alone and drops off the dolly at the last location passed.",
      "Illustration of a Revoy swap station. (Revoy)",
      "Electric conversion for trucks without upfront costs",
      "Worried about capital expense? Revoy's business model removes the barrier entirely. Truckers and fleet operators don't purchase the dolly; they lease it per mile. That means zero capital investment and no maintenance headaches.",
      "The system is designed to pay for itself. Revoy estimates savings of over $5,000 per truck annually, mostly through reduced fuel consumption. In some cases, fleets have reported 3 to 5 times better fuel efficiency.",
      "And weight isn't an issue for most operators. While the dolly adds mass, most truckloads fill trailers by volume, not weight. Revoy says over 60% of loads qualify, making this a practical fit for the majority of long-haul routes.",
      "Can this electric truck add-on work worldwide?",
      "Revoy built its dolly system for U.S.-style single-trailer rigs, but the idea could scale globally. Countries like Australia, with vast, sun-drenched highways, could easily support dolly-swap stations powered by solar energy. Imagine swapping a charged dolly in the Outback instead of waiting an hour for a charger.",
      "Canada and other countries with twin-trailer B-Doubles would require a modified version, but the core concept remains powerful: electrify trucks without replacing them. The technology is modular. The logistics are scalable. The potential is massive.",
      "A big rig on the road using a high-tech electric dolly. (Revoy)",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Electric trucks\u00a0are still years away from becoming mainstream. But this electric add-on is already solving the biggest problems today. It's fast. It's smart. It works with the trucks that are already on the road. Instead of overhauling the entire trucking industry, this system works with what exists right now. You don't need a brand-new truck. You just need a smarter way to power it.",

      "Opposition is mounting from climate advocates and watchdogs. Nichole Heil from the Private Equity Stakeholder Project voiced concerns over financial burdens and rate hikes:",
      "\"No one in northern Minnesota wants higher utility bills solely to line the pockets of Wall Street-based private equity firms.\"",
      "Electricity bills are already climbing nationwide. According to the Energy Information Administration, the average monthly household bill rose nearly 4% in April to $175 a month. This is the average for a single household using 1,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity.",
      "To address these concerns, the Minnesota Department of Commerce brokered a deal that includes key protections. These measures prohibit passing acquisition costs onto customers and preserve programs for low-income households.",

      "If Wall Street giants like BlackRock and Blackstone acquire your local utility, rates could increase as they strive to maximize returns for their shareholders. Sure, they might improve the infrastructure and service, but history shows that when these types of companies come in, customers often end up paying more. They need to be kept in check to balance infrastructure investment while making energy affordable for regular Americans.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "The rapid increase in demand for tech has made utility ownership a battleground between profit-driven investors and consumer advocates. While firms like BlackRock and Blackstone argue that their resources can modernize aging grids, critics warn of a future where reliability and affordability take a backseat. With regulators now at a crossroads, the outcome in Minnesota may set the tone for utility ownership nationwide.",

      "ChatGPT agent powers itself with a unified agentic system that combines multiple strengths behind the scenes. It integrates\u00a0Operator's\u00a0ability to interact visually with websites, clicking, filling forms, and navigating pages, with deep research's capacity for synthesizing complex information. Added to this are new tools, including a text-based browser for efficient reasoning, a terminal to run code, and direct API access. The agent also uses\u00a0connectors to apps like Gmail and GitHub to pull relevant data while maintaining security.",
      "When you assign it a task, ChatGPT agent spins up a secure virtual workspace, effectively giving your assistant its own computer.

It feels more like a true assistant than a chatbot, capable of following multi-step instructions and updating you as it works.",

      "OpenAI stresses that you remain fully in control. ChatGPT agent explicitly asks for your permission before sending emails, making bookings, or changing files. It actively refuses high-risk requests like bank transfers or actions with serious consequences without your consent.",
      "The agent stops when you open sensitive websites, avoids following harmful web instructions, and lets you clear browsing histories and revoke permissions at any time. Sensitive data like passwords are never stored or exposed because the model does not need to see them.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "With ChatGPT agent, we're moving from AI chatbots that merely react to those that are proactive and decision-makers. As AI agents become increasingly autonomous, their capabilities will continue to expand. However, the biggest challenge for OpenAI will be striking the right balance between convenience, safety, and privacy.",

      "Illustration of a dog watching TV. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why dogs see TV differently than we do",
      "In the past, older TVs didn't do much for dogs. Their lower refresh rates caused flickering that was hard for canine eyes to process. Dogs see flicker more sensitively than humans do. So while you were watching your favorite sitcom, your dog was probably just seeing a strobe light. Today's high-definition, high-frame-rate TVs are a different story. The improved visuals and sound mean dogs can now recognize what's happening onscreen and respond to it.",
      "What the study found about how dogs respond to different kinds of tv content",
      "Researchers developed something called the Dog Television Viewing Scale (DTVS). It's a 16-question tool that helps measure how dogs respond to different kinds of TV content, like barking, tail-wagging, or even following something off-screen. They surveyed over 650 dog owners. More than 450 respondents reported that their dogs actually watch TV. From there, three main behavior patterns emerged:",
      "Dogs responded most strongly to other animals, especially dogs and wildlife.",
      "Some dogs physically tracked an object as it moved off the screen. This suggests they think the image might exist beyond the TV, like in real life.",
      "Dogs also reacted to people and inanimate objects, such as cars or doorbells.",
      "Illustration of a dog watching TV. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Personality plays a big role in how dogs react to TV",
      "The researchers found that personality, not breed or age, influenced how dogs reacted. Excitable dogs were more likely to exhibit \"follow\" behavior, actively watching and expecting movement off-screen. Fearful or reactive dogs were more sensitive to non-animal stimuli, like human voices or doorbells. Interestingly, dogs' sex, breed, or even whether they were neutered didn't seem to affect their TV habits. Exposure to TV also wasn't a strong factor, meaning dogs aren't necessarily \"trained\" to watch.",
      "What this means for dog owners",
      "If you leave the TV on for your dog while you're out, you're not alone, and it might even help them feel more at ease. But not all dogs benefit the same way. The content matters. Animal-heavy programming could excite or soothe a curious pup. But shows with loud sounds or human conflict could stress out a fearful dog. Some streaming services, like DOGTV, are now designing content tailored for dogs. This research gives that idea more scientific credibility.",
      "Illustration of a dog watching TV. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Can TV help shelter dogs?",
      "The findings suggest a new tool for improving dog welfare, especially in shelters. Tailored TV programming could help reduce stress and provide mental enrichment for dogs waiting to be adopted. Still, more research is needed. Most of the data came from owners whose dogs already engage with TV. Behavior reports were based on what owners observed, rather than direct measurement.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "TV might not just be background noise for your dog. For some, it could be entertainment. For others, it might even be stress relief or stimulation. And thanks to modern screen tech, they're seeing it clearer than ever before. So next time you catch your dog watching with you, take a moment. They may really be following the action.",

      "How scammers trick your parents even when they know better",
      "What does this have to do with protecting your parents from scammers? None of us is invulnerable, not even a hero like Odysseus. The trick is knowing what you can't resist and, one way or another, avoiding it. You can teach your parents all there is to know about modern-day fraud and the dangers of sharing personal information, but there's still this Siren song out there that will have them throwing all that knowledge out the window in a heartbeat.",
      "What this Siren song is varies from person to person and day to day. It might be a near-perfect clone of a grandchild's voice, calling in a panic and asking for an urgent transfer to bail them out of trouble, if not jail. Alternatively, a financial adviser could be deftly playing on your parents' anxieties around money since retiring. Another common scam involves a suspiciously foreign-sounding Microsoft customer-support worker calling to inform your parents that the computer they don't have or never use has been infected with a virus.",
      "Emotional triggers are the scammer's best tool",
      "The point is that all of us, no matter how well-informed, careful, or clever, can be exploited by a fast-talking scammer. All it takes is the right hook at exactly the wrong moment, and we're along for the ride. All the more so as we get older and technology advances rapidly, leaving us behind. Scammers rely on emotional reactions as much as, if not more than, ignorance. Letting your parents know about the dangers of engaging with strangers (even if they claim to be from Visa or\u00a0the IRS) is crucial, but it's not enough. Scammers exploit fear, greed, and the desire to please others or simply be a good citizen. They're experts at raising the emotional toll of interrupting, interrogating, or ignoring them. In short, getting drawn into discussions with scammers is playing with fire.",
      "(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsso)",
      "The best solution: Cut off scammers at the source",
      "So, what's the solution? Stop the scammers from making contact in the first place. They're getting your parents' contact information and much more personal data besides, from somewhere. Stop them from getting their hands on it, and they won't have the chance to manipulate your parents into doing something they'll regret.",
      "People-search sites are a great source of information for scammers. Fast, easy, and inexpensive, they fuel smaller operations and individual scammers. People-search sites are a kind of data broker; the other major kind, sometimes called private-database data brokers, are even worse. These data brokers sell personal data in bulk to other businesses.",
      "They've been caught selling the personal data of vulnerable adults before, offering data packs that focused on people who needed in-home care or were suffering from cognitive impairment or decline, for example. This is worse than posting your parents' details publicly. This is packaging up those details and marketing them directly to scammers.",
      "An elderly parent and his daughter \u00a0looking at a laptop screen. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsso)",

Names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, property values, health information, shopping habits, political preferences, and more. You can take all this down in one fell swoop with a personal data removal service.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0 They aren\u2019t cheap and neither is your privacy.\u00a0 These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0 It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0 By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you and your parents.",

      "The Walker S2 humanoid robot switches out its own battery\u00a0 (UBTech)",
      "How the Walker S2 robot swaps its own battery",
      "Instead of shutting down to recharge, the Walker S2 walks to a nearby swap station. When one battery starts to run low, the robot turns its torso, uses built-in tools on its arms and removes the drained battery. It then picks up a fresh one, plugs it in and gets back to work immediately. The entire process takes about three minutes. This system is similar to battery-swapping tech used in electric vehicles. But this time, it\u2019s for humanoid robots.",

      "The Walker S2 is the size of a small adult. It\u2019s 5 feet, 3 inches tall and weighs 95 pounds. It has two 48-volt lithium batteries. When one runs out, it switches to the other. Each battery lasts approximately two hours while walking or four hours when the robot is standing still. Swap stations also monitor battery health. If a battery starts to degrade, a technician can replace it.",

They have vision systems to detect battery levels. A green light indicates that a battery is ready to use. The robot reads that, picks it up and plugs it in using a USB-style connector. The robot also features a display face to communicate its status to human workers. And, yes, there\u2019s an emergency stop button, just in case.",

      "What is AI-powered ticket pricing?",
      "Traditional ticket pricing relies on fare \"buckets,\" where customers are grouped into categories based on when and how they book their tickets. Delta's AI-powered system replaces static pricing with a dynamic model that evaluates real-time market data, like demand surges or route-specific trends, to recommend pricing tiers.",
      "Delta President Glen Hauenstein describes this as a reengineering of pricing, calling AI a\u00a0\"super analyst\" that works 24/7, seeking the optimal price for every traveler, every time. The airline has partnered with Fetcherr, which provides the underlying technology and also supports other global airlines.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Why Delta wants smarter, not personalized pricing",
      "Let's be honest. Airlines aren't adopting new, high-tech pricing systems to make less money. Delta says early results from AI-driven pricing show\u00a0\"amazingly favorable\" revenues.",
      "However, the airline states it is not personalizing prices based on individual behavior. Instead, the AI analyzes large-scale patterns, like route demand, seasonal shifts, and timing trends, before analysts set final prices.",

      "Passengers traveling through an airport (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How does this affect travelers?",
      "If you've ever wondered why airfare fluctuates every time you check, get ready for even more volatility. Delta's system could theoretically offer you a different price than someone else for the exact same seat, calculated in real time by AI.",
      "Pros: You might get special offers or early discounts if the AI needs to fill seats.",
      "Cons: It becomes much harder to know if you're getting a \"fair\" deal because the price shown is purely based on what AI thinks you'll pay, not what everyone else pays.",
      "Some privacy advocates worry this could disadvantage customers who lack the means or time to search for the best deals, potentially charging the highest prices to those unable to shop around.",
      "We reached out to Delta for a comment, and a spokesperson provided CyberGuy with this statement:",
      "\"There is no fare product Delta has ever used, is testing or plans to use that targets customers with individualized offers based on personal information or otherwise. A variety of market forces drive the dynamic pricing model that\u2019s been used in the global industry for decades, with new tech simply streamlining this process. Delta always complies with regulations around pricing and disclosures.\"",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Industry impact and growing criticism over AI ticket pricing",
      "Delta's transparency regarding this shift has drawn national attention. Other airlines are already testing their own AI fare systems, and experts expect the industry to follow suit. Yet, privacy advocates and some lawmakers are voicing strong concerns. Critics argue that letting AI determine pricing behind the scenes is, in the words of Consumer Watchdog, like airlines\u00a0\"hacking our brains\" to find the maximum price we'll accept.",
      "The legal risks are still emerging. While price variation based on demand or timing is not new, using AI for ultra-personalized pricing raises uncomfortable questions about discrimination and fairness, especially since prior research suggests that poorer customers often receive the worst deals.",
      "Passengers sitting on a plane\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What this means for you",
      "Delta says it does not tailor prices based on your digital footprint. You won't be charged more because you searched twice or booked from a certain device. Instead, prices respond to broader factors like how many seats are left, the time of day, and demand on that route.",
      "That said, airfares will likely feel even more unpredictable. Shopping around is now a must. Quick decisions might save you money, but waiting could result in a price increase.",
      "A VPN may still help you hide your location, but Delta states that its pricing does not vary by personal data like IP or browser history. Still, comparing prices across platforms and booking early remain smart moves.",
      "Privacy matters more than ever, not because Delta is watching you, but because digital tools are transforming how industries think about pricing. In short, you still have power as a consumer. Be smart, be flexible, and always compare before making a purchase.",

      "AI took off in 2023 when tools like ChatGPT became widely adopted. Since then, companies have been racing to build more infrastructure to keep up. PJM's territory now has the largest number of data centers in the world.",
      "Between 2024 and 2025, electricity demand from AI and data centers in the PJM region contributed to a $9 billion increase in power costs. PJM expects peak usage this summer to reach over 154,000 megawatts, with the potential to exceed all-time records during heat waves or emergencies.",
      "AI data center needing high energy demands\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why electricity prices are rising across the U.S.",
      "While demand is rising quickly, the power supply is not keeping up with the pace. Many fossil fuel plants are shutting down due to state regulations, aging infrastructure or market conditions. More than 9,000 megawatts of coal capacity will retire or convert to gas in 2025 alone.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Clean energy options like wind and solar are often the cheapest ways to add new power, but developers are struggling with permitting delays, rising costs and a loss of federal incentives. For example, the 30% federal solar tax credit for homeowners will end after 2025. That change is already slowing down new installations.",
      "Large solar farm generating renewable energy\u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How AI is increasing your electric bill",
      "Even if you never use AI tools yourself, you are still likely paying for their growth. The cost of expanding the data center's power supply is spread across all grid users, including regular households.",
      "PJM customers have been warned to expect electric bills to increase by $25 or more per month. Commercial users may see prices climb nearly 30%.",
      "To help prevent rolling blackouts, PJM is rolling out demand response programs that pay large businesses to temporarily reduce their electricity use during periods of extreme demand. Still, if electricity usage exceeds 166,000 megawatts, some regions may not have enough reserve power to maintain reliability.",
      "Tips to reduce your electricity bill",
      "Looking for ways to lower your electricity bill as prices surge? Here are some effective tips you can start using today:",
      "Unplug electronics and appliances when not in use to avoid phantom power drain.Upgrade to\u00a0smart thermostats and LED lighting for greater energy efficiency.Run major appliances (like washers and dishwashers) during off-peak hours.Consider adding weather stripping or insulation to block drafts and improve cooling/heating.Monitor your energy usage with\u00a0smart plugs or an electricity usage monitor for real-time feedback.",

Without major upgrades to infrastructure or smarter energy policy, prices could keep climbing. The tech may be smart, but the cost of keeping it running is getting harder for everyone else to ignore.",

      "4. Use strong antivirus software: Consider using strong antivirus software with built-in phishing and link protection to catch threats before they reach you. Stay vigilant when it comes to emails, phone calls, or messages from unknown sources asking for personal information. Avoid clicking on suspicious links or providing sensitive details unless you can verify the legitimacy of the request. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "6. Consider personal data removal services: After phishing attempts, your data may end up circulating among data brokers, increasing your risk of future scams and identity theft. Data removal services can help reduce the visibility of your personal information by submitting removal requests to dozens of people-search and broker sites. This limits how easily scammers and spammers can find and target you.",

This setup delivers precise environmental awareness for everything from highway cruising to close-range maneuvers.",

      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "These updates are just the beginning. Lucid is investing heavily in advanced driver-assistance and automation, with a clear focus on safety, comfort and long-term innovation.",
      "Lucid now joins the ranks of top hands-free driving systems. Tesla's Full Self-Driving and GM's Super Cruise both offer hands-free driving on highways, though they differ in how they monitor driver attention and what roads they support. Ford's BlueCruise is another major option, available on a growing number of mapped highways. Mercedes-Benz Drive Pilot goes a step further by letting drivers take their eyes off the road in certain traffic conditions, though it's only available in limited markets for now.",

      "What this means for you",
      "If you're driving a car with advanced driver-assistance features, such as the Lucid Air or similar models, you're likely noticing real changes in your daily routine. With hands-off driving now available on select highways, those stressful commutes can feel a little easier. Sitting in stop-and-go traffic doesn't have to be such a chore anymore. Long road trips? Suddenly, they're much more comfortable. Many automakers, not just Lucid, are pushing out updates directly to your car, so you can access new tools without ever stepping into a service center.",
      "Safety is at the forefront with these new systems. As you drive, a network of sensors and smart software helps keep your lane changes smooth, your following distances steady and your ride free from abrupt surprises. These advances can give you peace of mind, but it's essential to remember that these systems don't drive for you. You still need to stay alert and keep your hands ready.",
      "With more cars using similar technology each year, the roads themselves are changing. There's hope that fewer accidents caused by distraction or delayed reactions will benefit not just tech-savvy drivers, but everyone out there. While these models, like the Lucid Air, showcase what's possible, the real transformation comes as driver-assistance features become the new normal in cars everywhere.",

      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Lucid's new hands-free driving update puts it in direct competition with Tesla, GM, and other automakers working to change the way we drive. With DreamDrive Pro, Lucid shows that combining advanced hardware, in-house software, and frequent updates can deliver real capability. As more companies roll out similar systems, drivers are getting more options, and the convenience once reserved for luxury models is becoming more accessible.",

Antivirus software and firewalls cannot fix all of these problems. A VPN offers a powerful layer of protection by encrypting your traffic, hiding your activity, and making your connection truly private.

      "Some of the criminal illegal aliens charged or convicted of a child sex offense arrested by the ICE ERO Houston Field Office in the past six months. (ICE; Google Maps)",
      "Gould emphasized that the surge in arrests reflects more than Houston's proximity to the southern border; it\u2019s also the result of renewed political will.",
      "\"This is a renewed commitment,\" Gould said. \"They\u2019ve put together a multi-agency task force, involving the FBI, DEA, Customs, and state law enforcement. The numbers don\u2019t lie\u2014what we\u2019re seeing in these arrests reflects a policy shift.\"",
      "He contrasted the Trump administration's posture on immigration enforcement with the Biden administration, arguing that the current administration has prioritized the removal of individuals charged with felonies, particularly those involving children.",
      "\"Trump has done an excellent job shutting down the border,\" Gould said. \"But now, the administration is focusing on what to do internally, and that\u2019s targeting the worst of the worst. That\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing.\"",

      "Gould noted that the success of these operations hinges on the close cooperation between local and federal law enforcement.",
      "\"Federal reach only goes so far,\" he said. \"Local law enforcement knows who these offenders are, and where they are. They have the most at stake because it\u2019s their community.\"",
      "He added that working together not only improves operational efficiency but also boosts morale among local departments who might otherwise feel sidelined by federal agents.",

      "The NTSB kicked off the first day of hearings in Washington on Wednesday to discuss the Jan. 29 crash between an American Airlines plane from Wichita, Kansas, and a Black Hawk helicopter near Ronald Reagan National Airport that left 67 people dead.",
      "Air traffic controllers reportedly warned about the hazards of helicopter traffic near the airport for years leading up to the crash, but concerns raised about the Black Hawk helicopter's route were not addressed. The Federal Aviation Administration also allegedly did not make route changes or warn pilots, despite 85 near misses in the past three years at the airport.",
      "\"It\u2019s so bureaucratic,\" NTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy said during the hearing, adding, in part, that \"people are so critical of the federal government because you can\u2019t ensure safety.\"",
      "NTSB LAUNCHES 3-DAY INVESTIGATIVE HEARING ON DEADLY DC PLANE CRASH",
      "The NTSB on Wednesday kicked off the first day of hearings in Washington, in which investigators pointed to several factors that contributed to the crash. (AP)",
      "Army and FAA representatives attempted to point blame toward air traffic controllers and the lack of separation between planes landing at the airport and helicopters flying on approved routes, but later implied that the routes weren't supposed to ensure separation.",
      "The Army did acknowledge that Black Hawk altimeters may be more than 100 feet off before adding that their pilots aim to maintain altitude within 100 feet of a limit.",
      "Lawyer Bob Clifford, who is representing several victims\u2019 families, said the hearing had a lot of \"finger-pointing\" and \"no acceptance of responsibility and accountability.\"",
      "Though the final report will not be released until next year, the hearing on Wednesday revealed how small the margin of error was for helicopters flying the route that the Black Hawk took that night.",
      "The flight data recorder showed the helicopter was 80 to 100 feet higher than the barometric altimeter the pilots relied upon showed they were flying, investigators said on Wednesday. The NTSB conducted tests on three other helicopters from the same unit in a flight over the same area and found similar discrepancies in their altimeters.",
      "The bigger concern, Army officials said, is that there are some FAA-approved routes around the airport with separation distances as small as 75 feet when planes are landing on a certain runway.",
      "\"The fact that we have less than 500 feet separation is a concern for me,\" Scott Rosengren, chief engineer in the office that manages the Army\u2019s utility helicopters, said during the hearing.",
      "Rosengren said that \"if he was king for a day\" he would immediately retire all the older Black Hawk models like the one involved in the crash and replace them with newer versions.",
      "The incident in January was the first in a string of crashes and near-misses this year that have sparked concern among officials and travelers. (AP)",
      "During the two minutes before the crash, an air traffic controller was directing airport traffic and helicopters in the area, which included communications with several different aircraft on two different frequencies, according to the NTSB's History of Flight Performance Study released on Wednesday.",
      "The air traffic controller had communicated with the Black Hawk helicopter, an airplane that was taking off, an Air Force helicopter, an airplane on the ground, a medical helicopter and an inbound airplane that was not the one involved in the crash.",
      "\"All aircraft could hear the controller, but helicopters could only hear other helicopters on their frequency and airplanes only other airplanes,\" the report said. \"This resulted in a number of stepped-on transmissions as helicopters and airplanes were not aware when the other was communicating.\"",
      "Stepped on transmissions refers to those that are unheard or blocked because of other transmissions. The NTSB report includes a list of 29 separate communications between the airport tower and other aircraft during the two minutes before the crash.",
      "Previously disclosed air traffic control audio featured the helicopter pilot telling the air traffic controller twice that they had noticed the plane and would avoid it.",
      "Officials on Wednesday also raised concerns about the use of night vision goggles on the helicopter as a factor in the crash, as the goggles limit the field of view.",
      "Investigations have previously shown that the FAA failed to recognize a history of 85 near-misses around the airport in the three years before the collision and that the Army's helicopters routinely flew around Washington with a key piece of locating equipment, known as ADS-B Out, turned off.",
      "Even if they had been turned on, the ADS-B Out systems on most of the helicopters in the same unit as the one that crashed would not work because they had been installed incorrectly, officials said on Wednesday. When the NTSB learned of that problem, the Army sent out an alert about it and worked to quickly reprogram the units to ensure they would work.",
      "Homendy said \"every sign was there that there was a safety risk and the tower was telling you that,\" but after the incident, the FAA transferred managers out of the tower instead of admitting they had been warned.",
      "Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, introduced legislation on Tuesday to require all aircraft operators to use both forms of ADS-B, the technology to broadcast aircraft location data to other planes and air traffic controllers. Most aircraft today are equipped with ADS-B Out equipment, but airlines would need to add the more comprehensive ADS-B In technology to their planes.",

      "Eight days later, on Jan. 28, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) confirmed that the order had paused the government program, barring additional Ukrainians from entering the U.S. under those protections.",
      "However, even as TPS remained in place for Ukrainians already stateside, concern remained high amid reports in March that the president was considering the removal of this protection status.",

      "From Gaza to Greenland, French President Emmanuel Macron appears to be taking increasingly bolder diplomatic stabs at President Donald Trump\u2019s foreign policy even though such gestures don\u2019t \"carry weight\" as Trump pointed out last week after the French leader declared his intention to recognize a Palestinian state.",
      "\"French Presidents from Charles de Gaulle onwards have\u00a0reveled in the idea that they are a natural counterweight to U.S. foreign policy on the international stage,\" Alan Mendoza, executive director of the U.K.-based Henry Jackson Society, told Fox News Digital Monday.",
      "Charles de Gaulle was\u00a0France\u2019s long-serving leader in the 1950s and 1960s and was famously resistant to U.S. global dominance, withdrawing his country from NATO\u2019s military command structure in a bid to increase its military independence and criticizing U.S. policies in Eastern Europe and Vietnam.",

      "Macron met with Trump in Washington on the third anniversary of Russia's full-scale military invasion of Ukraine.\u00a0 (Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images)",
      "Such contrarian actions, Mendoza said, \"have in many ways defined the French Fifth Republic, with\u00a0larger-than-life characters thrusting their views onto the world stage.",
      "\"The difference now is that France matters far less globally than it did 60 years ago,\" he said, adding that a weakening of the European country\u2019s economy and its military might \"means that where once de Gaulle could roar, now Macron whimpers.\"",
      "\"What was once a sign of French strength and confidence now therefore looks more like a desperate attempt to escape irrelevance,\" said Mendoza.",
      "In a dramatic announcement last week, Macron said that at the United Nations General Assembly in September France intends to declare its recognition of a Palestinian state, even as Palestinian terror groups continue to battle Israel in the Gaza Strip.",

      "It was also criticized by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who called the decision \"reckless\" and \"a slap in the face to the victims of October 7th.\" He said the U.S. strongly rejected such a plan.",

      "This is not the first time the president has discounted Macron as inconsequential.",
      "Last month, after the French president speculated about Trump\u2019s reasons for leaving the G7 summit in Canada early and returning to Washington, the president wrote on his Truth Social platform, \"Wrong! He has no idea why I am now on my way to Washington, but it certainly has nothing to do with a Cease Fire. Much bigger than that. Whether purposely or not, Emmanuel always gets it wrong. Stay Tuned!\"",
      "In the same post, Trump said Macron was \"publicity seeking.\"",

      "The disparaging comments came after Macron directly contradicted Trump\u2019s foreign policy by stopping on his way to the summit in the semi-autonomous Arctic territory of Greenland, which Trump has said he wishes to acquire.",
      "\"Greenland is not to be sold, not to be taken,\" Macron declared in a\u00a0diplomatic stab at Trump\u2019s foreign policy and seemingly an attempt to rally support from\u00a0other European countries to stand up to the U.S.",
      "Asked about Trump\u2019s ambitions for Greenland, Macron, according to Reuters, said, \"I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what allies do. \u2026 \u00a0It\u2019s important that Denmark and the Europeans commit themselves to this territory, which has very high strategic stakes and whose territorial integrity must be respected.\"",
      "In February, the French president paid his first visit to the White House since Trump\u2019s return to power, and while the meeting appeared to be\u00a0warm, it also\u00a0came amid tension over the U.S. approach to the Russia-Ukraine war.",
      "Hours before the meeting, the U.S. voted against a United Nations resolution drafted by Ukraine and the European Union condemning Russia for its invasion.",

      "They\u00a0stem from Macron\u2019s\u00a0\"desire to be relevant and to stand for something,\" he said.\u00a0\"The French are famous contrarians, but they do it for the sake of being contrarian.\"",
      "Reuel Marc Gerecht, a resident scholar at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, the Washington, D.C., think tank, said Macron was no\u00a0\"different from most European leaders. \u2026 Trump just isn\u2019t their cup of tea.\"",

      "\"The American way\u00a0has been enormously appealing in Europe since World War\u00a0II, but it has come in part at the expense of the French, who have culturally lost a lot of ground to the Anglophones, especially the Americans,\" he said. \"Consequently, many Frenchmen have a love-hate relationship with the U.S.\"",
      "On\u00a0Macron, Gerecht added, \"He is part of the French elite. They are a bright lot who punch way above their weight, but, educationally, temperamentally, they are nearly the opposite of Trump.\"",

      "Holding 15 of 248 Upper House seats is not sufficient for Kamiya\u2019s party to submit legislation. However, polling data shows Sanseit\u014d\u2019s impact with younger voters, as Kyodo News reported that more than 20% of voters from 18 to 40 voted for his party.",

      "Inspired by President Donald Trump\u2019s leadership style, Kamiya\u2019s rise has largely been attributed to his social media savvy. He snagged his earliest followers through his opposition to \"blanket mask mandates, mass PCR testing, and vaccine requirements\" during the COVID-19 pandemic, Japan Forward reported.",
      "Kamiya has also adopted a spin-off of Trump\u2019s MAGA motto, proclaiming \"Japanese first\" as his party promises to strengthen Japan\u2019s culture, birth rates and food sufficiency, while finding solutions for its reliance on immigration.",
      "Though the Western media has characterized Kamiya as far-right, fringe or xenophobic, Lance Gatling, a principal at Nexial Research, Tokyo, told Fox News Digital that while Kamiya\u2019s goals of \"protecting Japan, growing Japan, and educating Japan\" are \"fairly populist,\" they do not represent \"a radical move towards the right wing.\"",
      "In fact, Gatling said many in the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which has dominated Japanese politics for decades, \"are more right-wing than Sanseit\u014d.\" Gatling described members of Kamiya\u2019s party as \"pretty reasonable.\"",
      "Gaitlin said that Kamiya, formerly a reservist in the Self-Defense Forces and an English teacher, \"doesn\u2019t appear to be playing.\" Kamiya \"has been honing his message for some time,\" Gatling said.",

      "Some critics have expressed particular concern over what they call Kamiya\u2019s anti-immigration stance. Immigration, however, has become a chief issue for the island nation. When former President Joe Biden called Japan \"xenophobic\" for failing to increase immigration in May 2024, Kamiya responded on social media. \"It\u2019s not that we\u2019re xenophobic, we are being cautious after seeing your failures,\" Kamiya said. \"You are meddling too much in our internal affairs.\"",
      "Gatling says categorizing the Japanese as xenophobic \"just doesn\u2019t ring true.\" He explained that the country has \"one of the most astonishing cultures in history,\" formed by adopting Western culture and enriching it to create \"a completely unique culture that has tremendous appeal around the world.\"",
      "Gatling says Kamiya is aiming for a return to traditional cultural values, while also lowering taxes and increasing food self-sufficiency, which is currently the lowest rate of all Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development nations at 38%.",

      "The rice trade would be critical to this arrangement, with Sanseit\u014d eager to curb imports of U.S. rice. At present, imports of U.S. rice are set to increase by 75%, thanks to a $550 billion trade deal President Donald Trump signed with Japan on July 22.",
      "Another possible friction point in the future might be Sanseit\u014d\u2019s desire to turn the nation\u2019s farmers into public sector employees, Gatling admitted. \"The agriculture bloc is one of the most powerful in the LDP,\" he explained. \"I\u2019m not sure how many of the farmers want to be public sector employees.\"",
      "While he says that it is too early to determine the future of Sanseit\u014d in Japanese politics, Gatling said Kamiya has stated he is not \"interested in building a coalition government.\" Gatling believes the party\u2019s future will hinge on preparations for subsequent elections and demonstrating that \"they have reasonable policies.\"",
      "Chang said Sanseit\u014d\u2019s win was a loss for the LDP, which he says has \"been adrift\" since Abe\u2019s 2020 resignation and subsequent 2022 assassination. Current Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba \"is weak and unpopular,\" and the LDP now finds itself \"in the minority in both houses of the Diet for the first time since the party was formed in 1955,\" Chang said. \"Ishiba is naturally catching the blame.\"",

      "While the political waves leave Japan \"rudderless,\" Chang said to \"expect Sanseit\u014d to only get stronger, which means Japan will turn inward. Around the world, societies have had enough of large foreign populations that do not assimilate, so we should not be surprised that Kamiya will become even more influential.",
      "\"Change occurs slowly in Japan until it happens all at once. Japan is now on the verge of an all-at-once moment,\" Chang said.",

    "story": [
      "The family of a key survivor of Jeffrey Epstein's sexual abuse urged President Donald Trump on Wednesday not to consider clemency for the late financier's co-conspirator and confidant, Ghislaine Maxwell.",
      "The family of Virginia Roberts Giuffre, a sexual abuse advocate who died by suicide in April, made their plea to Trump in a public statement after he told reporters that Epstein, a convicted sex offender, \"stole\" Giuffre from his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, where she worked as a locker-room attendant at age 16 during the summer of 2000.",
      "Follow live politics coverage here",
      "Giuffre's family called Trump's admission \"shocking\" and questioned whether he was aware of Epstein's and Maxwell's actions.",
      "\u201cIt was shocking to hear President Trump invoke our sister and say that he was aware that Virginia had been 'stolen' from Mar-a-Lago. It makes us ask if he was aware of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell\u2019s criminal actions, especially given his statement two years later that his good friend Jeffrey 'likes women on the younger side . . . no doubt about it.' We and the public are asking for answers; survivors deserve this,\u201d the family added.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Wednesday night that Trump was referring to Giuffre in response to a question from a reporter about her.",
      "\u201cHe did not bring her up. The fact remains that President Trump kicked Jeffrey Epstein out of his club for being a creep to his female employees,\u201d she said in a statement.",
      "In the statement, the family also said it was \u201cconvicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell who targeted and preyed upon our then 16-year-old sister, Virginia, from Mar-a-Lago, where she was working in 2000, several years before Epstein and President Trump had their falling out.\u201d",
      "The Justice Department declined to comment when it was asked about the statement.",
      "Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for her role recruiting and trafficking minors for sex, met with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche last week as the Trump administration seeks additional information pertaining to Epstein's case. While her attorney, David Oscar Markus, said Friday there have been \"no asks and no promises\" about clemency, he told reporters Maxwell \"would welcome any relief.\"",
      "Asked last week about pardoning Maxwell, Trump said he hadn't thought about it but noted that he's \"allowed to do it.\" The family of Giuffre, one of the earliest and most prominent voices to call for charges against Epstein and Maxwell, said any leniency extended toward Maxwell would \"go down in history as being one of the highest travesties of justice.\"",
      "\"The government and the President should never consider giving Ghislaine Maxwell any leniency,\" the family said.",
      "\u201cGhislaine Maxwell is a monster who deserves to rot in prison for the rest of her life for the extraordinary violence and abuse she put not just our sister Virginia through, but many other survivors, who may number in the thousands.\"",
      "Maxwell's attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment regarding the Giuffre family statement.",
      "A senior administration official told NBC News after the statement was issued that \"no leniency is being given or discussed.\"",
      "\"The president himself has said that clemency for Maxwell is not something he is even thinking about at this time,\" the official said.",
      "The Republican-led House Oversight Committee recently subpoenaed Maxwell for a deposition because of the \u201cimmense public interest and scrutiny\u201d surrounding her case and Epstein's. Maxwell\u2019s lawyers said she\u2019d consider testifying if she were granted immunity to ensure she doesn\u2019t \u201crisk further criminal exposure.\u201d Rep. James Comer, R-Ky, the chair of the committee, denied the request, according to his spokesperson.",
      "The Justice Department roiled Trump's base this month in a memo that dismissed Epstein conspiracy theories, some of which Trump and his allies have promoted over the years. Among other things, the memo said that an internal review found no evidence of a \u201cclient list\u201d and that Epstein died by suicide in jail in 2019. It also concluded there was no evidence to suggest Epstein had participated in blackmail.",
      "Despite Trump's efforts to tamp down the backlash from his supporters, at times calling the Epstein issue a \"hoax,\" many in his base have pointed to past promises him and Attorney General Pam Bondi to release all files related to the Epstein investigation.",
      "Trump directed Bondi this month to seek the release of \"pertinent\" grand jury testimony. Bondi subsequently filed requests in federal courts in New York and Florida. A federal judge in Florida denied the Justice Department's request last week, while court proceedings in New York continue.",
      "The directive to seek grand jury testimony came the same day The Wall Street Journal reported that Trump wrote a letter to Epstein in 2003 with a drawing of a naked woman. Trump denied having written the letter and later sued for defamation."

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump slapped higher trade duties on India on Wednesday and offered a reprieve to two others \u2014 his latest trade war declarations in what has become a cornerstone of his second administration.",
      "Imports from India now face a 25% tariff, Trump said in a social media post earlier in the day, along with an unspecified penalty for what Trump said was an over-reliance on Russian energy and military equipment. The president later signaled talks with India were ongoing.",
      "Shortly before 4 p.m., Trump said Brazil was now facing a 90% tariff, up from 50%, as the administration also sanctioned the Brazilian judge overseeing the cases of former President Jair Bolsonaro for allegedly plotting a coup. Trump has taken issue with Brazil's treatment of Bolsonaro, who was a strong supporter in his first term.",
      "Finally, Trump said Wednesday afternoon that South Korea had made \u201can offer to buy down\u201d the 25% duty level it faces. \u201cI will be interested in hearing what that offer is,\u201d Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. NBC News has reported South Korea is interested in investing in U.S. shipbuilding capacity.",
      "Trump announced Wednesday evening that he had met with South Korean trade negotiators. \"The Deal is that South Korea will give to the United States $350 Billion Dollars for Investments owned and controlled by the United States, and selected by myself, as President. Additionally, South Korea will purchase $100 Billion Dollars of LNG, or other Energy products.\"",
      "As a result, Trump said \"We have agreed to a Tariff for South Korea of 15%\" while American imports would not be hit with any import duties at all.",
      "South Korean President Lee Jae-myung confirmed the trade agreement Wednesday evening, writing in a statement that the country has \u201covercome a major hurdle.\u201d",
      "\u201cThrough this agreement, the government has eliminated uncertainty in the export environment and adjusted U.S. tariffs to be at or below those of key competitor nations. This creates conditions for our industries to compete on equal or even more favorable terms,\u201d he wrote.",
      "The announcements come ahead of a Friday trade negotiation deadline that Trump said earlier Wednesday \u201cstands strong\u201d and \u201cwill not be extended.\u201d",
      "The president has suggested that dozens of other countries will face a new baseline tariff level of as much as 20% \u2014 higher than the already-elevated 10% he announced in April \u2014\u00a0once the deadline passes.",
      "Taken together, those tariff levels are at or near the historic highs that Trump initially threatened on \"Liberation Day\" on April 2, a move that shocked the global economy and sent stock markets tumbling.",
      "Trump initially backed down, but he has since steadily been reintroducing elevated tariffs at levels not seen since the 1930s, when a protectionist U.S. trade policy meant to boost the economy ended up worsening the Great Depression.",
      "The Yale University Budget Lab said Monday that U.S. consumers face an effective tariff rate of 18.2%, the highest since 1934, translating to an equivalent loss of as much as $2,400 per household in 2025. That analysis came before Wednesday\u2019s announcement of tariffs on India.",
      "While India's 25% rate would be slightly lower than the 26% that Trump threatened on April 2, it is still a sharp increase from 2.4%, which is the average tariff rate applied to Indian imports in recent years. India is one of the top sources of imports for American consumers and companies, with nearly $90 billion of goods flowing in from India last year.",
      "India recently became the top source of smartphone imports, after Apple shifted production away from China to avoid high tariffs and geopolitical conflicts, according to data reported by Bloomberg. Apple alone exported $17 billion of iPhones from India last year.",
      "Apple CEO Tim Cook said on the company\u2019s May 1 earnings call that he expected \u201cthe majority of iPhones sold in the U.S. will have India as their country of origin\u201d starting this quarter.",
      "Other top U.S. imports from India include chemicals, plastics, leather goods, agricultural products, and metals.",
      "In 2022, India applied an effective average tariff rate of 5.2% on U.S. goods. Oils, cement, stone, glass and machinery rank as India's top purchases from the U.S.",
      "Trump continues to plunge headlong into a tariffs strategy that has cast a cloud of uncertainty over the global economy. Over the past two weeks, Trump has announced new agreements with a host of other countries designed to clarify trade terms with the U.S., but which critics say are beset by vague details and unworkable promises.",
      "Major stock indexes have nevertheless continued to churn higher, in part because some companies are noting that the hit to their bottom lines from the tariffs won\u2019t be as bad as initially feared when Trump first rolled out his country-by-country tariffs in April.",
      "Still, the bilateral trade deals Trump has recently been announcing come with duty levels far higher than the ones that have prevailed for decades. They also include 19% tariffs on goods from Indonesia and the Philippines and 15% tariffs on ones from Japan and the European Union.",
      "A deal announced this month with Vietnam puts 20% duties on its products, rising to 40% for any goods rerouted from China."

      "The magnitude-8.8 earthquake off Russia\u2019s Kamchatka peninsula sent a wave of water racing at the speed of a jetliner toward Hawaii, California and Washington state, spurring warnings and alarm overnight Wednesday.",
      "But when the tsunami waves arrived, they didn\u2019t cause devastation or deaths in the United States, and the inundation might not have appeared threatening in some locations where warnings were issued.",
      "That doesn\u2019t mean the tsunami was a \"bust,\" that it was poorly forecast or that it didn\u2019t pose a risk, earthquake and tsunami researchers said.",
      "\u201cYou start to hear \u2018tsunami warning,\u2019 and everyone immediately thinks of the last Hollywood movie they saw, and then it comes in at 3 feet and people are like, 'What\u2019s that?\u2019\u201d said Harold Tobin, the director of the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network and a professor at the University of Washington. \u201cWe should count it as a win that a tsunami occurred, we got a warning and it wasn\u2019t the worst-case scenario.\u201d",
      "Here\u2019s what to know.",
      "How strong was the Kamchatka earthquake? And why did it change so much?",
      "Initial reports from the U.S. Geological Survey pegged the Kamchatka earthquake at magnitude 8.0. Later, it was upgraded to 8.8.",
      "\u201cThat is not uncommon for very, very large earthquakes in those initial minutes,\u201d Tobin said. \u201cOur standard algorithms for determining the size of an earthquake quickly saturate. It\u2019s like turning up an amp and getting a lot of distortion.\"",
      "One of the first signs the earthquake was stronger than the initial seismic reports said was an initial measurement from a buoy about 275 miles southeast of the Kamchatka peninsula.",
      "The buoy, which is part of the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s DART (Deep-ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis) system, is connected to a seafloor pressure sensor about 4 miles below the surface.",
      "The sensor registered a 90-centimeter wave \u2014 more than 35 inches \u2014 which is eye-popping to tsunami researchers.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the second-largest recording we ever saw in the tsunami world,\u201d said Vasily Titov, a senior tsunami modeler at NOAA's Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory, adding that it indicated there was \u201ca catastrophic tsunami propagating in the ocean.\u201d",
      "Titov said the only higher reading was from the 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami, which killed nearly 16,000 people in Japan.",
      "Seismic models later confirmed that Wednesday's earthquake was magnitude 8.8, which means it released nearly 16 times as much energy as a magnitude-8.0 earthquake, according to a USGS calculation tool.",
      "T\u014dhoku was much bigger.",
      "Tobin estimated that earthquake released two to three times as much energy as was observed in Kamchatka. Titov said the tsunami in Japan was also about three times larger.",
      "In addition, he said the T\u014dhoku earthquake \u201cproduced an anomalously large seafloor displacement,\u201d lurching and moving more water than expected, even for an earthquake of its magnitude.",
      "At Kamchatka, \u201cit\u2019s likely that there was less seafloor displacement than could have happened in a worst-case or more dire scenario for a magnitude-8.8,\u201d Tobin said, though more research will be needed to confirm that theory.",
      "How did researchers make a forecast? How good was the forecast?",
      "In two hours, researchers produced a tsunami forecast for \u201cpretty much the whole Pacific and for warning points along the U.S. coastlines,\u201d Titov said, with predictions of water levels at coastal tide gauges and for flood inundation.",
      "The tsunami took about eight hours to reach Hawaii and 12 hours to reach the California coast.",
      "Titov, who helped build the models used by forecasters who issue warnings from the National Tsunami Warning Centers in Hawaii and Alaska, said the models rely on seismic data and the network of more than 70 DART buoys along the Pacific Rim, which sense pressure changes. The United States owns and operates more than half of the DART buoys.",
      "Titov said the models indicated that north shore areas of Hawaii would get tsunami waves of about 2 meters or less.",
      "\u201cHilo was predicted at about 2 meters [6.5 feet], and it materialized at about 150 centimeters,\u201d or 1.5 meters (5 feet), Titov said. \u201cIt\u2019s exactly how we want it \u2014 a little bit on the conservative side.\u201d",
      "The same trend played out in parts of California, Titov said.",
      "It will take some time to assess how well the models predicted inundation because reports about the extent of flooding are still coming in.",
      "\u201cWe know that the flooding occurred at Hawaii. We don\u2019t know exactly the extent, but from the reports that I saw on TV, it looks like exactly what we predicted,\u201d Titov said.",
      "Why were people in Hawaii evacuated for a 5-foot wave?",
      "Yong Wei, a tsunami modeler and senior research scientist at the University of Washington and the NOAA Center for Tsunami Research, said a 1.5-meter (5-foot) tsunami wave can be very dangerous, particularly in shallow waters off Hawaii.",
      "Tsunami waves contain far more energy than wind waves, which are far shorter in wavelength and period (time between waves) and slower in speed.",
      "Wei said tsunami waves of the size that struck Hawaii can surge inland \u201ctens of meters,\u201d produce dangerous currents and damage boats and other moveable objects.",
      "\u201cPeople die. If they stay there and they don\u2019t get any warning, 2 meters can definitely kill people,\u201d Wei said. \u201cIf you\u2019re on the beach, strong currents can definitely pull you out into the ocean and people will get drowned.\u201d",
      "Tobin said the initial warnings were conservative but appropriate, in his view.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want people to think, oh, we had a warning and nothing much happened and pooh-pooh it \u2014 'I can ignore it,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cWarnings by nature have to err a bit on the side of caution.\u201d",
      "Was this a historic event?",
      "No. The Kamchatka peninsula has a long history of earthquakes.",
      "\u201cThis was an area that was ready for another earthquake, and there had been a lot of earthquakes in that region over the last few weeks,\u201d which indicates increased risk, said Breanyn MacInnes, a professor in the geological sciences department at Central Washington University.",
      "In 1952, before scientists had a strong understanding of plate tectonics, a 9.0-magnitude earthquake struck off the Kamchatka peninsula in much the same region, sending a tsunami into the town of Severo-Kurilsk.",
      "\u201cPeople in Russia were not really prepared for it. It was very big earthquake, a big tsunami, and they were caught off guard,\u201d MacInnes said.",
      "MacInnes said the tsunami was 30 to 60 feet in height in southern parts of the peninsula.",
      "\u201cThousands of people were killed, and basically the town was destroyed,\u201d said Joanne Bourgeois, an emeritus professor of sedimentology at the University of Washington, who has been studying the region\u2019s earthquake history for about three decades.",
      "How would the tsunami warning system perform if the earthquake struck closer to home?",
      "The Kamchatka tsunami is a megathrust earthquake produced along a large subduction zone fault, when one tectonic plate is forced beneath another. The U.S. West Coast features a similar fault, called the Cascadia subduction zone, which runs offshore from Northern California to northern Vancouver Island.",
      "\u201cThis is kind of a mirror image across the Pacific,\u201d Tobin said. \u201cAn 8.8 at a relatively shallow depth in Cascadia is definitely in the realm of scenarios. We could have a similar event here.\u201d",
      "In fact, Cascadia has the potential to produce much larger quakes, Tobin said. Modeling suggests Cascadia could produce tsunami waves as tall as 100 feet.",
      "Subduction zone earthquakes typically produce tsunamis that reach shore in about 30 minutes to an hour, Titov said, which would strain forecasters\u2019 capabilities to predict tsunami effects precisely along the U.S. West Coast before inundation happened.",
      "Titov said more seafloor sensors, more computer processing and innovation with artificial intelligence algorithms are needed to speed forecasting.",
      "Tobin said the successful tsunami warning Tuesday should spur investment in seafloor sensors and seismic monitoring stations offshore along the subduction zone.",
      "\u201cThis shows the value and importance of NOAA and the USGS in these times where some of these government agencies have come into question,\u201d he said. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t have had a tsunami warning if it weren\u2019t for NOAA, and the next one could be a closer event. They showed their value.\u201d"

      "LOS ANGELES \u2014 Natural disaster survivors would be eligible for six months of mortgage relief under a bill introduced Thursday by two senators whose states have been ravaged by wildfires and floods.",
      "The Mortgage Relief for Disaster Survivors Act would apply to homeowners with federally backed loans in areas declared disasters since Jan. 1 without accumulating interest or penalties during the six-month period. Borrowers could apply for additional six-month extensions.",
      "\u201cEarlier this year, we watched as families in Los Angeles were devastated by wildfires, and to date, many homeowners are still struggling to rebuild from this disaster,\u201d said Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who is co-sponsoring the bill.",
      "\u201cAs natural disasters become more frequent due to climate change, it is critical that we pave a path to stability for homeowners in times of crisis,\u201d he added.",
      "Parts of Schiff\u2019s former congressional district in Southern California were devoured in January when the Eaton Fire tore through Altadena, destroying nearly 6,000 homes and killing at least 19 people.",
      "His co-sponsor is Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., whose state was ravaged by the 2021 Marshall Fire, which damaged or destroyed some 1,200 homes in Boulder County.",
      "\u201cColoradans know all too well how difficult it is to pick up the pieces and move forward after catastrophic wildfires,\u201d Bennet said. \u201cWhen mounting financial and emotional costs of recovery weigh on families, they should be able to take time to put their lives back together and rebuild their homes.\u201d",
      "House members who represent Altadena, Pacific Palisades and Malibu in California introduced a companion bill this year that would provide 180 days of mortgage relief without penalties or late fees. The pause would apply only to federally backed loans.",
      "Nonfederal lenders are not required to offer payment reprieves to homeowners in disaster zones. But after the Palisades and Eaton fires, more than 400 lenders agreed to a 90-day pause without reporting the missed payments to credit agencies.",
      "Eaton Fire survivor Freddy Sayegh said he took advantage of the program after heavy smoke damage prevented him from returning to his Altadena home. He has since moved his family seven times and incurred thousands of dollars of unforeseen costs for food, clothing and other immediate needs.",
      "Some of the costs were covered by insurance, but much of the money came out of his pocket while he awaits compensation.",
      "He dipped into his savings when the 90 days were over and paid his delinquent mortgage in a lump sum, fearing he would incur fees or be forced to refinance.",
      "\u201cIt actually placed a lot of pressure to come up with three months all at once,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people who don\u2019t have three months of savings.\u201d",
      "In Texas, where cataclysmic flooding that began July 2 caused an estimated $240 million in damage, officials announced a 90-day foreclosure moratorium that prohibits mortgage companies from initiating or completing foreclosures in Kerr County, the area hardest hit by the disaster.",
      "According to the Mortgage Bankers Association, delinquencies nearly doubled nationally in March compared with the same time last year, up 21% from 12%.",
      "In California, wildfire-related delinquencies peaked in March at 4,100 and fell to 2,240 in June, according to the data tracking company ICE Mortgage Technology.",
      "The trend follows a pattern seen after other natural disasters, in which delinquencies spike in the months immediately following catastrophes and gradually level out over the next 18 to 24 months, said Andy Walden, head of mortgage and housing market research at Intercontinental Exchange, the parent company of ICE Mortgage Technology.",
      "\u201cIt takes time for many homeowners to untangle finances while dealing with the emotional and logistical aftermath of losing their homes,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom navigating insurance claims to working with FEMA, borrowers often need time to stabilize. Foreclosure moratoriums introduced after major disasters often give families the breathing room they need to recover.\u201d",
      "Former Altadena resident Keni \u201cArts\u201d Davis stared down at a 10-year mortgage when his home of nearly four decades was destroyed. He has moved six times since then, finally landing close to the neighborhood he loved so much.",
      "Much of his recovery journey included negotiating with his insurance company to pay off his mortgage, rather than borrowing or seeking an extension.",
      "\u201cIt might have meant financial ruin,\u201d he said.",
      "He intends to rebuild by cobbling together the money through savings and microloans that are sometimes just $500. He said that the mortgage relief bills sound good on paper but that their timing leaves something to be desired.",
      "\u201cMy grandmother would have said it\u2019s a day late and a dollar short,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re all just depending on any help we can get to make it one day to the next.\u201d"

      "\u201cI hope they will go to someone who really values them,\u201d Pepp\u00e9 wrote in a February piece for Sotheby\u2019s accompanying the auction catalogue.",
      "They were put on public exhibition in Hong Kong in the days leading up to the auction in three glass cases, containing shimmering penny-sized silver and gold-leaf stars embossed with symbols. They also include pearls, beads and flowers cut from precious stones, including amethyst, topaz, garnet, coral and crystal.",

      "There were no details immediately available regarding the person who died as a result of the illness.",
      "Legionnaire\u2019s, a type of pneumonia, is caused by the bacteria Legionella, which grows in warm water. The cases from the cluster have been found in five Harlem ZIP codes: 10027, 10030, 10035, 10037 and 10039, along with the bordering communities, according to health officials.",
      "All cooling towers that are operating in the impacted area have been sampled, and the Health Department has told owners of buildings where positive results were found to initiate remediation within a day.",
      "Those who have been in the impacted area since late July and have been experiencing flu-like symptoms, fever, cough or difficulty breathing should seek medial attention immediately, according to the Health Department.",
      "Legionnaires\u2019 disease is not transmitted from person to person, and is treatable with antibiotics. It spread by breathing in water vapor containing the Legionella bacteria.

      "An investigation is ongoing.",
      "Individuals at higher risk include those 50 years old and older, cigarette smokers, and people with chronic lung disease or compromised immune systems. People living or working in the area who are experiencing these symptoms should seek medical attention with a primary care provider or seek urgent care, officials say.",
      "In 2022, at least five people died of Legionnaires\u2019 disease over the summer at a Manhattan nursing home in the city\u2019s worst outbreak, in terms of total cases, since a cooling tower in the Bronx was blamed for an infection that caused 16 deaths. Usually, about 200 to 700 people are diagnosed each year, official health data show.",
      "What is Legionnaires\u2019 disease?",
      "Legionnaires is a type of pneumonia, or a lung infection, the state DOH said.",
      "The legionella bacteria can also lead to a milder illness called Pontiac fever, which resembles flu-like symptoms.",
      "How does it spread?",
      "Legionella bacteria spread when someone inhales tiny droplets of contaminated water, commonly found in hot tubs, industrial air conditioning systems, decorative fountains, plumbing systems and even drinking water.",
      "Outbreaks often occur in large and complex water systems found in places like hotels, hospitals, and cruise ships.",
      "The bacteria can also survive and spread in soil, occasionally causing infections when people garden using contaminated soil.",
      "However, in most cases, people do not transmit Legionnaires\u2019 disease or Pontiac fever to others.",
      "What are the symptoms?",
      "Symptoms of Legionnaires disease typically appear between two to 10 days after exposure to the bacteria and can include:",

      "The New Jersey Department of Health noted that the symptoms can be similar to those of COVID-19 and other respiratory illnesses like the flu. Only tests ordered by a doctor can confirm a diagnosis.",
      "Who is at higher risk?",
      "Those most susceptible to Legionnaires\u2019 disease include adults over 50, individuals with weakened immune systems or chronic conditions, and smokers.",
      "It is rarer for healthy people who are exposed to the legionella bacteria to develop Legionnaires\u2019 disease.",
      "Can it be treated?",
      "Antibiotics are used to treat Legionnaires\u2019 disease, though it often requires hospitalization.",

      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Wednesday night that Trump was referring to Giuffre in response to a question from a reporter about her.",
      "\u201cHe did not bring her up. The fact remains that President Trump kicked Jeffrey Epstein out of his club for being a creep to his female employees,\u201d she said in a statement.",
      "In the statement, the family also said it was \u201cconvicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell who targeted and preyed upon our then 16-year-old sister, Virginia, from Mar-a-Lago, where she was working in 2000, several years before Epstein and President Trump had their falling out.\u201d",
      "The Justice Department declined to comment when it was asked about the statement.",
      "Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for her role recruiting and trafficking minors for sex, met with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche last week as the Trump administration seeks additional information pertaining to Epstein's case. While her attorney, David Oscar Markus, said Friday there have been \"no asks and no promises\" about clemency, he told reporters Maxwell \"would welcome any relief.\"",
      "Asked last week about pardoning Maxwell, Trump said he hadn't thought about it but noted that he's \"allowed to do it.\" The family of Giuffre, one of the earliest and most prominent voices to call for charges against Epstein and Maxwell, said any leniency extended toward Maxwell would \"go down in history as being one of the highest travesties of justice.\"",
      "\"The government and the President should never consider giving Ghislaine Maxwell any leniency,\" the family said.",
      "\u201cGhislaine Maxwell is a monster who deserves to rot in prison for the rest of her life for the extraordinary violence and abuse she put not just our sister Virginia through, but many other survivors, who may number in the thousands.\"",
      "Maxwell's attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment regarding the Giuffre family statement.",
      "A senior administration official told NBC News after the statement was issued that \"no leniency is being given or discussed.\"",
      "\"The president himself has said that clemency for Maxwell is not something he is even thinking about at this time,\" the official said.",
      "The Republican-led House Oversight Committee recently subpoenaed Maxwell for a deposition because of the \u201cimmense public interest and scrutiny\u201d surrounding her case and Epstein's. Maxwell\u2019s lawyers said she\u2019d consider testifying if she were granted immunity to ensure she doesn\u2019t \u201crisk further criminal exposure.\u201d Rep. James Comer, R-Ky, the chair of the committee, denied the request, according to his spokesperson.",
      "The Justice Department roiled Trump's base this month in a memo that dismissed Epstein conspiracy theories, some of which Trump and his allies have promoted over the years. Among other things, the memo said that an internal review found no evidence of a \u201cclient list\u201d and that Epstein died by suicide in jail in 2019. It also concluded there was no evidence to suggest Epstein had participated in blackmail.",
      "Despite Trump's efforts to tamp down the backlash from his supporters, at times calling the Epstein issue a \"hoax,\" many in his base have pointed to past promises him and Attorney General Pam Bondi to release all files related to the Epstein investigation.",
      "Trump directed Bondi this month to seek the release of \"pertinent\" grand jury testimony. Bondi subsequently filed requests in federal courts in New York and Florida. A federal judge in Florida denied the Justice Department's request last week, while court proceedings in New York continue.",
      "The directive to seek grand jury testimony came the same day The Wall Street Journal reported that Trump wrote a letter to Epstein in 2003 with a drawing of a naked woman. Trump denied having written the letter and later sued for defamation."

    "story": [
      "The magnitude-8.8 earthquake off Russia\u2019s Kamchatka peninsula sent a wave of water racing at the speed of a jetliner toward Hawaii, California and Washington state, spurring warnings and alarm overnight Wednesday.",
      "But when the tsunami waves arrived, they didn\u2019t cause devastation or deaths in the United States, and the inundation might not have appeared threatening in some locations where warnings were issued.",
      "That doesn\u2019t mean the tsunami was a \"bust,\" that it was poorly forecast or that it didn\u2019t pose a risk, earthquake and tsunami researchers said.",
      "\u201cYou start to hear \u2018tsunami warning,\u2019 and everyone immediately thinks of the last Hollywood movie they saw, and then it comes in at 3 feet and people are like, 'What\u2019s that?\u2019\u201d said Harold Tobin, the director of the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network and a professor at the University of Washington. \u201cWe should count it as a win that a tsunami occurred, we got a warning and it wasn\u2019t the worst-case scenario.\u201d",
      "Here\u2019s what to know.",
      "How strong was the Kamchatka earthquake? And why did it change so much?",
      "Initial reports from the U.S. Geological Survey pegged the Kamchatka earthquake at magnitude 8.0. Later, it was upgraded to 8.8.",
      "\u201cThat is not uncommon for very, very large earthquakes in those initial minutes,\u201d Tobin said. \u201cOur standard algorithms for determining the size of an earthquake quickly saturate. It\u2019s like turning up an amp and getting a lot of distortion.\"",
      "One of the first signs the earthquake was stronger than the initial seismic reports said was an initial measurement from a buoy about 275 miles southeast of the Kamchatka peninsula.",
      "The buoy, which is part of the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s DART (Deep-ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis) system, is connected to a seafloor pressure sensor about 4 miles below the surface.",
      "The sensor registered a 90-centimeter wave \u2014 more than 35 inches \u2014 which is eye-popping to tsunami researchers.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the second-largest recording we ever saw in the tsunami world,\u201d said Vasily Titov, a senior tsunami modeler at NOAA's Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory, adding that it indicated there was \u201ca catastrophic tsunami propagating in the ocean.\u201d",
      "Titov said the only higher reading was from the 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami, which killed nearly 16,000 people in Japan.",
      "Seismic models later confirmed that Wednesday's earthquake was magnitude 8.8, which means it released nearly 16 times as much energy as a magnitude-8.0 earthquake, according to a USGS calculation tool.",
      "T\u014dhoku was much bigger.",
      "Tobin estimated that earthquake released two to three times as much energy as was observed in Kamchatka. Titov said the tsunami in Japan was also about three times larger.",
      "In addition, he said the T\u014dhoku earthquake \u201cproduced an anomalously large seafloor displacement,\u201d lurching and moving more water than expected, even for an earthquake of its magnitude.",
      "At Kamchatka, \u201cit\u2019s likely that there was less seafloor displacement than could have happened in a worst-case or more dire scenario for a magnitude-8.8,\u201d Tobin said, though more research will be needed to confirm that theory.",
      "How did researchers make a forecast? How good was the forecast?",
      "In two hours, researchers produced a tsunami forecast for \u201cpretty much the whole Pacific and for warning points along the U.S. coastlines,\u201d Titov said, with predictions of water levels at coastal tide gauges and for flood inundation.",
      "The tsunami took about eight hours to reach Hawaii and 12 hours to reach the California coast.",
      "Titov, who helped build the models used by forecasters who issue warnings from the National Tsunami Warning Centers in Hawaii and Alaska, said the models rely on seismic data and the network of more than 70 DART buoys along the Pacific Rim, which sense pressure changes. The United States owns and operates more than half of the DART buoys.",
      "Titov said the models indicated that north shore areas of Hawaii would get tsunami waves of about 2 meters or less.",
      "\u201cHilo was predicted at about 2 meters [6.5 feet], and it materialized at about 150 centimeters,\u201d or 1.5 meters (5 feet), Titov said. \u201cIt\u2019s exactly how we want it \u2014 a little bit on the conservative side.\u201d",
      "The same trend played out in parts of California, Titov said.",
      "It will take some time to assess how well the models predicted inundation because reports about the extent of flooding are still coming in.",
      "\u201cWe know that the flooding occurred at Hawaii. We don\u2019t know exactly the extent, but from the reports that I saw on TV, it looks like exactly what we predicted,\u201d Titov said.",
      "Why were people in Hawaii evacuated for a 5-foot wave?",
      "Yong Wei, a tsunami modeler and senior research scientist at the University of Washington and the NOAA Center for Tsunami Research, said a 1.5-meter (5-foot) tsunami wave can be very dangerous, particularly in shallow waters off Hawaii.",
      "Tsunami waves contain far more energy than wind waves, which are far shorter in wavelength and period (time between waves) and slower in speed.",
      "Wei said tsunami waves of the size that struck Hawaii can surge inland \u201ctens of meters,\u201d produce dangerous currents and damage boats and other moveable objects.",
      "\u201cPeople die. If they stay there and they don\u2019t get any warning, 2 meters can definitely kill people,\u201d Wei said. \u201cIf you\u2019re on the beach, strong currents can definitely pull you out into the ocean and people will get drowned.\u201d",
      "Tobin said the initial warnings were conservative but appropriate, in his view.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want people to think, oh, we had a warning and nothing much happened and pooh-pooh it \u2014 'I can ignore it,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cWarnings by nature have to err a bit on the side of caution.\u201d",
      "Was this a historic event?",
      "No. The Kamchatka peninsula has a long history of earthquakes.",
      "\u201cThis was an area that was ready for another earthquake, and there had been a lot of earthquakes in that region over the last few weeks,\u201d which indicates increased risk, said Breanyn MacInnes, a professor in the geological sciences department at Central Washington University.",
      "In 1952, before scientists had a strong understanding of plate tectonics, a 9.0-magnitude earthquake struck off the Kamchatka peninsula in much the same region, sending a tsunami into the town of Severo-Kurilsk.",
      "\u201cPeople in Russia were not really prepared for it. It was very big earthquake, a big tsunami, and they were caught off guard,\u201d MacInnes said.",
      "MacInnes said the tsunami was 30 to 60 feet in height in southern parts of the peninsula.",
      "\u201cThousands of people were killed, and basically the town was destroyed,\u201d said Joanne Bourgeois, an emeritus professor of sedimentology at the University of Washington, who has been studying the region\u2019s earthquake history for about three decades.",
      "How would the tsunami warning system perform if the earthquake struck closer to home?",
      "The Kamchatka tsunami is a megathrust earthquake produced along a large subduction zone fault, when one tectonic plate is forced beneath another. The U.S. West Coast features a similar fault, called the Cascadia subduction zone, which runs offshore from Northern California to northern Vancouver Island.",
      "\u201cThis is kind of a mirror image across the Pacific,\u201d Tobin said. \u201cAn 8.8 at a relatively shallow depth in Cascadia is definitely in the realm of scenarios. We could have a similar event here.\u201d",
      "In fact, Cascadia has the potential to produce much larger quakes, Tobin said. Modeling suggests Cascadia could produce tsunami waves as tall as 100 feet.",
      "Subduction zone earthquakes typically produce tsunamis that reach shore in about 30 minutes to an hour, Titov said, which would strain forecasters\u2019 capabilities to predict tsunami effects precisely along the U.S. West Coast before inundation happened.",
      "Titov said more seafloor sensors, more computer processing and innovation with artificial intelligence algorithms are needed to speed forecasting.",
      "Tobin said the successful tsunami warning Tuesday should spur investment in seafloor sensors and seismic monitoring stations offshore along the subduction zone.",
      "\u201cThis shows the value and importance of NOAA and the USGS in these times where some of these government agencies have come into question,\u201d he said. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t have had a tsunami warning if it weren\u2019t for NOAA, and the next one could be a closer event. They showed their value.\u201d"

      "The proposal, which follows President Donald Trump\u2019s public pressing for a new map in the state, would shift district lines in ways that target current Democratic members of Congress in districts in and around Austin, Dallas and Houston, as well as two already endangered Democrats representing South Texas districts that Trump carried last year.",
      "If it were enacted, the proposal could have a major effect on the battle for control of the House in 2026. Republicans hold a slim, three-seat advantage right now, but this map could add extra padding as they seek to keep the House for the final two years of Trump\u2019s presidency. They already control 25 of the 38 congressional districts in Texas.",

    "summary": "Latino Victory Fund, which focuses on increasing Latino political representation, is supporting the women ahead of midterm races in Arizona, Nebraska and Pennsylvania.",
    "story": [
      "With the midterm elections over a year away, a progressive Latino group is announcing its support for four Democratic candidates who could be the first Latinas to represent their congressional districts.",
      "Latino Victory Fund, an organization focused on increasing Latino political representation, is endorsing Marlene Gal\u00e1n-Woods and JoAnna Mendoza in Arizona\u2019s 1st and 6th districts, respectively; Denise Powell in Nebraska\u2019s 2nd District; and Carol Obando-Derstine in Pennsylvania\u2019s 7th District. They will face Democratic primary challengers in districts many expect to be among the most competitive on the midterm map next year.",
      "The early endorsements unlock a number of benefits for the candidates, including social media rollouts, direct contributions to their campaigns from the group\u2019s political action committee and access to a national network of funders, CEO and President Katharine Pichardo told NBC News before the endorsements were announced.",
      "\u201cThese are all outstanding candidates,\u201d Pichardo said. \u201cThey are top-notch advocates and professionals who have their fingers on the pulse of their communities.\u201d",
      "While Latinos have traditionally leaned Democratic, recent elections have shown a shift toward the Republican Party. In 2024, Donald Trump captured an ethnically and racially diverse coalition of voters and made substantial gains among Latino voters, winning 48% of the Hispanic vote, while Democrat Kamala Harris won 51%, according to an analysis by the Pew Research Center. By contrast, Joe Biden won 61% of the Hispanic vote in 2020, compared with 36% for Trump.",
      "Latinos make up almost 20% of the U.S. population but only 2% of the country\u2019s elected officials. Pichardo argued that supporting Latino candidates is necessary \u201cbecause representation matters \u2014 you need people in office who are going to be consistent with our values as a community and that have the lived experiences that allow them to be good representatives for our community.\u201d",
      "The Latina candidates come from diverse backgrounds. Gala\u0301n-Woods, a Republican-turned-Democrat, is making a second run for Congress in an Arizona district that includes parts of north Phoenix, Scottsdale and Paradise Valley. The seat is held by Republican David Schweikert, who won his 2024 race by 2 percentage points. Gala\u0301n-Woods, a Cuban American, will face Amish Shah in the Democratic primary; Shah defeated her last year and became the Democratic candidate.",
      "Mendoza, a Mexican American veteran and the daughter of farmworkers, is seeking to unseat Mexican-born Rep. Juan Ciscomani, a Republican, in Arizona\u2019s 6th District. The district stretches throughout parts of Pima County and much of Tucson and Cochise counties. Ciscomani won a second term last year by a comfortable margin. Other potential Democratic candidates have filed paperwork indicating their interest in the race.",
      "Powell, of Cuban and Chilean descent, co-founded Women Who Run Nebraska, an organization that motivates women to run for office, and she is running in Nebraska\u2019s 2nd District. Republican Rep. Don Bacon, who has a reputation as a centrist, recently announced he would not seek a sixth term. Previous election cycles have featured tight races between Bacon and his Democratic opponents. Several other Democrats have announced their candidacies, including John Cavanaugh, a state senator whose father, John J. Cavanaugh III, represented the district, which includes Omaha, from 1977 to 1981.",
      "Obando-Derstine would be running to represent Pennsylvania\u2019s 7th District, a seat held by Republican Ryan Mackenzie. Obando-Derstine, born in Colombia, previously served on Gov. Tom Wolf\u2019s Advisory Commission on Latino Affairs and worked for Sen. Bob Casey.",
      "The district is considered one of the most competitive in the country and one of the most expensive. Two other Democrats are running, including Northampton County Executive Lamont McClure, who has been in Democratic politics for 15 years.",
      "The GOP holds a narrow majority in the House, with 219 Republicans and 212 Democrats. Historically, the president\u2019s party tends to lose ground in midterm elections as voters punish the party in office. Trump\u2019s approval numbers are around 43%, a historically low number compared with other presidents, though it is slightly higher than in his first term, according to an NBC News analysis. But the Democratic Party\u2019s image is at its lowest point in three decades, according to a recent Wall Street Journal poll.",
      "In the past, Latino Victory Fund has made high-six-figure investments in support of Latina candidates, Pichardo said.",
      "\u201cThese are trailblazing Latinas that will be making history \u2014 but at the end of the day, how we bring back Latinos is really through a plan,\u201d she said, \u201cincluding a focus on building a new coalition that speaks to voters on the issues that matter most to them.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "When people think of wearables, a few names usually come up: Apple Watch, Oura Ring, Fitbit, Garmin. Whoop is usually not on that list: it\u2019s a smaller brand that appeals to a specific crowd as opposed to the Apple Watch and Fitbit users of the world.",
      "And yet, most people, myself included, will inevitably compare it to an Apple Watch. After all, most people will wear one, not both. That\u2019s why I wore the latest Whoop MG and the Apple Watch Series 10 at the same time for over a month: to see how they compare, and which one is right for you.",

      "Whoop offers three products: Whoop One ($199 a year), Whoop Peak ($239 a year) and Whoop Life ($359 a year), each with their own distinct differences in software and hardware.",
      "Whoop One and Whoop Peak use the same physical Whoop band, but Whoop Peak users have more software features in the app. Whoop Life uses the Whoop MG (Medical Grade) band, which has a more advanced sensor with ECG and AFib detection.",
      "Apple sells the Apple Watch SE ($249), Apple Watch Series 10 ($399) and Apple Watch Ultra 2 ($799). I wore the Apple Watch Series 10 for this comparison, as it is the closest direct competitor to the Whoop, in my view.",
      "Want more from NBC Select? Sign up for our newsletter, The Selection, and shop smarter.",
      "My experience using Whoop and Apple Watch",
      "Whoop and Apple Watch are very different devices for very different people. Both are comfortable to wear and give interesting and mostly accurate health, sleep and fitness insights. But the experience of using them is wildly different, and highlights how they are meant for different kinds of people. Below are some of the key differences between the two.",
      "Whoop is essentially a screenless watch band. The included band is made of a flexible, comfortable yarn, and the sensor itself attaches to the band with a titanium clasp. It\u2019s comfortable, subtle and easy to forget when you are wearing it, plus it looks relatively normal in more formal settings (unlike some smartwatches). The clasp can be a little finicky when taking the Whoop on and off your wrist. Unlike most other wearables, you can wear the Whoop MG (or 5.0) on your bicep using the Whoop Bicep Band, but it hasn\u2019t been released at the time of writing this comparison.",
      "The Whoop MG gets up to 14 days of battery life, which is excellent. This made it easy to forget I was wearing it most of the time.",
      "You charge the Whoop MG using the wireless charging puck, which slides and clicks into place on top of the clasp. It takes about two hours to fully charge, which is pretty slow. You can, however, keep wearing the Whoop MG while it\u2019s charging, though this makes it much heavier and bulkier. I think you\u2019ll either love the wireless charging puck or hate it. One the one hand: it means you never have to take off your Whoop, even to charge. On the other hand, it\u2019s slow, feels  bulky on your wrist and is easier to lose compared to a more standard wireless charging station.",
      "You\u2019re probably familiar with the Apple Watch, and the Series 10 is similar to models before it. It\u2019s thinner and lighter than the Apple Watch Series 9, but ekes out more screen space by reaching further into the edges of the case. It\u2019s very comfortable to wear daily, and you can choose from dozens of bands to maximize comfort or better fit the occasion.",
      "Improvements over the Series 9 include a brighter screen that is easier to see at off-angles and faster charging \u2014 up to 80% charge in 30 minutes (or 100% in an hour). Total battery life is still about 18 hours, though.",
      "My take: This is mostly about battery life and whether you want a screen or not. I barely need to think about battery life with the Whoop MG, and charging is relatively flexible. The Apple Watch needs to be charged almost daily, but it\u2019s a fully-featured smartwatch, with all the features that entails.",
      "Day-to-day",
      "Whoop",
      "Using the Whoop MG feels like a middle ground between the mostly passive Oura Ring ($349) and the arguably over-active Ultrahuman Ring ($349). It offers some notifications, like reminders about tonight\u2019s optimal bedtime for ideal recovery, but it leaves most control in your hands to open the app and explore your data when you want to, not when the app tells you to. Like the Oura Ring, the Whoop MG has automatic workout detection, though you can also open up the app to manually start and stop workouts as they happen.",
      "Apple",
      "An Apple Watch can be as active or as passive as you want it to be. You can have all your smartphone notifications synced, and get pings every time you get a text, emails or app notification. You can also turn everything off, and treat it as a watch that\u2019s also a fitness and sleep tracker \u2014 it\u2019s up to you.",
      "It\u2019s easy to start and stop workouts on the Apple Watch because it has a screen \u2014 you don\u2019t need to pull out your phone. It also automatically detects some workouts, but will prompt you on screen when it does, which makes it easier to know when to start a workout yourself.",
      "My take: I think the Apple Watch is more flexible here. With a couple of minutes in its setting menu, you can make it as hands on or as hands off as you want. Whoop is a more focused product than the Apple Watch, so its day-to-day experience is more one-size-fits-all.",
      "Whoop",
      "My Whoop MG tracked health, sleep and fitness data relatively accurately, and provided a lot more information to dig into than the Apple Watch in most cases, for better or worse.",
      "Sleep data between the Whoop MG and the Apple Watch Series 10 was similar, but the Whoop showed my sleep on a more granular level than the Apple Watch, with exact timings on wake windows and sleep stages.",
      "The Whoop MG does have automatic workout detection, but like the Oura Ring, I found myself starting and stopping workouts manually through the app. After my month of testing, I realized that while the automatic tracking is okay, I didn\u2019t trust it enough to risk not logging a workout or having inaccurate data about my runs or gym time.",
      "Apple",
      "The Apple Watch similarly tracks sleep, health and fitness data, but has more convenient exercise tracking than Whoop, especially outdoors. It has its own GPS built-in, so its outdoor walk, run and cycling workouts tend to be slightly (or significantly) more accurate than the Whoop, depending on the environment. It also has more detailed stats for runners like cadence, stride length and more.",
      "Again, because it has a screen, it\u2019s easier to start and stop workouts on the Apple Watch. That screen is also useful for confirming or denying its automatic workout detection.",
      "My take: Both wearables track similar things. Whoop has the edge when it comes to sleep and health tracking, while Apple is easier and more accurate for exercise tracking.",
      "Metrics and analysis",
      "This is where things get interesting, and where the big differences between the Apple Watch and the Whoop MG reveal themselves.",
      "Whoop",
      "Whoop has three key metrics placed front and center on the Home tab: sleep, recovery and strain. Sleep is pretty self-explanatory, but recovery and strain are impressive but can be a bit confusing. Whoop assigns a strain score to all of your activities, and charts your strain across days, weeks and months. Strain is scored between zero and 21, which is very specific but can take some mental gymnastics when every other brand is using scales of zero to 10 or zero to 100. The specificity around strain and recovery was interesting to look at, but didn\u2019t feel too different from easy to understand features like Training Readiness and Training Status on some Garmin watches.",
      "The Health tab is where you will find most of the new features compared to the previous Whoop 4.0, and this is where I have the most mixed feelings.",
      "Clicking on the Health tab pulls up a slew of other metrics. You can track your respiratory rate, blood oxygen, resting heart rate, heart rate variability and skin temperature. You can see trends in each overtime, from weeks to months, similar to my experience using the Oura Ring 4.",
      "But the biggest new feature is Healthspan. In the essay-length description of the feature on the Whoop app, Whoop calls Healthspan \u201cthe number of years you live in good health.\u201d It gives two measurements: your Whoop Age and your Pace of Aging. Both, but mostly Pace of Aging, fills me with dread and anxiety in a way no other wearable I\u2019ve tested has. I could argue this says more about my relationship with mortality than Whoop, but hear me out.",
      "Pace of Aging \u201creflects how quickly your Whoop Age is changing,\u201d says Whoop in its app. It charts it on a scale from -1.0x to 3.0x, \u201clike a speedometer.\u201d Over 1.0x? Your Whoop Age is increasing faster than your chronological age.",
      "Your Pace of Aging changes weekly, and Whoop would notify me every week that it changed. During my entire test period, my Whoop Age was younger than my actual age (likely a reflection of my fitness activity), but my Pace of Aging was consistently fast, usually at 1.4x. Whoop eventually explained that my Whoop Age and Pace of Aging are increasing because of my sleep consistency, and to \u201ckeep an eye on this trend to stay on track\u201d or else my Whoop Age may increase if \u201cyou keep up with your current behaviors.\u201d",
      "Here\u2019s the thing: I know why I get between five and 6.5 hours of interrupted sleep every night: it\u2019s because I live in a one bedroom and have a wonderful one year old. I would love to sleep eight hours uninterrupted every night, but most new parents know that that is a pipe dream. So Whoop telling me that my interrupted sleep is speeding up my aging was just frustrating.",
      "It\u2019s important to remember that Whoop Age and Whoop Pace of Aging ultimately cannot truly tell you how fast you are aging. It\u2019s far too complex a topic for Whoop, or any wearable, to track. Aging is affected by a myriad of factors Whoop either isn\u2019t including or can\u2019t track, including diet, lifestyle, genetics, mental health and underlying medical conditions, to name a few.",
      "Healthspan is a buzzy feature that made me open the Whoop app more than usual. But I don\u2019t think a feature that fills me with dread and anxiety is a win, especially one that is more of a suggestion than objective truth.",
      "Apple",
      "By comparison, metrics and analysis on the Apple Watch are much more grounded and reserved \u2014 it doesn\u2019t go anywhere near fitness age or aging with its data. It\u2019s solely focused on giving you your sleep, health and fitness data, without much suggestion or analysis.",
      "Metrics are spread across two apps: Apple Health and Apple Fitness. Apple Fitness shows you all your workouts, and has features like Training Load and Trends that chart things like exercise frequency, move goals, steps, pace and cardio fitness over time. Apple Health has the Vitals feature, which tracks your overnight heart rate, respiratory rate, wrist temperature and sleep duration, and can tell you when your stats are out of normal range, indicating potential illness. Whoop does this too, but unfortunately for my testing (and fortunately for my health), I did not get sick during this comparison, so I couldn\u2019t test this feature.",
      "My take: Whoop MG gives you more metrics and analysis to look at than the Apple Watch. That\u2019s arguably the whole point of getting the Whoop: detailed strain, recovery and health data. My problem is that I either didn\u2019t find the analysis all that useful or it stressed me out (Healthspan). Apple Watch takes a \u201cjust the facts\u201d approach, with little to no analysis (outside of Vitals), just detailed metrics you can interpret on your own.",
      "Value",
      "My take: Normally I wouldn\u2019t harp on value too much: everyone has their own budget, and knows what they can and can\u2019t afford. But the Whoop subscription model is expensive, even compared to a premium product like the Apple Watch Series 10.",
      "A full-priced Series 10 is $399 (though it\u2019s often on sale for less). The lowest priced Whoop subscription is $199 a year. That means after just two years of use, the Whoop starts becoming more expensive than the Series 10.",
      "Everyone I know uses their wearables for four or five years. Four years of Whoop Life, the version I tested, is $1436. That\u2019s more than basically every wearable on the market.",
      "Whoop vs Apple Watch: The final verdict",
      "Whoop is a much more specific product than the Apple Watch \u2014 it\u2019s for a niche crowd who want a tracker with no screen, in-depth analysis and excellent battery life. If that sounds like you, give the Whoop a try \u2014 the brand has a one month free trial (though the trial does not include Healthspan features).",
      "Whoop is not for me, though. If I am wearing something on my wrist, I want it to have a screen so I can use my phone less. The Apple Watch Series 10 is one of the best wearables for anyone with an iPhone, as long as you don\u2019t mind charging it daily. In the long run, it\u2019s also much cheaper than any Whoop subscription.",
      "Why trust NBC Select?",
      "I am a reporter at NBC Select who covers technology and fitness including recent stories on smartwatches, running shoes, workout earbuds and more. I tested the Whoop MG for a month alongside the Apple Watch Series 10. I test wearables regularly, and tested the Whoop 4.0 in years past.",

    "summary": "Brands are already raising prices, so experts recommend buying tech, household basics, clothing and baby gear before costs go up even more.",
    "story": [
      "It\u2019s almost impossible to avoid tariff-related price hikes while shopping. A universal 10% tariff on all countries has been in effect since April, and over 100 countries could soon face higher reciprocal tariffs if they don\u2019t reach a trade agreement with the U.S. before Aug. 1.",
      "Since the trade war is expected to heat up even more in the coming weeks, don\u2019t be surprised if you\u2019re suddenly paying more for clothes, tech, household basics and groceries. That said, there\u2019s still time to save \u2014 tariffs only apply to imported goods, so prices on products currently in U.S. warehouses aren\u2019t currently shooting up. Once that supply runs out, however, many brands will have no choice but to raise prices, including those that already did a first round of hikes earlier this year.",
      "Below, I spoke with experts about what they recommend buying before tariffs have a significant impact on your shopping cart. They also responded to frequently asked questions about tariffs and shared tips for saving money.",

      "What to buy as tariff-related price hikes roll out",
      "We don\u2019t know what the exact impacts of tariffs will be, but one thing is for sure: almost everything you buy is getting more expensive, says Dr. Ross Steinman, a professor of consumer psychology at Widener University. That doesn\u2019t mean you should panic buy \u2014 it does, however, mean that now is the best time to purchase anything on your wishlist or that you\u2019ve been saving up for. It\u2019s crucial to focus on higher-cost items produced abroad, like tech, appliances, furniture and cars, as well as clothing, shoes and household basics like groceries and cleaning supplies, says Vipin Porwal, the CEO and a consumer savings expert at Smarty.",
      "A few things to keep in mind: First, as I said above, tariffs only apply to imported goods, so the price of products currently in U.S. warehouses aren\u2019t shooting up.  But it\u2019s only a matter of time before that stock runs low and companies have to import more goods, which will be subject to the new tariff rates. We\u2019re also already seeing brands across industries raise prices or warn customers about impending hikes, including big names like Nike, Black+Decker and Fabletics. And with the threat of higher duties looming, companies that already raised prices could do so again.",
      "Also, remember that even if a product is manufactured in the U.S., tariffs are causing companies to face higher production costs. They often import materials like fabric, batteries and microchips from foreign countries, so expect increased prices on American-made goods, too.",
      "Below, I rounded up examples of products you should consider buying before more tariff-related price hikes roll out. They\u2019re all manufactured in places subject to universal tariffs or higher country-specific duties.",
      "Basics and groceries",
      "Tide Pods Liquid Laundry Detergent (76-Count)",
      "During a recent earnings call, Procter & Gamble\u2019s CEO said shoppers will start seeing price hikes from its brands this summer, including Tide, which has manufacturing plants in the U.S. but may import ingredients, materials and packaging from abroad. These laundry detergent pods have a color protector, odor fighter and stain remover inside. They dissolve quickly in cool or warm water, according to Tide.",
      "Bounty Paper Towels",
      "Procter & Gamble also owns the paper goods brand Bounty, which, similar to Tide, makes its products across the U.S. but may import ingredients, materials and packaging from abroad. These paper towels are absorbent so you can quickly soak up messes. Rolls come pre-measured, letting you tear off small or large sheets along the perforated lines.",
      "Kosterina Original Extra Virgin Olive Oil",
      "Kosterina harvests Koroneiki olives in Greece to make this extra-virgin olive oil. Before the price of this pantry staple increases due to the 15% tariff imposed on countries part of the European Union, consider buying a couple of bottles. The EVOO, which I use for sauteing, roasting and making dressings, has a buttery, peppery flavor.",
      "Technology",
      "Apple AirPods 4 with ANC",
      "Apple makes most of its hardware in China and produces devices like iPhones, iPads, MacBooks and AirPods in India and Vietnam. NBC Select reporter Harry Rabinowitz, who tested Apple\u2019s AirPods 4 for two months, says they\u2019re a small, comfortable pair you can rely on daily. \u201cThese are the best earbuds for anyone who hates the feeling of rubber eartips clogging their eardrums,\u201d he says. \u201cThey also have new features like dust and water resistance, and adaptive audio, which automatically switches between noise cancellation modes.\u201d",
      "JBL Clip 5",
      "The JBL Clip 5, which is made in China, is our team\u2019s go-to Bluetooth speaker \u2014 the audio quality is impressive for the device\u2019s size, and its built-in carabiner clip lets you attach it to bags, bikes, beach umbrellas, bathroom towel rods and more. You can use the speaker for up to 12 hours before needing to recharge it, according to the brand. The Clip 5 is also dust- and water-resistant.",
      "Nintendo Switch with Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy-Con",
      "While Nintendo didn\u2019t raise the price of the Switch 2 prior to its launch in June, the company, which makes most of its products in Asia, marked up related accessories. It also said \u201cother adjustments to the price of any Nintendo product are possible in the future, depending on market conditions.\u201d",
      "The original Switch is beloved among the NBC Select staff, and if it\u2019s on your wishlist, we recommend buying it soon \u2014 its price could increase at any point, and it\u2019s more readily available compared to the frequently out-of-stock Switch 2. This handheld gaming console has two detachable Joy-Con controllers and three play modes: TV, handheld and tabletop. It\u2019s also designed with built-in motion controls that immerse you in games.",
      "Google Pixel Watch 3",
      "Most Google Pixel products are made in China and Vietnam, like the Pixel Watch 3, which won an NBC Select Wellness Award. Rabinowitz says it\u2019s Google\u2019s best smartwatch yet, although it\u2019s only compatible with Android phones (which are also likely to increase in price soon). It has fitness tracking features, including the ability to automatically log workouts and build custom runs. The water-resistant watch has a 24-hour battery life, according to the brand, and collects data about your sleep.",
      "Clothes and shoes",
      "Gap Organic Cotton VintageSoft T-Shirt",
      "I buy basics from Gap every time they\u2019re on sale, including this 100% cotton T-shirt, which is made in India. The shirt has a soft, loose feel, short sleeves and a crewneck. It runs true-to-size, in my experience. I typically wear it tucked into a pair of jeans, and in the colder months, I throw a cardigan over it.",
      "501\u00ae Original Fit Men's Jeans",
      "These Levi\u2019s jeans, available in men\u2019s and women\u2019s sizes, are produced in China, but the brand makes and sources apparel from across the world. \u201cI\u2019ve been wearing a pair of Levi\u2019s 501\u2019s for over 6 years now,\u201d says NBC Select editor Jordan Bowman. \u201cI love the classic, straight fit because it works for almost every outfit, and the cut is honestly timeless. There\u2019s a reason these are one of most iconic pairs of denim of all time.\u201d",
      "Lululemon Wunder Train High-Rise Leggings",
      "Lululemon, which makes and sources products from across the world, raised prices on a small portion of its merchandise this summer. According to an earnings call, the hikes were \u201cmodest\u201d and \u201cstrategic.\u201d The brand didn\u2019t specify exactly what products increased in price, or whether customers should expect additional increases in the future. Lululemon\u2019s Wunder Train High-Rise Leggings are my all-time favorite pair for high-intensity workouts like running, as well as strength training. They have two side pockets, a hidden pocket in the waistband and a waistband drawcord.",
      "Adidas Samba OG Sneaker",
      "Adidas, which primarily makes its shoes in Asia and Germany, will eventually raise prices on its U.S. products, according to the brand, which did not disclose how much increases will be or what items will be affected. These are some of Adidas\u2019 most classic sneakers for men and women. The Samba has a leather upper, synthetic fabric lining and grippy rubber outsole.",
      "Birkenstock Arizona",
      "Birkenstock, which makes products at its factories in Germany, plans to raise prices globally to offset tariffs at some point before September. The brand\u2019s Arizona slip-on sandal for men and women has two adjustable straps and a cork footbed. There\u2019s also a deep heel cup to keep your foot secure, as well as a raised toe bar to encourage the natural gripping motion of your feet, according to the brand.",
      "Under Armour Charged Surge 4 Sneaker",
      "During a recent earnings call, Under Armour, which sources products from countries like Vietnam, Jordan and Indonesia, shared that it\u2019s increasing prices on its apparel, shoes and accessories. We\u2019ve tested lots of Under Armour\u2019s activewear and sneakers over the years. The Charged Surge 4, available in men\u2019s and women\u2019s sizes, is a basic shoe that\u2019s great for walkers, runners and gym goers. It has a cushioned midsole to support feet and a grippy rubber outsole to stabilize you on various surfaces. The sneaker is also made with mesh to keep feet cool.",
      "Home and kitchen",
      "Ninja AF101 Air Fryer",
      "SharkNinja already raised prices on a handful of products in response to tariffs, and will continue to, according to a statement from the company\u2019s CEO during a recent earnings call. Almost every NBC Select staff member has a Ninja appliance in their kitchen, most of which are manufactured in China and Southeast Asia. While we love using the Creami to make frozen treats, we rely most on Ninja\u2019s basic kitchen gadgets, like blenders, air fryers and coffee machines. This air fryer is recommended by NBC Select SEO editor Nikki Brown, who appreciates that it\u2019s big enough to feed a few people,  yet compact enough to keep in her small kitchen. The appliance is easy to operate, and you can use it to air fry, roast, reheat and dehydrate ingredients. Its detachable parts are dishwasher-safe, according to the brand.",
      "Dyson Ball Animal 3 Extra Upright Vacuum",
      "We recommend Dyson\u2019s vacuums, which are made in countries like China and Malaysia, because they have superior suction and make cleaning all types of floors a breeze. If you have one on your wishlist, now is the time to buy \u2014 Dyson\u2019s vacuums are hundreds of dollars, so potential price increases could put them out of your budget. The Ball Animal 3 Extra upright vacuum is designed to clean large homes with pets. It has a detangling brushhead, three cleaning modes and a built-in filtration system, plus it comes with multiple accessories, including a pet grooming tool.",
      "Sproos! Handheld Showerhead with Filter Set",
      "In the spring, Sproos notified customers that it planned on holding prices steady for the time being. We\u2019re keeping a close eye on increases, which we haven\u2019t seen yet \u2014 that means now is the best time to invest in one of the brand\u2019s filtered showerheads. This set comes with a handheld fixture that has a replaceable filter and three spray modes. Everything you need for installation is included, including steel pliers and step-by-step instructions.",
      "Ikea Kallax Shelf Unit",
      "Ikea\u2019s furniture and home goods are centered around Swedish and Scandinavian designs, but they\u2019re manufactured worldwide. Rabinowitz\u2019s favorite Ikea piece is this shelf, which he has a larger version of. \u201cThis storage shelf has moved with me across three apartments in New York City \u2014 it\u2019s outlasted couches, mattresses, bed frames and TV stands,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to wow anyone aesthetically, but it is extremely practical.\u201d",
      "Casper Original Hybrid Mattress",
      "Many brands, including Casper, assemble their mattresses in the U.S.. Still, they import materials like fabrics, foam and springs from overseas \u2014 that could lead to increased production costs for companies, and, in turn, increased prices for shoppers.",
      "NBC Select updates editor Mili Godio recommends Casper\u2019s Original Hybrid Mattress if you need to upgrade soon. \u201cI bought this mattress in 2021 and it still feels brand new years later,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s semi-firm, which is perfect for my husband and I since we tend to have different preferences. I\u2019m really picky about my mattresses because I\u2019m a very hot sleeper, but this one manages to feel fairly cool and doesn\u2019t trap heat, in my experience.\u201d",
      "Baby gear",
      "Uppababy Aria Infant Car Seat",
      "The cost of baby gear like strollers and car seats, much of which is produced overseas, is up 20% on average since January, according to BabyCenter, a digital parenting resource. Uppababy raised prices across most of its products a few months ago, so if you\u2019re in the market for one of the brand\u2019s strollers, car seats, high chairs, changing backpacks or bouncers, buy it before another round of hikes happen. Rabinowitz used the brand\u2019s Aria car seat to travel with his newborn, and he still uses the brand\u2019s Vista V2 stroller with his now 1-year-old. He recommends buying from Uppababy if you\u2019re looking for high quality pieces and peace of mind as a parent.",
      "Coterie Monthly Diaper Box",
      "Coterie already increased the price of its monthly diaper box by $5, and the price of its 4-pack of wipes by $3, per auto-review shipment. In an email to customers, the brand cited \u201cglobal economic factors and rising material costs\u201d as the reason for the hike.",
      "Rabinowitz started buying the brand\u2019s diapers when his baby was born last year. \u201cUsing Coterie\u2019s diapers make me feel good as a parent because they work really well and don\u2019t have ingredients that I\u2019m skeptical of, like a lot of plastic and perfumes,\u201d says Rabinowitz. \u201cThe subscription is easy to use and very flexible \u2014 if I\u2019m scheduled to get diapers in five weeks but I need them in two, I can move up my shipment date.\u201d",
      "Bugaboo Butterfly 2 Travel Stroller",
      "Similar to Uppababy, Bugaboo raised prices across its baby gear earlier this year. Select products were impacted, but the brand didn\u2019t specify which ones \u2014 if you have your eye on something, buy it before its price goes up. NBC senior photo editor Becca Delman, a soon-to-be mom of three, highly recommends Bugaboo\u2019s compact travel stroller. \u201cThe Butterfly 2 works so well for my 10-month old and 3.5-year old,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s lightweight, I can fold it with one hand and it\u2019s easy to clean. The lay-flat feature is also great for my new baby when he arrives in November.\u201d",
      "Will retailers raise prices due to tariffs?",
      "Yes, in addition to individual brands, some retailers plan to start pricing their merchandise higher due to tariffs. Here are a few we know about right now:",
      "Walmart: Walmart started rolling out price hikes this summer, although the retailer didn\u2019t share details about what types of products will be impacted or what the rollout will look like.Target: Target has recently reported lower earnings and ended its price matching policy, signs that it will likely raise prices due to tariffs in the future.

      "Frequently Asked Questions",
      "Tariffs are taxes on imported goods. If a company brings foreign goods into the U.S., it must pay the U.S. government a percentage of those goods.",
      "Tariff rates are constantly changing as the U.S. government negotiates deals with its trading partners globally. In addition to the tariffs below, all of which are currently in effect, numerous countries, including Brazil, Canada, Mexico and South Africa, could soon be subject to high reciprocal tariffs once a pause expires on Aug. 1. China is also in ongoing talks with the U.S, about tariffs \u2014 the current 90-pause on duties between the countries expires on Aug. 12.",
      "10% universal tariff on imports from all U.S. trading partners, unless they\u2019re subject to country-specific rates 15% tariff on imports from countries part of the European Union, with exceptions for select products, like all aircraft and component parts, certain chemicals, generic pharmaceuticals, semiconductor equipment and some agricultural products15% tariff on imports from Japan",

      "15% tariff on imports from Japan",
      "Tariffs will eventually raise prices for U.S. consumers, but so far, the impact is muted, says Ales. Generally speaking, prices haven\u2019t changed much across industries since duties first went into effect in April \u2014 that won\u2019t be the case forever though. \u201cCompanies did a lot of stocking up in advance of tariffs, creating an inventory that\u2019s almost like a shock absorber to prevent some of the price changes,\u201d says Ales. \u201cBut eventually, that inventory runs out, and as companies get used to this new landscape, they\u2019ll begin to sit down and figure out how to adjust to it.\u201d",
      "Since tariffs are higher under the current Trump administration, brands need to find ways to pay increased duties while continuing to make a profit. Raising prices on their products, or adding an additional fee at checkout, is a route many will take. \u201cThe tariff needs to be absorbed by someone \u2014 is it the business or the consumer?,\u201d says Steinman. \u201cWe don\u2019t know exactly, but most likely, there will be some absorption occurring at the consumer level.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn terms of prices and costs going up, it appears that it\u2019s going to be almost universal,\u201d says Steinman. \u201cRight now, it seems like it\u2019s not going to be specific to any one category or industry.\u201d That said, price hikes will likely be the most noticeable among categories like groceries, vehicles and auto parts, clothing, shoes, electronics, appliances, furniture and home goods, says Porwal.",
      "There\u2019s no standard amount by which tariffs will raise prices on consumer goods, says Tala Akhavan, the COO of Pietra, an AI-powered sourcing platform that works with e-commerce brands. Companies large and small are approaching price hikes individually and using different strategies to adjust to their new reality. For example, some are splitting the burden of increased duties between customers and themselves, others are fully eating costs and finding new manufacturers, and a select few are putting all tariff fees onto customers, says Akhavan. The strategy a brand takes plays a large part in how much it increases its prices by.",
      "Long story short: consumers should expect to pay more for goods right now, says Akhavan. \u201cSo far, brands that are raising prices seem to be keeping them that way. There\u2019s so much opacity around how the tariff situation is going to play out, and as a bit of insurance, brands are keeping their prices elevated, especially since they\u2019re accepting the volatility around tariffs,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say where tariffs are going to land in the long term, but for the most part, I don\u2019t see a world where we go back to exactly where we were.\u201d",
      "Yes, tariffs are likely to increase prices on products manufactured in the U.S. as well as overseas, says Ales. Many domestically-made goods rely on imported materials, packing and machinery, all of which cost more now.",

    "story": [
      "Warning: Spoilers ahead for \u201cThe Hunting Wives.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Hunting Wives\u201d is the definition of a binge watch. Sultry yet thought-provoking, the series has stayed near the top of the Netflix Top 10 charts since its debut on the streamer on July 21.",
      "Brittany Snow plays Sophie, who arrives in East Texas from Boston along with her husband Graham (Evan Jonigkeit) and their son. She's a fish out of water, adjusting to new cultural norms and a few traumatic events in her past that cast a long shadow.",
      "The Maple Brook neighborhood clearly has a charged history. Luckily for Sophie, Margo (Malin Akerman) takes her under her wing \u2014 a good friend to have, considering Margo is married to a wealthy oil tycoon named Jed (Dermot Mulroney) who is running for governor.",
      "But there's a darkness lurking in this friend group. Local teenage Abby (Madison Wolfe) is found dead, and anyone could be the killer. Signs are pointing to it being Sophie, since Abby was shot with Sophie\u2019s new gun. Yep, that\u2019s right: It only took a few weeks and Sophie was already getting arms to match her new neighbors\u2019.",
      "Sophie can hardly remember the night of Abby's murder \u2014 she and Margo were having a bit of a rager at Margo's lake house. But she's sure she's innocent. Still, she's not innocent when it comes to letting Margo convince her to start drinking, start driving after a tragic accident, and have affairs with younger men (and each other).",
      "Read on to find out what happens in \u201cThe Hunting Wives\u201d and how the ending compares to the book by May Cobb.",
      "Who Kills Abby on 'The Hunting Wives'?",
      "Do you really want to know? OK: It's Margo, Sophie's new lover and the queen bee of the friend group.",
      "Two scenes from the first episode foreshadow Margo's crime.",
      "First, Abby hooks up with her then-boyfriend, high schooler Brad (George Ferrier), but stops because it conflicts with her faith. In the middle of all this, Margo opens the door and makes eye contact with Brad. Yep, they\u2019re a secret item.",
      "Aside from the age gap, and aside from the fact that Margo is married, there's another complication. Brad's mom Jill (Katie Lowes) is married to a prominent pastor and is Margo's friend.",
      "Second, there's the question of the tampons.",
      "Sophie meets Margo for the first time in the bathroom of her palatial house. There, Margo lets it slip that she can't use tampons. But that's not quite the case. In the finale, when Sophie and Margo have rekindled their romance, Sophie goes to the bathroom and sees tampons. Margo says she can use tampons.",
      "Why would this matter? Well, Pastor Pete (Paul Teal), the town's youth pastor (more on that dude later), had told Sophie that Abby had gotten an abortion \u2014 but he interpreted Brad's confession wrong. In fact, it was Margo who had the abortion. When's a time that women can't use tampons? After abortions.",
      "Margo had gone to her estranged biological dad, a doctor, to perform the procedure. (At the same time as all this, Margo is campaigning for her husband's anti-abortion stance).",
      "As for why Margo killed Abby? Her motive was simple. After a lifetime of manipulating her way to the top, Margo couldn't let her status be threatened, and Abby was about to do just that.",
      "Abby figured out that Margo had the abortion and was planning to reveal it \u2014 a disaster for Margo, her husband's campaign and her political career.",
      "Margo kills her. With the help of her father and brother Kyle (Michael Aaron Milligan), they conspire to help Margo cover it up, creating an alibi for her.",
      "Who Else Dies in  'The Hunting Wives'?",
      "A lot of people! Four, in fact. Here\u2019s who dies in \u201cThe Hunting Wives\u201d aside from Abby.",
      "Abby's mom, Starr (Chrissy Metz), is killed by Jill, Brad's mom. Mess! Starr learns from Pastor Pete that her daughter had an abortion, which she didn't. She goes to confront Brad's mom, Jill \u2014 convinced that Jill had killed Abby. Seeing Starr with a rifle, Jill shoots her.Jill is then killed by Callie.

      "Eugenics is an evolutionary theory aimed to select \u201cdesired heritable characteristics in order to improve future generations,\u201d according to Encyclopedia Britannica. The movement has a long history, but in the U.S., it historically used \"genetic superiority\" as justification for white supremacy.",
      "The ad\u2019s messaging surrounding \u201cgood genes\u201d feels like a wink to eugenic ideals.",
      "\u201cThem choosing \u2018Sydney Sweeney has great genes\u2019 was not an accident,\u201d one user said in a TikTok video that received over one million views. \u201cIt\u2019s a dog whistle towards the rise of people who are wanting to see more people who look like them everywhere.\u201d",
      "A representative for Sweeney declined to comment to NBC News. American Eagle did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Cheryl Overton, Chief Experience Officer at integrated marketing communications firm Cheryl Overton Communications, says context is important. The promotion \u201cdoesn\u2019t exist in a vacuum,\u201d she says. Instead, it occurs in \u201ca country actively grappling with social standards rooted in whiteness.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe subtext isn\u2019t imagined; it\u2019s rooted in centuries-old narrative about one archetype of beauty that is seen as genetically superior or \u2018aspirational,\u201d Overton tells TODAY.com.",
      "While the ad never references race, Hillary Herskowitz, CEO and Founder of H2 Marketing Group, tells TODAY.com there is \u201cno denying\u201d that the phrase \u201ccarries historical baggage.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen you pair that kind of wordplay with a blond, blue-eyed actress, it can unintentionally reinforce narrow, Eurocentric beauty standards,\u201d she adds.",
      "Whether this implication is purposeful is up for debate.",
      "Overton says the messaging could be the result of a \u201cblind spot of a team lacking cultural fluency\u201d or a \u201cbrand looking actively to cull consumers who value diversity from its base.\u201d",
      "Herskowitz sees the ad as being designed to provoke a reaction.",
      "\u201cIntentional,\u201d Herskowitz says. \u201cThat line \u2014 \u2018good jeans\u2019 \u2014 is too perfectly constructed not to be. It was designed to be cheeky, playful and buzzworthy. The creative team knew exactly what they were doing.\"",
      "Adrienne Alexander, owner of the PR firm IPY Agency, points out the extensive process campaigns like this go through, and says multiple teams likely signed off on the language.",
      "\u201cCampaigns like this go through many hands, including creative, legal, PR, and brand strategy, so it\u2019s unlikely that no one flagged the potential issue. More likely, the team underestimated the reaction or saw it as a playful pun rather than a loaded phrase. Either way, the responsibility remains the same: if you spark a conversation, be prepared to own it and respond accordingly,\u201d she says.",
      "The ad has also garnered criticism for sexualizing Sweeney. Some say the ad\u2019s close-up shots of the actor seem to objectify her and cater to the male gaze.",
      "\u201cAre we selling jeans to women or selling women in jeans to men?\u201d one user commented on American Eagle\u2019s Instagram.",
      "The limited edition Sydney Jean, produced with Sweeney, has a butterfly motif on the back pocket representing domestic violence awareness, per a press release from the company, and the entirety of the purchase price will be donated to the Crisis Text Line.",
      "Marketing professor Melissa Murphy calls the juxtaposition of the sexual nature of the ads, plus the domestic violence tie-in, \"mismatched\" tonally.",
      "Some viewers have also pointed out that the ad feels reminiscent of a controversial Calvin Klein campaign from 1980 featuring a teenage Brooke Shields.",
      "\u201cYou want to know what comes in between me and my Calvins? Nothing,\u201d the then 15-year-old model said in the ad as the camera panned her entire body.",
      "The moment caused an uproar for holding sexual implications and taking advantage of the young star. Shields later spoke out about the moment, saying she was unaware of the ad\u2019s meaning.",
      "Like the Calvin Klein ad, which Klein once said put the company on the map, American Eagle has seen increased chatter following the campaign\u2019s debut.",
      "According to Herskowitz, controversy can \u201cdrive brand momentum.\u201d But was the controversy intentional?",
      "Murphy, doubts it, and so calls the ad campaign, and its lack of diversity, a \u201cmiss.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey should have done (the ad) with multiple people \u2014 that would definitely resonate better,\u201d she says. \u201cIf there isn\u2019t more, and this is just it, then that\u2019s not a good sign.\u201d"

      "The aircraft\u2019s delivery made headlines across the country, where the public cheered Air India\u2019s transformation from a neglected state-owned flagship carrier into a modern airline that its new owners, the Tata Group, hoped would become the world\u2019s biggest.",
      "Under the Indian conglomerate, which founded the airline in 1932  and bought it back in 2022 after it spent decades under government operation, Air India was making big moves, announcing a record order in 2023 of 470 aircraft valued at more than $70 billion.",
      "A year later, the airline said it had begun a $400 million retrofit of its legacy fleet, accelerating the upgrade by leasing jets from other airlines, including Delta.",
      "That momentum came to a grinding halt last month when a London-bound Boeing 787 Dreamliner crashed seconds after takeoff in the northwestern Indian city of Ahmedabad, killing all but one of the 242 people aboard plus 19 others on the ground in one of India\u2019s worst aviation disasters.",
      "Air India has since been under immense pressure to answer for the crash, but bereaved families were left with more questions after investigators released a preliminary report this month that said the plane\u2019s fuel switches had been wrongly cut off, leading to speculation that one of the pilots might have done it accidentally or even intentionally.",
      "Indian investigators and the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, which is involved in the crash investigation as the aircraft is U.S.-made, said such conclusions were irresponsible.",

The Indian foreign ministry said Wednesday that all remains were being handled with \u201cutmost professionalism\u201d and that it was working closely with the British side to address concerns.",
      "Air India was also warned last week by India\u2019s aviation regulator that it could face enforcement action over more than two dozen safety violations from this year and last year, Reuters reported, citing government notices. They include pilots not being given mandatory rest and poor compliance with simulator training requirements.",

      "Air India was already under enormous pressure to clean up its reputation after falling into disrepair during its nearly 70 years of government ownership. Its reform nevertheless aligned perfectly with Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s nationalist narrative of turning India into a global superpower.",
      "\u201cGiven its legacy, the brand remains synonymous with India,\u201d said Shelley Vishwajeet, a New Delhi-based aviation journalist and  author of \u201cThe IndiGo Story,\u201d a book about the Indian airline. He added that the cultural transformation within Air India \u201chas been a challenge\u201d for its new owners.",

      "The gemstones are part of a cache of more than 1,800 artifacts, mostly housed at the Indian Museum in Kolkata. Critics of the planned auction of the gems, which British colonial landowner William Claxton Pepp\u00e9 dug up on his northern Indian estate in 1898, said it was offensive to the world\u2019s 500 million Buddhists and a violation of Indian and international law and United Nations conventions.",
      "Many Buddhists believe the gemstones, named after the town in what is now the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, where they were buried in a stupa, or funerary monument, around 200 to 240 B.C., are imbued with the presence of Buddha, on top of whose cremated remains the gemstones were said to be enshrined.",
      "\u201cIt would make every Indian proud that the sacred Piprahwa relics of Bhagwan Buddha have come home after 127 long years,\u201d Modi said, referring to Buddha as a god in Hindi.",
      "\u201cThese sacred relics highlight India\u2019s close association with Bhagwan Buddha and his noble teachings,\u201d he added.",
      "Sotetheby\u2019s postponed the planned auction of the gems in May after the Indian government threatened legal action and demanded their repatriation.",
      "The Indian government said at the time that Pepp\u00e9\u2019s great-grandson, Chris Pepp\u00e9, a TV director and film editor based in Los Angeles, lacked the authority to sell the gems. New Delhi also accused Sotheby\u2019s of \u201cparticipating in continued colonial exploitation\u201d by facilitating the sale and said that the gems must be returned to India if Pepp\u00e9 no longer wished to be their custodian.",
      "\u201cI hope they will go to someone who really values them,\u201d Pepp\u00e9 wrote in a February piece for Sotheby\u2019s accompanying the auction catalogue.",
      "They were put on public exhibition in Hong Kong in the days leading up to the auction in three glass cases, containing shimmering penny-sized silver and gold-leaf stars embossed with symbols. They also include pearls, beads and flowers cut from precious stones, including amethyst, topaz, garnet, coral and crystal.",
      "Sotheby\u2019s later announced the auction had been postponed \u201cwith the agreement of the consignors,\u201d three descendants of the British colonial landowner who excavated them.",
      "On Thursday, the auction house said it had \u201cfacilitated the return\u201d of the gems to India, thanking the Pepp\u00e9 family.",
      "\u201cThis completes our active search over the past two months to identify the best possible custodian for the Gems,\u201d Sotheby\u2019s said."

      "The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) may revise the magnitude of the earthquake, but if it remains at 8.8, this quake would be tied with the sixth strongest ever, which struck central Chile in 2010, killing more than 500 people and destroying over 370,000 homes.",
      "Russian authorities have called the latest quake a \u201cremarkable event.\u201d",
      "It struck at a depth of an estimated 13 miles, about 74 miles off the coast of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, the regional capital on the Kamchatka Peninsula, with a population of 180,000.",
      "Despite its strength, early reports indicate that there have been no deaths or significant damage from the event and that recorded tsunami waves reached a maximum of 9.8 to 13.1 feet in Russia, 4.9 feet in Japan and 5.7 feet in Hawaii.",

      "\u201cWhen I first saw it was 8.8, I must admit, I thought, \u2018Oh, we\u2019re going back to maybe Japan,\u2019\u201d he said, referring to the 2011 earthquake that triggered a huge tsunami, killing more than 20,000 people and causing a meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant.",
      "Now referred to as the \u201cGreat Tohoku Earthquake,\u201d it had a magnitude of 9.1, the fourth most powerful ever recorded. The waves from that tsunami reached as high as 130 feet, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, hitting the coast at a height of about 50 feet.",
      "\u201cAt the present time, it seems quite anomalous. 8.8 magnitude generating a 4-meter tsunami seems very unusual but \u2026 the information on the tsunami impact is still quite limited,\u201d Tappin said, adding that he would have expected a tsunami of at least 10 meters, or about 33 feet.",
      "He said the relatively insignificant damage reported so far could be due to the remoteness of the epicenter and the effectiveness of the warning systems.",
      "\u201cIt seems to me that the warning system kicked in, and warnings were given in Japan initially, Hawaii and off the West Coast of the U.S. So it just demonstrates the importance of having these warning systems,\u201d Tappin said. \u201cIn this instance, perhaps the tsunami wasn\u2019t large, but it saves people\u2019s lives.\u201d",
      "The fifth-strongest earthquake ever recorded, a 9.0 tremor, also hit the Kamchatka region in 1952. Its epicenter was less than 19 miles from this one. In that disaster, the waves reached up to 50 feet and killed at least 1,790 people, with some historians putting the death toll as high as 8,000, according to the Russian Military Historical Society.",
      "The region has experienced nearly 700 earthquakes with magnitudes over 5.0 since 1990, according to the USGS.",
      "The most powerful earthquake ever recorded was the magnitude-9.5 \u201cValdivia\u201d or \u201cGreat Chilean\u201d earthquake, which hit central Chile in 1960, killing more than 1,600 people and leaving 2 million homeless.",
      "One of the world\u2019s most deadly earthquakes was the third most powerful ever recorded, which struck off the coast of Sumatra, Indonesia, on Boxing Day in 2004. The 9.1-magnitude quake triggered massive tsunamis reaching up to 100 feet and killed an estimated 280,000 people."

      "\"He has continued to see photos of starving children and wants to continue to help,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told NBC News. In 2017, pictures of victims of chemical weapons attacks prompted Trump to launch Tomahawk missiles over Syria."

    "story": [
      "At least 60% of liver cancers could be preventable, according to an analysis published Monday in The Lancet.",
      "Liver cancer is the sixth most common cancer in the world, with around 870,000 cases in 2022. That\u2019s projected to increase to 1.52 million cases in 2050, the new report found, if no changes are made.",
      "The leading cause of liver cancer is viral infections, including the hepatitis B and C viruses. Hepatitis B infections \u2014 which are preventable with a vaccine \u2014 accounted for 39% of liver cancers in 2022. That\u2019s expected to fall slightly, to 36.9%, by 2025. Hepatitis C accounted for 29.1% of liver cancers in 2022 and is also projected to fall, to 25.9%, by 2050.",
      "The proportions of alcohol- and obesity-related liver cancers, however, are projected to rise in the next 25 years. Alcohol accounted for 18.8% of liver cancers in 2022, and that is expected to increase to 21.1% in 2050. The share of liver cancers caused by obesity-related disease is projected to increase from 8% to 10.8% by 2050 due to increasing rates of obesity, diabetes and high cholesterol and other metabolic risk factors.",
      "Dr. Hashem El-Serag, one of the report\u2019s co-authors and chair of the department of medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, said the public usually thinks of alcohol as the biggest risk factor for liver cancer.",
      "\u201cI think for most people, if you say cirrhosis, they immediately think of a relative, of someone who was a heavy drinker,\u201d El-Serag said. \u201cI think the vast majority do not make the tie between MASLD, or fatty liver, and cirrhosis and liver cancer.\u201d",
      "MASLD, or metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, affects about 25% of adults in the U.S. It\u2019s caused by a buildup of fat in the liver. About 5% of U.S. adults have a more severe form, called metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), which can lead to scarring, or cirrhosis, of the liver, significantly increasing the risk of cancer.",
      "Excess alcohol consumption can also lead to cirrhosis.",
      "Liver cancer is still relatively rare in the United States, representing 2.1% of all new cancer diagnoses in 2025. The report estimated that by 2040, U.S. rates of MASLD could more than double, affecting more than 55% of adults.",
      "Detecting liver cancer risk factors",
      "Earlier detection and effective treatment plans for MASLD can reduce the risk of obesity-related liver cancer, El-Serag said. The most common treatment is weight loss. GLP-1 weight loss drugs, which include Ozempic and Wegovy, are promising, he said. (A clinical trial published in April found that Wegovy treated MASH in about two-thirds of patients.)",
      "However, people aren\u2019t screened for MASLD like they are for viral hepatitis, El-Serag said.",
      "Dr. Arun Jesudian, a hepatologist and the director of liver quality and inpatient liver services at Weill Cornell Medicine and NewYork-Presbyterian, said patients are tested for MASLD and/or MASH if they have elevated liver enzymes in their blood.",
      "Raising awareness about MASLD among both patients and doctors can lead to more effective testing and diagnosis, Jesudian said.",
      "\u201cI think then we need to make sure that providers who are interacting with these patients are looking at the liver disease component of metabolic syndrome,\u201d he said, referring to patients with a cluster of conditions including high blood sugar, high blood pressure and excess weight. \u201cSo checking liver enzymes, that they know how to assess for fibrosis, even based on these blood test scores.\u201d",
      "MASLD and MASH can often be asymptomatic, making self-detection more challenging.",
      "\u201cRight now, it\u2019s haphazard. Some people get tested. Others get suspected. Third, who knows?\u201d El-Serag said.",
      "Dr. Neehar Parikh, a hepatologist at the University of Michigan who specializes in liver cancer, said he is seeing more patients with MASLD as a driving factor for liver cancer.",
      "Patients with MASLD can develop liver cancer without developing cirrhosis, making it even more challenging to detect those cases, Parikh said. Up to 40% of those with liver cancers linked to MASLD don\u2019t develop cirrhosis, according to the report.",
      "Figuring out who those patients are is the \u201cmillion-dollar question,\u201d he said. \u201cThose patients that develop MASLD that develop liver cancer, you know, how do you screen that population? We don\u2019t really know what to do.\u201d",
      "Still, Parikh said these types of cases are rare.",
      "Ultimately, Jesudian said, \u201ctreating these liver diseases early is the best way to prevent liver cancer, because liver cancer almost always occurs in the setting of chronic liver disease.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 President Donald Trump said Monday that there was \u201creal starvation\u201d in Gaza, breaking with Israel as the U.S. ally faces intense pressure to lift restrictions on aid with hunger spreading in the besieged enclave.",
      "His comments came amid mounting global outrage over rising deaths from malnutrition under Israel\u2019s military offensive on the territory.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces began limited pauses in fighting in three populated areas of Gaza on Sunday for 10 hours a day. But aid groups have warned the trickle of aid entering the enclave is not enough to stave off famine.",
      "'Those children look very hungry'",
      "Speaking in Scotland, Trump said that the U.S. would set up food centers in Gaza as \u201cwe have to get the kids fed.\u201d He disagreed with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s assessment that there is \u201cno starvation in Gaza.\u201d",
      "Trump said that he had seen images of Palestinians on TV and that \u201cthose children look very hungry.\u201d He later added that the scenes were \u201creal starvation\u201d and that \u201cyou can\u2019t fake that.\u201d",
      "His views were echoed by Vice President JD Vance, who said in response to a question from NBC News on a trip to Canton, Ohio, that the Trump administration was \u201cvery worried about the humanitarian problem in Gaza\u201d and wanted to make sure starving children got food.",
      "The partial easing of restrictions in Gaza under the new round of \u201ctactical pauses\u201d has done little to quell fears about the spiraling hunger crisis.",
      "\u201cThis is progress, but vast amounts of aid are needed to stave off famine and a catastrophic health crisis,\u201d United Nations Emergency Relief Coordinator Tom Fletcher warned in a statement.",
      "Sunday's aid deliveries were a \"drop in the ocean\" and the days ahead will be \"make or break\" in addressing the hunger crisis, Fletcher told British broadcaster BBC News on Monday.",
      "His warnings were echoed by others as the Palestinian health ministry in the enclave said Monday that 14 deaths over the past 24 hours were attributed to \u201cfamine and malnutrition,\u201d with two children among those killed.",
      "That brought the total number of deaths due to malnutrition up to 147, including 88 children, since the war began, the health ministry said, with most of those recorded in recent months, according to statements from the United Nations. NBC News was not able to independently confirm the figures.",
      "Trump, speaking either side of a meeting with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer at his golf resort in Turnberry, Scotland, said that the U.S. would be working with its European partners to address the crisis in Gaza. He offered few other details about the plan.",
      "Humanitarian groups and doctors have warned for weeks of mounting malnutrition in Gaza, with Israel allowing only a \u201cbasic\u201d amount of food in since May when it lifted its blockade barring the entry of aid into the enclave.",
      "Just under 30 aid packages carrying food were airdropped over Gaza on Sunday, COGAT, the Israeli military's liaison with the Palestinians, said in a statement.",
      "Video captured by NBC News' crew on the ground showed scores of Palestinians running toward a handful of parachutes dotting the sky in northern Gaza, which COGAT said was airdropped in collaboration with the United Arab Emirates and Jordan.",
      "Abdul Rahman Al-Kahlout, 18, said he waited for hours under the blazing sun in hope of reaching the supplies before they ran out.",
      "\"We died in the sun for four hours,\" Al-Kahlout said. He described shots being fired and soldiers surrounding Palestinians as they waited for the aid several times. He said he feared he was \"going to die for flour.\"",
      "More than 1,000 people, including children, have been killed by Israeli forces while waiting for and trying to reach aid since a new distribution system was implemented in late May, led by the controversial U.S. and Israel-backed group the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation.",
      "Health officials in Gaza said Israeli attacks killed at least 41 Palestinians from late Saturday into Sunday, including 26 people who were seeking aid, The Associated Press reported.",
      "Facing growing pressure from the global community, Israel has sought to justify both its restrictions and the introduction of a new distribution system by arguing that Hamas has been diverting aid from civilians in the enclave throughout the war.",
      "But an internal U.S. government analysis has found no evidence of systematic theft of aid supplies by Hamas, according to a report presented to State Department officials and later seen by NBC News. The IDF dismissed the report as \"biased.\"",
      "The World Food Program said Sunday that it had enough food in and on its way to the region to feed the entire population of Gaza \"for almost three months,\" if enabled to do so, as it warned that a \"third of the population\" is still \"not eating for days.\""

    "story": [
      "HONG KONG \u2014 The head of China\u2019s famous Shaolin Temple has been defrocked as authorities investigate allegations of financial offenses and sexual misconduct.",
      "Shi Yongxin, the temple\u2019s abbot since 1999, has had his ordination certificate revoked, China\u2019s state-backed Buddhist Association said in a statement Monday, citing allegations that he embezzled and misappropriated project funds and temple assets.",
      "Shi, 59, also broke his vow of celibacy, having \u201cimproper relationships\u201d with women over a long period of time and fathering at least one child out of wedlock, the temple said in a separate statement Sunday.",
      "Shi\u2019s actions are \u201cparticularly egregious, severely damaging the reputation of the Buddhist community and tarnishing the image of monastics,\u201d the association said, adding that it \u201cfirmly supports\u201d the investigation by multiple agencies.",
      "Calls to the Shaolin Temple went unanswered Monday.",
      "Dubbed the \u201cCEO monk,\u201d Shi globally commercialized the Shaolin Temple, based in China\u2019s central province of Henan, a 1,500-year-old monastery recognized as the cradle of kung fu. As of Monday, four companies are still registered under Shi\u2019s name, according to Qichacha, a Chinese corporate database operator.",
      "Led by Shi, the temple has raised its international profile over the years through tourism, performances and training. It has also established multiple overseas cultural centers, including in the United States, Australia and Europe.",
      "Though Shi has faced similar accusations in the past, religious authorities rejected them at the time.",
      "In 2011, Shi downplayed online rumors that he had mistresses and children. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to vindicate. When things like this happen, just let it go,\u201d he told the state-run newspaper People\u2019s Daily.",
      "In 2015, several of Shi\u2019s students accused him of extortion and bribery, drawing heightened attention from China\u2019s top religious affairs body. A two-year investigation cleared Shi of wrongdoing.",
      "The latest investigation was widely satirized on Chinese social media, where commenters noted the irony of the allegations given that Shi\u2019s religion requires him to live frugally.",
      "\u201cAll the wishes I made for wealth and success at the Buddhist temples have come true for the monks,\u201d a user wrote on the Chinese social media platform Weibo."
