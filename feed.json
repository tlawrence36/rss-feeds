      "Since its initial release in 1973, \u201cBuckingham Nicks\u201d has never been reissued and is not currently available on streaming platforms. The remastered version arrives Sept. 19 via Rhino Records' high-fidelity series and was sourced from the original analog master tapes. The album will also receive a CD and digital release for the first time, and the opening track, \u201cCrying in the Night,\u201d was available to stream Wednesday.",
      "Buckingham and Nicks were in their early to mid-20s during the making of their album. \u201cIt was a very natural thing, from the beginning,\u201d Nicks says in the re-release's liner notes, written by music journalist David Fricke.",
      "Despite their relative inexperience, \u201cit stands up in a way you would hope it would, by these two kids who were pretty young to be doing that work,\u201d Buckingham says, according to the announcement release.",
      "The reissue announcement was foreshadowed by cryptic Instagram posts last week. Both Nicks and Buckingham shared handwritten lyrics to their official social media accounts.",
      "\u201cAnd if you go forward\u2026\u201d Nicks posted, a line from their song \u201cFrozen Love,\u201d which appears on \u201cBuckingham Nicks.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll meet you there,\u201d Buckingham shared, completing the lyric.",
      "In 2011, Buckingham told Uncut that he and Nicks had \u201cevery intention of putting that album back out and possibly even doing something along with it, but I can\u2019t put any specifics on that.\u201d In 2013, on the album\u2019s 40th anniversary, Fleetwood Mac released \u201cExtended Play,\u201d their first new studio material since 2003\u2019s \u201cSay You Will.\u201d The four-track collection featured a song titled \u201cWithout You,\u201d which had been originally slated for \u201cBuckingham Nicks.\u201d",
      "The reissued version of \u201cBuckingham Nicks\u201d features the same album cover as the original, despite Nicks' public dissatisfaction with the photograph, telling classic rock magazine MOJO that she \u201cfelt like a rat in a trap\u201d during the shoot.",

      "\u201cBuckingham Nicks\u201d was released one year before they joined Fleetwood Mac, and was met with little commercial success. But it did attract the attention of Mick Fleetwood, who invited Buckingham to join Fleetwood Mac. Buckingham in turn insisted Nicks come, too. The two, then a couple, became the central faces, voices and songwriters of the group for the four decades that followed.",
      "The pair\u2019s tumultuous relationship appeared across the band\u2019s discography: She wrote \u201cDreams\u201d about him. He wrote \u201cGo Your Own Way\u201d about her.

      "Buckingham left the band in 1987, returning in 1996. The last time the band reunited, however, for a 2018-2019 tour, the rest of the members kicked Buckingham out, and as a result, he sued them. He claimed he was told five days after the group appeared at Radio City Music Hall that the band would tour without him. He says he would have been paid at least $12 million for his share of the proceeds. Later that year, Buckingham said they had settled the lawsuit.",
      "Both Buckingham and Nicks have also released reams of solo music. Some fans had theorized that Nicks and Buckingham were teasing a Fleetwood Mac reunion, which would have been the first since the death of vocalist, songwriter and keyboard player Christine McVie in 2022.",
      "Last year, Nicks told MOJO that without McVie, \u201cthere is no chance of putting Fleetwood Mac back together in any way.\u201d",

      "Would the world know what a vibraslap sounds like without the immediately recognizable introduction to Osbourne's first solo single, \u201cCrazy Train?\u201d To call it a classic is almost a disservice \u2014 it is an addicting tune, complete with chugging guitars and Cold War-era fears.",
      "Another classic cut from Osbourne's debut solo album, \u201cBlizzard Of Ozz\u201d \u2014 released one year after Osbourne was fired from Black Sabbath for his legendary excesses, \u2014 the arena rock anthem \u201cMr. Crowley\u201d pays tribute to the famed English occultist Aleister Crowley and features Deep Purple's Don Airey on keyboard.",
      "The title track and coda of Osbourne's second solo studio album, \u201cDiary of a Madman,\u201d runs over six minutes long, features big strings and a choir so theatrical it sounds like they're scoring a medieval war film. He wanted big, he wanted dramatic, and he nailed it.",
      "It wouldn't be inaccurate to call \u201cMama, I'm Coming Home\u201d a beautiful-sounding song. It's unlike anything on this list, a power ballad featuring lyrics written by the late Mot\u00f6rhead frontman Lemmy and a welcomed deviation.",
      "When Black Sabbath comes to mind, most fans jump to an unimpeachable run of albums released in the '70s and early \u201980s. But \u201cI,\u201d a cut from Black Sabbath's too often overlooked 16th studio album, \u201cDehumanizer,\u201d is worth your ear. And not only because it is the first Sabbath album to feature singer Ronnie James Dio and drummer Vinny Appice since 1981's \u201cMob Rules,\u201d though that's an obvious plus.",
      "Late in life Ozzy Osbourne was generous with his time and talent, often collaborating with younger performers who idolized the metal legend. One such example is Post Malone's \u201cTake What You Want,\u201d which also features the rapper Travis Scott. Osbourne gives the song a necessary gothic edge \u2014 validating the otherwise balladic song's use of a sprightly guitar solo.",

      "The show features Payne as a guest judge, offering pointed but witty advice to young bands chasing success not unlike what he achieved as part of the culture-shifting boy band, One Direction. Payne died in October after falling from a hotel balcony in Argentina, not long after the show\u2019s production wrapped.",
      "\u201cGetting to see the real, true him that the world gets to remember him for, which you\u2019ll see on this show, is just a beautiful thing,\u201d says the Backstreet Boys\u2019 AJ McLean, the show\u2019s host.",
      "\u201cBuilding the Band\u201d flips traditional music competitions on their head, bringing together 50 up-and-coming artists who are tasked with singing for each other and forming groups based on those performances. The catch? They can\u2019t see how anyone looks.",
      "The first batch of episodes premiered in early July and the last few episodes, including the finale, will drop Wednesday. The show ultimately follows six bands working to develop their group sound and performances \u2014 until only one band is left standing, winning the $500,000 prize.",
      "The show is hosted by McLean, with Pussycat Dolls frontwoman \u2014 and newly minted Tony winner \u2014 Nicole Scherzinger mentoring the bands and Destiny\u2019s Child star Kelly Rowland serving as a guest judge alongside Payne.",
      "The series opened with a dedication to Payne and his family, in which McLean said they \u201cnever imagined we'd soon be saying goodbye to our friend\u201d while filming the show.",
      "Payne first appears in the seventh episode for the showcase, where each band performs in front of a live audience and the judges, only about a week after they form.",
      "\u201cWe were amazing dancers, obviously, in One Direction,\u201d Payne joked in the episode while offering critiques to boy band Midnight \u2019til Morning, whose members expressed hesitations with dancing onstage. Band member Mason Watts then revealed his family had won tickets to sit front row at a One Direction concert when he was 11, stoking applause from the crowd and a heartfelt response from Payne.",
      "\u201cEver since that moment, I wanted to be in a group,\u201d Watts, originally from Australia, said in the episode. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a full-circle moment to be here with a group and performing in front of you. So, thank you, man.\u201d",
      "Landon Boyce, a member of the show's other boy band, Soulidified, told The Associated Press that Payne left a lasting impact and was a leading example of how he hopes to carry himself as a performer.",
      "\u201cI remember Liam just said, \u2018Have fun,\u2019\u201d Boyce says. \u201cHe just told us, \u2018I wish One Direction kind of, like, did what you guys were doing.\u2019 And I kind of just took that as like, let\u2019s just have fun and dance.\u201d",
      "Payne is seen nodding along with excitement during the band's showcase performance, when they sang \u201cSure Thing\u201d by Miguel. Bradley Rittmann, another Soulidified member, told the AP they were \u201con Cloud 9\u201d after Payne said he would join their band.",

      "The decision to pull U.S. funding and participation from UNESCO comes two years after the Biden administration rejoined following a controversial, five-year absence that began during President Donald Trump\u2019s first term. The White House cited similar concerns as it did in 2018, saying it believes U.S. involvement is not in its national interest and accusing the agency of promoting anti-Israel speech.",
      "The decision, which won't go into effect until December 2026, will deal a blow to an agency known for preserving cultural heritage through its UNESCO World Heritage Sites program \u2014 which recognizes significant landmarks for protection, ranging from the Taj Mahal to Egypt's pyramids of Giza and the Grand Canyon National Park. The agency also empowers education and science across the globe.",
      "It is the Trump administration\u2019s latest move to pull support for U.N. agencies under a larger campaign to reshape U.S. diplomacy. Under the \"America First\" approach, the administration has pulled out of the U.N. World Health Organization and the top U.N. human rights body, while reassessing its funding for others. This has left the U.N., which is in the process of its own massive overhaul, reevaluating core programs and initiatives and what the international body would look like without support from the U.S. \u2014 its largest donor.",
      "State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said in a statement that the withdrawal was linked to UNESCO\u2019s perceived agenda to \u201cadvance divisive social and cultural causes.\u201d",
      "She added that UNESCO\u2019s decision in 2011 \u201cto admit the \u2018State of Palestine\u2019 as a Member State is highly problematic, contrary to U.S. policy, and contributed to the proliferation of anti-Israel rhetoric within the organization.\u201d",
      "UNESCO director general Audrey Azoulay said she \u201cdeeply\u201d regrets the U.S. decision but said it was expected and that the agency \u201chas prepared for it.\u201d She also denied accusations of anti-Israel bias, saying it contradicts \u201cthe reality of UNESCO\u2019s efforts, particularly in the field of Holocaust education and the fight against antisemitism.\u201d",
      "Azoulay added that \u201cthe reasons put forward by the United States of America are the same as seven years ago, even though the situation has changed profoundly, political tensions have receded, and UNESCO today constitutes a rare forum for consensus on concrete and action-oriented multilateralism.\"",
      "Danny Danon, Israel's ambassador to the U.N., celebrated the announcement, saying in a statement that it is a \u201cfitting response to the consistent misguided anti-Israel bias of UNESCO, an organization that has lost its way.\u201d",

While the U.S. had previously provided a notable share of the agency\u2019s budget, UNESCO has diversified its funding sources in recent years as the U.S. contribution has decreased. Today, American assistance represents only 8% of the agency\u2019s total budget.",
      "Bruce hinted later Tuesday that further U.S. withdrawal from international organizations could be coming as a result of the ongoing review to ensure \u201ccontinued U.S. participation in international organizations will focus on advancing American interests with clarity and conviction.\u201d",

      "The NBA Summer League in Las Vegas has become more than just basketball",
      "LAS VEGAS -- While Bronny James and other young talent were lighting up the NBA Summer League court in Las Vegas, another game was being played just a few steps away: One with scripts, storyboards and studio buzz.",
      "Inside the Thomas & Mack Center, just as the league wrapped up Sunday, a different kind of crowd formed. Hollywood execs, producers and curious power players were slipping away from the basketball action to catch a slate of 34 film projects created by NBA stars past and present.",
      "More than just film screenings, it\u2019s an emerging playground where sports and the art of storytelling collide. From baseline to backlot, the Summer League Film Festival is generating off-court buzz \u2014 with the likes of Hall of Famer Kevin Garnett, actor-producer Mark Wahlberg and filmmaker Deon Taylor joining the mix. Conversations are building on turning this three-day showcase into a launchpad for athlete-filmmakers, backed by film industry veterans who understand both the creative and business sides of shaping ideas and grooming projects for the screen.",
      "\u201cThis definitely has legs,\u201d said retired NBA player Stacey Augmon after previewing \u201cUNLV: Kings of Vegas,\u201d a documentary chronicling the untold story of the Runnin\u2019 Rebels in the Strip View Pavilion. A 10-minute clip was screened before a packed audience, including Sundance Film Festival director Michelle Satter and production companies like the Wahlberg co-owned Unrealistic Ideas and Alcon Entertainment, the company behind \u201cThe Book of Eli\u201d and \u201cBlade Runner 2049.\u201d",
      "Like other entries, the \u201cKings of Vegas\u201d team showcased select footage, including interviews with high-profile names such as Snoop Dogg, Chuck D and Jimmy Kimmel, alongside UNLV legends Augmon, Larry Johnson, Greg Anthony and others. After the screening, the producers and cast discussed the film\u2019s origins, drawing a standing ovation from the crowd.",
      "The documentary remains in development, but Augmon says the film festival is already proving its worth.",
      "\u201cThis gives us another great avenue,\u201d said Augmon, who played on the Runnin' Rebels team that won the 1990 NCAA championship before his 15-season NBA career. His college teammate, Anderson Hunt, said sharing their authentic, real-life stories offer a major advantage like never before, unlocking new pathways to getting their projects financed and sold.",
      "\u201cWe have control of what's coming out,\u201d Hunt said. \u201cPeople might know about our stories through the internet. But stuff like this takes our platform to the next level. This is great for us, and Deon is like a golden child.\u201d",
      "The festival spotlighted stories produced by NBA stars past and present including Nikola Jokic, Luguentz Dort, Tony Allen, Nate Robinson, Kyle Anderson, Cole Anthony, Keyon Dooling and Udonis Haslem.",
      "Deon and Roxanne Avent Taylor of Hidden Empire Film Group were tapped to infuse the festival with seasoned filmmaking expertise, helping bridge the worlds of sports and entertainment. He played a key role in encouraging Hollywood insiders to show up, especially during the NBA Summer League's final stretch to keep the closing days as enticing as opening week.",
      "Taylor credited NBA Summer League co-founder Albert Hall for having the foresight to spark the collaboration.",
      "\u201cThis is all invaluable,\u201d said Hall, who cofounded the league with Warren LeGarie in 2004. \u201cThe players make money, no doubt about it. They invest in these projects. But they don\u2019t really know what the system can provide or how to approach it. Kind of like a young executive getting into the sport or a young player trying to be seen and get exposure. It\u2019s the same way. They have to be coached up.\u201d",
      "Hall said the partnership with Hidden Empire was a natural next step following their successful collaboration with the NFL and Skydance Sports, where they led film training sessions in March for more than 20 current and former NFL players. He added that having Wahlberg and Archie Gips of Unrealistic Ideas on board brings more industry muscle to strengthen the initiative and help drive it forward.",
      "Taylor said the festival is a door opener for the athletes.",

      "\u201cThe greatest artists are the ones that draw, create, build, shoot in the face of negativity and who paint pictures of what they see in the times that they live in,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cYou can only do that if you live in this culture. You can do that if you've lived and experienced it. You can't do that from a high-rise building with no pain. These guys come from adversity in life and sports.\u201d",
      "EverWonder Studio president Michael Antinoro certainly thinks so, and then some. He sees the film festival as more than a one-off spectacle in Las Vegas.",
      "In Antinoro's eyes, it could become the Oscars of athlete-driven storytelling with satellite versions popping up in the NBA arenas throughout the season. He sees value in helping standout projects secure the final funding and reach the right distributors.",
      "\u201cIf we can add any value, we\u2019re in the rooms talking to all the networks and streamers that distributes films,\u201d said Antinoro, a founding partner of the studio, which specializes in nonfiction content, documentaries and live events. The company served as co-executive producer on \u201cDefiant: The Manny Pacquiao Obsession\u201d in 2019 and produced projects featuring Mike Tyson and Brett Favre.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re talking to them a lot. It\u2019s all about exposure,\u201d he said. \u201cSome of these films maybe need a little more money just to get them over the line. If it makes sense, we can play a little there too.\u201d",
      "For Michelle Satter, it\u2019s all about fostering a supportive creative community. She sees promising potential in what\u2019s taking shape at the Summer League Film Festival.",
      "While it\u2019s still early, Satter can envision a future where projects from the festival eventually find their way into Sundance.",
      "\u201cWhy not? Of course,\u201d said Satter, a founding figure at Sundance since 1981. She now serves as the founding senior director of Sundance Institute's artist programs. She's exploring how it might support the festival after being invited by Taylor.",
      "Sundance already has an existing partnership with Taylor\u2019s Hidden Empire. She called the opportunity to collaborate on this new venture both exciting and aligned with Sundance\u2019s mission to uplift emerging voices in storytelling.",
      "Satter's late son, Michael Latt, had his documentary short \u201cHoops, Hopes & Dreams\u201d premiere at Sundance early this year. She said Sundance gets about 15,000 short film submissions each year, but there\u2019s room for compelling storytelling that opens up new perspective from an athlete\u2019s lens.",
      "\u201cThat was the power of storytelling, the unity of sports and bringing people together in community,\u201d she said. \u201cI love the idea. These are the stories people need to see. They need to be out there in the world.\u201d",

(AP) \u2014 Jimmy Buffett \u2019s widow has accused her late husband\u2019s financial adviser of failing to administer the singer\u2019s multimillion-dollar trust in good faith and ignoring what she believed were her best interests for the $275 million estate.",
      "Jane Buffett on Monday asked a judge in West Palm Beach, Florida, to stop Richard Mozenter from trying to remove her as a trustee and instead sought an order removing him from overseeing the estate, according to court papers.",

      "The dispute is similar to another going on with the estate of another beloved singer, Tony Bennett. Two of the late crooner\u2019s daughters sued their brother over his handling of the family trust.",

      "On May 30, Jane Buffett's lawyers provided Mozenter's lawyers a copy of a petition they planned to file in Los Angeles Superior Court if he did not resign as cotrustee by June 2, the filing states.",
      "Mozenter's counsel instead filed a petition June 2 in West Palm Beach, seeking Buffett's removal as cotrustee, documents show. Jane Buffett's complaint was filed June 3 in Los Angeles, where Mozenter is managing director at Gelfand, Rennert and Feldman LLC.",

      "ERIE, Pa. -- Besides being a fan, John Oliver has had a certain affinity for minor league baseball.",
      "On Saturday night, the comedian and host of HBO's \u201cLast Week Tonight\u201d saw his latest crazy creation set out into the world as the Erie Moon Mammoths made their debut in front of a record crowd of 7,070 at UPMC Park.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re sending our furry child out into the world and you are the custodian of it. Now, please be careful with our child,\u201d Oliver said a couple of hours before the Moon Mammoths took the field against the Chesapeake Oyster Catchers.",
      "Oliver spotlighted Minor League Baseball promotions and alternate nicknames during \u201cLast Week Tonight\u201d on May 4. At the end of the segment, Oliver invited teams to send in proposals on why they should get rebranded by the show's staff.",
      "Forty-seven teams sent in pitches, including the Erie SeaWolves, the Double-A affiliate of the Detroit Tigers.",
      "Erie president Greg Coleman sent a list of 11 reasons why they were the perfect candidate, including: \u201cThe SeaWolves play baseball nowhere near the sea.\u201d",
      "\u201cTo have so many teams expressing interest was really edifying. I think it kind of validates the fact that we thought there was something special about minor league baseball. We thought this would be a group of people that would respond to the ludicrous idea that we had,\u201d Oliver said.",
      "Erie was announced as the winner on May 18. After six weeks of research by Oliver and his staff, the Moon Mammoths were unveiled on June 29. That included the mascot named Fuzz, a purple woolly mammoth wearing a space helmet.",
      "\u201cErie did stand out to us as being, you know, uniquely eccentric. And I say that as both a compliment and an insult, which is the biggest compliment there is,\" Oliver said. \u201cThere was something about the Moon Mammoth that spoke to us for being particularly odd. It felt like it could make a baseball team's theme. You could almost see the logo in your head and it felt like something to be extra surprising.\u201d",
      "That this came together in less than three months is a minor miracle. It usually takes 16 months for a team to have an alternate identity approved and then take the field.",
      "\u201cI thought we had a good chance when I sent it in. And then when we were selected it was a little surreal,\u201d Coleman said. \u201cAnd since then working with the \u2018Last Week Tonight\u2019 team, they've been wonderful and detail oriented.\u201d",
      "The Moon Mammoths name was inspired by George Moon, who found the bone of a prehistoric mammoth while scuba diving in 1991. The remains are housed at the State Museum of Pennsylvania in Harrisburg.",

      "Coleman said that since the Moon Mammoths were unveiled, the team has done the equivalent of four years' of online sales in three weeks. The line of people waiting to get into the team store, which was located in left field, stretched out to near home plate in the concourse area.",
      "Karyn Drombosky and Sean Mizerski drove from Pittsburgh and were wearing homemade tusks as they waited to get into the team store.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just great. We\u2019re big baseball fans. We see the Pirates all the time, and minor league games are fun. There\u2019s so much silliness,\u201d Drombosky said. \u201cWe watch John Oliver pretty regularly. We were like surprised but excited when we saw he picked the Erie team to take over.\u201d",
      "In addition to throwing out the first pitch, Oliver was a batboy during one inning and led the crowd in \u201cTake Me Out to the Ball Game\u201d during the seventh inning stretch. The cap and jersey that Oliver wore for the first pitch are going to the Baseball Hall of Fame.",
      "Erie trailed 6-3 going into the bottom of the ninth but got within one run on Kevin McGonigle's two-run double. Chesapeake's Yaqui Rivera struck out Josue Brice\u00f1o with the bases loaded to end the game.",
      "\u201cThe atmosphere was great. Everything worked smoothly. It doesn\u2019t happen very often in minor league baseball to be able to have an event like that. It was a fun night for everyone,\u201d Erie manager Andrew Graham said.",
      "The Moon Mammoths will be back on Aug. 19 as well as Sept. 12 and 13. Coleman said there will be at least four Moon Mammoths games next season.",
      "\u201cI love minor league baseball. There is a special eccentricity to it,\u201d Oliver said. \u201cIt felt like a nice fit with our show because minor league baseball, as you know, is willing to try anything. That was proven by the fact that over half the league was willing to sight unseen, rebrand and put their trust in the hands of a group of people who are objectively untrustworthy. That\u2019s a bad decision, and it\u2019s that kind of bad decision making that I love about minor league baseball.\u201d",

      "Roger Norrington, a conductor acclaimed for historically informed performances during more than a half-century leading orchestras in Europe and the United States, has died. He was 91.",
      "Norrington died Friday at his home, his son Tom said Saturday. Norrington lived outside Exeter, England.",
      "Norrington conducted both period-instruments and modern orchestras, asking both types to play without vibrato and usually at faster tempi than modern practice.",

He made things happen emotionally,\u201d Myron Lutzke, an Orchestra of St. Luke\u2019s cellist who helped persuade Norrington to become music director, said Saturday. \u201cHe had his detractors, certainly, and some of them were some of my best friends. But for me, he got the music off the page. He made the concert experience transformative.\u201d",
      "Born on March 16, 1934, Norrington was the son of Arthur, president of Trinity College, Oxford, and the former Edith Carver. A violinist and boy soprano in his youth, Roger attended The Royal Conservatory of Music in Toronto, Dragon School, Westminster School, Cambridge and the Royal College of Music, where he studied under conductor Adrian Boult.",
      "In 1962, Norrington founded the Sch\u00fctz Choir, originally dedicated to the works of Heinrich Sch\u00fctz. He became music director of Kent Opera from 1969-84, the Bournemouth Sinfonietta from 1985-89 and New York's Orchestra of St. Luke's from 1990-94.",

      "Coldplay's concert at Gillette Stadium on Wednesday took an unexpected turn when a couple caught on the jumbotron sparked debate online",
      "LONDON -- It started out as a routine bit of fun at a Coldplay concert: Lead singer Chris Martin asked the cameras to scan the crowd for his \u201cJumbotron Song,\u201d when he sings a few lines about the people the camera lands on.",
      "At a concert at Gillette Stadium in Massachusetts on Wednesday, a man wearing a birthday sash was up first. Two people in banana costumes were highlighted.",
      "But in between, something else ensued. For several seconds, a couple was shown on the big screen. They were cuddling and smiling, his arms wrapped around her, as she leaned back into him. When they saw themselves on the big screen, her jaw dropped, her hands flew to her face and she spun away from the camera. He ducked out of the frame, as did she.",
      "\u201cEither they\u2019re having an affair or they\u2019re just very shy,\u201d Martin joked.",
      "But it didn't end there. The video went viral, and the internet got to work.",
      "The Associated Press could not immediately confirm the couple's identity.",
      "But internet sleuths allege he is the chief executive officer of a U.S.-based company, while she is the chief people officer \u2014 in other words, the head of human resources.",
      "A spokesman for the company did not respond when asked to confirm the identities of the people shown on camera. But he said in an email that a statement circulating online that was attributed to the chief executive was a \u201cfake from a clearly labeled parody account.\u201d The company later released a statement saying it had opened an investigation into the incident, but did not directly identify the employees.",
      "The woman didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment on LinkedIn. The man's LinkedIn page appeared to be deactivated, and no other way of contacting him could be immediately found. A phone call to a number listed in an online directory under his name went straight to voicemail. Attempts to reach him through other numbers associated with his name in the directory were not successful.",
      "A representative for Coldplay said the band had no comment.",
      "It\u2019s easy to miss, but most concert venues have signs informing the audience that they could be filmed during the event. Look for them on the walls when you arrive and around the bar areas or toilets. It\u2019s common practice especially when bands like to use performances for music videos or concert films.",

      "Hyuk, who lived in North Korea\u2019s North Hamgyong Province until age 12, defected to the South in 2013. His journey to K-pop stardom began while working in a factory in South Korea, where a chance encounter with the CEO of a music label eventually led to weekend rap lessons in Seoul.",
      "\u201cI went to university but then things went bad. It was when COVID was pretty severe, and a bad incident happened, so I had no choice but to work at a factory,\u201d he said.",
      "Initially skeptical, Hyuk thought the invitation to become a pop star might be a scam. He recalled thinking: \u201cI really have nothing right now, even if you rob me, not even dust would come out.\"",
      "After a year of meetings where the music executive consistently bought him meals and encouraged his training, Hyuk joined the agency in late 2021.",

      "In Alaska, a public radio station general manager took a moment from a busy day warning her community about a possible tsunami for a special task \u2014 sending a text message to Sen. Lisa Murkowski urging her to vote against a measure to strip federal fund...",
      "ANCHORAGE, Alaska -- Lauren Adams, general manager for KUCB public radio in Unalaska, Alaska, didn't have much time to reflect on Congress, 4,000 miles away, stripping federal funding for public media this week. She's been too busy working.",
      "Sirens blared in the Aleutian Islands community Wednesday warning of a potential tsunami, with a voice over public loudspeakers urging the community's 4,100 residents to seek higher ground immediately and tune into the radio \u2014 to Adams' station.",
      "At the same time in Washington, the Senate was voting on a measure that would eliminate nearly $1.1 billion that had already been appropriated for NPR and PBS \u2014 a process that didn't end until early Thursday morning. The House completed the process in time for President Donald Trump to sign it before a Friday deadline.",
      "Trump had called for the cuts, saying public media's news programming was biased against him and fellow Republicans, and threatened GOP members of Congress with primary challenges if they didn't fall in line.",

Then she made time for one more task \u2014 texting U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski and urging her to vote against the bill. Murkowski was one of two Republican senators, along with Susan Collins of Maine, to publicly dissent.",
      "\u201cI thought that it was such a telling story of why her constituents have a different relationship to public radio than maybe some other regions of the United States,\u201d Adams said.",
      "The federal money is appropriated to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which distributes it to NPR and PBS. Roughly 70% of the money goes directly to the 330 PBS and 246 NPR stations across the country, although that's only a shorthand way to describe its potential impact.",
      "The cuts are expected to weigh most heavily on smaller public media outlets away from big cities, and it's likely some won't survive. Katherine Maher, NPR's president and CEO, estimated as many as 80 NPR stations may face closure in the next year. Some stations are already fielding offers from commercial entities to buy their broadcast licenses, she said.",
      "\u201cMany of our stations which provide access to free unique local programming and emergency alerts will now be forced to make hard decisions in the weeks and months ahead,\u201d said Paula Kerger, PBS president and CEO. \u201cThere is nothing more American than PBS. Despite today's setback, we are determined to keep fighting to preserve the essential services we provide to the American public.\u201d",
      "The measure will cost PBS and NPR stations in Mississippi roughly $2 million, about 15% of the budget, said Royal Aills, executive director of Mississippi Public Broadcasting.",
      "Already, Mississippi Public Broadcasting has decided to eliminate a streaming channel that airs children's programming like \u201cCaillou\u201d and \u201cDaniel Tiger's Neighborhood\u201d to the state's youngsters 24 hours a day, said Taiwo Gaynor, the system's chief content officer.",
      "\u201cThis is important for families, to have access to content that they don't have to pay for,\u201d Gaynor said. \u201cThat is a sad thought, to think that we ... might not be able to provide that for a generation of children.\u201d",
      "Maine\u2019s public media system is looking at a hit of $2.5 million, or about 12% of its budget, for the next fiscal year, said Rick Schneider, president and chief executive officer of Maine Public. He said he\u2019s not ready to identify specific cuts, but the system is preparing to reinvent itself to make certain it continues serving the state\u2019s residents.",
      "Maine\u2019s rural residents rely heavily on public media for weather updates and disaster alerts, said Molly Curren Rowles, executive director of ACLU of Maine. Rowles said public media was a \u201clifeline\u201d to her growing up off the grid.",
      "NPR's Maher fears what the cuts might mean for the system's journalism, not just in rural areas where local news can be hard to come by, but in telling the rest of the country what is going on there. Less funding will also mean less support for popular television and radio programming, although it's too soon to tell which programs will be affected.",
      "NPR stations also use millions of dollars in federal money to pay music licensing fees. Now many will have to renegotiate these deals, which could mean less music, or a more limited variety of music, on outlets where music discovery is a big part of their identity. For example, Maher estimates that some 96% of all classical music broadcast in the United States is on NPR stations. \u201cThat is essentially taking an entire art form out of public access,\u201d she said.",

      "But donations aren't going to fill the hole left by the loss in federal funding, Maher said. The public media leaders have already turned to lobbying Congress to restore some of the funding through the appropriations process for next year's budget. They don't know how much time they have; Maher said it would be inordinately costly, and perhaps prohibitive, to reopen a radio station that is forced to close.",

      "Connie Francis was a giant of 1950s and '60s sugary-sweet pop, notching more than a dozen hits. In the months leading up to her death, announced Thursday, she experienced one more in \u201cPretty Little Baby,\u201d which has become a viral hit on TikTok six decades after its release.",
      "As of Thursday, more than 22.5 million TikTok videos have been created using the sound, often partnering videos of baby animals, toddlers, makeup tutorials and retro fashions. According to TikTok, those videos have amassed more than 45.5 billion views, globally. Celebrities like Kylie Jenner, Kim Kardashian and North West have used it, too, with West lip-syncing along to the track.",
      "Hooky, feel-good pop songs tend to do well on TikTok, and 1962's \u201cPretty Little Baby\u201d is an exemplar of that phenomenon. Users gravitated toward the song's wholesome simplicity, sweet vocals, delicate organ and upstroke riffs. \u201cYou can ask the flowers / I sit for hours / Telling all the bluebirds / The bill and coo birds / Pretty little baby, I\u2019m so in love with you,\u201d Francis swoons on the verse that has picked up steam on the platform.",

A month later, that number had climbed to 2.4 million. That\u2019s a growth of over 7,000%. The song has earned over 29 million streams this year so far.",
      "In one popular video, which garnered over 56 million views, a user posted about baby teething hacks for first-time moms. Another user, Amari Goins, posted a video, with over 112 million views, of her 2-year-old daughter singing along to the lyrics, noting that her toddler picked up the song because of how often they heard it on TikTok.",
      "Most recently, TikTok users have begun posting covers of \u201cPretty Little Baby\u201d as part of a singing challenge, where they exaggerate Francis' performance with their own stylized vocal runs. Francis, who died at 87, herself joined TikTok as a result of her song's popularity, and her first two videos \u2014 which earned 16.3 million and 31.2 million views, respectively \u2014 furthered engagement. In her first video, posted in early June, she said she was \u201cflabbergasted and amazed\u201d at the song's resurgence.",
      "\u201cTo think that a song I recorded 63 years ago is captivating new generations of audiences is truly overwhelming for me,\u201d Francis said in that first post, which she followed with a clip of herself lip-syncing to the song.",
      "For decades, the song lived in relative obscurity \u2014 written by Don Stirling and Bill Nauman for Francis, it was never a single and was originally released in the U.K. as the B-side of her 1962 single \u201cI\u2019m Gonna Be Warm This Winter.\u201d It appears on her album \u201cConnie Francis Sings \u2018Second Hand Love,\u2019\u201d released the same year.

      "The U.S. is developing new safeguards for the organ transplant system after a government investigation found a Kentucky group continued preparations for donation by some patients who showed signs of life",
      "WASHINGTON -- The U.S. is developing new safeguards for the organ transplant system after a government investigation found a Kentucky group continued preparations for organ donation by some patients who showed signs of life, officials told Congress Tuesday.",
      "While the organ removals were canceled, near misses that some lawmakers called horrifying should never happen. A House subcommittee asked how to repair trust in the transplant network for potential organ donors and families -- some of whom have opted out of donor registries after these cases were publicized.",
      "\u201cWe have to get this right,\u201d said Rep. Brett Guthrie, a Kentucky Republican who chairs the Energy and Commerce Committee and whose mother died waiting for a liver transplant.",
      "\u201cHopefully people will walk away today knowing we need to address issues but still confident that they can give life,\u201d Guthrie said, adding that he will remain a registered organ donor.",
      "The hearing came after a federal investigation began last fall into allegations that a Kentucky donation group pressured a hospital in 2021 to proceed with plans to withdraw life support and retrieve organs from a man despite signs that he might be waking up from his drug overdose. That surgery never happened after a doctor noticed him moving and moaning while being transported to the operating room \u2014 and the man survived.",
      "Lawmakers stressed most organ donations proceed appropriately and save tens of thousands of lives a year. But the federal probe \u2013 concluded in March but only made public ahead of Tuesday\u2019s hearing -- cited a \u201cconcerning pattern of risk\u201d in dozens of other cases involving the Kentucky group's initial planning to recover someone's organs.",
      "The report said some should have been stopped or reassessed earlier, and mostly involved small or rural hospitals with less experience in caring for potential organ donors.",
      "The Kentucky organ procurement organization, or OPO, has made changes and the national transplant network is working on additional steps. But notably absent Tuesday was any testimony from hospitals \u2013 whose doctors must independently determine a patient is dead before donation groups are allowed to retrieve organs.",
      "Here's a look at how the nation's transplant system works.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration insists it hasn\u2019t wavered in its duty to protect the civil rights of America\u2019s children even as it dismantles the Education Department. Yet its own data shows the agency has resolved far fewer civil rights cases than in past years despite families filing more complaints.",
      "The Education Department\u2019s civil rights branch lost nearly half its staff amid mass layoffs in March, raising questions about its ability to address a deep backlog of complaints from students alleging discrimination based on disability, sex or race. Pressed on the issue in June, Education Secretary Linda McMahon denied a slowdown.",
      "\u201cNot only are we reducing the backlog, but we are keeping up with the current amount with a reduced staff because we are doing it efficiently,\u201d McMahon said at a Senate budget hearing.",
      "By several measures, however, the output of the Office for Civil Rights appears to have fallen sharply in comparison with previous years. A public database of the office\u2019s resolution agreements \u2014 cases in which schools or universities voluntarily agreed to address civil rights concerns \u2014 suggests the office\u2019s work has slowed.",
      "The database lists just 65 resolutions so far this year, on pace to fall far below previous years\u2019 totals. Last year the office logged 380 resolutions in total, following 561 in 2023. During President Donald Trump\u2019s first term, the office averaged more than 800 resolutions a year, including 1,300 during his first year in office.",
      "Other internal data obtained by The Associated Press show a similar trend. Since Trump took office, the total number of resolved cases is down about 40% from the same time frame last year \u2014 including cases that were dismissed, mediated or reached a voluntary resolution. Compared with last year, there also has been a 70% decrease in the number of cases resolved through resolution agreements or action taken by a school to comply with federal law, the internal data shows.",
      "Meanwhile, new complaints have increased 9%. The total number of cases has now climbed beyond 25,000.",
      "An Education Department spokesperson said the Trump administration is fixing a broken system.",
      "\u201cWhen staff levels were at their peak, OCR\u2019s processes still proved to be ineffective, as evidenced by the chronic backlog of tens of thousands of cases that left students\u2019 discrimination claims languishing over many presidential administrations,\u201d spokesperson Julie Hartman said.",
      "Parents and advocates say they\u2019ve noticed a difference.",
      "Adrienne Hazel filed a complaint in April after her 20-year-old son Ricky, who has autism, was placed in a public school program without a certified teacher and was not given an individual learning plan. Hazel, of Southfield, Michigan, has not heard from the federal office after receiving an automatic reply when she filed the complaint.",
      "Things moved faster last year when Hazel filed a separate complaint for her son. The office notified Ricky\u2019s school, which Hazel says spurred the district to reach an agreement with her within about three months. This time, she said, it feels like she\u2019s on her own.",
      "\u201cThere has been zero response to this,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s basically going into a babysitting situation. He\u2019s not getting the things that he needs to grow into independence. And he\u2019ll just be aging without getting an education.\u201d",
      "Marcie Lipsitt, a special education advocate in Michigan who worked with Hazel, said such stories are common. She helps families file complaints but warns it could take at least a year before an investigation opens. Some schools have backtracked on previous agreements, she said, yet parents can\u2019t get a response from the federal office.",

      "The fate of the Education Department itself is in question as the Trump administration moves ahead with a plan to wind down the agency. A Supreme Court decision Monday cleared the way for the agency to continue mass layoffs and outsource some functions to other agencies. McMahon previously suggested the civil rights work could be managed by the Justice Department.",
      "Still, McMahon said in June that the office was making headway after inheriting a backlog of 20,000 cases from the Biden administration. She told senators the office was catching up on the backlog and keeping up with new complaints.",
      "With half the staff, many question how that\u2019s possible. In a June court order pausing the termination of Office for Civil Rights employees, a federal judge in Boston said the branch is \u201ccurrently incapable of addressing the vast majority\u201d of complaints. More than 200 of the office\u2019s employees remain on leave while that case is decided.",
      "The Office for Civil Rights is responsible for enforcing civil rights laws across the nation\u2019s schools and is often a last resort for parents and students facing discrimination from schools. The office reviews complaints and, for those that meet certain criteria, opens investigations. Others are dismissed or move to a mediation process.",
      "Of the 65 resolution agreements reported this year, 57 were signed after Trump took office. Of those, the vast majority involve complaints of discrimination based on disability, with smaller numbers based on sex or race. Most of the sex discrimination findings deal with keeping transgender athletes out of women\u2019s sports, one of Trump\u2019s campaign promises.",
      "\"OCR will continue to meet its statutory responsibilities while driving to improve efficiency and resolve the longstanding backlog,\u201c Hartman said.",
      "Multiple workers in the office who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation said caseloads have grown too big to manage. In last year\u2019s budget request, the office said it was becoming difficult to keep up when investigative staff averaged 42 cases per person. Some estimates put the current caseload beyond 200.",

      "Another parent in Michigan, Casie Clouse, hasn\u2019t heard from the department since she filed a complaint in May.

Brady, 14, made no academic progress in eighth grade, and he\u2019s now heading to high school without the support he needs, his mother said.",

      "The removal of 21 children from the custody of a Los Angeles-area couple has put a spotlight on the practice of using surrogates to build a family. Surrogacy has no federal regulation, leaving it up to states to set the rules if they choose to allow it.",
      "The kids \u2014 15 at the couple's mansion and six more living elsewhere \u2014 were taken by an LA County child welfare agency in May after the parents were accused of failing to intervene in the abuse of a baby by a nanny, police in Arcadia said.",
      "The children range in age from 2 months to 13 years, with most between 1 and 3, police said. The FBI won\u2019t comment but agents are investigating. Silvia Zhang, 38, and Guojun Xuan, 65, have not responded to emails seeking comment.",
      "Police believe Zhang gave birth to one or two of the children while the rest were born by surrogate. Some women who were paid surrogates for the couple now say they were unaware that the couple was accumulating a supersize family, raising questions about their intentions.",
      "\u201cWhat were they going to do with these children?\u201d said Deborah Wald, a lawyer in San Francisco whose expertise includes surrogacy law.",
      "Surrogacy is an agreement between parties to have a woman become pregnant, typically through an embryo transfer, and deliver a baby. The intended parent or parents might struggle with infertility. They also could be same-sex couples.",
      "There\u2019s no limit on how many children someone can have through surrogates or any other method, said Wald, who is not involved in the Arcadia case.",
      "She acknowledged that California is considered a \u201csurrogacy-friendly state\" because it has clear laws around the process.",
      "Both sides are required to have lawyers, and there must be a written, notarized contract before an embryo transfer, Wald said.",
      "\u201cThe legitimate surrogacy community in California is very distressed when things like this happen,\u201d Wald said of surrogates feeling deceived. \u201dWe\u2019ve worked very hard on legal and ethical standards. It hurts everyone when something like this happens.\u201d",
      "There are businesses that act as matchmakers, connecting surrogates to people who want to have children. State business records show a company called Mark Surrogacy Investment LLC had been registered at the Arcadia address of Zhang and Xuan.",
      "It\u2019s not clear if Zhang and Xuan set up the business solely to find surrogates for themselves. State records show the company terminated its business license in June.",
      "Wald said there are no special licensing requirements in California for businesses that match surrogates with intended parents.",
      "Wald said there should have been plenty of checks and balances in the process, noting the role of fertility clinics in handling embryos.",

      "The Children\u2019s Law Center has worked with some families with 10 to 12 children, Heimov said. A family with 20 children or more is \u201cunusual,\" she added.",

      "Swollen legs led to President Donald Trump being diagnosed with what\u2019s called chronic venous insufficiency",
      "Swollen legs led to President Donald Trump being diagnosed with what's called chronic venous insufficiency. It's a fairly common condition among older adults but requires a thorough checkup to rule out more serious causes of swelling in the legs. Here are some things to know.",
      "Chronic venous insufficiency, or CVI, happens when veins in the legs can't properly carry blood back to the heart. That can lead to blood pooling in the lower legs. In addition to swelling, usually around the feet and ankles, symptoms can include legs that are achy, heavy feeling or tingly, and varicose veins. Severe cases could trigger leg sores known as ulcers.",
      "Overcoming gravity to pump blood from the feet all the way up to the heart is a challenge, especially when someone is standing or sitting for long periods. So legs veins are lined with one-way valves that keep blood from sliding backward on that journey. Anything that damages those valves can lead to chronic venous insufficiency. Risk factors can include blood clots, vein inflammation known as phlebitis or being overweight.",
      "Doctors must rule out serious causes of leg swelling, such as heart problems, kidney disease or blood clots. Ultrasound exams of the leg veins can help confirm chronic venous insufficiency. According to the Cleveland Clinic, treatment can include wearing compression stockings, elevating the legs and achieving a healthy weight. Also exercise, especially walking, is recommended \u2014 because strong leg muscles can squeeze veins in a way that helps them pump blood. Medications and medical procedures are available for more advanced cases.",

      "KYIV, Ukraine -- Ukrainian activists called for more protests Wednesday against a law they say weakens the country\u2019s anti-corruption bodies, following the first major demonstration against the country's government in more than three years of war. The legislation has also drawn rebukes from European Union officials and international rights groups.",
      "President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, under pressure as the change threatened to endanger his public support at a critical time in the war, convened the heads of Ukraine's key anti-corruption and security agencies Wednesday morning in a response to the outcry against his decision to approve the new law that was passed by Parliament.",

A detailed joint action plan is expected within two weeks, aimed at addressing institutional weaknesses, removing legal hurdles, and ensuring justice across the board, he said.",
      "Thousands of people gathered in the capital and other cities across Ukraine on Tuesday evening to urge Zelenskyy to veto the controversial bill. After Zelenskyy approved it, activists called on social media for another demonstration in the center of Kyiv at 8 p.m. Wednesday.",

      "Britain\u2019s Supreme Court has quashed the convictions of two financial market traders accused of manipulating benchmark interest rates in one of the biggest scandals to come out of the global financial crisis in 2008",
      "LONDON -- Britain\u2019s Supreme Court on Wednesday quashed the convictions of two financial market traders accused of manipulating benchmark interest rates in one of the biggest scandals to come out of the global financial crisis in 2008.",
      "The charges against Tom Hayes, a former Citigroup and UBS trader, and Carlo Palombo, who worked for Barclays, centered around alleged efforts to influence the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate, or Libor, and its euro currency equivalent Euribor, which were used to set the interest rates on trillions of dollars of loans and other financial products around the world.",
      "The court ruled that the convictions of Hayes and Palombo were unfair because the judges in their separate cases gave inaccurate instructions to jurors. That effectively prevented jurors from considering the key question of whether the traders had acted dishonestly.",
      "\u201cThat misdirection undermined the fairness of the trial,\u201d Judge George Leggatt wrote in an 82-page decision backed by all five members of the panel that heard the case.",
      "Hayes was convicted in August 2015 and sentenced to a maximum of 14 years in prison, which was later reduced to 11 years. Palombo, convicted in March 2019, was sentenced to four years in prison. Both men were released in 2021.",
      "\u201cIt destroyed my family, I missed most of my son\u2019s childhood,\u201d Hayes told the BBC.",
      "\u201cFor so long I\u2019ve been an international fugitive \u2026 and now I can move on with my life, or try to,\u201d he added.",
      "The decision came after the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeal in 2022 overturned the convictions of two traders charged with similar crimes in the United States. Hayes and Palombo, whose appeals were repeatedly rejected by British judges, were allowed to take their case to the U.K. Supreme Court after that ruling.",

      "Libor and Euribor were critical benchmarks that were once used to set the interest rates on everything from business loans to home mortgages and credit card debts. As a result, they also became central to more complex financial transactions such as those used by banks and businesses to bet on interest rate fluctuations.",
      "The benchmarks were vulnerable to manipulation because they were set by banks that could profit from swings in interest rates.",
      "Each day, major international banks were asked to submit the interest rate at which they could borrow money from other banks. An average of those submissions was then used to set the daily Libor and Euribor rates.",
      "During the financial crisis, regulators became aware that some banks were making artificially low Libor submissions to make their institutions seem more creditworthy. Some traders also sought to influence the submissions made by their banks as even small moves in the benchmark rates could boost their profits.",
      "Those risks became even more pronounced during the financial crisis, when lending dried up and bankers had to base their daily submissions on a subjective assessment of the market rather than actual loans.",
      "Libor and Euribor were phased out in recent years, in part because they were seen as worsening the financial crisis.",

      "A Syrian government investigation says sectarian violence along the coast earlier this year has left over 1,400 people dead, mostly civilians",
      "DAMASCUS, Syria -- More than 1,400 people, most of them civilians, were killed in several days of sectarian violence on Syria \u2019s coast earlier this year, a government committee tasked with investigating it said Tuesday.",
      "The violence was the first major incident to emerge after the ouster of longtime President Bashar Assad in December. It said there was no evidence that Syria's new military leaders ordered attacks on the Alawite community there, to which Assad belonged.",
      "Nearly 300 people suspected of committing crimes including murder, robbery, torture and looting and burning of homes and businesses were identified during the four-month investigation and referred for prosecution, and 37 people have been arrested, officials told journalists. They didn't say how many suspects were members of security forces.",
      "The committee's report came as Syria reels from a new round of sectarian violence in the south, which again has threatened to upend the country\u2019s fragile recovery from nearly 14 years of civil war.",
      "The violence on the coast began on March 6 when armed groups loyal to Assad attacked security forces of the new government, killing 238 of them, the committee said. In response, security forces descended on the coast from other areas of the country, joined by thousands of armed civilians. In total, some 200,000 armed men mobilized, the committee said.",
      "As they entered neighborhoods and villages, some \u2014 including members of military factions \u2014 committed \u201cwidespread, serious violations against civilians,\u201d committee spokesperson Yasser al-Farhan said. In some cases, armed men asked civilians whether they belonged to the Alawite sect and \u201ccommitted violations based on this,\u201d he said.",
      "The committee, however, found that the \u201csectarian motives were mostly based on revenge, not ideology,\u201d he said.",
      "Judge Jumaa al-Anzi, the committee\u2019s chair, said that \u201cwe have no evidence that the (military) leaders gave orders to commit violations.\u201d",
      "He also said investigators had not received reports of girls or women being kidnapped. Some rights groups, including a United Nations commission, have documented cases of Alawite women being kidnapped in the months since the violence.",
      "There also have been scattered reports of Alawites being killed, robbed and extorted since then. Tens of thousands of members of the minority sect have fled to neighboring Lebanon.",
      "Echoes of the coastal violence resonated in the new clashes in southern Sweida province over the past two weeks.",
      "Those clashes broke out between Sunni Muslim Bedouin clans and armed groups of the Druze religious minority, and government security forces who intervened to restore order ended up siding with the Bedouins. Members of the security forces allegedly killed Druze civilians and looted and burned homes. Druze armed groups launched revenge attacks on Bedouin communities.",
      "Hundreds have been killed, and the U.N. says more than 128,500 people have been displaced. The violence has largely stopped as a ceasefire takes told.",
      "The committee chair said the violence in Sweida is \u201cpainful for all Syrians\u201d but \u201cbeyond the jurisdiction\u201d of his committee.",
      "\u201cTime will reveal what happened and who is responsible for it,\u201d he said.",
      "The head of the Syrian Arab Red Crescent, Mohammed Hazem Baqleh, told The Associated Press on Tuesday that the situation in the city of Sweida was grim, particularly in the main hospital, where some 300 bodies piled up during the clashes. The city had been almost entirely cut off from supplies during the two-week fighting.",

      "Russia now often batters Ukraine with more drones in a single night than it did during some entire months in 2024, and analysts say the barrages are likely to escalate. On July 8, Russia unleashed more than 700 drones \u2014 a record.",
      "Some experts say that number could soon top 1,000 a day.",
      "The spike comes as U.S. President Donald Trump has given Russia until early September to reach a ceasefire or face new sanctions -\u2013 a timeframe Moscow is likely to use to inflict as much damage as possible on Ukraine.",
      "Russia has sharply increased its drone output and appears to keep ramping it up. Initially importing Shahed drones from Iran early in the 3 1/2-year-old war, Russia has boosted its domestic production and upgraded the original design.",

Ukraine\u2019s military intelligence estimates that Russia receives up to 65% of components for its Geran drones from China. Beijing rejects the claims.",
      "Russia initially launched its production of the Iranian drones at factory in Alabuga, located in Tatarstan. An Associated Press investigation found employees at the Alabuga plant included young African women who said they were duped into taking jobs there. Geran production later began at a plant in Udmurtia, west of the Ural Mountains. Ukraine has launched drone attacks on both factories but failed to derail production.",

But it was forced to cancel its press briefing in the face of strong protests by relatives of crash victims who were informed of the findings earlier in the day, according to government officials and bereaved families.",
      "\u201cIf they want to say their investigation was done in a reliable, independent manner, they should have come up with evidence that backs up their explanation,\u201d said Kim Yu-jin, head of an association of bereaved families. \u201cNone of us resent the pilots.\u201d",

      "\u201cThat\u2019s why the story is so exciting,\u201d Springer said. \u201cIt all happened around the same time.\u201d",
      "S. Blair Hedges, a professor at Temple University and director of its center for biology, was the first to identify the Barbados threadsnake. Previously, it was mistakenly lumped in with another species.",
      "In 2008, Hedges\u2019 discovery was published in a scientific journal, with the snake baptized Tetracheilostoma carlae, in honor of his wife.",
      "\u201cI spent days searching for them,\u201d Hedges recalled. \u201cBased on my observations and the hundreds of rocks, objects that I turned over looking for this thing without success, I do think it is a rare species.\u201d",
      "That was June 2006, and there were only three other such specimens known at the time: two at a London museum and a third at a museum collection in California that was wrongly identified as being from Antigua instead of Barbados, Hedges said.",
      "Hedges said that he didn\u2019t realize he had collected a new species until he did a genetic analysis.",
      "\u201cThe aha moment was in the laboratory,\u201d he said, noting that the discovery established the Barbados threadsnake as the world\u2019s smallest-known snake.",
      "Hedges then became inundated for years with letters, photographs and emails from people thinking they had found more Barbados threadsnakes. Some of the pictures were of earthworms, he recalled.",
      "\u201cIt was literally years of distraction,\u201d he said.",
      "Scientists hope the rediscovery means that the Barbados threadsnake could become a champion for the protection of wildlife habitat.",
      "A lot of endemic species on the tiny island have gone extinct, including the Barbados racer, the Barbados skink and a particular species of cave shrimp.",
      "\u201cI hope they can get some interest in protecting it,\u201d Hedges said. \u201cBarbados is kind of unique in the Caribbean for a bad reason: it has the least amount of original forest, outside of Haiti.\u201d",

      "Nonprofits in the Bronx are facing severe challenges as federal grant cuts disrupt essential services",
      "NEW YORK -- On a sweltering summer day, children leap between rocks along the Bronx River while cyclists pedal on newly paved paths. Kayaks rest on what was once an industrial dumping ground, now transformed into a bustling promenade along the city\u2019s only freshwater river.",
      "The Bronx River Greenway, a series of stitched-together waterfront parks built atop once largely abandoned and polluted wasteland, is a hard-fought victory for the country\u2019s poorest congressional district \u2014 one that locals call a \u201cbeacon of environmental justice\u201d built by federal dollars and water-pollution settlements from the borough\u2019s wealthier neighbors.",
      "Now, like thousands of nonprofits around the country, this organization\u2019s future is in jeopardy. The Trump administration\u2019s sweeping federal grant cuts have left nonprofits nationwide and the communities they serve in precarious straits. But few places face as stark a reckoning as the Bronx, where federal funding has proved indispensable for revitalizing green spaces, protecting survivors of domestic violence, and preventing youth violence.",
      "Over 84% of the 342 nonprofits based in the Bronx rely on federal grants now at risk, according to an analysis by the Urban Institute. It\u2019s a significant increase from the 70% of groups vulnerable to government defunding statewide.",
      "In all but two of the country\u2019s 437 congressional districts, the typical nonprofit could not cover its expenses without government grants. Nonprofits have increasingly served as contractors for government services \u2014 like operating homeless shelters \u2014 since the 1960s.",
      "In the Bronx, if such grants were to disappear entirely, the borough\u2019s nonprofits could face a collective deficit of nearly 30% \u2014 cuts that have begun to force layoffs and austerity on dozens of groups connecting Bronxites to low-cost health care, food assistance, and preschool slots.",
      "\u201cWhen America sneezes, the Bronx gets the flu,\u201d said U.S. Rep. Ritchie Torres, the Democrat who represents the district. \u201cI think we in the Bronx feel we have been and will continue to be the hardest hit by the impact of a Trump presidency.\u201d",
      "Nestled in a corner of parkland atop the site of an abandoned amusement park, the headquarters of the Bronx River Alliance is among the borough\u2019s greenest buildings, boasting nature classrooms, samples of the river\u2019s flora and fauna, and a storage space teeming with kayaks and canoes.",
      "In March, the group received formal notice that it would lose $1.5 million in federal grants promised under the Inflation Reduction Act last year for improving water quality and climate-resilience projects. After years of rising momentum, cubicles now sit empty. Leaders held off on hiring in anticipation of cuts, and now they don\u2019t know if they\u2019ll be able to fill those roles.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve met some of the folks who were pulling cars out of the river in the \u201970s and \u201980s,\u201d said Daniel Ranells, the group\u2019s deputy director of programs. Back then, the area was a \u201cdumping ground\u201d so inundated with industrial waste, tires, abandoned cars, ovens, and microwaves that \u201cfolks didn\u2019t really understand there was a river there.\u201d",
      "That has shifted dramatically in recent years thanks in part to decades of federal investment. Just south of its headquarters, the organization restored salt marshes along the riverbanks of a shuttered concrete plant.",
      "In 2007, the first beaver appeared on the Bronx River in over 200 years \u2014 named \u201cJos\u00e9 the Beaver\u201d in honor of former Congressman Jos\u00e9 E. Serrano, who helped direct millions in federal funds to groups dedicated to the river\u2019s restoration.",
      "\u201cThe Bronx River is a shining light of environmental justice,\u201d Ranells said, and millions in federal funding over the years has helped \u201cmake it a destination\u201d after years of neglect.",
      "Now staffers at the Bronx River Alliance describe a sense of \u201cwhiplash\u201d in seeing hard-fought funds dry up and grant language scrubbed of any allusions to racial or environmental justice.",
      "The Bronx River Alliance has joined other nonprofits in suing the Trump administration to unfreeze funds, but the uncertainty has already disrupted years of planning, a reality that has rippled across the neighborhood, leaving few organizations untouched.",
      "Up the street from the Alliance, the office of the Osborne Association, a group that has worked to prevent youth violence for nearly a century, has grown quieter. In April, an email from the Bureau of Justice Assistance stated the remaining $666,000 of a $2 million grant \u201cno longer effectuates department priorities.\u201d",

      "The cut thrust the nonprofit into \u201ctriage mode,\u201d said Osborne president Jonathan Monsalve, who was forced to lay off three staffers and reduce the number of participants in a diversion program offering young adults facing gun charges an alternative to jail time.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a lifeline for young people, and it\u2019s no longer there for 25 more of them,\u201d Monsalve said. \u201cWithout another alternative, it\u2019s 25 young people that will see prison or jail time, and that\u2019s incredibly frustrating.\u201d",
      "The Department of Justice has canceled over $810 million in similar grants to nonprofits working in violence prevention. The Environmental Protection Agency attempted to cancel $2 billion in grants for environmental justice work.",
      "Nonprofit leaders say the cuts hit hardest in the places that can afford them the least. In the Bronx, almost 30 percent of residents live in poverty, the vast majority of whom are Black or Latino, and nearly one in six schoolchildren experience homelessness every year.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve had decades of disinvestment in these communities, and we had been starting to see some meaningful investment and community-based solutions that were actually working,\u201d said Monsalve. \u201cAnd then all of a sudden that support just gets yanked away.\u201d",
      "The federal government, he said, is essentially telling these communities: \u201cYou aren\u2019t a priority anymore. You don\u2019t fit the plan.\u201d",
      "For decades, a million-dollar federal grant allowed the victim-service organization Safe Horizon to operate a program that stationed domestic violence advocates in the borough\u2019s criminal court.",
      "When the grant came up for renewal this year, it came with new restrictions that CEO Liz Roberts described as \u201cso extreme, so broad, so radical\u201d that the organization chose to walk away rather than accept conditions which would have prohibited supporting transgender survivors or treating domestic violence as a systemic issue.",
      "It was an agonizing decision given the volume of domestic violence in the Bronx, Roberts said.",
      "It means that hundreds of survivors \u201cmay not have the opportunity to talk to an advocate about their options, about their rights, or about their safety,\u201d she said.",
      "Roberts said she\u2019s bracing for more cuts \u2014 federal funds make up about 24% of the group\u2019s budget \u2014 that could force the closure of shelters or reductions to a citywide hotline.",
      "As nonprofits nationwide grapple with similar losses, Roberts said private philanthropy and local governments will need to \u201cmake some smart and thoughtful and principled decisions about where they can help to fill those gaps.\u201d",
      "In places like the Bronx, finding alternative funding is especially challenging. \u201cThe not-for-profit sector is often fragile, and nowhere more so than the Bronx,\u201d Torres said of the district he represents, where organizations tend to be more dependent on government funding than wealthier enclaves.",
      "\u201cOrganizations spent hundreds of thousands of dollars simply to apply for a contract and hired staff and made all these plans only to see the written contract disappear,\u201d Torres said. \u201cIt\u2019s deeply destabilizing.\u201d",

      "BANGKOK -- U.S. President Donald Trump has announced trade deals with Japan and a handful of other Asian countries that will relieve some pressure on companies and consumers from sharply higher tariffs on their exports to the United States.",
      "A deal with China is under negotiation, with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent saying an Aug. 12 deadline might be postponed again to allow more time for talks.",
      "Steep tariffs on U.S. imports of steel and aluminum remain, however, and many other countries, including South Korea and Thailand, have yet to clinch agreements. Overall, economists say the tariffs inevitably will dent growth in Asia and the world.",
      "Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba announced a deal Wednesday that will impose 15% tariffs on U.S. imports from Japan, down from Trump's proposed 25% \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs.",
      "It was a huge relief for automakers like Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda, whose shares jumped by double digits in Tokyo. Trump also announced trade deals with the Philippines and Indonesia. After meeting with Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos, Jr., Trump said the import tax on products from his country would be subject to a 19% tariff, down just 1% from the earlier threat of a 20% tariff.",
      "Indonesia also will face a 19% tariff, down from the 32% rate Trump had recently said would apply, and it committed to eliminating nearly all of its trade barriers for imports of American goods. Earlier, Trump announced that Vietnam's exports would face a 20% tariff, with double that rate for goods transshipped from China, though there has been no formal announcement.",
      "Negotiations with China are subject to an Aug. 12 deadline, but it's likely to be extended, Bessent told Fox Business on Tuesday. He said the two sides were due to hold another round of talks, this time in Sweden, early next week. Meanwhile, Trump said a trip to China may happen soon, hinting at efforts to stabilize U.S.-China trade relations.",
      "A preliminary agreement announced in June paved the way for China to lift some restrictions on its exports of rare earths, minerals critical for high technology and other manufacturing. In May, the U.S. agreed to drop Trump's 145% tariff rate on Chinese goods to 30% for 90 days, while China agreed to lower its 125% rate on U.S. goods to 10%. The reprieve allowed companies more time to rush to try to beat the potentially higher tariffs, giving a boost to Chinese exports and alleviating some of the pressure on its manufacturing sector. But prolonged uncertainty over what Trump might do has left companies wary about committing to further investment in China.",

Imports from Myanmar and Laos would be taxed at 40%, Cambodia and Thailand at 36%, Serbia and Bangladesh at 35%, South Africa and Bosnia and Herzegovina at 30% and Kazakhstan, Malaysia and Tunisia at 25%. Nearly every country has faced a minimum 10% levy on goods entering the U.S. since April, on top of other sectoral levies.",
      "Even after Trump has pulled back from the harshest of his threatened tariffs, the onslaught of uncertainty and higher costs for both manufacturers and consumers has raised risks for the regional and global economy.

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump announced a trade framework with Japan on Tuesday, placing a 15% tax on goods imported from that nation.",
      "\u201cThis Deal will create Hundreds of Thousands of Jobs \u2014 There has never been anything like it,\u201d Trump posted on Truth Social, adding that the United States \u201cwill continue to always have a great relationship with the Country of Japan.\u201d",
      "The president said Japan would invest \u201cat my direction\u201d $550 billion into the U.S. and would \u201copen\u201d its economy to American autos and rice. The 15% tax on imported Japanese goods is a meaningful drop from the 25% rate that Trump, in a recent letter to Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, said would be levied starting Aug. 1.",
      "Early Wednesday, Ishiba acknowledged the new trade agreement, saying it would benefit both sides and help them work together.",
      "With the announcement, Trump is seeking to tout his ability as a dealmaker \u2014 even as his tariffs, when initially announced in early April led to a market panic and fears of slower growth that for the moment appear to have subsided. Key details remained unclear from his post, such as whether Japanese-built autos would face a higher 25% tariff that Trump imposed on the sector.",
      "But the framework fits a growing pattern for Trump, who is eager to portray the tariffs as win for the U.S. His administration says the revenues will help reduce the budget deficit and more factories will relocate to America to avoid the import taxes and cause trade imbalances to disappear.",
      "The wave of tariffs continues to be a source of uncertainty about whether it could lead to higher prices for consumers and businesses if companies simply pass along the costs. The problem was seen sharply Tuesday after General Motors reported a 35% drop in its net income during the second quarter as it warned that tariffs would hit its business in the months ahead, causing its stock to tumble.",
      "As the Aug. 1 deadline for the tariff rates in his letters to world leaders is approaching, Trump also announced a trade framework with the Philippines that would impose a tariff of 19% on its goods, while American-made products would face no import taxes. The president also reaffirmed his 19% tariffs on Indonesia.",
      "The U.S. ran a $69.4 billion trade imbalance on goods with Japan last year, according to the Census Bureau.",
      "America had a trade imbalance of $17.9 billion with Indonesia and an imbalance of $4.9 billion with the Philippines. Both nations are less affluent than the U.S. and an imbalance means America imports more from those countries than it exports to them.",
      "The president is set to impose the broad tariffs listed in his recent letters to other world leaders on Aug. 1, raising questions of whether there will be any breakthrough in talks with the European Union. At a Tuesday dinner, Trump said the EU would be in Washington on Wednesday for trade talks.",

      "Nonprofits in McDowell County, West Virginia, face severe challenges due to federal funding cuts",
      "For nonprofits in McDowell County, West Virginia, the federal cuts in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act threaten a lifeline.",
      "Many of McDowell\u2019s 17,000 residents rely on federal programs and the nonprofits they fund to get by. The county\u2019s tax base and population have significantly declined since 1950, when McDowell was the top coal-producing county in the nation and had about 100,000 residents.",
      "Now, more than half the children in the county receive federal Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program benefits, and about one-third of seniors are on Medicaid, the federal health insurance program for the poor. Decades after the Kennedy administration made the county a first test of food stamps, nearly half the county\u2019s residents receive supplemental nutrition assistance, or SNAP, the Food Stamp Program\u2019s successor.",
      "The strains created by new eligibility restrictions on SNAP as a result of the passage of President Trump\u2019s domestic policy bill will be especially dire in places like McDowell County, where more than one-third of the population lives below the federal poverty line, said Rosemary Ketchum, executive director of the West Virginia Nonprofit Association.",
      "\u201cThese federal cuts are starving people,\u201d she said.",
      "Since the interruption in federal support tied to President Trump\u2019s January executive orders barring grants related to \u201cgender ideology\u201d; diversity, equity, and inclusion; and environmental justice, Ketchum said many of the 9,000 or so nonprofits in her state have laid off staff. Others, she said, are dipping into whatever reserves they have to pay their employees.",
      "Those reserves are slim, if they exist at all. Taken together, the seven nonprofits that receive federal grants in McDowell County run on a 3 percent operating margin, according to data tabulated by the Urban Institute\u2019s National Center for Charitable Statistics. If all federal support disappeared, the center found, all the county\u2019s nonprofits would be at risk of going under unless other funding was provided.",
      "In a poor state like West Virginia, which is already facing a budget deficit and lacks the legions of philanthropic donors who got rich on Wall Street or in Silicon Valley, nonprofits don\u2019t have a plan B, said Kathy Gentry, executive director of Safe Housing and Economic Development, or SHED, a McDowell nonprofit housing provider.",
      "The nonprofit\u2019s clients, many of whom are elderly or disabled, rely on U.S. Housing and Urban Development support to cover the rent at the 94 housing units SHED manages.",
      "Gentry\u2019s pay was temporarily cut for six weeks this spring because part of her salary comes from a HUD capacity-building grant that the administration deemed at cross-purposes with Trump\u2019s anti-DEI policy agenda. Her full paycheck resumed, but Gentry worries further cuts will force her to lay off staff.",
      "Already the nonprofit operates at a loss. In its 2023 tax filing, the most recent available, SHED\u2019s $663,000 in expenses outstripped its revenue by nearly $200,000.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re in a quandary here \u2014 all nonprofits are,\u201d Gentry said. \u201cAre we going to exist? Will we have to dissolve?\u201d",
      "Since 2015, Heidi Binko and her team at the Just Transition Fund have worked with economic development agencies and nonprofits in areas where the coal industry once flourished. That can mean helping a local organization identify or write a grant or provide a matching grant.",
      "The fund was created by the Rockefeller Family Foundation and Appalachian Funders Network to help coal towns capture some of the dollars provided in the 2015 Clean Power Plan, or POWER Act, passed during the Obama administration. Since then, the fund says it has helped coal communities in West Virginia and throughout the nation secure more than $2 billion in federal grants.",
      "Binko hopes the fund can continue to attract federal resources to towns with high poverty rates.",

As a result, Binko fears recent progress will be dimmed.",
      "For instance, Generation West Virginia, a Just Transition Fund grantee worked with McDowell County to apply for funds from the Biden administration\u2019s Digital Equity Act to run an elementary and middle school digital literacy program. Programs under the act were terminated in May.",
      "The cancellation of the Digital Equity Act is a setback for McDowell, where 20 percent of households don\u2019t have a broadband internet connection, according to a Generation West Virginia report.",
      "Other, more basic infrastructure is lacking in the county. According to DigDeep, a nonprofit that assists with clean water access and wastewater systems and is primarily funded by private institutions, corporate partners and grassroots donations, there may be hundreds of people in the county without a dependable water supply. The exact number is unknown because information on whether existing water systems provide safe drinking water is not gathered by the U.S. Census.",
      "DigDeep works with the McDowell Public Service District utility provider to identify residents who need a water hookup and helps secure grants from the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s rural development program to extend water trunk lines to hard-to-reach areas. In some cases, the nonprofit helps pay to connect the federally supported water lines directly to people\u2019s homes. It is also helping to install wastewater treatment facilities to more than 400 residents who either have inadequate systems or flush waste into nearby creeks.",
      "The water supply throughout the county is unreliable because of the area\u2019s close historical ties to the rise and fall of the coal economy, said George McGraw, DigDeep\u2019s chief executive.",
      "When coal operations came to McDowell, businesses operated in a \u201cclosed loop\u201d environment. Coal companies paid workers to build and work in the mines, they owned the houses where miners lived, and they built the water lines that served those houses, McGraw said.",
      "When the coal industry began to peter out, companies exited the county, leaving behind an aging system of pipes and drains.",
      "To secure water in the county today, hundreds of people fill plastic jugs from roadside springs or mine shafts, McGraw said. To get drinking water, they may use the bathroom in a store, a neighbor\u2019s house, or a school.",
      "DigDeep has several projects in the planning stages in McDowell. But the Trump USDA budget proposal would chop the rural water program by two-thirds, meaning some public works projects may never get completed. Someone else will have to foot the bill or the system will continue to crumble, leaving many people in McDowell County without a basic necessity.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not like the burden goes away,\u201d McGraw said. \u201cThe burden just shifts, and utilities are forced to raise rates on customers, many of whom are below the poverty line.\u201d",

      "\u201cGovernment moves slowly usually, and I think what was so disorienting early on was government was moving really fast,\u201d she said.",
      "In the early days of his second term, President Donald Trump froze, cut or threatened to cut a huge range of social services programs from public safety to early childhood education to food assistance and services for refugee resettlement. Staffing cuts to federal agencies have also contributed to delays and uncertainty around future grant funds. Altogether, his policies are poised to upend decades of partnerships the federal government has built with nonprofits to help people in their communities.",
      "This vast and interconnected set of programs funded by taxpayers has been significantly dismantled in just months, nonprofit leaders, researchers and funders say. And even deeper, permanent cuts are still possible. That uncertainty is also taking a toll on their staff and communities, the leaders said.",
      "In response to questions about the cuts to grant funding, White House spokesperson Kush Desai said, \u201cInstead of government largesse that\u2019s often riddled with corruption, waste, fraud, and abuse, the Trump administration is focused on unleashing America\u2019s economic resurgence to fuel Americans\u2019 individual generosity.\u201d",
      "He pointed to a new deduction for charitable giving included in the recently passed tax and spending law that he said encourages Americans\u2019 \u201cinnate altruism.\u201d",
      "But experts say private donations will not be enough to meet the needs.",
      "In 2021, $267 billion was granted to nonprofits from all levels of government, according to an analysis by the Urban Institute published in February. While the data includes tax-exempt organizations like local food pantries as well as universities and nonprofit hospitals, it underestimates the total funding that nonprofits receive from the government. It includes grants, but not contracts for services nor reimbursements from programs like Medicare. It also excludes the smallest nonprofits, which file a different, abbreviated tax form.",
      "However, the figure does give a sense of the scale of the historic \u2014 and, until now, solid \u2014 relationship between the public sector and nonprofits over the last 50 years. Now, this system is at risk and leaders like Price say the cost of undoing it will be \u201ccatastrophic.\u201d",
      "The Urban Institute\u2019s analysis shows more than half of nonprofits in every state received government grants in 2021.",
      "In the vast majority of the country, the typical nonprofit would run a deficit without government funding. Only in two Congressional districts \u2014 one including parts of Orange County, California, and another in the suburbs west of Atlanta \u2014 would a typical nonprofit not be in the red if they lost all of their public grant funding, the analysis found.",
      "But in Orange County, famous for its stunning beaches, mansions and extraordinary wealth, funders, nonprofits and researchers said that finding surprised them. In part, that's because of major economic inequalities in the county and its high cost of living.",
      "Taryn Palumbo, executive director of Orange County Grantmakers, said nonprofits are not as optimistic about their resiliency.",
      "\u201cThey are seeing their budgets getting slashed by 50% or 40%,\u201d she said. \u201cOr they\u2019re having to look to restructure programs that they are running or how they\u2019re serving or the number of people that they\u2019re serving.\u201d",
      "Last year, the local Samueli Foundation commissioned a study of nonprofit needs in part because they were significantly increasing their grantmaking from $18.8 million in 2022 to an estimated $125 million in 2025. They found local nonprofits reported problems maintaining staff, a deep lack of investment in their operations and a dearth of flexible reserve funds.",

      "The foundation responded by opening applications for both unrestricted grants and to support investments in buildings or land. Against this $10 million in potential awards, they received 1,242 applications for more than $250 million, said Lindsey Spindle, the foundation\u2019s president.",
      "\u201cIt tells a really stark picture of how unbelievably deep and broad the need is,\u201d Spindle said. \u201cThere is not a single part of the nonprofit sector that has not responded to these funds. Every topic you can think of: poverty, animal welfare, arts and culture, civil rights, domestic abuse... They\u2019re telling us loud and clear that they are struggling to stay alive.\u201d",
      "One of the founding stories of the United States is the importance of the voluntary sector, of neighbors helping neighbors and of individuals solving social problems. While other liberal democracies built strong welfare states, the U.S. has preferred to look to the charitable sector to provide a substantial part of social services.",
      "Since the 1960s, the federal government has largely funded those social services by giving money to nonprofits, universities, hospitals and companies. Several new policies converged at that time to create this system, including the expansion of the federal income tax during World War II and the codification of tax-exempt charitable organizations in 1954. Then, the Kennedy and Johnson administrations started to fund nonprofits directly with federal money as part of urban renewal and Great Society programs.",
      "\u201cIt was a key approach of midcentury liberalism of addressing issues of poverty, sort of making a reference to civil rights and racial inequality, but not growing the size of government,\u201d said Claire Dunning, an assistant professor of public policy at the University of Maryland, College Park. Conservatives also tended to support working through local, private, nonprofit organizations, though for different reasons than liberals, she said.",
      "With various expansions and cuts during different presidencies, the federal government has continued to fund nonprofits at significant levels, essentially hiding the government in plain sight, Dunning said. The size and importance of the nonprofit apparatus became suddenly visible in January when the Trump administration sought to freeze federal grants and loans.",
      "Dunning said the speed, hostility and scale of the proposed cuts broke with the long legacy of bipartisan support for nonprofits.",
      "\u201cPeople had no idea that the public health information or services they are receiving, their Meals on Wheels program, their afterschool tutoring program, the local park cleanup were actually enabled by public government dollars,\u201d she said.",
      "A coalition of nonprofits challenged the freeze in court in a case that is ongoing, but in the six months since, the administration has cut, paused or discontinued a vast array of programs and grants. The impacts of some of those policy changes have been felt immediately, but many will not hit the ground until current grant funding runs out, which could be in months or years depending on the programs.",
      "Friendship Shelter in Laguna Beach has an annual budget of about $15 million, $11.5 million of which comes from government sources. Price said the government funding is \u201cbraided\u201d in complex ways to house and support 330 people. They've already lost a rental reimbursement grant from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. But the Samueli Foundation stepped in to backfill those lost funds for three years.",
      "That kind of support is extremely unusual, she said.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t know of any large-scale private philanthropy response to keeping people housed because it\u2019s a forever commitment,\u201d Price said. \u201cThat person is in housing and is going to need the subsidy for the rest of their lives. These are seriously disabled people with multiple issues that they\u2019re facing that they need help with.\u201d",
      "She also believes that even in a wealthy place like Orange County, private donors are not prepared to give five, six or eight times as much as they do currently. Donors already subsidize their government grants, which she said pay for 69% of the actual program costs.",
      "\u201cWe are providing this service to our government at a loss, at a business loss, and then making up that loss with these Medicaid dollars and also the private fundraising,\u201d she said.",
      "She said her organization has discussed having to put people out of housing back on to the streets if the government funding is cut further.",
      "\u201cThat would be, I think, a signal to me that something is deeply, deeply wrong with how we\u2019re looking at these issues,\u201d said Price, adding, \u201cIf I was placing a bet, I would bet that we have enough good still in government to prevent that.\u201d",

      "When the KissCam at a Coldplay concert last week landed on a couple who suspiciously escaped their embrace and tried (but failed) to duck out of the spotlight, the internet immediately got to work",
      "NEW YORK -- When the \u201cKissCam\u201d at a Coldplay concert landed on a couple who tried (but failed) to duck out of the spotlight, the internet immediately got to work.",
      "In hours, the clip was just about everywhere. Endless memes, parody videos and photos of the pair's shocked faces filled social media feeds. Online sleuths rushed to identify who was on camera. Artificial intelligence and software company Astronomer eventually confirmed that its CEO and chief people officer were in fact the couple in the video \u2014 and announced the CEO's resignation over the weekend.",
      "The incident's fallout has, of course, generated conversations about business ethics, corporate accountability and the repercussions that conflicts of interest among leadership can cause. But there are also broader implications at play in our increasingly online world \u2014 about the state of potentially being visible everywhere you go or tracked through \u201csocial media surveillance.\" Experts say it's more and more common for moments that may have been intended to be private, or at least reserved to a single physical venue, to make their way online and even go global today.",
      "So in the era of lightning-fast social sharing and when cameras are practically inescapable, does being in public hold any expectation of privacy anymore? Is every experience simply fodder for the world to see?",
      "It's no secret that cameras are filming much of our lives these days.",
      "From CCTV security systems to Ring doorbells, businesses, schools and neighborhoods use ample video surveillance around the clock. Sporting and concert venues have also filmed fans for years, often projecting playful bits of audience participation to the rest of the crowd. In short, the on-scene viewer becomes part of the product \u2014 and the center of attention.",
      "And of course, consumers can record just about anything if they have a smartphone in their pocket \u2014 and, if it's enticing to other social media users, that footage can quickly spread through cyberspace.",
      "Ellis Cashmore, author of the book \u201cCelebrity Culture,\u201d proposes that the rapid fame of last week\u2019s KissCam moment probably answers a question many have been asking for years: \u201cIs the private life still what it was? And the answer is, of course, there\u2019s no such thing as the private life anymore,\u201d he notes. \u201cCertainly not in the traditional sense of the term.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not sure that we can assume privacy at a concert with hundreds of other people,\u201d adds Mary Angela Bock, an associate professor in the University of Texas at Austin\u2019s School of Journalism and Media. \u201cWe can\u2019t assume privacy on the street anymore.\u201d",
      "Some version of the KissCam has long been a staple at big events \u2014 from timeouts during sports games to romantic songs played by artists at their concerts. It\u2019s easy to miss, but most venues have signs to inform the audience that they could be filmed during the event. What\u2019s been different in more recent years, experts note, is how quickly those moments can travel beyond the physical space where they actually unfold.",
      "That isn\u2019t only limited to what shows up on a jumbotron. Sometimes it only takes one person in the crowd to capture any interaction on their phone and post the video online \u2014 where it can zip around the world.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not just the camera,\" Bock says. \u201cIt\u2019s the distribution system that is wild and new.\u201d",

The LinkedIn pages belonging both to Astronomer\u2019s now-former CEO and chief people officer remained disabled on Monday, and The Associated Press could not reach either for comment.",
      "But it isn't limited to company executives. Beyond someone simply spotting a familiar face and spreading the word, technological advances \u2014 including AI \u2014 have made it easier and faster overall to find just about anyone in an online post. This can happen with videos and photos shared on social media each day, even if it doesn't go viral, experts warn.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit unsettling how easily we can be identified with biometrics, how our faces are online, how social media can track us \u2014 and how the internet has gone from being a place of interaction, to a gigantic surveillance system,\" Bock says. \u201cWhen you think about it, we are being surveilled by our social media. They\u2019re tracking us in exchange for entertaining us.\u201d",
      "And of course, such moments can also impact people who were not actually on camera. As easy as it can be to be identified online today, the internet is notorious for cutting a broad swath or not always getting it right. That sometimes produces harassment of individuals not actually involved.",
      "At last week's Coldplay concert, for example, many social media users speculated that a third person seen near the two caught on camera was another Astronomer employee \u2014 leading to swarms of posts targeting her. But the company later confirmed that she was not at the event and said no other employees were in the video circulating online.",

Still, it\u2019s a \u201cvery frightening thing to get a lot of abuse and harassment online,\u201d Taylor notes. \u201cThere are real human beings behind this.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s hard to think that that these kind of viral moments will ever go away \u2014 and there are few legal restrictions to stop users from sharing clips of interactions recorded from anything from a concert to the street widely online. But on an individual level, Bock says it can be helpful to \u201cthink before you share\u201d and question whether something\u2019s really accurate.",
      "\u201cSocial media has changed so much,\u201d Bock says. \u201cBut we really have not, as a society, caught up with the technology in terms of our ethics and our etiquette.\u201d",

      "It all stems from Trump's decision in February to keep AP journalists out of the Oval Office, Air Force One and other events too small for a full press corps, in retaliation for the news outlet's decision not to follow his lead in changing the Gulf of Mexico's name.",
      "The AP sued in response. In April, a district court ruled that the administration could not exclude journalists based on their opinions. The Trump administration immediately turned to the U.S. Court of Appeals to successfully delay implementation of the ruling before the court could consider the full merits of the case.",
      "Next up: This fall, the appeals court considers those full merits.",
      "\u201cWe are disappointed by today's procedural decision but remain focused on the strong district court opinion in support of free speech as we have our case heard,\u201d said Patrick Maks, an AP spokesman. \u201cAs we've said throughout, the press and the public have a fundamental right to speak freely without government retaliation.\u201d",

      "An electrical engineer in rural Vermont is reviving old pay phones to give people a free option for making calls in areas where cell service is unreliable or nonexistent",
      "TUNBRIDGE, Vt. -- An electrical engineer by trade, Patrick Schlott has spent countless hours tinkering with new and old technology. But it wasn\u2019t until he found himself living in rural Vermont that he realized his penchant for repairing old pay phones could provide a public service.",
      "\u201cI realized, wow, there\u2019s no cell service for 10 miles (16 kilometers) in either direction,\u201d he said. \u201cThe community could really benefit from something like this.\u201d",
      "Schlott, a full-time engineer at electric airplane manufacturing company BETA Technologies, decided to approach the owners of his local general store with the idea to install old pay phones around town and make them free for public use. After he explained that there would be no cost to the host, North Tunbridge General Store owners Mike and Lois Gross let Schlott install his first phone outside the store.",
      "\u201cEveryone\u2019s pretty surprised, and they\u2019re like, \u2018Is that a real payphone? Does that really work?\u2019 And I\u2019m like, \u2018Yeah, but it doesn\u2019t cost any money now,\u2019\" said store owner Mike Gross. \"We\u2019ve had people use it that broke down. It\u2019s a great thing because service is so spotty in Vermont.\u201d",
      "The first free public phone installation was Schlott\u2019s idea, but he says the two other locations, the Latham Library in Thetford and inside an informational booth in Randolph off Interstate 89, came from community members requesting the service.",
      "\u201cAll the other phones so far have been people reaching out, which is pretty cool,\u201d he said.",
      "Schlott buys the old pay phones, which can range in cost from $100-$500, at flea markets, from internet listings or at auction and fixes them up in his basement workshop. All that\u2019s needed to install one of his phones is an internet connection \u2014 no coins necessary.",
      "\u201cBasically, there\u2019s a small piece of equipment that converts an internet telephone line to an analog line that these phones can operate off of,\u201d he said.",

If a user dials zero, the phone will ring Schlott's personal cellphone, though he uses an app to keep his number private.",
      "So far, the phone at the Latham Library location has seen the most use. According to Schlott, 370 calls have been made since the phone was installed five months ago, filling a need for students without cellphones to call their parents for after-school pickups.",
      "Hannah McClain is a regular at the North Tunbridge General Store and says she finds comfort in knowing the phone is there whenever her 16-year-old daughters might need it.",
      "\u201cIt does make me feel safer if the kids are out and about, that if they had an emergency up this way that they could stop and use this. I think these are a great service,\u201d she said.",
      "Schlott is seeing increased interest in the service, with another free phone install in the works at the Brownell Library in Essex. For now, he plans to continue covering the costs associated with each phone, but noted that may change as the project scales.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s cool to see something retro that has that old-school appeal but also works. To actually hear it ring, to pick it up and have a dial tone, I think there\u2019s real power in that,\" he said. \"And I don\u2019t think they should end up in a landfill. They should be recycled and put to good use.\u201d",

      "TOKYO -- Japan's far-right populist Sanseito party was one of the biggest winners in the weekend's upper house election, attracting many voters with its \u201cJapanese First\" platform that included calling for tougher restrictions on foreigners and the curtailment of gender equality and diversity policies.",
      "Sanseito added 14 seats in Sunday\u2019s vote to the one seat already held by its leader in the 248-member upper house, the less powerful of Japan's two-chamber parliament.",

      "Kamiya said he is open to cooperating with other emerging parties, but he's expected to wait in the hopes of gaining more seats in the more powerful lower house. His ambition is to have more influence to possibly form a multiparty coalition like those in Europe.",
      "Sanseito, which translates to \u201cParticipate in Politics,\u201d started in 2020 when Kamiya gathered people on YouTube and social media to create a political group to attract voters discontent with conventional parties.",
      "The group began to grow as its members started winning seats in local assemblies, stepping up its presence and grassroots support base.",
      "After the start of the coronavirus pandemic, his online approach quickly got traction, fueled partly by an anti-vaccine stance.",
      "Sanseito achieved a foothold in national politics in 2022 when Kamiya won a six-year term in the upper house. The party won three seats in the October election in the lower house.",
      "The party holds 15 seats in the upper house, compared with the 122 held by Ishiba's governing coalition, but Kamiya has been steadily reaching a much larger audience.",

      "The 15-year-old asks ChatGPT for guidance on back-to-school shopping, makeup colors, low-calorie choices at Smoothie King, plus ideas for her Sweet 16 and her younger sister\u2019s birthday party.",
      "The sophomore honors student makes a point not to have chatbots do her homework and tries to limit her interactions to mundane questions. But in interviews with The Associated Press and a new study, teenagers say they are increasingly interacting with AI as if it were a companion, capable of providing advice and friendship.",

But artificial intelligence is playing a much larger role in many of their lives. AI, teens say, has become a go-to source for personal advice, emotional support, everyday decision-making and problem-solving.",
      "More than 70% of teens have used AI companions and half use them regularly, according to a new study from Common Sense Media, a group that studies and advocates for using screens and digital media sensibly.",
      "The study defines AI companions as platforms designed to serve as \u201cdigital friends,\u201d like Character.AI or Replika, which can be customized with specific traits or personalities and can offer emotional support, companionship and conversations that can feel human-like. But popular sites like ChatGPT and Claude, which mainly answer questions, are being used in the same way, the researchers say.",

      "In the Common Sense Media survey, 31% of teens said their conversations with AI companions were \u201cas satisfying or more satisfying\u201d than talking with real friends. Even though half of teens said they distrust AI's advice, 33% had discussed serious or important issues with AI instead of real people.",
      "Those findings are worrisome, says Michael Robb, the study\u2019s lead author and head researcher at Common Sense, and should send a warning to parents, teachers and policymakers. The now-booming and largely unregulated AI industry is becoming as integrated with adolescence as smartphones and social media are.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 James Gunn\u2019s \u201cSuperman\u201d showed staying power in its second weekend at North American box offices, collecting $57.3 million in ticket sales and remaining the No. 1 movie in cinemas, according to studio estimates Sunday.",

      "In two weeks, \u201cSuperman\u201d has grossed $406.8 million worldwide, a good start for the movie DC Studios is banking on to restart its movie operations. A big test looms next weekend, when the Walt Disney Co. releases Marvel's \u201cThe Fantastic Four: First Steps.\u201d",

For Warner Bros. and DC Studios, \u201cSuperman\u201d is key to kicking off a 10-year plan for the comic book adaptation studio. Co-heads Gunn and Peter Safra were tasked with rehabilitating the flagging operation. Next on tap are the films \u201cSupergirl\u201d and \u201cClayface\u201d in 2026.",
      "But \u201cSuperman\u201d is far from flying solo in theaters right now.

      "The movie's reviews (38% \u201cfresh\u201d on Rotten Tomatoes) were poor for \u201cI Know What You Did Last Summer\u201d and audiences graded it similarly. The film notched a \u201cC+\u201d on CinemaScore. The original collected $72.6 million in its domestic run in 1997.",
      "Paramount Pictures\u2019 \u201cSmurfs\u201d debuted in fourth place this weekend with $11 million. The latest big-screen reboot for the woodland blue creatures prominently features Rihanna as the voice of Smurfette. But reviews (21% \u201cfresh\u201d on Rotten Tomatoes) were terrible. Audiences were kinder, giving it a \u201cB+\u201d on CinemaScore, but the $58 million-budgeted release will depend largely on its international sales. In 56 overseas markets, \u201cSmurfs\u201d earned $22.6 million.",
      "Ari Aster\u2019s \u201cEddington\u201d opened with $4.2 million on 2,111 screens for A24. Since its premiere at the Cannes Film Festival, \u201cEddington\u201d has been particularly divisive. The pandemic-set Western features Joaquin Phoenix as the right-wing sheriff of a small New Mexico town who faces off with its liberal mayor (Pedro Pascal).",

His 2023 film \u201cBeau Is Afraid\u201d cost $35 million to make but collected just $12.4 million worldwide. \u201cEddington\u201d cost about $25 million to produce. Audiences gave it a \u201cC+\u201d on CinemaScore. None of Aster\u2019s previous films have been graded higher.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 \u201cHappy Gilmore\u201d was born on the range.",
      "When Adam Sandler was a kid growing up in New Hampshire, his father was an avid golfer. He\u2019d often take his son along to hit balls at the driving range. But Sandler was uninterested in the sport, and usually got antsy.",
      "\u201cWhy don\u2019t you bring a friend?\u201d his dad told him. So Sandler took his buddy, Kyle McDonough, a star hockey player who\u2019d later turn professional.",
      "\u201cHe never played before but he was cracking the ball so far,\u201d Sandler recalls. \u201cSo when I started becoming a comedian and me and (Tim) Herlihy were writing stuff and stand-up and talking about movies, I started thinking about a guy who could hit it really big and had a hockey player mentality.\u201d",
      "\u201cHappy Gilmore,\u201d released in 1996, was Sander and Herlihy\u2019s second movie, following \u201cBilly Madison.\u201d Sandler was just exiting \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d Herlihy was Sandler\u2019s roommate at New York University and became a lawyer before Sandler got him to stick to writing comedy. (You might remember the \u201cHerlihy Boy\u201d sketch.)",
      "\u201cWe had just done our first movie, \u2018Billy Madison,\u2019 and we put every idea we ever had for a movie in that movie,\u201d says Herlihy. \u201cSo when they said we could do another movie, it was like, \u2018What are we going to do this movie about?\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cHappy Gilmore,\u201d released in February 1996, became one of the most beloved comedies of the \u201990s and codified the hockey-style swing as a mainstay on golf courses. \u201cA hop, skip and a hit,\u201d as Sandler says. The movie also made comic heroes of Bob Barker, Christopher McDonald and Carl Weathers, and made lines like \u201cAre you too good for your home?\u201d plausible things to ask golf balls.",
      "Like most cult comedies, \u201cHappy Gilmore\u201d didn\u2019t start out an obvious instant classic, though. \u201cA one-joke \u2018Caddyshack\u2019 for the blitzed and jaded,\u201d wrote EW. \u201cTo describe Happy\u2019s antics as boorish is putting it mildly,\u201d wrote The New York Times. \u201c\u2018Happy Gilmore\u2019 tells the story of a violent sociopath,\u201d wrote Roger Ebert. He called it \u201cthe latest in the dumber and dumbest sweepstakes.\u201d",
      "\u201cHappy Gilmore\u201d was a box-office success, grossing $39 million in the U.S. and Canada. And through worn-out DVDs and regular TV reruns, it became a favorite to generations of golfers and a staple of goofy \u201990s comedy.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t even tell you how many times I\u2019ve seen that movie,\u201d says the actor-filmmaker Benny Safdie, who co-directed Sandler in \u201cUncut Gems.\u201d \u201cIt was on an endless loop. I had the DVD and I just kept watching it. I can close my eyes and see the movie end to end. It\u2019s one of my favorite movies.\u201d",
      "Now, nearly three decades later, and after years of batting away pleas for a sequel, Sandler has finally put Happy\u2019s Bruins jersey back on. \u201cHappy Gilmore 2,\u201d which Netflix will debut Friday, is arguably the most anticipated streaming release of the summer.",
      "Sandler was well aware of the checkered history of comedy sequels. Movies like \u201cZoolander 2\u201d and \u201cAnchorman 2\u201d have struggled to recapture the freewheeling spirit of the originals.

Safdie co-stars as the founder of Maxi Golf, a new circus-like tour with long hitters.",
      "\u201cWe thought it could be fun to write something like that\u201d says Sandler. \u201cIt kind of connected to our lives and this age, and wanting to make a full-on comedy. There\u2019s nothing better than dropping a comedy and trying to make people laugh, to us. It feels like why we originally got into this business.\u201d",

For the 58-year-old friends and regular collaborators, it was a chance to riff like they used to.",
      "\u201cWe were outlining the story together and then we were like, \u2018We should watch the first one again, man,\u2019\u201d Sandler says. \u201cWe\u2019re going off of our memory of so many things, hanging out with Carl Weathers and Bob Barker and all that stuff.

In the years since, many of the faces of the original have died, including Barker, Weathers, Frances Bay, the hulking Richard Kiel and Joe Flaherty, who played the heckler. Even the golf ball-stealing alligator, Morris, has passed on. \u201cHappy Gilmore 2,\u201d unusually elegiac for a proudly silly comedy, nods to all of them.",
      "For the sequel, many others, like Travis Kelce, Bad Bunny and Margaret Qualley, were lining up to be a part of it. So were pro golfers. Just about all the big names in golf, including several legends, appear. The day after winning Sunday\u2019s British Open, Scottie Scheffler flew to New York for the premiere.",
      "Over the years, Herlihy and Sandler have seen a lot of them try \u201cthe Happy Gilmore.\u201d",
      "\u201cI feel like when these golfers try to do it, these pros, they\u2019re 5% thinking, \u2018Maybe this will work,\u2019\u201d says Herlihy, laughing.",
      "\u201cI played with Bryson (DeChambeau) like a week ago and when he did it, it was ridiculous,\u201d adds Sandler. \u201cHe literally blasted it 360 and just kept walking. I was like, \u2018Did he just smash the Happy Gilmore and not even think about it?\u2019\u201d",
      "It\u2019s possible that \u201cthe Happy Gilmore\u201d will even outlive the movies. There's a good chance that, even as you read this, somewhere some kid is trying it, hoping to get a laugh and maybe get it on the fairway, too.",
      "\u201cWhen we were putting it together, I called my dad and asked him if it was legal. He was like, \u2018I don\u2019t see why not,\u2019\u201d Sandler remembers. \u201cThen there are some people who look at it and go: \u2018It does help you swing hard. It gives you more momentum. You turn your hips faster. Maybe it\u2019s a good thing.\u2019\u201d",

      "So much of the attention going into New York Giants training camp is on first-round pick and quarterback of the future Jaxson Dart",
      "EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. -- Jaxson Dart is squarely in the spotlight as someone the New York Giants hope will be their quarterback of the future. The future is not here yet.",
      "For all the attention Dart is getting as a first-round draft pick, coach Brian Daboll made it clear when training camp opened Wednesday that the plan has not diverted from Russell Wilson being the guy at football's most important position.",
      "\u201cThese guys will be out here competing, but Russ is our starter,\u201d Daboll said.",
      "Wilson took all the first-team snaps in the first practice of camp, with Dart and journeyman Jameis Winston alternating going second and third. Dart threw an interception his first throw of 11-on-11 team drills, Wilson told his younger teammate to focus on the next play and the rookie's subsequent throw went for a touchdown.",
      "\u201cI think they\u2019re working well together,\u201d veteran defensive tackle Dexter Lawrence said. \u201cRuss is a great leader, Jameis is a great leader and I see them talking to him a lot. Russ handles his business really well, so for (Dart) to learn from that and them to be unselfish to teach that to him, it\u2019s only on an up trajectory.\"",
      "There's little direction to go but up for the Giants, who tied for the worst record in the NFL last season at 3-14. That is one reason fourth-year general manager Joe Schoen turned over the quarterback part of the roster almost completely \u2014 with local cult hero Tommy DeVito the lone holdover.",
      "Wilson at age 36 got a contract for this season worth up to $21 million with $10.5 million guaranteed. And New York traded a second-round pick and two third-rounders to move up to take Dart 25th, several weeks after signing Winston.",
      "Scouting Dart from afar at Mississippi and watching him up close in offseason workouts, the Giants like what they're witnessing so far.",
      "\u201cYou saw leadership, you saw arm talent, you saw athleticism and he\u2019s a rookie,\u201d Schoen said. \u201cHe\u2019s got a long way to go, and he\u2019s got a really good supporting cast in there to help. We\u2019ve got a really good coaching staff as well, so he\u2019s in a good spot right now.\u201d",
      "That spot is in reserve, though Daboll would not say if the backup job is up for grabs between Dart and Winston. Only that when the season starts on Sept. 7 at NFC East rival Washington, Wilson will be under center if healthy.",
      "Asked about that certainty, Wilson said he's \u201calways just focused on being the best version of myself every day.\u201d",
      "A teammate two seasons ago in Denver, tight end Chris Manhertz believes Wilson is qualified to handle this situation thanks to \u201call the traits of a good quarterback.\u201d",

      "The toe injury that kept standout receiver Malik Nabers off the field this spring has healed enough that he was full go for the start of his second pro training camp. But Nabers said he does not know if it eventually will go away or even if surgery might be needed.",

Everything has been going good with the rehab, so my toe\u2019s feeling better. I\u2019m just happy to be out there with my guys.\u201d",

      "Archaeologists have identified a 250-year-old shipwreck uncovered on a remote Scottish beach",
      "LONDON -- When a schoolboy going for a run found the ribs of a wooden ship poking through the dunes of a remote Scottish beach, it sparked a hunt by archaeologists, scientists and local historians to uncover its story.",
      "Through a mix of high-tech science and community research, they have an answer. Researchers announced Wednesday that the vessel is very likely the Earl of Chatham, an 18th-century warship that saw action in the American War of Independence before a second life hunting whales in the Arctic \u2014 and then a stormy demise.",
      "\u201cI would regard it as a lucky ship, which is a strange thing to say about a ship that\u2019s wrecked,\u201d said Ben Saunders, senior marine archaeologist at Wessex Archaeology, a charity that helped community researchers conduct the investigation.",
      "\u201cI think if it had been found in many other places, it wouldn\u2019t necessarily have had that community drive, that desire to recover and study that material, and also the community spirit to do it,\u201d Saunders said.",
      "The wreck was discovered in February 2024 after a storm swept away sand covering it on Sanday, one of the rugged Orkney Islands that lie off Scotland\u2019s northern tip.",
      "It excited interest on the island of 500 people, whose history is bound up with the sea and its dangers. Around 270 shipwrecks have been recorded around the 20-square-mile (50-square-kilometer) island since the 15th century.",
      "Local farmers used their tractors and trailers to haul the 12 tons of oak timbers off the beach, before local researchers set to work trying to identify it.",
      "\u201cThat was really good fun, and it was such a good feeling about the community \u2013 everybody pulling together to get it back,\u201d said Sylvia Thorne, one of the island\u2019s community researchers. \u201cQuite a few people are really getting interested in it and becoming experts.\u201d",
      "Dendrochronology \u2014 the science of dating wood from tree rings \u2014 showed the timber came from southern England in the middle of the 18th century. That was one bit of luck, Saunders said, because it coincides with \u201cthe point where British bureaucracy\u2019s really starting to kick off\u201d and detailed records were being kept.",
      "\u201cAnd so we can then start to look at the archive evidence that we have for the wrecks in Orkney,\u201d Saunders said. \u201cIt becomes a process of elimination.",
      "\u201cYou remove ones that are Northern European as opposed to British, you remove wrecks that are too small or operating out of the north of England and you really are down to two or three \u2026 and Earl of Chatham is the last one left.\u201d",

      "Its military career saw it play a part in the expansion \u2014 and contraction \u2014 of the British Empire. It helped Britain wrest control of Canada from France during the sieges of Louisbourg and Quebec in the 1750s, and in the 1770s served as a convoy escort during Britain\u2019s failed effort to hold onto its American colonies.",
      "Sold off by the navy in 1784 and renamed, the vessel became a whaling ship, hunting the huge mammals in the Arctic waters off Greenland.",
      "Whale oil was an essential fuel of the Industrial Revolution, used to lubricate machinery, soften fabric and light city streets. Saunders said that in 1787 there were 120 London-based whaling ships in the Greenland Sea, the Earl of Chatham among them.",
      "A year later, while heading out to the whaling ground, it was wrecked in bad weather off Sanday. All 56 crew members survived \u2014 more evidence, Saunders says, that this was a vessel blessed with luck.",
      "The ship\u2019s timbers are being preserved in a freshwater tank at the Sanday Heritage Centre while plans are discussed to put it on permanent display.",

      "\u201cOne of the biggest things I\u2019ve got out of this project is realizing how much the past in Sanday is just constantly with you \u2014 either visible or just under the surface,\u201d said Ruth Peace, another community researcher.",

      "\u201cThe AI\u2019s incapable of giving you accurate answers because it\u2019s been so programmed with diversity and inclusion,\u201d Sacks said at the time. Google quickly fixed its tool, but the \u201cBlack George Washington\u201d moment remained a parable for the problem of AI's perceived political bias, taken up by X owner Elon Musk, venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, Vice President JD Vance and Republican lawmakers.",

      "Also receiving one of the contracts was Musk\u2019s xAI, which has been pitched as an alternative to \u201cwoke AI\u201d companies.

Amazon, Microsoft, Meta and xAI also have major projects underway.",

      "\u201cA typical AI data center eats up as much electricity as 100,000 homes,\u201d Guterres said. \u201cBy 2030, data centers could consume as much electricity as all of Japan does today.\u201d",

      "The sophomore honors student makes a point not to have chatbots do her homework and tries to limit her interactions to mundane questions. But in interviews with The Associated Press and a new study, teenagers say they are increasingly interacting with AI as if it were a companion, capable of providing advice and friendship.",
      "\u201cEveryone uses AI for everything now. It\u2019s really taking over,\u201d said Chege, who wonders how AI tools will affect her generation. \u201cI think kids use AI to get out of thinking.\u201d",

But artificial intelligence is playing a much larger role in many of their lives. AI, teens say, has become a go-to source for personal advice, emotional support, everyday decision-making and problem-solving.",
      "More than 70% of teens have used AI companions and half use them regularly, according to a new study from Common Sense Media, a group that studies and advocates for using screens and digital media sensibly.",
      "The study defines AI companions as platforms designed to serve as \u201cdigital friends,\u201d like Character.AI or Replika, which can be customized with specific traits or personalities and can offer emotional support, companionship and conversations that can feel human-like. But popular sites like ChatGPT and Claude, which mainly answer questions, are being used in the same way, the researchers say.",

      "\u201cAI is always available. It never gets bored with you. It\u2019s never judgmental,\u201d says Ganesh Nair, an 18-year-old in Arkansas. \u201cWhen you\u2019re talking to AI, you are always right. You\u2019re always interesting. You are always emotionally justified.\u201d",
      "All that used to be appealing, but as Nair heads to college this fall, he wants to step back from using AI. Nair got spooked after a high school friend who relied on an \u201cAI companion\u201d for heart-to-heart conversations with his girlfriend later had the chatbot write the breakup text ending his two-year relationship.",
      "\u201cThat felt a little bit dystopian, that a computer generated the end to a real relationship,\u201d said Nair. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like we are allowing computers to replace our relationships with people.\u201d",
      "In the Common Sense Media survey, 31% of teens said their conversations with AI companions were \u201cas satisfying or more satisfying\u201d than talking with real friends. Even though half of teens said they distrust AI's advice, 33% had discussed serious or important issues with AI instead of real people.",
      "Those findings are worrisome, says Michael Robb, the study\u2019s lead author and head researcher at Common Sense, and should send a warning to parents, teachers and policymakers. The now-booming and largely unregulated AI industry is becoming as integrated with adolescence as smartphones and social media are.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s eye-opening,\u201d said Robb. \u201cWhen we set out to do this survey, we had no understanding of how many kids are actually using AI companions.\u201d The study polled more than 1,000 teens nationwide in April and May.",
      "Adolescence is a critical time for developing identity, social skills and independence, Robb said, and AI companions should complement \u2014 not replace \u2014 real-world interactions.",
      "\u201cIf teens are developing social skills on AI platforms where they are constantly being validated, not being challenged, not learning to read social cues or understand somebody else\u2019s perspective, they are not going to be adequately prepared in the real world,\u201d he said.",

      "When the KissCam at a Coldplay concert last week landed on a couple who suspiciously escaped their embrace and tried (but failed) to duck out of the spotlight, the internet immediately got to work",
      "NEW YORK -- When the \u201cKissCam\u201d at a Coldplay concert landed on a couple who tried (but failed) to duck out of the spotlight, the internet immediately got to work.",
      "In hours, the clip was just about everywhere. Endless memes, parody videos and photos of the pair's shocked faces filled social media feeds. Online sleuths rushed to identify who was on camera. Artificial intelligence and software company Astronomer eventually confirmed that its CEO and chief people officer were in fact the couple in the video \u2014 and announced the CEO's resignation over the weekend.",
      "The incident's fallout has, of course, generated conversations about business ethics, corporate accountability and the repercussions that conflicts of interest among leadership can cause. But there are also broader implications at play in our increasingly online world \u2014 about the state of potentially being visible everywhere you go or tracked through \u201csocial media surveillance.\" Experts say it's more and more common for moments that may have been intended to be private, or at least reserved to a single physical venue, to make their way online and even go global today.",
      "So in the era of lightning-fast social sharing and when cameras are practically inescapable, does being in public hold any expectation of privacy anymore? Is every experience simply fodder for the world to see?",
      "It's no secret that cameras are filming much of our lives these days.",
      "From CCTV security systems to Ring doorbells, businesses, schools and neighborhoods use ample video surveillance around the clock. Sporting and concert venues have also filmed fans for years, often projecting playful bits of audience participation to the rest of the crowd. In short, the on-scene viewer becomes part of the product \u2014 and the center of attention.",
      "And of course, consumers can record just about anything if they have a smartphone in their pocket \u2014 and, if it's enticing to other social media users, that footage can quickly spread through cyberspace.",
      "Ellis Cashmore, author of the book \u201cCelebrity Culture,\u201d proposes that the rapid fame of last week\u2019s KissCam moment probably answers a question many have been asking for years: \u201cIs the private life still what it was? And the answer is, of course, there\u2019s no such thing as the private life anymore,\u201d he notes. \u201cCertainly not in the traditional sense of the term.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not sure that we can assume privacy at a concert with hundreds of other people,\u201d adds Mary Angela Bock, an associate professor in the University of Texas at Austin\u2019s School of Journalism and Media. \u201cWe can\u2019t assume privacy on the street anymore.\u201d",
      "Some version of the KissCam has long been a staple at big events \u2014 from timeouts during sports games to romantic songs played by artists at their concerts. It\u2019s easy to miss, but most venues have signs to inform the audience that they could be filmed during the event. What\u2019s been different in more recent years, experts note, is how quickly those moments can travel beyond the physical space where they actually unfold.",
      "That isn\u2019t only limited to what shows up on a jumbotron. Sometimes it only takes one person in the crowd to capture any interaction on their phone and post the video online \u2014 where it can zip around the world.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not just the camera,\" Bock says. \u201cIt\u2019s the distribution system that is wild and new.\u201d",

      "Then there's the second ring of exposure \u2014 what happens after the video or photos spread.",
      "Experts point to growing instances of social media users rushing to publicly identify, or dox, the people captured on camera \u2014 much like how quickly the internet committed to finding those involved in the Coldplay moment, for example. The LinkedIn pages belonging both to Astronomer\u2019s now-former CEO and chief people officer remained disabled on Monday, and The Associated Press could not reach either for comment.",
      "But it isn't limited to company executives. Beyond someone simply spotting a familiar face and spreading the word, technological advances \u2014 including AI \u2014 have made it easier and faster overall to find just about anyone in an online post. This can happen with videos and photos shared on social media each day, even if it doesn't go viral, experts warn.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit unsettling how easily we can be identified with biometrics, how our faces are online, how social media can track us \u2014 and how the internet has gone from being a place of interaction, to a gigantic surveillance system,\" Bock says. \u201cWhen you think about it, we are being surveilled by our social media. They\u2019re tracking us in exchange for entertaining us.\u201d",
      "And of course, such moments can also impact people who were not actually on camera. As easy as it can be to be identified online today, the internet is notorious for cutting a broad swath or not always getting it right. That sometimes produces harassment of individuals not actually involved.",
      "At last week's Coldplay concert, for example, many social media users speculated that a third person seen near the two caught on camera was another Astronomer employee \u2014 leading to swarms of posts targeting her. But the company later confirmed that she was not at the event and said no other employees were in the video circulating online.",
      "For the now-viral moment, \u201cwe can talk about what\u2019s right and wrong, and whether they deserved it,\u201d says Alison Taylor, a clinical associate professor at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business. Still, it\u2019s a \u201cvery frightening thing to get a lot of abuse and harassment online,\u201d Taylor notes. \u201cThere are real human beings behind this.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s hard to think that that these kind of viral moments will ever go away \u2014 and there are few legal restrictions to stop users from sharing clips of interactions recorded from anything from a concert to the street widely online. But on an individual level, Bock says it can be helpful to \u201cthink before you share\u201d and question whether something\u2019s really accurate.",
      "\u201cSocial media has changed so much,\u201d Bock says. \u201cBut we really have not, as a society, caught up with the technology in terms of our ethics and our etiquette.\u201d",

      "Earlier this year, Meta began to test the use of artificial intelligence to determine if kids are lying about their ages on Instagram, which is technically only allowed for those over 13. If it is determined that a user is misrepresenting their age, the account will automatically become a teen account, which has more restrictions than an adult account. Teen accounts are private by default. Private messages are restricted so teens can only receive them from people they follow or are already connected to. In 2024, the company made teen accounts private by default.",

      "The financial world is buzzing about tokenization, a process using blockchain to turn real-world assets like stocks or real estate into digital tokens",
      "As cryptocurrencies become more intertwined with the traditional financial system, industry heavyweights are racing for a long-sought goal of turning real-world assets into digital tokens.",
      "\u201cTokenization is going to open the door to a massive trading revolution,\u201d said Vlad Tenev, the CEO of the trading platform Robinhood at a recent James Bond-themed tokenization launch event in the south of France.",
      "Advocates say tokenization is the next leap forward in crypto and can help break down walls that have advantaged the wealthy and make trading cheaper, more transparent and more accessible for everyday investors.",
      "But critics say tokenization threatens to undermine a century\u2019s worth of securities law and investor protections that have made the U.S. financial system the envy of the world. And Robinhood\u2019s push into tokenizing shares of private companies quickly faced pushback from one of the world\u2019s most popular startups.",
      "The basic idea behind tokenization: Use blockchain technology that powers cryptocurrencies to create digital tokens as stand-ins for things like bonds, real estate or even fractional ownership of a piece of art and that can be traded like crypto by virtually anyone, anywhere at any time.",
      "The massive growth of stablecoins, which are a type of cryptocurrency typically bought and sold for $1, has helped fuel the appetite to tokenize other financial assets, crypto venture capitalist Katie Haun said on a recent podcast.",
      "She said tokenization will upend investing in ways similar to how streamers radically changed how people watch television.",
      "\u201cYou used to have to sit there on a Thursday night and watch Seinfeld,\u201d Haun said. \u201cYou tune in at a specific time, you don\u2019t get to choose your program, you couldn\u2019t be watching a program like Squid Games from Korea. Netflix was market-expanding. In the same way, I think the tokenization of real-world assets will be market expanding.\u201d",
      "Robinhood began offering tokenized stock trading of major U.S. public companies for its European customers earlier this month and gave away tokens to some customers meant to represent shares in OpenAI and SpaceX, two highly valued private companies.",
      "Several other firms are diving in. Crypto exchange Kraken also allows customers outside the U.S. to trade tokenized stocks while Coinbase has petitioned regulators to open the market to its U.S. customers. Wall Street giants BlackRock and Franklin Templeton currently offer tokenized money market funds. McKinsey projects that tokenized assets could reach $2 trillion by 2030.",
      "The push for tokenization comes at a heady time in crypto, an industry that\u2019s seen enormous growth from the creation and early development of bitcoin more than 15 years ago by libertarian-leaning computer enthusiasts to a growing acceptance in mainstream finance.",
      "The world\u2019s most popular cryptocurrency is now regularly setting all-time highs \u2014 more than $123,000 on Monday \u2014 while other forms of crypto like stablecoins are exploding in use and the Trump administration has pledged to usher in what\u2019s been called the \u201cgolden age\u201d for digital assets.",
      "Lee Reiners, a lecturing fellow at Duke University, said the biggest winners in the push for tokenization could be a small handful of exchanges like Robinhood that see their trading volumes and influence spike.",
      "\u201cWhich is kind of ironic given the origins of crypto, which was to bypass intermediaries,\u201d Reiners said.",
      "Interest in tokenization has also gotten a boost thanks to the election of President Donald Trump, who has made enacting more crypto-friendly regulations a top priority of his administration and signed a new law regulating stablecoins on Friday.",
      "\u201cTokenization is an innovation and we at the SEC should be focused on how do we advance innovation at the marketplace,\u201d said Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Paul Atkins.",

The crypto exchange Binance pulled back offerings of tokenized securities in 2021 after German regulators raised questions about potential violations of that country\u2019s securities law.",
      "Under Trump, the SEC has taken a much less expansive view than the previous administration and dropped or paused litigation against crypto companies that the agency had previously accused of violating securities law.",

      "\u201cThese are massive wealth generators for a very small group of rich, well-connected insiders who get access to these deals early,\u201d said Robinhood executive Johann Kerbrat. \u201cCrypto has the power to solve this inequality.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "As global temperatures rise under climate change, the bees responsible for pollinating many crops are under increasing stress and scientists are trying to understand how they are affected",
      "WILLIAMSPORT, Ohio -- Sweat covers Isaac Barnes\u2019s face under his beekeeper\u2019s veil as he hauls boxes of honeycomb from his hives to his truck. It's a workout in what feels like a sauna as the late-morning June temperatures rise.",
      "Though Barnes was hot, his bees were even hotter. Their body temperatures can be up to 27 degrees Fahrenheit (about 15 Celsius) higher than the air around them. As global temperatures rise under climate change, scientists are trying to better understand the effects on managed and wild bees as they pollinate crops, gather nectar, make honey and reproduce.",
      "They noticed flying bees gathering nectar avoided overheating on the hottest days by using fewer but harder wingbeats to keep their body temperature below dangerous levels, according to a study published last year. Scientists also say that bees \u2014 like people \u2014 may also cope by retreating to a cooler environment such as the shade or their nest.",
      "\u201cJust like we go into the shade, or we sweat or we might work less hard, bees actually do the exact same thing so they can avoid the heat,\u201d said Jon Harrison, an environmental physiologist at Arizona State University and one of the study\u2019s authors.",
      "But that means the bees aren't able to do what they normally do, said Kevin McCluney, a biology professor at Bowling Green State University.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re not going out and getting more nectar. They\u2019re not mating. They\u2019re not doing the things that bees would otherwise do,\u201d McCluney said.",
      "Generally, most bees are heat-tolerant, but as the climate warms, some experts think their ability to fend off disease and gather food might become harder. And habitat loss, increased use of pesticides, diseases and lack of forage for both managed and wild bees are all listed as potential contributors to the global decline of bees and other pollinators.",
      "\u201cIf you're not well-fed, and your body is intoxicated with pesticides and you have lots of diseases in your body, you're going to be less heat-tolerant than if you were healthy,\u201d said Margarita L\u00f3pez-Uribe, a pollinator health expert at Pennsylvania State University.",
      "Earlier this year, preliminary results from the annual U.S. Beekeeping Survey found that beekeepers lost almost 56% of their managed colonies, the highest loss since the survey started in 2010.",
      "Almost all of the managed honeybee colonies in the U.S. are used to pollinate agricultural crops such as almonds, apples, cherries and blueberries. Fewer pollinators can lead to less pollination and potentially lower yields.",
      "\u201cIt's a very fragile system if you think about it,\u201d L\u00f3pez-Uribe said. \u201cBecause if something goes wrong, you have these super high-value crops that won\u2019t get enough bees for pollination.\u201d",
      "Back at Barnes' hives in Ohio, thousands of honeybees fly around as he gathers boxes to take back to his farm for honey production. Nearby, a couple of his bees land on milkweed flowers, a rare bit of plant diversity in an area dominated by corn and soybean fields.",
      "For Barnes, who operates Honeyrun Farm with his wife, Jayne, one of the challenges heat can pose to his 500 honeybee hives is fending off parasitic mites that threaten the bees. If temperatures get too hot, he can\u2019t apply formic acid, an organic chemical that kills the mites. If it\u2019s applied when it\u2019s too hot, the bees could die.",
      "Last year they lost almost a third of the 400 hives they sent to California to help pollinate commercial almond groves. Barnes thinks those hives may have been in poor health ahead of pollination because they were unable to ward off mites when it was hot months earlier.",

      "Sometimes the heat helps. Here in Ohio, Barnes' hives last summer produced a bumper crop of honey as they feasted on nearby soybean nectar as the plants bloomed in the heat. Still, the lack of diverse plants for bees to forage in an area dominated by corn and soybean fields isn't ideal.",
      "And even the native blooms are appearing erratically, Barnes said. In autumn, his bees search for food on goldenrod, but those blooms are appearing later. And even then, he has supplemented his hive with additional food to keep them healthy into the winter.",
      "\u201cEvery single plant that blooms is something that the bee can use,\u201d Barnes said. \u201cAnd every single plant is affected by climate change.\u201d",
      "It's only in the last decade that people have become aware of the magnitude of the pollinator decline globally, said Harrison, of Arizona State University. Data is limited on how much climate change and heat stress is contributing to pollinator decline.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a relatively new focus for biology,\" he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s super important, but it\u2019s not being studied a ton.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration's proposed budget would eliminate the research program that funds the USGS Bee Lab, which supports the inventory, monitoring and natural history of the nation\u2019s wild bees. Other grants for bee research are also in jeopardy.",
      "U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon said America\u2019s pollinators are in \u201cgrave danger,\u201d and he'll fight for the federal funding. Pollinators contribute to the health of the planet, the crops we grow and the food we eat, he said.",
      "\u201cRather than taking bold action to protect them, the Trump administration has proposed a reckless budget that would zero out funding for critical research aimed at saving important pollinators,\u201d he said in a statement to The Associated Press.",
      "Harrison said his research on this topic would come to a halt if cuts are made to his federal funding, and it would be more difficult in general for scientists to study the disappearance of bees and other pollinators and improve how they prevent these losses. Not being able to manage these pollinator deaths could cause the price of fruits, vegetables, nuts, coffee and chocolate to jump or become scarce.",

      "MIAMI -- Elon Musk fought court cases on opposite coasts Monday, raising a question about the billionaire that could either speed his plan to put self-driving Teslas on U.S. roads or throw up a major roadblock: Can this wildly successful man who tends to exaggerate really be trusted?",
      "In Miami, a Tesla driver who has admitted he was wrong to reach for a dropped cell phone moments before a deadly accident, spoke of the danger of putting too much faith in Musk's technology \u2014 in this case his Autopilot program.",
      "\u201cI trusted the technology too much,\u201d said George McGee, who ran off the road and killed a woman out stargazing with her boyfriend. \u201cI believed that if the car saw something in front of it, it would provide a warning and apply the brakes.\u201d",
      "In unusual coincidence, regulators arguing an Oakland, California, case tried to pin exaggerated talk about the same Tesla technology at the center of a request to suspend the carmaker from being able to sell vehicles in the state.",
      "Musk's tendency to talk big \u2014 whether it's his cars, his rockets or his government costing-cutting efforts \u2014 have landed him in trouble with investors, regulators and courts before, but rarely at such a delicate moment.",
      "After his social media spat with President Donald Trump, Musk can no longer count on a light regulatory touch from Washington. Meanwhile, sales of his electric cars have plunged and so a hit to his safety reputation could threaten his next big project: rolling out driverless robotaxis \u2014 hundreds of thousands of them \u2014 in several U.S. cities by the end of next year.",
      "The Miami case holds other dangers, too. Lawyers for the family of the dead woman, Naibel Benavides Leon, recently convinced the judge overseeing the jury trial to allow them to argue for punitive damages. A car crash lawyer not involved in the case, but closely following it, said that could cost Tesla tens of millions of dollars, or possibly more.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve seen punitive damages go to the hundreds of millions, so that is the floor,\u201d said Miguel Custodio of Los Angeles-based Custodio & Dubey. \u201cIt is also a signal to other plaintiffs that they can also ask for punitive damages, and then the payments could start compounding.\u201d",
      "That Tesla has allowed the Miami case to proceed to trial is surprising. It has settled at least four deadly accidents involving Autopilot, including payments just last week to a Florida family of a Tesla driver. That said, Tesla was victorious in two other jury cases, both in California, that also sought to lay blame on its technology for crashes.",
      "Lawyers for the plaintiffs in the Miami case argue that Tesla\u2019s driver-assistance feature, called Autopilot, should have warned the driver and braked when his Model S sedan blew through flashing lights, a stop sign and a T-intersection at 62 miles-an-hour in an April 2019 crash. Tesla said that drivers are warned not to rely on Autopilot, or its more advanced Full Self-Driving system. It says the fault entirely lies with the \"distracted driver\" just like so many other \u201caccidents since cellphones were invented.\u201d",
      "Driver McGee settled a separate suit brought by the family of Benavides and her severely injured boyfriend, Dillon Angulo.",
      "McGee was clearly shaken when shown a dashcam video Monday of his car jumping a Key West, Florida, road and hitting a parked Chevrolet Tahoe which then slammed into Benavides and sent her 75 feet through the air to her death. Asked if he had seen those images before, McGee pinched his lips, shook his head, then squeaked out a response, \u201cNo.\u201d",

      "Tesla's attorney sought to show that McGee was fully to blame, asking if he had ever contacted Tesla for additional instructions about how Autopilot or any other safety features worked. McGee said he had not, though he was heavy user of the features. He said he had driven the same road home from work 30 or 40 times. Under questioning, he also acknowledged he alone was responsible for watching the road and hitting the brakes.",
      "Summarizing the testimony, Tesla said in a statement after the court adjourned that McGee had \"stated the simple truth that we all know: If he had just paid attention to the road instead of searching for his dropped cell phone and pressing the accelerator \u2014which he was doing for over a minute before the crash \u2014 this tragic accident would never have happened.\u201d",
      "But lawyers for the Benavides family had a chance in the courtroom at parrying that line of argument, asking McGee if he would have taken his eyes off the road and reached for his phone had he been driving any car other than a Tesla on Autopilot.",

A court filing claims even those feature names are misleading because they offer just partial self-driving",
      "Musk has been warned by federal regulators to stop making public comments suggesting Full Self-Driving allows his cars to drive themselves because it could lead to overreliance on the system, resulting in possible crashes and deaths. He also has run into trouble with regulators for Autopilot. In 2023, the company had to recall 2.3 million vehicles for problems with the technology and is now under investigation for saying it fixed the issue though it\u2019s unclear it has, according to regulatory documents.",
      "The California case is expected to last another four days.",

      "Officials said Thursday they had received no reports of injuries or major damage from the latest event, which triggered a tsunami warning that lasted about an hour before being downgraded and prompted communities along a 700-mile (1,127-km) stretch of Alaska\u2019s southern coast to urge people to move to higher ground. The official maximum wave height at Sand Point, a community 55 miles (88 kilometers) north of the epicenter, was about 3.9 inches (10 centimeters), said Kara Sterling, a lead duty scientist at the National Tsunami Warning Center. It occurred at low tide.",
      "The earthquake struck at 12:37 p.m. local time, prompting the center's tsunami warning.",
      "There are a number of ways people in warning areas can receive notifications, including the sounding of sirens in communities that have them, listening to weather radio or public radio broadcasts, following official accounts on social media, or via push alerts on cellphones. In some places, local officials have relayed warnings door to door, said Jeremy Zidek, a spokesperson with the state's emergency management division.",
      "Public safety departments in King Cove and Unalaska sent alerts urging those in coastal areas or those that could see inundation to seek higher ground.",
      "The warning issued by the center was downgraded to an advisory before being canceled around 2:45 p.m.",
      "Alaska is the most earthquake-prone state in the U.S. and one of the most seismically active regions in the world, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The state experiences a magnitude 7 earthquake almost annually, and the second-largest earthquake ever recorded was centered about 75 miles (120 kilometers) east of Anchorage, the agency said. That 1964 magnitude 9.2 earthquake \u2014 and the tsunami it triggered \u2014 killed about 130 people.",

      "Zidek and West said people should continue to heed warnings. West said he worries about a \u201cburnout effect\u201d among residents in the region, some of whom have evacuated numerous times since 2018 in response to larger earthquakes that have not caused significant damage.",

      "\u201cRegular cleaning and proper maintenance not only keeps your gadgets looking pristine, and wins you hygiene points, it also helps them perform better and last longer,\u201d the company says. \u201cIn the case of devices like earbuds, the accumulated bacteria and debris may even cause health issues or discomfort.\u201d",

      "Assemble some basic equipment and material for cleaning, which should include a soft and lint-free cleaning cloth, like a microfiber cloth; cotton swabs; a soft-bristled brush like a toothbrush, paintbrush or makeup brush; compressed air and isopropyl alcohol.",
      "Isopropyl, or rubbing alcohol, is a non-toxic cleaning solvent that\u2019s antiseptic and antibacterial. It's popular for cleaning electronics because it doesn\u2019t leave any residue and dries quickly. But you might want to wear gloves to avoid skin irritation. Drip some of it on a cloth instead of pouring it directly onto your device. Also heed some of the more specific warnings below.",
      "Water and mild soap can be useful for cleaning dirty surfaces, but isopropyl alcohol is recommended for cleaning the internals of a device, said Alex Diaz-Kokaisl, senior technical writer at electronics repair company iFixit.",
      "\u201cWhile there isn\u2019t a hard-and-fast rule for cleaning electronics, we generally use high-concentration isopropyl alcohol (more than 90%) because it evaporates quickly,\u201d he said. \u201cThe faster a liquid evaporates, the less likely it is to affect any components that conduct electricity.\u201d",
      "For whatever device you're cleaning, disconnect or power it off first. Remove any cases, plugs, covers and accessories.",
      "When using a computer, the keyboard and mouse are the parts that are touched most often and therefore need the most frequent cleaning. And all those crevices between a keyboard's keys are sure to catch crumbs.",
      "To remove any loose debris, iFixit's official in-house cleaning guide recommends using a can of compressed air. Run the spray back and forth across the keys to blow out any bits. If possible, hold the keyboard upside down so the debris falls out.",
      "If you don\u2019t have compressed air, Logitech suggests using a hair dryer on the cold air setting. Some social media users also recommend a handheld balloon pump.",
      "Next, dampen a cleaning cloth with water and gently wipe down the keyboard and mouse.",
      "Logitech says you can also use rubbing alcohol but recommends you test it first on an inconspicuous spot to make sure it doesn't cause discoloration or scrub the lettering off the keys.",
      "Anti-bacterial baby wipes can also work on devices like a mouse, Diaz-Kokaisl said.",

      "OpenAI should continue to be controlled by a nonprofit because the artificial intelligence technology it is developing is \u201ctoo consequential\u201d to be governed by a corporation alone.",
      "That is the message from an advisory board convened by OpenAI to give it recommendations about its nonprofit structure \u2014 delivered in a report released Thursday, along with a sweeping vision for democratizing AI and reforming philanthropy.",
      "\u201cWe think it\u2019s too important to entrust to any one sector, the private sector or even the government sector,\u201d said Daniel Zingale, the convener of OpenAI\u2019s nonprofit commission and a former adviser to three California governors. \u201cThe nonprofit model allows for what we call a common sector,\u201d that facilitates democratic participation.",
      "The recommendations are not binding on OpenAI, but the advisory commission, which includes the labor organizer Dolores Huerta, offers a framework that may be used to judge OpenAI in the future, whether or not they adopt it.",
      "In the commission's view, communities that are already feeling the impacts of AI technologies should have input on how they are developed, including how data about them is used. But there are currently few avenues for people to influence tech companies who control much of the development of AI.",
      "OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, started in 2015 as a nonprofit research laboratory and has since incorporated a for-profit company with a valuation that has grown to $300 billion. The company has tried to change its structure since the nonprofit board ousted its CEO Sam Altman in Nov. 2023. He was reinstated days later and continues to lead OpenAI.",
      "It has run into hurdles escaping its nonprofit roots, including scrutiny from the attorney generals in California and Delaware, who have oversight of nonprofits, and a lawsuit by Elon Musk, an early donor to and founder of OpenAI.",
      "Most recently, OpenAI has said it will turn its for-profit company into a public benefit corporation, which must balance the interests of shareholders and its mission. Its nonprofit will hold shares in that new corporation, but OpenAI has not said how much.",
      "Zingale said Huerta told the commission their challenge was to help make sure AI is a blessing and not a curse. To grapple with those stakes, they envision a nonprofit with an expansive mandate to help everyone participate in the development and trajectory of AI.",
      "\u201cThe measure of this nonprofit will be in what it builds, who it includes, and how faithfully it endures to mission and impact,\" they wrote.",
      "The commission toured California communities and solicited feedback online. They heard that many were inspired by OpenAI\u2019s mission to create artificial intelligence to benefit humanity and ensure those benefits are felt widely and evenly.",
      "But, Zingale said many people feel they are in the dark about how it\u2019s happening.",

      "House Democrats are launching a bid to subpoena President Donald Trump\u2019s Justice Department for files in the sex trafficking investigation into Jeffrey Epstein",
      "WASHINGTON -- House Democrats launched a bid Wednesday to subpoena President Donald Trump's Justice Department for files in the sex trafficking investigation into Jeffrey Epstein, goading GOP lawmakers to defy Trump and Republican leadership to support the action.",
      "Democrats on a subcommittee of the powerful House Committee on Oversight made a motion for the subpoena Wednesday afternoon, just hours before the House was scheduled to end its July work session and depart Washington for a monthlong break.",
      "The subcommittee's Republican chairman, Rep. Clay Higgins of Louisiana, postponed a vote on the matter until the end of the meeting. While several Republicans on the panel are members of a right-wing faction and have called for the release of the files, it was not clear whether they would vote for the subpoena.",
      "During a brief break in the meeting, Higgins told reporters he expected the motion for the subpoena to pass with some changes.",
      "\u201cIf the Republican Party, if our colleagues on this committee don\u2019t join us in this vote, then what they\u2019re essentially doing is joining President Donald Trump in complicity,\u201d Rep. Summer Lee, the Pennsylvania Democrat who made the motion for the subpoena, told reporters outside the hearing room.",
      "The move by Democrats showed how they were doing practically everything in their power to force Republicans to act on the Epstein files. House Speaker Mike Johnson \u2014 caught between demands from Trump and clamoring from his own members for the House to act \u2014 has resisted calls for action and prepared to send the House home a day early.",
      "Johnson told reporters earlier Wednesday there was no need to vote on legislation calling for the release of the Epstein files this week because the Trump administration is \u201calready doing everything within their power to release them.\u201d",
      "Yet Democrats have delighted this week in pressing Republicans to support the release of the files. Their efforts halted the GOP's legislative agenda for the week and turned attention to an issue that Trump has unsuccessfully implored his supporters to forget about.",
      "\u201cThey're fleeing our work, our job and sending us back home because they don't want to vote to release these files. This is something that they ran on. This is something that they talked about: the importance of transparency, holding pedophiles accountable,\u201d Lee said.",
      "Democratic leaders are hoping to make the issue about much more than just Epstein, who died in his New York jail cell six years ago while he awaited trial on sex trafficking charges.",
      "\u201cWhy haven't Republicans released the Epstein files to the American people? It's reasonable to conclude that Republicans are continuing to protect the lifestyles of the rich and the shameless, even if that includes pedophiles,\u201d said House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries at a news conference. \u201cSo it's all connected.\u201d",

      "TOPEKA, Kan. -- The Trump administration on Wednesday canceled a $4.9 billion federal loan guarantee for a new high-voltage transmission line for delivering solar and wind-generated electricity from the Midwest to the eastern U.S.",
      "The U.S. Department of Energy declared that it is \"not critical for the federal government to have a role\u201d in the first phase of Chicago-based Invenergy's planned Grain Belt Express. The department also questioned whether the $11 billion project could meet the financial conditions required for a loan guarantee.",
      "President Donald Trump has repeatedly derided wind and solar energy as \u201cunreliable\u201d and opposed efforts to combat climate change by moving away from fossil fuels. The Department of Energy also said Wednesday that the conditional commitment to Invenergy in November was among billions of dollars' worth of commitments \"rushed out the doors\" by former President Joe Biden's administration after Biden lost the election.",
      "\u201cTo ensure more responsible stewardship of taxpayer resources, DOE has terminated its conditional commitment,\u201d the agency said in a statement.",
      "It wasn\u2019t immediately clear how much the department\u2019s action would delay or stop the start of construction, which was set to begin next year. The company\u2019s representatives didn\u2019t immediately respond to emails Wednesday seeking comment",
      "The company has said its project would create 4,000 jobs and new efficiencies in delivering power, and that it would save consumers $52 billion over 15 years. The line would deliver electricity from Kansas across Missouri and Illinois and into Indiana, connecting there to the power grid for the eastern U.S. It could deliver up to 5,000 megawatts of electricity.",
      "\"When electricity demand and consumer power bills are soaring, it\u2019s hard to imagine a more backward move,\u201d said Bob Keefe, executive director of E2, a nonpartisan, Washington-based group supporting renewable energy.",
      "Keefe called the Grain Belt Express \u201cone of the country\u2019s most important energy projects\u201d and suggested Trump canceled the loan guarantee \u201cjust because it will bring cleaner energy to more people.\u201d",

      "OSLO, Norway -- A former security guard at the U.S. Embassy in Norway has been indicted by prosecutors there on suspicion of espionage after he allegedly spied for Russia and Iran, state broadcaster NRK said Wednesday.",
      "The Norwegian man, whose name has not been made public, was arrested last November on suspicion of having damaged national security. He is accused of handing over details about the embassy\u2019s diplomats, its floor plans and security routines, among other things, NRK reported.",
      "His defense attorney, Inger Zadig, said her client acknowledges the indictment's facts but denies any criminal guilt.",
      "\u201cAt its core, this case concerns legal interpretation \u2014 specifically, whether, and to what extent, the information in question was \u2018classified\u2019 under the law, and whether it was capable of harming fundamental national interests,\u201d she wrote in an email to The Associated Press. \u201cIf not, then sharing the information is not a criminal offense. Our client did not hold a security clearance, and his access to information that could threaten vital national interests was more or less non-existent. These issues will be thoroughly addressed in court.\u201d",
      "The broadcaster reported that America's ties to Israel and the war in Gaza prompted the man to contact Russia and Iran.",
      "The defendant faces up to 21 years in prison, NRK reported.",
      "The U.S. Embassy and the prosecutor\u2019s office did not respond to AP's requests for comment.",

      "Venezuela's President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and other officials have said many of the immigrants were physically and psychologically tortured during their detention in El Salvador, airing on state television videos of some of the men describing the alleged abuse, including rape, severe beatings and pellet-gun wounds. The narratives are reminiscent of the abuses that Maduro\u2019s government has long been accused of committing against its real or perceived, jailed opponents.",
      "As the men reached their homes, they and their relatives shared deeply emotional moments in which sad tears and happy tears rolled down their cheeks at the same time.",
      "Uzc\u00e1tegui's wife, Gabriela Mora, 30, held onto their home's fence and sobbed as she saw the military vehicle carrying him approach after a 30-plus-hour bus ride to their mining community nestled in Venezuela's Andean mountains.

      "The administration did not provide evidence to back up the accusation. However, several recently deported migrants have said U.S. authorities wrongly judged their tattoos and used them as an excuse to deport them.",

      "Ken Beckley never went to Harvard, but he has been wearing a crimson Harvard cap in a show of solidarity. As he sees it, the Trump administration's attacks on the school echo a case of government overreach at his own alma mater, Indiana University.",
      "Beckley, a former head of the school's alumni association, rallied fellow graduates this spring in an unsuccessful effort to stop Gov. Mike Braun, a Republican, from removing three alumni-elected members from Indiana University\u2019s Board of Trustees and handpicking their replacements.",
      "No government effort to influence a university \u2014 private or public \u2014 has gotten more attention than the clash at Harvard, where the Trump administration has frozen billions of dollars in federal funding as it seeks a series of policy changes. But far beyond the Ivy League, Republican officials are targeting public universities in several states with efforts seeking similar ends.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s happened nationally is now affecting Indiana,\u201d said Beckley, who bought Harvard caps in bulk and passes them out to friends.",
      "Officials in conservative states took aim at higher education before President Donald Trump began his second term, driven in part by the belief that colleges are out of touch \u2014 too liberal and loading up students with too much debt. The first efforts focused on critical race theory, an academic framework centered on the idea that racism is embedded in the nation\u2019s institutions, and then on diversity, equity and inclusion programs.",
      "Since Trump took office, officials in states including Indiana, Florida, Ohio, Texas, Iowa and Idaho increasingly have focused on university governance \u2014 rules for who picks university presidents and boards and how much control they exert over curriculums and faculty tenure.",
      "As at Harvard, which Trump has decried as overly influenced by liberal thinking, those state officials have sought to reduce the power of faculty members and students.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve realized that they can take a bit of a step further, that they can advance their policy priorities through those levers they have through the state university system,\u201d said Preston Cooper, a senior fellow who studies higher education policy at the conservative American Enterprise Institute.",

      "Braun's administration has ramped up scrutiny of hiring practices at colleges statewide. Indiana's attorney general, Todd Rokita, has sent letters to the University of Notre Dame, Butler University and DePauw University questioning the legality of their DEI programs.",
      "Butler, a private, liberal arts school in Indianapolis, was founded by an abolitionist in the decade leading up to the Civil War and admitted women and students of color from the start.",
      "\u201cI hope that Butler will uphold the standards they were founded on,\u201d said Edyn Curry, president of Butler\u2019s Black Student Union.",
      "In Florida, the state university system board in June rejected longtime academic Santa Ono for the presidency at the University of Florida, despite a unanimous vote of approval by the school's own Board of Trustees. The unprecedented reversal followed criticism from conservatives about Ono's past support for DEI programs.",
      "That followed the conservative makeover of New College of Florida, a small liberal arts school once known as the state\u2019s most progressive. After Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis appointed a group of conservatives to its governing board, many faculty left, including Amy Reid, who now manages a team focused on higher education at the free-expression group PEN America.",

Now, there's a perceived sense that faculty should not be solely responsible for academic matters and that the trustees should play a more active role, said Joseph Yockey, a professor at the University of Iowa College of Law and the former president of Iowa\u2019s faculty senate.",

      "Alaska State Troopers used a helicopter to evacuate the woman off the Basher Trail to a hospital, Anchorage Police spokesperson Christopher Barraza said. Her injuries are considered non-life-threatening, he said.",
      "The woman, who has not been identified, called 911 around 3 p.m. and told the dispatcher that she had been mauled by a bear about 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) into the trail, Barraza said. She told officials she couldn't walk.",
      "For about an hour, the woman talked with officials over the phone, telling them the area she was in as they used drones to try to find her, Barraza said.",

The task force includes officers who work for federal Homeland Security Investigations, which can enforce immigration laws, the lawsuit said.",
      "After federal immigration officers told him in the chat that the student did not have a criminal history but had an expired visa, Zwinck allegedly provided them with their location and told her to wait with him in his patrol car for about five minutes, asking about her accent and where she was born. He let her go with a warning and gave federal agents a description of her vehicle and told her which direction she was headed so they could arrest her, the lawsuit said.",

      "Zwinck is also accused of violating the law again on June 10 by providing immigration officers with the photo of the license of another driver who had overstayed his visa, information about the person's vehicle and directions to help them arrest the driver.

      "After a customer at the Ryde Hotel mentioned Sunday seeing two men grabbing one of the birds and putting it inside a cage on the bed of a pickup truck, the staff did a count and realized only four of their exotic birds remained, David Nielsen, the hotel\u2019s general manager, said.",

      "The owner purchased five of the birds to wander the grounds 14 years ago. They reproduced \u201cto the point that they became a signature of the hotel,\u201d Nielsen said. Peacocks are common in Art Nouveau design.",
      "Staff fed them leftovers of fillet mignon, prime rib and salmon, and over time, the birds became tamer. They got used to people, and the employees began seeing them as pets, even naming some of them.",

      "The former Fleetwood Mac bandmates shared a pair of cryptic messages across their Instagram accounts last week which combined to read, \"And if you go forward\u2026 I'll meet you there\" \u2014 lyrics from \"Frozen Love,\" a song off the duo's fabled 1973 album. Social media lit up with discussion of a possible reunion, seven years after Buckingham was fired from Fleetwood Mac.",
      "On Wednesday, Nicks and Buckingham jointly posted a video of a billboard advertising the album's reissue going up in Los Angeles, announcing in the post's caption that the first single from the release, a newly remastered edition of \"Crying In The Night,\" was available now to stream.",
      "Nicks and Buckingham released \"Buckingham Nicks\" shortly before joining Fleetwood Mac in 1974. It was a commercial failure, resulting in their label, Polydor Records, dropping the pair from their contract. The album's last official release was a 1981 vinyl pressing from Polydor, according to Discogs, but the record has never been available on CD or digital, although bootlegs have surfaced over the years.",
      "Now, premium vinyl record producer Rhino High Fidelity is gearing up to release the full album on Sept. 19, alongside fresh liner notes from music journalist David Fricke, including interviews with both Buckingham and Nicks.",
      "\"[We] knew what we had as a duo, two songwriters that sang really well together. And it was a very natural thing, from the beginning.\" Nicks is quoted as saying in a Rhino press release. Buckingham said the album \"stands up in a way you hope it would, by these two kids who were pretty young to be doing that work.\"",
      "The remastered album is now available to pre-order in a standard edition and a deluxe edition, which includes two 7-inch singles, \"Crying In The Night\" and \"Don't Let Me Down Again.\" The standard edition is limited to 5,000 copies, while the singles are numbered to 2,000.",
      "Rumors of a possible \"Buckingham Nicks\" reissue have percolated for years. Back in 2011, Buckingham told Rolling Stone that the album has \"been a victim of inertia. It's funny, I spent a lot of time with Stevie this year when she was finishing her album and we were getting along great. We have every intention of putting that album back out and possibly even doing something along with it, but I can't put any specifics on that.\"",
      "Rhino sourced the audio for the remastered vinyl from the duo's original analog master tapes of the album, which was recorded at Sound City Studios in Los Angeles, not far from the billboard announcing its long-awaited return.",

      "The family's statement didn't provide additional details about the circumstances surrounding Osbourne's death.",
      "Osbourne revealed in 2020 that he was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, the movement disorder affecting the nervous system that gets worse over time. A year earlier, the rock star postponed all of his 2019 performances after falling at his home in Los Angeles, which aggravated injuries from a 2003 all-terrain vehicle accident. He announced in 2023 that he would retire from touring.",
      "\"Ozzy was someone who lived hard, rocked hard and retired over and over again, starting, I think, first in the '90s,\" Joe Levy, a contributor for Rolling Stone magazine, told CBS News on Tuesday following news of Osbourne's death. \"He retired at least two times, kept coming back, and the fact that his Parkinson's diagnosis kept him from performing made it all the more amazing that just two weeks ago, he took the stage for what absolutely would be the final time.\"",
      "Either clad in black or bare-chested, the singer was often the target of parents' groups for his imagery and once caused an uproar for biting the head off a bat. Later, he would reveal himself to be a doddering and sweet father on the reality TV show \"The Osbournes.\"",
      "The Big Bang of heavy metal",
      "Black Sabbath's 1969 self-titled debut LP has been likened to the Big Bang of heavy metal. It came during the height of the Vietnam War and crashed the hippie party, dripping menace and foreboding. The cover of the record was of a spooky figure against a stark landscape. The music was loud, dense and angry, and marked a shift in rock 'n' roll.",
      "The band's second album, \"Paranoid,\" included such classic metal tunes as \"War Pigs,\" \"Iron Man\" and \"Fairies Wear Boots.\" The song \"Paranoid\" only reached No. 61 on the Billboard Hot 100 but became in many ways the band's signature song. Both albums were voted among the top 10 greatest heavy metal albums of all time by readers of Rolling Stone magazine.",
      "\"Black Sabbath are the Beatles of heavy metal. Anybody who's serious about metal will tell you it all comes down to Sabbath,\" Dave Navarro of the band Jane's Addiction wrote in a 2010 tribute in Rolling Stone. \"There's a direct line you can draw back from today's metal, through Eighties bands like Iron Maiden, back to Sabbath.\"",
      "Sabbath fired Osbourne in 1979 for his legendary excesses, like showing up late for rehearsals and missing gigs. \"We knew we didn't really have a choice but to sack him because he was just so out of control. But we were all very down about the situation,\" wrote bassist Terry \"Geezer\" Butler in his memoir, \"Into the Void.\"",
      "Osbourne reemerged the next year as a solo artist with \"Blizzard of Ozz\" and the following year's \"Diary of a Madman,\" both hard rock classics that went multi-platinum and spawned enduring favorites such as \"Crazy Train,\" \"Goodbye to Romance,\" \"Flying High Again\" and \"You Can't Kill Rock and Roll.\" Osbourne was twice inducted to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame \u2014 once with Sabbath in 2006 and again in 2024 as a solo artist.",

      "Metallica, Guns N Roses, Slayer, Tool, Pantera, Gojira, Alice in Chains, Lamb of God, Halestorm, Anthrax, Rival Sons and Mastodon did sets. Tom Morello, Aerosmith's Steven Tyler, Billy Corgan, Ronnie Wood, Travis Barker, Sammy Hagar, Andrew Watt, Yungblud, Korn's Jonathan Davis, Nuno Bettencourt, Chad Smith and Vernon Reid made appearances. Actor Jason Momoa was the host for the festivities.",
      "\"Black Sabbath: we'd all be different people without them, that's the truth,\" said Pantera singer Phil Anselmo. \"I know I wouldn't be up here with a microphone in my hand without Black Sabbath.\"",
      "Outlandish exploits and a classic look",
      "Osbourne embodied the excesses of metal. His outlandish exploits included relieving himself on the Alamo, snorting a line of ants off a sidewalk and, most memorably, biting the head off a live bat that a fan threw onstage during a 1981 concert. (He said he thought it was rubber.)",
      "In a statement posted to its Facebook page Tuesday, the Alamo said it was \"saddened to hear\" of Osbourne's death.",
      "\"His relationship with the Alamo was marked initially by a deeply disrespectful incident in 1982,\" the statement reads. \"This act profoundly and rightfully upset many who hold this site sacred. However, redemption and reconciliation eventually became part of his history as well. In 1992, Ozzy personally apologized to then-Mayor Nelson Wolff and expressed genuine remorse for his actions. Decades later, in 2015, he revisited the Alamo grounds to learn and appreciate the site's profound history, openly demonstrating humility and understanding.\"",
      "Osbourne was sued in 1987 by parents of a 19-year-old teen who died by suicide while listening to his song \"Suicide Solution.\" The lawsuit was dismissed. Osbourne said the song was really about the dangers of alcohol, which caused the death of his friend Bon Scott, lead singer of AC/DC.",
      "Then-Cardinal John J. O'Connor of New York claimed in 1990 that Osbourne's songs led to demonic possession and even suicide. \"You are ignorant about the true meaning of my songs,\" the singer wrote back. \"You have also insulted the intelligence of rock fans all over the world.\"",
      "Audiences at Osbourne shows could be mooned or spit on by the singer. They would often be hectored to scream along with the song, but the Satan-invoking Osbourne would usually send the crowds home with their ears ringing and a hearty \"God bless!\"",
      "He started an annual tour \u2014 Ozzfest \u2014   in 1996 after he was rejected from the lineup of what was then the top touring music festival, Lollapalooza. Ozzfest has gone on to host such bands as Slipknot, Tool, Megadeth, Rob Zombie, System of a Down, Limp Bizkit and Linkin Park.",
      "Osbourne's look changed little over his life. He wore his long hair flat, heavy black eye makeup and round glasses, often wearing a cross around his neck. In 2013, he reunited with Black Sabbath for the dour, raw \"13,\" which reached No. 1 on the U.K. Albums Chart and peaked at No. 86 on the U.S. Billboard 200. In 2019, he had a Top 10 hit when featured on Post Malone's \"Take What You Want,\" Osbourne's first song in the Top 10 since 1989.",
      "In 2020, he released the album \"Ordinary Man,\" which had as its title song a duet with Elton John. \"I've been a bad guy, been higher than the blue sky/And the truth is I don't wanna die an ordinary man,\" he sang. In 2022, he landed his first career back-to-back No. 1 rock radio singles from his album \"Patient Number 9,\" which featured collaborations with Jeff Beck, Eric Clapton, Mike McCready, Chad Smith, Robert Trujillo and Duff McKagan. It earned four Grammy nominations.",
      "At the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony in 2024, Jack Black called him \"greatest frontman in the history of rock and roll\" and \"the Jack Nicholson of rock.\" Osbourne thanked his fans, his guitarist Randy Rhoads and his longtime wife, Sharon.",
      "The beginnings of Black Sabbath",
      "John Michael Osbourne was raised in the gritty city of Birmingham, England. Kids in school nicknamed him Ozzy, short for his surname. As a boy, he loved the Four Seasons, Chuck Berry and Little Richard. The Beatles made a huge impression.",
      "\"They came from Liverpool, which was approximately 60 miles north of where I come from,\" he told Billboard. \"So all of a sudden it was in my grasp, but I never thought it would be as successful as it became.\"",
      "In the late 1960s, Osbourne had teamed up with Butler, guitarist Tony Iommi and drummer Bill Ward as the Polka Tulk Blues Band. They decided to rename the band Earth, but found to their dismay there was another band with that name. So they changed the name to the American title of the classic Italian horror movie \"I Tre Volti Della Paura,\" starring Boris Karloff: Black Sabbath.",
      "Once they found their sludgy, ominous groove, the band was productive, putting out their self-titled debut and \"Paranoid\" in 1970, \"Master of Reality\" in 1971, \"Vol. 4\" in 1972 and \"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\" in 1973.",
      "The music was all about industrial guitar riffs and disorienting changes in time signatures, along with lyrics that spoke of alienation and doom. \"People think I'm insane because I am frowning all the time,\" Osbourne sang in one song. \"All day long I think of things but nothing seems to satisfy/Think I'll lose my mind if I don't find something to pacify.\"",
      "The Guardian newspaper in 2009 said the band \"introduced working-class anger, stoner sludge grooves and witchy horror-rock to flower power. Black Sabbath confronted the empty platitudes of the 1960s and, along with Altamont and Charles Manson, almost certainly helped kill off the hippy counterculture.\"",
      "After Sabbath, Osbourne had an uncanny knack for calling some of the most creative young guitarists to his side. When he went solo, he hired the brilliant innovator Rhoads, who played on two of Osbourne's finest solo albums, \"Blizzard of Ozz\" and \"Diary of a Madman.\" Rhoads was killed in a freak plane accident in 1982; Osbourne released the live album \"Tribute\" in 1987 in his memory.",
      "Osbourne then signed Jake E. Lee, who lent his talents to the platinum albums \"Bark at the Moon\" and \"The Ultimate Sin.\" Hotshot Zakk Wylde joined Osbourne's band for \"No Rest for the Wicked\" and the multiplatinum \"No More Tears.\"",
      "\"They come along, they sprout wings, they blossom, and they fly off,\" Osbourne said of his players in 1995 to The Associated Press. \"But I have to move on. To get a new player now and again boosts me on.\"",
      "Music world reacts to Osbourne's death",
      "Several musicians and celebrities, including Osbourne's Black Sabbath bandmates, took to social media to respond Tuesday to the news of his death.",
      "\"I just can't believe it! My dear dear friend Ozzy has passed away only weeks after our show at Villa Park,\" Black Sabbath guitarist and band co-founder Tony Iommi\u00a0wrote on X, referring to the farewell show earlier this month. \"It's just such heartbreaking news that I can't really find the words, there won't ever be another like him. Geezer, Bill and myself have lost our brother. My thoughts go out to Sharon and all the Osbourne family. Rest in peace Oz.\"",
      "Black Sabbath bassist Geezer Butler wrote on X: \"Goodbye dear friend - thanks for all those years - we had some great fun. 4 kids from Aston- who'd have thought, eh? So glad we got to do it one last time, back in Aston. Love you.\"",
      "On Instagram, Elton John described Osbourne as a \"dear friend and a huge trailblazer who secured his place in the pantheon of rock gods \u2014 a true legend. He was also one of the funniest people I've ever met. I will miss him dearly. To Sharon and the family, I send my condolences and love.\"",
      "Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood, who took part in Osbourne's farewell concert, wrote on X that he was \"so very sad to hear of the death of Ozzy Osbourne. What a lovely goodbye concert he had at Back To The Beginning in Birmingham.\"",
      "Kiss co-founder Gene Simmons called Osbourne a \"giant\" who was \"Admired and loved by millions of fans worldwide. Prayers and condolences go out to the Osborne family.\"",
      "Actor Jason Momoa, who hosted the farewell show, wrote on Instagram, \"Love you @ozzyosbourne All my aloha @sharonosbourne and ohana. So grateful. RIP.\"",
      "Mike McCready, lead guitarist and founding member of Pearl Jam, wrote on X that he discovered Black Sabbath's music in high school.",
      "\"'War Pigs' was terrifying and mesmerizing at the same time,\" McCready wrote. \"It was Ozzy's voice that took me away to a dark universe. A great escape. Then when The 'Blizzard of Ozz' record came out I was instantly a fan. Randy Rhoads was an influence on me to play lead guitar. Luckily I got to play on the song 'Immortal' on the last record. Thanks for the music, Ozzy it makes our journey in life better.\"",
      "Courting controversy \u2014 and wholesomeness",
      "Whomever he was playing with, Osbourne wasn't likely to back down from controversy. He had the last laugh when the TV evangelist the Rev. Jimmy Swaggart in 1986 lambasted various rock groups and rock magazines as \"the new pornography,\" prompting some retailers to pull Osbourne's album.",
      "When Swaggart later was caught with a sex worker in 1988, Osbourne put out the song \"Miracle Man\" about his foe: \"Miracle man got busted/miracle man got busted,\" he sang. \"Today I saw a Miracle Man, on TV cryin'/Such a hypocritical man, born again, dying.\"",
      "Much later, a whole new Osbourne would be revealed when \"The Osbournes,\" which ran on MTV from 2002-2005, showed this one-time self-proclaimed madman drinking Diet Cokes as he struggled to find the History Channel on his new satellite television or warning his kids not to smoke or drink before they embarked on a night on the town.",
      "Later, he and his son Jack toured America on the travel show \"Ozzy & Jack's World Detour,\" where the pair visited such places as Mount Rushmore and the Space Center Houston. Osbourne was honored in 2014 with the naming of a bat frog found in the Amazon that makes high-pitched, batlike calls. It was dubbed Dendropsophus ozzyi.",
      "He also met Queen Elizabeth II during her Golden Jubilee weekend. He was standing next to singer-actor Cliff Richard. \"She took one look at the two of us, said 'Oh, so this is what they call variety, is it?' then cracked up laughing. I honestly thought that Sharon had slipped some acid into my cornflakes that morning,\" he wrote in \"I Am Ozzy.\"",
      "Thelma Riley and Osbourne married in 1971; Osbourne adopted her son Elliot Kingsley, and they had two more children, Jessica and Louis. Osbourne later met Sharon, who became her own celebrity persona, when she was running her father's Los Angeles office. Her father was Don Arden, a top concert promoter and artist manager. She went to Osbourne's hotel in Los Angeles to collect money, which Osbourne had spent on drugs.",
      "\"She says she'll come back in three days and I'd better have it. I'd always fancied her and I thought, 'Ah, she's coming back! Maybe I have a chance.' I had pizza hanging from my hair, cigarette ashes on my shirt,\" he told the Los Angeles Times in 2000. They married in 1982, had three children \u2014 Kelly, Aimee and Jack \u2014 and endured periodic separations and reconciliations.",
      "He is survived by Sharon, and his children.",

      "Warner drowned Sunday afternoon in Cocles de Lim\u00f3n, on Costa Rica's Caribbean coast, the country's Judicial Investigation Department said. He appeared to have been pulled out to sea by a current.",
      "Warner was assisted by people who were at the beach, but he was declared dead by the staff of the Costa Rican Red Cross, the department said. An autopsy determined his cause of death to be asphyxiation by submersion.",
      "In a statement Monday, the Costa Rican Red Cross said it was alerted to a water accident on Sunday at 2:10 p.m. local time, and it dispatched three ambulances.",
      "The Red Cross said two adult men were treated on-site and one was transferred to a local clinic in critical condition. They tried to resuscitate Warner, but he didn't show vital signs and was declared dead. Costa Rica's Judicial Investigation Department said the other person involved in the incident had \"entered the sea to try to help Mr. Warner.\"",
      "Warner starred as Theo Huxtable on \"The Cosby Show\" from 1984 to 1992. His performance earned him an Emmy nomination for outstanding supporting actor in a comedy series in 1986.",
      "In 2023, Warner told CBS Pittsburgh that being part of \"The Cosby Show\" was an \"awesome\" experience.",
      "\"That show had such an impact on the culture here in America but also a global impact on how Black people saw ourselves globally and how the rest of the world saw us,\" he said. \"So I'm proud to have been part of that legacy and it's been a great ride ever since.\"",
      "Warner said in a 2015 interview with The Associated Press that he was saddened that the show's legacy was \"tarnished\" by \"Cosby Show\" patriarch Bill Cosby, who was\u00a0accused of sexual assault by multiple women. Cosby's\u00a0conviction in a Pennsylvania case\u00a0was later overturned.",
      "Warner went on to star in other TV shows, including \"Malcolm & Eddie\" (1996-2000), \"Reed Between the Lines\" (2011-2015) and \"The Resident\" (2018-2023). He also voiced The Producer on \"The Magic School Bus\" (1994-1997). He made his feature film debut in \"Drop Zone\" in 1994.",
      "Warner also directed episodes of several TV shows, including \"The Cosby Show,\" \"All That,\" \"Keenan & Kel\" and \"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,\" according to his biography on his website.",
      "Most recently, he appeared in a few episodes of \"Alert: Missing Persons Unit\" and was hosting the podcast \"Not All Hood,\" looking at the different experiences of Black Americans.",
      "Warner was also a poet and a musician. He won a Grammy for best traditional R&B performance in 2015 for his part in a cover of Stevie Wonder's \"Jesus Children of America,\" and was nominated for another Grammy for best spoken word poetry.",
      "Fellow poet and author Kevin Powell, who was a friend of Warner's, described him as a devoted husband and father who was humble, kind and supportive of other people.",
      "\"You would have never known he was a major child star,\" Powell said in an interview Monday with CBS News. \"He was never someone who was into the celebrity of it. He knew what he was. He knew, you know, that he was America's son. He literally was America's son as the only male child on that historic show, 'The Cosby Show.'\"",
      "Powell said he was struck by the emotional reactions from fans on social media. \"It's someone you came of age with,\" he said of Warner.",
      "Powell recalled publishing a poem Warner wrote in a special issue of the magazine \"African Voices\" for the 50th anniversary of hip-hop in 2023.",
      "Warner was a lifelong hip-hop fan, Powell said, but he also was \"concerned about a lot of the images that were being put out there.\"",
      "\"So that became kind of his thing in the last few years, like how are we representing ourselves as a community, as a people, with the art that we're creating?\" he said. \"That sticks with me because he was someone who understood he had a huge platform. He had a famous name and people would pay attention if he said certain things. ... That's who Malcolm-Jamal was.\"",
      "The news of Warner's death was \"devastating,\" a spokesperson for Bill Cosby said. The spokesperson, Andrew Wyatt, said Cosby compared it to learning of the death of his son Ennis, who was shot and killed in a robbery in 1997. \"It felt the same way,\" Wyatt said.",
      "Cosby shared a memory of Warner with CBS News' Jericka Duncan on Monday, saying, \"He was never afraid to go to his room and study and make sure he followed whatever he had learned in the acting school he went to.\"",

    "story": [
      "Restaurateur Keith McNally hates New Year's Eve \u2013 he doesn't like being told to have a good time. \"I don't like to be forced to enjoy myself,\" he said.",
      "The \"least hospitable man in hospitality,\" as he calls himself, is not a big smiler, either. \"Inside,\" he explained.",
      "It doesn't seem to have hurt. Over 40 years, he's opened some of New York City's most popular restaurants, among them The Odeon, Balthazar, and Pastis \u2013 institutions almost as well-known as some of the bold-face names that frequent them. But McNally himself has never been much of a publicity hound, even less so after suffering a stroke in 2016. \"Naturally I'm a bit embarrassed to be on TV talking like this\u2014who wouldn't be?\" he said. \"But it's good for me to do it, because it gets me free of my embarrassment. Actually, I'm embarrassed talking about embarrassment!\"",
      "But the British-born McNally has largely overcome his embarrassment in a new memoir, \"I Regret Almost Everything.\" \u00a0\"The drawback for me with most memoirs [is], if you're not embarrassed by what you write, you've probably not spoken the truth,\" he said. \"If you don't cringe over every word, it's not the truth.\"",
      "The hardest part to write, he said, was about his suicide attempt, \"because my kids. I didn't want to leave them at all.\"",
      "That suicide attempt was two years after his stroke. He was found by his younger son, George. \"He was supposed to not find me,\" McNally said. \"Like most teenagers he would sleep until noon. But that day he woke up early, at 8:00 o'clock.\"",
      "\"You expected him to be sleeping later, he woke up early, he saw you?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yeah, the bastard just woke up early and saved my life!\" he laughed.",
      "McNally might joke about it now, but the father of five was suffering with an immobile right arm (he was right-handed), back pain, and aphasia (which causes his slurred speech), and his second marriage was falling apart. But as he writes, some sobering words from a doctor made him reflect: \"He said that children who lose a parent to suicide were far more likely to kill themselves than the children of parents who don't. That stopped me in my tracks.\"",
      "Because he had such trouble communicating verbally after his stroke, McNally began using social media. \"I was so embarrassed by my speech and the way I looked, I didn't go to my restaurants for one year,\" he said. \"I was ashamed. But eventually I realized, nothing to be ashamed about. So, not only did I admit it wasn't a bad thing, but I went in on Instagram.\"",
      "McNally went viral in 2022 with a post criticizing former late-night host James Corden for allegedly being rude to the waitstaff at Balthazar. But now, McNally confesses in his book he isn't so sure calling out Corden was fair. He wrote: \"For someone who's hyperconscious of humiliation since suffering a stroke, it now seems monstrous that I didn't consider the humiliation I was subjecting Corden to. I felt like I'd hit the jackpot of a slot machine and thousands of gold coins were spilling out in front of me. That night I ended up with over 90,000 followers. I was intoxicated with self-righteousness.\"",
      "\"Uh-huh, it's true,\" McNally said. \"But afterwards, I felt really bad.\"",
      "Corden later apologized. But the 73-year-old McNally has continued creating a stir online. Take this recent post he wrote about his friend, ABC News' Diane Sawyer, describing a weeklong affair the two had in the 1970s. The story made news \u2026 except that it was completely made up.",
      "I said, \"Some people say, 'Listen, Keith, you know, it's really not cool for you to be sharing this.' And so, did you enjoy that back-and-forth with them?\"",
      "\"Yes. Yeah, I'm afraid, I did, yeah,\" he laughed.",
      "\"And I wonder, do you think that the stroke \u2013 I don't know, is that, does that \u2026\"",
      "\"Say what you think,\" said McNally.",
      "\"Well, is it that you feel a little trapped inside of yourself?\"",
      "\"No,\" he replied. \"I've always been a little like this inside. But since my stroke, and now on the outside.\"",
      "McNally grew up in the East End of London, one of four children born to Jack, a dockworker, and Joyce, a house and office cleaner. The family had little money. \"I got angry inside at my parents,\" he said, \"because we had no books in the house, no pictures on the walls. But they couldn't help it. They were working class who grew up with nothing.\"",
      "McNally says he didn't eat in a restaurant until he was 17. \"Most of the time, when we were on a holiday, we would go to the restaurant, they would look the prices outside, and then she'd go, 'Not for us.'\"",
      "And yet, when McNally moved to New York City in 1975 as an aspiring filmmaker, he made ends meet by working in restaurants. \"I didn't eat asparagus until I came here,\" he said. \"And the next day, I went to the doctor because the smell of my \u2026\"",
      "\"That was so pungent from eating the asparagus?\" I asked.",

      "\"Pepsi Prebiotic Cola represents the next leap forward in giving consumers choice, optionality and functional ingredients in their cola experience, without sacrificing the iconic Pepsi taste we're known for delivering,\" Ram Krishnan, CEO of PepsiCo Beverages U.S., said in a\u00a0statement.",

      "The product announcement comes only months after Pepsi\u00a0acquired Poppi, which is marketed as a healthier alternative for soda lovers, for nearly $2 billion. The low-calorie soda contains a mix of prebiotics, fruit juice and apple cider.",
      "The prebiotic and probiotic food and drink sector has grown quickly in recent years as consumers increasingly seek out gut-healthy alternatives to soda that contain less sugar.\u00a0According\u00a0to consulting firm Future Market Insights, the prebiotic soda market was valued at $262 million in 2024. Global sales are expected to grow 7.6% over the next 10 years.",

Two days after trying so-called 'magic mushrooms' for the first time, he boarded Alaska Air Flight 2059 as a passenger from Everett, Washington, to San Francisco. It was a full flight, with 83 other passengers and crew on board, so he was given the cockpit jump seat behind the pilot and first officer.",
      "\"Most consequential three seconds of my life\"",
      "Suddenly, he said he felt a sense of \"all-out panic and fear\" on the plane as the drugs altered his perception of reality.",
      "\"You're not going home. You need to wake up. That's when I acted. I pulled the handles that were in front of my face,\" Emerson recalled thinking as he pulled the handles that cut off fuel to the engines in the event of a fire.",

      "The flight was diverted and landed safely in Portland, Oregon, where Emerson was arrested. He's set to be arraigned next month on a federal charge of interfering with a flight crew, and faces a host of state charges including 83 misdemeanor counts of recklessly endangering another person and one felony count of first-degree endangering aircraft.",
      "The case reignited the conversation about barriers facing pilots when it comes to their mental health.",
      "Pilots' mental health",
      "Disclosing mental health issues can lead to a pilot being grounded by the Federal Aviation Administration, putting their ability to work at risk for an extended period of time, possibly lasting years. A 2022 study published in the Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine estimated 56% of pilots avoid seeking medical care due to fear of losing their certification to fly.",
      "\"I came to an understanding, or a misunderstanding, that I needed to be perfect on paper. I needed to show up and appear perfect, no matter what else was going on for me,\" Emerson said.",
      "The National Transportation Safety Board has since held a first of its kind pilot mental health forum to review existing pilot mental health rules. The FAA also launched a review of policies \u2013 both calling for changes to address barriers to care.",
      "\"We need to have a system that allows people to be more forthcoming and to have treatment for issues that shouldn't keep you out of the cockpit,\" then-FAA Administrator Michael Whitaker said months after the incident, in December 2023.",
      "The FAA review committee made 24 recommendations.",
      "Illinois Rep. Sean Casten and Minnesota Rep. Pete Stauber are leading an effort in Congress to enact reforms within two years, introducing the bipartisan\u00a0Mental Health in Aviation Act\u00a0to help pilots and air traffic controllers get access to mental health care and hire additional medical examiners.",
      "\"The goal really simply is to make our skies safer and make our pilots safer. That's it,\" Casten told \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "The bill would also require the FAA to annually review and update the process related to mental health-related special issuance of medical certificates to pilots and air traffic controllers, set aside 13.74 million dollars a year for the next three years to hire additional certified Aviation Medical Examiners, and authorize a three year $4.5 million dollar public information campaign aimed at destigmatizing mental health care among pilots and air traffic controllers.",
      "\"Our pilots and air traffic controllers are not going to lose their job when they ask for help. We in this country must recognize that that's strength. And they're not to be punished. We're going to help them, process them, and get them back into cockpits,\" Stauber added.",
      "The bill maintains the FAA's rigorous process for determining a pilot is safe to resume flying but aims to cut red tape and increase transparency. It has unanimously passed the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee last month and has the backing of the largest pilot unions. The bill has advanced to the House of Representatives for consideration. The FAA declined to comment on the bill.",

      "That includes expediting the construction of large-scale data centers, which house servers, networking gear and other technology used to power artificial intelligence.",

    "story": [
      "Millions of people with student loans who are enrolled in a popular repayment plan are now in limbo, with the Department of Education saying it has temporarily paused forgiveness for borrowers in its income-based repayment plan, or IBR.",
      "Such plans offer a double benefit for borrowers by lowering a person's monthly loan repayment to reflect their income, while also promising to provide forgiveness after a number of years. Specifically, the government can cancel the balance of student loan after people have made payments for at least 20 years.",
      "About 40% of the roughly 33 million people repaying student loans were enrolled in one of the Education Department's four such repayment plans at the end of 2024, according to data from the National Student Loan Data System and the Government Accountability Office.",
      "But three of those programs had previously been halted by a court ruling, while forgiveness for the roughly 2 million people enrolled in the fourth \u2014 IBR \u2014 is now also paused.",
      "On Tuesday, Education Department deputy press secretary Ellen Keast told CBS MoneyWatch that the agency \"has temporarily paused discharges for IBR borrowers in order to comply with ongoing court injunctions regarding the Biden Administration's illegal attempts at student loan forgiveness.\"",
      "The court injunctions stem from 2024\u00a0lawsuits related to the Biden administration's flagship student loan repayment plan, called the\u00a0Saving on a Valuable Education, or SAVE, plan. That initiative, created to fix long-standing issues with the Education Department's previous income-based plans, proved popular with borrowers, with almost 8 million enrollees at the end of 2024, National Student Loan Data System data shows.",
      "Because the SAVE plan could count toward loan discharges in the IBR program, the Education Department is now temporarily halting forgiveness for enrollees in that plan.

      "What income-driven repayment plans are legally blocked?",
      "Student loan forgiveness under three of the federal government's income-driven plans \u2014 SAVE; Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR); and Pay As You Earn (PAYE) \u2014 is currently paused after a court ruled last summer that Congress exceeded its authority in approving those plans.",
      "The legal action last year called into question whether student loan forgiveness was authorized under the federal statute that governs those plans. But the IBR plan was created under a different authority.",
      "When will the Education Department start forgiving loans again?",
      "The Education Department didn't specify a timeframe in its statement to CBS MoneyWatch. It noted that the SAVE plan allowed forbearances \u2014 when loan payments are temporarily halted or reduced \u2014 to be counted toward loan forgiveness, but that the rule was halted by the court ruling.",

      "\"This change is not related to tariffs or trade policies,\" the spokesperson said in a statement to CBS News. \"It reflects the reality of rising ingredient costs including the unprecedented cost of cocoa.\"",
      "Price increases typically take around 90 days to take effect, although the timeframe varies by retailer, the spokesperson added.",
      "Global cocoa shortage",
      "Cocoa prices have skyrocketed in recent years due to a global cocoa shortage. The cost for the commodity was $8,402 in June, a 73% increase from five years ago, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, which tracks food prices.",
      "The majority of the world's cocoa supply comes from Ghana and the Ivory Coast, which have faced heatwaves and heavy rain linked to climate change. These unfavorable weather conditions have led to diseases like Black pod rot, which kills cocoa crops. Chronic underinvestment in cocoa farms is another reason behind the spike in cocoa prices,\u00a0according to an article from J.P. Morgan Global Research.",
      "\"Cocoa is a market where the grower produces a very high-value good but receives a very low share of the actual value chain.

    "summary": "President Trump said he's \"thinking about\" eliminating capital gains tax on home sales. Here's what that would mean for the housing market.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Tuesday floated the possibility of eliminating the federal capital gains tax on home sales, in a move that would change the way real estate profits are taxed for the first time in 30 years.",
      "Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office on Tuesday, Mr. Trump suggested he is weighing supporting\u00a0legislation\u00a0introduced by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia that would nix the existing capital gains tax on home sales. Greene called the tax \"an outdated, unfair burden\u2014especially in today's housing market, where values have skyrocketed.\"",
      "\"We're thinking about that,\" Mr. Trump responded to a reporter, when asked how important it is that the capital gains tax be eliminated in order to \"unleash\" the housing market. \"It would also unleash it just by lowering the interest rates,\" the president said, adding, \"If the fed would lower the rates we wouldn't even have to do that. But we are thinking about no tax on capital gains on houses.\"",
      "Currently, single-tax filers can exclude up to $250,000 in capital gains from sales of their primary homes from their taxable incomes under what's called the Section 121\u00a0exclusion. That amount rises to $500,000 for joint filers. Both amounts have remained fixed since 1997.",
      "Reached for comment by CBS MoneyWatch, the White House said it had nothing additional to add to Mr. Trump's comments.",
      "\"Homeowners who have lived in their homes for decades, especially seniors in places where values have surged, shouldn't be forced to stay put because of an IRS penalty,\" Greene said in a statement announcing the proposed No Tax on Home Sales Act. \"My bill unlocks that equity, helps fix the housing shortage, and supports long-term financial security for American families.\"",
      "According to Research from the National Association of Realtors (NAR), the current federal policy on the capital gains tax on home sales is \"quietly distorting the housing market\" by \"locking in older homeowners, and strangling inventory just when America needs it most.\"",
      "\"Stay-put penalty\"",
      "A NAR study found that 34% of homeowners, or 29 million Americans, would exceed the $250,000 threshold were they to sell their homes, while 10%, or eight million Americans, would surpass the $500,000 threshold for joint filers.",
      "As a result, older homeowners are disincentivized to sell their homes, in what NAR researchers refer to as a \"stay-put penalty.\" For example, seniors who might otherwise consider moving closer to family, or downsizing, are staying in place \u2014 and keeping housing inventory tied up.",
      "\"This stagnation in housing turnover is rippling through the entire market, driving up costs and limiting opportunity \u2014 exactly the opposite of what public policy should be encouraging,\" Shannon McGahn, NAR executive vice president and chief advocacy officer,\u00a0 said in a statement. \"And it grows worse each month.\"",
      "Critics say eliminating the tax would only benefit wealthy Americans who can afford to pay tax on gains from home sales that exceed the limit.",
      "Joel Berner, senior economist at Realtor.com, told CBS MoneyWatch that a lot of home sellers already benefit from the $250,000 exclusion limit, and that eliminating the capital gains tax altogether would primarily benefit wealthier Americans who own residences that have appreciated by more than $250,000, or $500,000 in the case of joint filers.",
      "\"It wouldn't really move the needle for a regular family, unless you have a home that's appreciated a lot,\" Berner told CBS MoneyWatch. \"If your home has appreciated by more than $1 million, there would be a benefit to removing the capital gains tax.\"",
      "Inventory release",
      "He also suspects abolishing the capital gains tax on home sales would release inventory onto the housing market.",
      "\"It could be a good thing for the market. In particular where inventory is constrained, it could benefit regular folks,\" Berner said.",
      "By contrast, eliminating the federal tax would also erase revenue paid to the government, and could spark increased interest from investors and speculators, which could also drive up home values. That would contribute to the nation's housing affordability problem, according to Berner.",
      "Nearly 27% of all homes sold in the first three months of the year were bought by investors \u2014 the highest share in at least five years, according to a report by real estate data provider BatchData.",

    "summary": "Pepsi hops on another nutritional bandwagon as more consumers opt for prebiotic beverages.",
    "story": [
      "PepsiCo is introducing a new prebiotic soda this fall geared toward health-conscious customers.",
      "The food and beverage company said Monday that the new product is designed to meet changing consumer needs and offer \"more functional ingredients.\" The new drink, which will come in cola and cherry vanilla flavors, will contain five grams of cane sugar, three grams of prebiotic fiber and no artificial sweeteners, while a single serving will have 30 calories, according to Pepsi.",
      "\"Pepsi Prebiotic Cola represents the next leap forward in giving consumers choice, optionality and functional ingredients in their cola experience, without sacrificing the iconic Pepsi taste we're known for delivering,\" Ram Krishnan, CEO of PepsiCo Beverages U.S., said in a\u00a0statement.",
      "The new cola will be available for purchase online this fall and in stores next year, Pepsi said.",
      "The product announcement comes only months after Pepsi\u00a0acquired Poppi, which is marketed as a healthier alternative for soda lovers, for nearly $2 billion. The low-calorie soda contains a mix of prebiotics, fruit juice and apple cider.",
      "The prebiotic and probiotic food and drink sector has grown quickly in recent years as consumers increasingly seek out gut-healthy alternatives to soda that contain less sugar.\u00a0According\u00a0to consulting firm Future Market Insights, the prebiotic soda market was valued at $262 million in 2024. Global sales are expected to grow 7.6% over the next 10 years.",
      "\"Consumer demand is certainly moving healthier,\" said Christopher Palmedo, an associate professor at the CUNY Graduate School of Public Health & Health Policy. \"Decades ago, gargantuan Big Gulps were the rage. Now it's probiotic Pepsi.\"",
      "\"From a public health perspective, that's a good trend,\" Palmedo said, while noting that most beverages in the market, including probiotic drinks like Pepsi's are \"ultra-processed\" making their health claims questionable.",
      "While consumer preferences have shifted away from soda and toward healthier options, demand for carbonated drinks overall remains high. Nearly 80% U.S. consumers drink carbonated drinks at least once a week, according to Innova Market Insights.",
      "Pepsi is moving to introduce healthier offerings to boost lagging soda sales. On an earnings call last week, PepsiCo CEO Ramon Laguarta said the company will introduce protein-enhanced versions of its snacks and new protein beverages this year. He also said Pepsi will relaunch Lay's potato chips and Tostitos tortilla chips without artificial colors or ingredients.",
      "\"I think protein is clearly a subsegment in our food and beverages categories that is growing fast,\" Laguarta said in the July 17 call. \"Consumers are adopting protein solutions in the diet at a pace that was not the case in a few months back, a few years back.\"",

    "summary": "The Pumpkin Spice Latte will soon return to Starbucks' menus, marking the unofficial start of fall for fans of the autumn-inspired beverage.",
    "story": [
      "The official start of fall is still months away, but the season is just around the corner for Starbucks fans.",
      "The coffee chain's popular Pumpkin Spice Latte is set to return on Aug. 26, Starbucks announced Monday. Although that's a later release date than last year, the 2025 return of the PSL is still on the earlier side for the company, which traditionally had waited until September to bring back the seasonal drink, closer to the actual start of autumn, which falls on Sept. 22 this year.",
      "The popular menu item consists of espresso, milk, Pumpkin Spice Syrup and whipped cream, with pumpkin pie spice sprinkled on top. The coffee chain started adding real pumpkin to the drink in 2015.",
      "The return of the Pumpkin Spice Latte as well as Starbucks' new fall menu comes at a critical juncture for Starbucks, which is pulling all of the levers it can to lure customers back into its stores. After enjoying years of strong growth, the company's progress has stalled, with U.S. same-store sales slipping 2% last year.",
      "The return of the Pumpkin Spice Latte as well as new menu items are \"cultural touchstones that spark connection, nostalgia and excitement,\" said Starbucks global chief brand officer Tressie Leiberman in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The perennial debut of the Pumpkin Spice Latte may not be enough on its own to turn around the fate of Starbucks. But if past years are any indication, it's sure to be a crowd pleaser and revenue booster.",
      "What is on Starbucks' new 2025 fall menu?",
      "Starbucks said several other fall-inspired drinks will be returning to its menu, including the Pumpkin Cream Cold Brew, Iced Pumpkin Cream Chai and the Pecan Crunch Oatmilk Latte.",
      "The chain is also adding a new fall drink, called the Pecan Oatmilk Cortado, with Leiberman describing it as combining \"fall flavors with our bold espresso.\" Starbucks is also adding a fall menu item, Italian Sausage Egg Bites.",
      "The rollout of the new fall menu comes amid CEO Brian Niccol's\u00a0\"Back to Starbucks\" campaign, which he rolled out in September of last year to increase foot traffic in the chain's stores and revive sales.",
      "The rise of PSL",
      "Starbucks introduced the drink in 2003 after a months-long brainstorming session to create the company's first fall beverage. Led by Peter Dukes, who is credited as the father of the drink, the group's goal was to match the success of the peppermint mocha.",
      "Little did they know it would become their most popular seasonal beverage of all time. Since debuting over 20 years ago, the Pumpkin Spice Latte, also known by its initials PSL, has skyrocketed in popularity, with hundreds of millions of beverages sold.",
      "\"Nobody knew at the beginning what it would grow to be,\" Dukes\u00a0said in a story posted on the Starbucks website for the beverage's 20-year anniversary. \"Twenty years later, it's taken on a life of its own.\"",
      "Starbucks initially considered naming the drink the fall harvest latte, but changed it to the Pumpkin Spice Latte \"because the spices play a really important role in bringing out the flavors of pumpkin,\" Dukes said in a Starbucks post.",
      "The Starbucks-induced pumpkin craze led Merriam-Webster to add the \"pumpkin spice\" to the dictionary in 2022. It also prompted other chains like Dunkin' and McDonald's to introduce their own pumpkin-inspired beverages in 2007 and 2013, respectively.",
      "Mentions of pumpkin spice on U.S. menus climbed nearly 34% from 2014 to 2024, according to Technomic, which tracks consumer and menu trends.",

    "published": "Tue, 22 Jul 2025 12:52:53 -0400",
    "summary": "More than three-quarters of Americans fear Social Security won't provide enough to live on when they retire, AARP study finds.",
    "story": [
      "Social Security is facing a growing number of challenges that threaten to undermine the retirement program's stability even as more retirees today say they urgently need the monthly payments compared with 20 years ago, according to a new AARP survey.",
      "About two-thirds of retirees said they substantially rely on Social Security for retirement income, or plan to do so, according to the survey, which polled more than 1,200 retirees as well as more than 2,000 younger Americans. When the advocacy group for older Americans asked the same question in 2005, about half of retirees indicated a heavy reliance on their monthly checks.",
      "The surge in retirees who largely rely on Social Security income to make ends meet comes as the program faces key challenges, from recent staffing cuts to a long-term financial crunch that could cause payments to be slashed starting in 2034.",
      "The AARP survey, conducted to mark the 90th anniversary of President Franklin D. Roosevelt signing the Social Security Act on August 14, 1935, underscores both the ever-growing importance of the program as well as its vulnerabilities.",
      "\"More than three-quarters of people in the U.S. \u2014 78% \u2014 are worried that Social Security won't provide enough to live on during retirement,\" AARP CEO Myechia Minter-Jordan said in a conference call to discuss the group's findings. \"That's an increase from five years ago, when 74%\" expressed concern.\"",
      "Confidence in the future of Social Security is also declining, with only 36% of Americans today saying they believe it will continue to pay out reliably and at the same level, a dip of seven percentage points from 2020, the study found. At the same time, 96% of Americans said they believed Social Security is important, with little difference between age groups or political party affiliations, AARP said.",
      "\"We're concerned that faith in the system ... is waning,\" Minter-Jordan added. \"We're concerned about their confidence that they will be able to receive benefits that they have paid into over time.\"",
      "Americans in their 30s are the most pessimistic about the future of Social Security, although confidence in the program's outlook tends to rise as people approach retirement age and get closer to claiming their benefits, the study found.",
      "\"Younger people have always underestimated how important Social Security will be to them in the future,\" Bill Sweeney, senior vice president of government affairs at AARP, said on the call.",
      "He added, \"Receiving Social Security changes how people view the program. They realize how important that inflation-adjusted treatment income is.\"",
      "The Social Security Administration didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about the survey's findings.",
      "Social Security filings at a record",
      "Meanwhile, Social Security Administration data shows that Americans are filing for benefits at a record rate in 2025. This comes as experts are pointing to rising concerns about the program's reliability and future solvency, given job cuts at the agency and other changes.",
      "Wealth inequality is also a growing issue among retirees, with some white-collar workers heading into their golden years with hefty retirement savings thanks to corporate 401(k) programs with company matches. But about half of all private-sector workers lack access to corporate retirement accounts, creating hurdles for saving for retirement, a recent Pew Charitable Trusts study found.",
      "Last year, a record 68 million retirees, disabled people and survivors of deceased workers relied on Social Security, a 42% jump from two decades ago,\u00a0data shows. The number of Social Security beneficiaries is forecast to swell to 82 million by 2035, AARP said.",
      "Despite the retirement program's importance, many Americans lack a grasp of the basics of Social Security, the new AARP study also found. For instance, only 24% of those surveyed correctly identified 70 years old as the age at which individuals can maximize their Social Security benefits.",
      "And about one-third of respondents said the potential insolvency of the Social Security trust funds would lead to a complete cessation of benefits, which is false. If the trust funds aren't shored up and they run out of money, which is currently forecast to occur in 2034, monthly benefits would be reduced by about 20%.",

    "published": "Tue, 22 Jul 2025 07:06:58 -0400",
    "summary": "The Labor Department is seeking to pull back on the regulation of workplaces by rewriting or repealing more than 60 \"obsolete\" regulations.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Department of Labor is aiming to rewrite or repeal more than 60 \"obsolete\" workplace regulations, ranging from minimum wage requirements for home health care workers and people with disabilities to standards governing exposure to harmful substances.",
      "If approved, the wide-ranging changes unveiled this month also would affect working conditions at constructions sites and in mines, and limit the government's ability to penalize employers if workers are injured or killed while engaging in inherently risky activities such as movie stunts or animal training.",
      "The Labor Department says the goal is to reduce costly, burdensome rules imposed under previous administrations, and to deliver on President Trump's commitment to restore American prosperity through deregulation.",
      "\"The Department of Labor is proud to lead the way by eliminating unnecessary regulations that stifle growth and limit opportunity,\" Secretary of Labor Lori Chavez-DeRemer said in a statement, which boasted the \"most ambitious proposal to slash red tape of any department across the federal government.\"",
      "Critics say the proposals would put workers at greater risk of harm, with women and members of minority groups bearing a disproportionate impact.",
      "\"People are at very great risk of dying on the job already,\" Rebecca Reindel, the AFL-CIO union's occupational safety and health director, said. \"This is something that is only going to make the problem worse.\"",
      "The proposed changes have several stages to get through before they can take effect, including a public comment period for each one.",
      "Some rollbacks under consideration",
      "Home health care workers help elderly or medically fragile people by preparing meals, administering medications, assisting with toilet use, accompanying clients to doctor appointments and performing other tasks. Under one of the Labor Department's proposals, an estimated 3.7 million workers employed by home care agencies could be paid below the federal minimum wage - currently $7.25 per hour - and made ineligible for overtime pay if they aren't covered by corresponding state laws.",
      "The proposed rule would reverse changes made in 2013 under former President Barack Obama and revert to a regulatory framework from 1975. The Labor Department says that by lowering labor and compliance costs, its revisions might expand the home care market and help keep frail individuals in their homes longer.",
      "Judy Conti, director of government affairs at the National Employment Law Project, said her organization plans to work hard to defeat the proposal. Home health workers are subject to injuries from lifting clients, and \"before those (2013) regulations, it was very common for home care workers to work 50, 60 and maybe even more hours a week without getting any overtime pay,\" Conti said.",
      "Others endorse the proposal, including the Independent Women's Forum, a conservative nonprofit based in Virginia. Women often bear the brunt of family caregiving responsibilities, so making home care more affordable would help women balance work and personal responsibilities, the group's president, Carrie Lukas, said.",
      "\"We're pleased to see the Trump administration moving forward on rolling back some of what we saw as counterproductive micromanaging of relationships that were making it hard for people to get the care they need,\" Lukas said.",
      "Samantha Sanders, director of government affairs and advocacy at the nonprofit Economic Policy Institute, said the repeal wouldn't constitute a win for women.",
      "\"Saying we actually don't think they need those protections would be pretty devastating to a workforce that performs really essential work and is very heavily dominated by women, and women of color in particular,\" Sanders said.",
      "Migrant farmworkers",
      "Last year, the Labor Department finalized rules that provided protections to migrant farmworkers who held H-2A visas. The current administration says most of those rules placed unnecessary and costly requirements on employers.",
      "Under the new proposal, the Labor Department would rescind a requirement for most employer-provided transportation to have seat belts for those agriculture workers.",
      "The department is also proposing to reverse a 2024 rule that protected migrant farmworkers from retaliation for activities such as filing a complaint and testifying or participating in an investigation, hearing or proceeding.",
      "\"There's a long history of retaliation against workers who speak up against abuses in farm work. And with H-2A it's even worse because the employer can just not renew your visa,\" said Lori Johnson, senior attorney at Farmworker Justice.",
      "Michael Marsh, president and CEO of the National Council of Agricultural Employers, applauded the deregulation efforts, saying farmers have been hit with thousands of pages of regulations pertaining to migrant farmworkers in recent years.",
      "\"Can you imagine a farmer and his or her spouse trying to navigate 3,000 new pages of regulation in 18 months and then be liable for every one of them?\" he asked.",
      "Construction workers",
      "The Occupational Safety and Health Administration, part of the Labor Department, wants to rescind a requirement for employers to provide adequate lighting at construction sites, saying the regulation doesn't substantially reduce a significant risk.",
      "OSHA said if employers fail to correct lighting deficiencies at construction worksites, the agency can issue citations under its \"general duty clause.\" The clause requires employers to provide a place of employment free from recognized hazards that are likely to cause death or serious physical harm.",
      "Worker advocates think getting rid of a specific construction site requirement is a bad idea. \"There have been many fatalities where workers fall through a hole in the floor, where there's not adequate lighting,\" Reindel said. \"It's a very obvious thing that employers should address, but unfortunately it's one of those things where we need a standard, and it's violated all the time.\"",
      "Miners and more",
      "Several proposals could impact safety procedures for mines. For example, employers have to submit plans for ventilation and preventing roof collapses in coal mines for review by the Labor Department's Mine Safety and Health Administration. Currently, MSHA district managers can require mine operators to take additional steps to improve those plans.",
      "The Labor Department wants to end that authority, saying current regulations give the district manager the ability to draft and create laws without soliciting comments or action by Congress.",
      "Similarly, the department is proposing to strip district managers of their ability to require changes to mine health and safety training programs.",
      "The general duty clause allows OSHA to punish employers for unsafe working conditions when there's no specific standard in place to cover a situation.",
      "An OSHA proposal would exclude the agency from applying the clause to prohibit, restrict or penalize employers for \"inherently risky professional activities that are intrinsic to professional, athletic, or entertainment occupations.\"",
      "A preliminary analysis identified athletes, actors, dancers, musicians, other entertainers and journalists as among the types of workers the limitation would apply to.",
      "\"It is simply not plausible to assert that Congress, when passing the Occupational Safety and Health Act, silently intended to authorize the Department of Labor to eliminate familiar sports and entertainment practices, such as punt returns in the NFL, speeding in NASCAR, or the whale show at SeaWorld,\" the proposed rule reads.",
      "Debbie Berkowitz, who served as OSHA chief of staff during the Obama administration, said she thinks limiting the agency's enforcement authority would be a mistake.",
      "\"Once you start taking that threat away, you could return to where they'll throw safety to the wind, because there are other production pressures they have,\" Berkowitz said.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission is recalling roughly 5 million above-ground pools linked to the deaths of nine children over the last two decades.",
      "The federal agency said in a recall\u00a0notice\u00a0that the pools, which were manufactured in China and sold by multiple U.S. vendors, have a compression strap along the outside that can allow children to gain access and drown. Children are able to enter the pool even when the ladder is removed, the CPSC said.",
      "The children who drowned were between 22 months and 3 years old, according to the agency. The deaths took place between 2007 and 2002 in California, Texas, Florida, Michigan, Wisconsin and Missouri. The CPSC said it's also aware of three separate instances when children gained access to the recalled pools using the compression strap.",
      "The pools, which are 48 inches high and taller, have been sold by outdoor recreation companies Bestway, Intex and Polygroup since 2002 at retail stores across the U.S., including Amazon.com, Lowe's, Target and Walmart, among others. Over 250,000 were also sold in Canada. They range in price from $400 to over $1,000, according to the CPSC.",
      "In a statement to CBS MoneyWatch, a spokesperson for Bestway, Intex and Polygroup said the three companies started working with the CPSC in 2023 to update the safety standard for above-ground pools. The updated standard, finalized in May 2025, \"aims to prevent unsupervised children from gaining a foothold on the products from compression straps that surround the outside of the pool legs,\" the companies' statement said.",
      "The recall, issued jointly by the CPSC and Bestway, Intex and Polygroup, was made to ensure that the new changes be applied to \"all above-ground pools sold since 2002 that are 48 inches or taller in height,\" according to the statement.",
      "Consumers are encouraged to contact Bestway, Intex and Polygroup for a free repair kit, which includes a rope used to maintain the structural integrity of the pool. The recall number is 25-393.",

    "story": [
      "Trump Media and Technology Group, the social media company owned by President Trump, said it has bought about $2 billion in bitcoin and related securities as it remodels itself as an investment firm.",
      "Trump Media, which owns the Truth Social app, announced in May that it planned to raise $2.5 billion to buy bitcoin, with the goal of creating a reserve of the cryptocurrency. The $2 billion bitcoin purchase is part of the company's \"bitcoin treasury plan,\" Trump Media CEO Devin Nunes said in a news release on Monday.",
      "Mr. Trump, the largest investor in Trump Media, has increasingly focused on cryptocurrencies both through his private businesses and his administration. The company's $2 billion bitcoin purchase comes as Trump Media looks to roll out a range of investment products, including a plan to sell exchange-traded funds, or ETFs.",
      "The bitcoin purchase will \"help ensure our Company's financial freedom, help protect us against discrimination by financial institutions and will create synergies with the utility token we're planning to introduce across the Truth Social ecosphere,\" Nunes said in a statement.",
      "The company also said it has set aside $300 million for an \"options acquisition strategy for bitcoin-related securities.\" Trump Media said it plans to continue acquiring bitcoin.",
      "Shares of Trump Media rose $1.04, or 5.6%, to $19.71 in Monday morning trading. The stock has declined 42% this year.",

      "What is a crypto treasury strategy?",
      "A crypto treasury strategy involves buying and holding cryptocurrencies, similar to how companies may invest in more traditional assets like bonds to provide them with financial flexibility.",

It owns 607,000 bitcoins \u2014 worth more than $72 billion at today's bitcoin price \u2014 making it the largest public bitcoin treasury company,\u00a0according\u00a0to Bitcointreasuries.net.",
      "Saylor's company uses a variety of strategies, such as selling shares or issuing debt, to keep expanding its bitcoin holdings. As the digital currency's price has soared to more than $118,000, shooting up 74% over the last year alone, Strategy's stock price has followed, surging more than 3,500% since 2020.",
      "That success has also spawned many imitators, while the White House invited him to its Digital Assets Summit earlier this year.",
      "The Trump administration is planning a new U.S. \"strategic reserve\" of crypto assets. Last week, Mr. Trump signed the\u00a0GENIUS Act, the first major law governing digital currency.",

    "story": [
      "A former chief executive of two clothing technology companies was released on $1 million bail Friday after pleading not guilty to charges alleging she cheated investors out of over $300 million over the past six years.",
      "Christine Hunsicker, 48, of Lafayette, New Jersey, was charged with six counts, including fraud, aggravated identity theft and false statement charges in the indictment in Manhattan federal court.",
      "U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton said in a release that Hunsicker forged documents, fabricated audits and made material misrepresentations about her company's financial condition to defraud investors in CaaStle Inc. and P180.",
      "\"As alleged, Christine Hunsicker defrauded investors of hundreds of millions of dollars through document forgery, fabricated audits, and material misrepresentations about her company's financial condition,\" Clayton said in a statement on Friday. \"The promise of pre-IPO technology companies can be fertile ground for fraudsters who play on investor euphoria.\"",
      "The indictment\u00a0said Hunsicker, once portrayed as an on-the-rise fashion entrepreneur, portrayed CaaStle as a high-growth, private company with substantial cash on hand when she knew it faced significant financial distress.",
      "In a statement, defense lawyers Michael Levy and Anna Skotko said prosecutors \"have chosen to present to the public an incomplete and very distorted picture in today's indictment,\" despite Hunsicker's efforts to be \"fully cooperative and transparent\" with prosecutors and the Securities and Exchange Commission.",
      "\"There is much more to this story, and we look forward to telling it,\" they said.",
      "Hunsicker did not comment as she left the courthouse with Skotko after entering the not-guilty plea and agreeing to the rules of her $1 million bail, which included not having any contact with former or current investors or employees.",
      "According to the indictment, Hunsicker continued her fraudulent scheme even after the CaaStle board of directors removed her and prohibited her from soliciting investments or taking other actions on the company's behalf.",
      "She \"persisted in her scheme\" even after law enforcement agents confronted her over the fraud, the indictment said.",
      "Before the fraud allegations emerged, Hunsicker seemed to be a rising star in the fashion world after she was named to Crain's New York Business \"40 under 40\" lists, was selected as one of Inc.'s \"Most Impressive Women Entrepreneurs\" and was recognized by the National Retail Federation as someone shaping the future of retail, the indictment noted.",
      "At a time when the business was in financial distress with limited cash available and significant expenses, CaaStle was valued by Hunsicker at $1.4 billion, the indictment said.",
      "Hunsicker was lying to investors in February 2019 and continued to do so through this March, prosecutors alleged.",
      "They said she fed investors falsely inflated income statements, fake audited financial statements, fictitious bank account records and sham corporate records.",
      "She allegedly told one investor in August 2023 that CaaStle reported an operating profit of nearly $24 million in the second quarter of 2023 when its operating profit that quarter was actually less than $30,000.",
      "The indictment alleged that she carried out the majority of the fraud by bilking CaaStle investors of $275 million before forming P180 last year to infuse CaaStle with cash before its investors could discover her fraud.",
      "Through misrepresentations and omissions, she cheated P180 investors out of about $30 million, the indictment said.",
      "It said CaaStle filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy last month, leaving hundreds of investors holding now-worthless CaaStle shares. Hunsicker was forced to resign from CaaStle's board in December and formally resigned as chief executive in March.",
      "In a related civil filing, the SEC said Hunsicker's \"fake financials\" supported her narrative that CaaStle was nearing an initial public offering or sale in late 2022 as it enjoyed rapid and steady revenue growth after launching a new monetization model called \"Clothing-as-a-Service.\"",
      "\"In reality, CaaStle's revenues were shrinking, its losses were increasing, and the company was never profitable,\" the lawsuit said. \"Not a single existing or prospective CaaStle investor received accurate monthly, quarterly, or annual CaaStle financial statements from Hunsicker.\"",
      "Before CaaStle, Hunsicker launched Gwynnie Bee, a subscription service renting everyday clothes to women sizes 10 to 32.",
      "\"We want it to be a place where managing a rotating wardrobe is actually the way the majority of people interact with clothing,\" Hunsicker told CBS News in 2016 when discussing the company.",
      "Previously, Hunsicker was also the COO and president of Right Media, an online advertising startup that sold to Yahoo! for $850 million, and then became the COO of Drop.io, an online file sharing service that was purchased by Facebook.",

      "Lawler had been considering a gubernatorial run, among the Republicans looking to challenge incumbent Gov. Kathy Hochul in next year's statewide election. But he said in an interview Wednesday morning that he intends to stay in the House representing the 17th Congressional District.",
      "\"There's no question Kathy Hochul is the worst governor in America,\" Lawler told \"Fox and Friends.\" \"But after months of deliberating over this and really working through it, I've decided the right thing to do for me and my family and my district is to run for reelection. My seat was determinative of control of the House back in 2022 and again in 2024. I'm one of only three Republicans that won a seat that Kamala Harris also won. Keeping the House majority is critical if we are going to continue to move this economy in the right direction.\"",
      "Lawler's seat has been targeted by Democrats in past election cycles and is a key part of Republicans' current narrow House majority.",
      "Later, Lawler couldn't resist taking a shot at Hochul, telling CBS News New York's Marcia Kramer, \"New York leads the nation in out migration, not because of the weather but because of its policies. It has the most awful business climate, the highest taxes.\"",
      "Hochul responded on social media, saying, \"This is the same Mike Lawler who caved to Trump the minute he asked to rip away New Yorkers' health care. Of course he doesn't have the spine to face me.\"",
      "Hochul also posted a tweet of dog biscuits, calling it \"A treat for Donald Trump's Good Boy,\" and later at a press conference on public safety said, \"Lawler barely doesn't have the courage to stand up to me or to Donald Trump. I'm not surprised, but all I know is that not only will he not be governor, he won't be much ... he won't be a congressman for much longer.\"",
      "N.Y. governor's race draws attention of President Trump",
      "President Trump appeared to weigh in on the governor's race back in May, with what experts said was a not-so-subtle attempt to clear the field for upstate Rep. Elise Stefanik to get the GOP nomination. Mr. Trump had initially tapped Stefanik to serve as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, but she\u00a0withdrew her name from consideration\u00a0two months later as Mr. Trump asked her to stay in Congress to protect Republicans' razor-thin majority.",
      "In a pair of social media posts on May 6, Mr. Trump\u00a0endorsed Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman\u00a0for reelection this November and\u00a0Lawler\u00a0for reelection in 2026.",
      "\"As I've said repeatedly, you know, when it comes to deciding about whether to run for governor or reelection, I'll be making that decision in June, and so we're still going through that process,\" Lawler responded at the time.",
      "\"Mike Lawler is a great, effective, and hardworking Representative for New York's 17th Congressional District and is committed to protecting the House Republican Majority. As I have previously stated, I am focused on supporting strong Republican local and county candidates on the ballot this November to lay the groundwork with a strong team for next year,\" Stefanik wrote in a statement Wednesday. \"I will make a final decision and announcement after this year's November election which we are all focused on.\"",
      "Hochul and Stefanik recently\u00a0sparred during a congressional hearing on sanctuary policies, and the governor has said\u00a0\"bring it on\" to whomever she faces\u00a0next fall. Meanwhile, her number two, Lt. Gov. Antonio Delgado, is\u00a0also running to replace her.",
      "\"Under Kathy Hochul's failed Far Left Democrat rule, a radical Communist Defund-the-Police Antisemite may be elected mayor of New York City, a CBP officer was just brutally shot in the face by an illegal in NY due to dangerous sanctuary state laws, and New Yorkers are fleeing the highest-taxed state in the nation,\" Stefanik wrote.",
      "Mike Lawler launches crusade against Zohran Mamdani",
      "Lawler told CBS News New York if Queens Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani wins the New York City mayor's race, Republicans will have no problem keeping control of the House during the midterm elections.",
      "\"I don't think there's any question. If Zohran Mamdani becomes mayor of New York City, he becomes the face of the Democratic party, and his policies will absolutely be on the ballot in 2026,\" Lawler said.",
      "Just hours after announcing he wouldn't be running for governor, Lawler upped the anti-Mamdani crusade, introducing something he called the \"Mamdani Act,\" a bill that seeks a probe by the Federal Trade Commission into the effects of one of Mamdani's signature proposals -- city-run grocery stores. Lawler wants the FTC to study the consequences of using tax dollars to compete against private grocers and bodegas.",

    "summary": "U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis barred federal immigration authorities from immediately taking Kilmar Abrego Garcia into custody once he is released from criminal confinement in Tennessee.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Wednesday barred federal immigration authorities from immediately taking Kilmar Abrego Garcia into custody once he is released from criminal confinement in Tennessee and ordered the Trump administration to provide him 72 hours' notice if it plans to initiate proceedings to remove him to a country that is not his place of origin.",
      "The order from U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis was issued as a federal judge in Tennessee, who is presiding over Abrego Garcia's criminal case, ruled that the Salvadoran national should be released from the custody of federal law enforcement under conditions that will be set by a magistrate judge.",
      "The Tennessee judge, Waverly Crenshaw, denied the Justice Department's request to revoke an order allowing Abrego Garcia to be released while awaiting a criminal trial, writing that the government \"failed to carry its burden of showing that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure Abrego's appearance or the safety of others.\"",
      "But Abrego Garcia will not be released from criminal custody immediately. The magistrate judge overseeing his case granted a request from his lawyers, made last week, to hold off on issuing the order directing Abrego Garcia's release for 30 days. The judge said he will continue to remain in the custody of U.S. Marshals.",
      "\"These rulings are a powerful rebuke of the government's lawless conduct and a critical safeguard for Kilmar's due process rights,\" Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, an attorney for Abrego Garcia, said in a statement. \"A federal judge has now barred ICE from taking him back into custody and ordered that any future deportation attempt must come with advance notice. After the government unlawfully deported him once without warning, this legal protection is essential.\"",
      "Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, attacked Xinis for her decision.",
      "\"The fact this unhinged judge is trying to tell ICE they can't arrest an MS-13 gang member, indicted by a grand jury for human trafficking, and subject to immigration arrest under federal law is LAWLESS AND INSANE,\" she said in a statement.",
      "Abrego Garcia was charged with two criminal counts of human smuggling last month and has pleaded not guilty. While a magistrate judge said he should be released from the custody of U.S. Marshals ahead of a trial, set to begin in January, the order prompted concerns that Abrego Garcia would then be swiftly detained by federal immigration authorities and deported.",
      "But Xinis' order limits the Trump administration's ability to swiftly remove him from the U.S. In addition to blocking Trump administration officials from taking Abrego Garcia into custody upon his release in Tennessee, Xinis ordered the Department of Homeland Security to return him to supervised release under U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Baltimore field office. She said Abrego Garcia should be returned to Maryland, where he lives with his family.",
      "Under that supervision order, issued in 2019, Abrego Garcia had permission to live in Maryland, as well as authorization to work. He was required to check in with an immigration officer at the ICE office in Baltimore. Court filings indicate Abrego Garcia was in compliance with ICE supervision order when he was deported to El Salvador.",
      "Xinis said her relief allows the Trump administration to initiate immigration proceedings once Abrego Garcia returns to Maryland, but said those proceedings must begin in Baltimore, which was handling the earlier ICE supervision order.",
      "\"Once Abrego Garcia is restored under the ICE Supervision Order out of the Baltimore Field Office, defendants may take whatever action is available to them under the law,\" Xinis said.",
      "Xinis, who sits on the federal district court in Maryland, wrote that she \"must accord modest relief\" that ensures Abrego Garcia is not subject to \"re-deportation without due process\" and ensures the fulfillment of her order earlier this year that required the Trump administration to return him to the U.S. from El Salvador.",
      "Administration officials, she wrote, \"have done little to assure the court that absent intervention, Abrego Garcia's due process rights will be protected.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia, who entered the U.S. illegally in 2011, was detained by ICE in March and sent to a Salvadoran prison along with hundreds of other deportees despite a 2019 court order that barred him from being sent back to El Salvador due to a fear of persecution by gangs. The Trump administration acknowledged Abrego Garcia's deportation to El Salvador was an \"administrative error,\" but he remained there for months \u2014 despite Xinis ordering the government to facilitate his return \u2014 until he was brought to Tennessee to face criminal charges.",
      "While the magistrate judge said he should be released pending trial, the prospect that Abrego Garcia would then swiftly be detained by the Department of Homeland Security for removal proceedings created a new tangle for the courts to unravel. He has remained in the custody of U.S. Marshals as the legal proceedings have continued.",
      "Abrego Garcia's lawyers asked the Tennessee court last week to put off his release from custody for 30 days if Crenshaw denied the Justice Department's bid to keep him in confinement while awaiting trial \u2014 which the judge did Wednesday.",
      "Abrego Garcia's lawyers said in seeking the delay in his release last week that they had been advised by the government that \"if the court denies the government's motion for revocation, the defendant would be transferred to the custody of the Department of Homeland Security ('DHS'), and DHS would begin removal proceedings.\"",
      "But earlier this month, Xinis heard testimony about how Abrego Garcia's deportation proceedings could be handled by ICE. An immigration official told the judge that if Abrego Garcia were to be released from pretrial detention in Tennessee, the agency had not determined where he would be sent.",
      "\"There's been no decision made, as he is not in ICE custody,\" Thomas Giles, assistant director for ICE enforcement and removal operations, testified in federal court in Maryland.",
      "Giles was in court after Xinis ordered the government to produce someone with firsthand knowledge of any third country other than El Salvador where Abrego Garcia could be deported to if he were released from criminal custody.",
      "If Abrego Garcia were to receive a notice of removal, up until his deportation, he would be able to express fear about going to a third country, a period of time that could range from \"a day to a week,\" Giles said.",
      "In a hearing on June 26, Justice Department attorney Jonathan Guynn said that if the Salvadoran man were to be released, ICE would begin removal proceedings to a third country, which is one that is not the country of origin, instead of his native El Salvador.",
      "During the arguments earlier this month, Xinis said she was not willing to allow for an \"unfettered release\" of Abrego Garcia into ICE custody so he can be \"spirited away\" and removed from the U.S. before she rules.",
      "\"We're a court of laws and we don't operate on 'take my word for it,'\" Xinis said. \"From day one, you have taken the presumption of regularity and destroyed it in my view.\"",

      "\"The facts and circumstances surrounding both your and Mr. Epstein's cases have received immense public interest and scrutiny,\" Republican Rep. James Comer of Kentucky, the chairman of the committee, wrote to Maxwell.",
      "Comer said the committee is seeking Maxwell's testimony \"to inform the consideration of potential legislative solutions to improve federal efforts to combat sex trafficking and reform the use of non-prosecution agreements and/or plea agreements in sex-crime investigations.\"",
      "The committee wants the deposition to take place on Aug. 11 at the Federal Correctional Institution Tallahassee, where Maxwell is imprisoned.",
      "Maxwell was\u00a0convicted in 2021\u00a0for her role in helping Epstein recruit, groom and abuse underage girls. She is\u00a0serving a 20-year prison sentence. Epstein died in federal custody in 2019 as he faced sex trafficking charges.",
      "A top Justice Department official is also planning to meet with Maxwell \"soon,\" and the government has asked federal courts overseeing the Epstein and Maxwell cases to release material from federal grand juries. The department said earlier this month that a review of evidence in Epstein case turned up no indication of a \"client list\" and said no more files would be released, citing victims' privacy. The decision sparked fierce backlash from President Trump's supporters who have called for more transparency into the case for years.",
      "Earlier Wednesday, House Speaker Mike Johnson said he had concerns about Maxwell providing testimony.",
      "\"If they see fit to bring in Ghislaine Maxwell for testimony, that's fine,\" the Louisiana Republican said. \"I will note the obvious concern ... Could she be counted on to tell the truth?

      "Read an excerpt below, and don't miss Susan Spencer's interview with Olga Khazan on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" July 20!",

      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "My journey into extroversion began solitarily, with me watching the improv show Middleditch & Schwartz on Netflix one night. The episode opened with two well-known actors, Thomas Middleditch and Ben Schwartz, spending an uncomfortably long time pulling a premise for their sketch out of a random audience member\u2014a photography intern. Then, on a bare stage, Middleditch pretended to interview Schwartz for a photography job, making up absurd questions like \"embody a gazelle.\"",
      "The audience laughed along gamely, but mostly, the scene reminded me that I needed to file my expense report. I felt uneasy for the actors, like at any moment the crowd could turn on them, leaving them groping for laughs in ghostly silence. I wondered why they couldn't have just written out better scenes ahead of time. And even worse, I knew that soon, I would be in their exact same position, except without the advantage of being a famous comedian.",
      "For my personality-change project, I had decided to focus on each of the five traits intensively for a few months at a time, and I tackled extroversion first. In recent years my life had descended into a rut that I didn't particularly like, and extroversion seemed like the way out. Most days, I worked, made dinner, watched TV, and worked some more. Rich and I were planning to relocate, and it occurred to me that I would have both moved into and out of my house without having met any of my neighbors. A test in a self-help book reminded me that I have \"high loneliness.\"",
      "My \"very low\" extroversion score was probably not surprising to people who know me: My friend Anastasia once sentenced me to attending a party on pain of ending our friendship. But my hard-core introversion could turn pernicious, shading at times into loneliness and isolation. I have a career in which work can expand to fill every crevice of the day, and sometimes I thought that was a good thing, because I didn't have many hobbies or friends to otherwise occupy my time. (And say what you will about extroverts, but they have plenty of hobbies and friends.) I had always told myself I could focus on socializing after my life had stabilized, but the absence of social interaction was, itself, destabilizing.",
      "Of all five traits, extroversion offers the simplest path to personality change: You just have to go out and talk to people. You don't even have to be particularly good at it, or to proclaim yourself an \"extrovert\" while you do it. You just go, and extroversion will find you, like the entire wedding follows the first intrepid dancer.",
      "Coincidentally, this is also the ethos behind improv comedy: You just have to say something. Anything! For the uninitiated, \"improv\" is short for \"improvisational theater.\" The idea is that two or more actors get up on stage without knowing what they'll say or do. They get to the \"scene\" by accepting and building on a partner's improvisations\u2014a concept known as \"yes, and.\" When this is done well, improvisers say there is virtually no difference between improv and scripted theater\u2014a claim about which opinions surely differ.",
      "I knew I needed a commitment device for extroversion\u2014something to force me out of my house and into gregariousness. I decided to try improv, which seemed like the full-immersion extrovert experience.",
      "It also felt like full-immersion insanity. Rich saw me entering my credit-card information into the website of Dojo Comedy, a cozy-looking D.C. improv theater whose logo incorporates a pair of mustachioed Groucho Marx comedy glasses. \"You doing improv is like Larry David doing ice hockey,\" he said.",
      "It's true. My general vibe is less \"yes, and\" and more \"well, actually.\" I've never really liked improv as an art form. I don't find it particularly funny\u2014it's more like an extended inside joke you're never going to get. I thought Middleditch would warm me to improv, but it only turned me off more.",
      "Before the first class a few weeks later, I donned a Groundlings-ready black T-shirt and jeans, hoping to draw as little attention to myself as possible. I tried to shake memories of being so timid in middle-school drama class that I only qualified to be the understudy for the smallest role\u2014Bob Cratchit's daughter. When I typed the address of the improv studio into my phone, I was relieved when the red snake of \"heavier than usual traffic\" indicated that I would have at least an hour to mentally prepare.",
      "The improv class met in an old townhouse, in a room that was, for no discernible reason, filled with dozens of sculptures of elephants. Six of us novices sat in a circle on chairs that looked like they'd been salvaged from Victorian funerals.",
      "The instructor, a short brunette with a brisk, friendly manner, opened by asking us about our past improv experience\u2014none, in my case. One of the other women rattled off a long list of improv classes she had taken. What kind of crazy person does improv multiple times? I wondered. (Me, as it would turn out.)",
      "Right after the instructor said, \"Let's get started,\" I prayed for someone to grab an elephant and knock me unconscious. That didn't happen, so instead I stood up to play warm-up games with a software engineer, two lawyers, and a guy who worked on the Hill. The games were meant to loosen us up for what was to come, which was \"scene work,\" or acting out unscripted mini plays with one another.",
      "First, we learned the improv standard Zip Zap Zop, which involves whooshing beams of energy at one another and taking turns saying \"Zip,\" \"Zap,\" and\u2014you guessed it\u2014 \"Zop.\" The point of the game is to stay unflustered enough to keep up the Zip-Zap-Zop sequence while still whooshing on to someone else in the circle.",
      "I struggled for several reasons: Because of the pandemic, I hadn't been in a room with other people for more than a year. On top of that, I have poor reflexes, and, because we wore masks, you had to determine whether someone was about to Zop you solely by the angle of their eyes.",
      "If someone messed up the sequence\u2014said \"Zip\" to another's \"Zip,\" for instance\u2014we would all stop, clap, and say, \"yay!,\" reinforcing the idea that it's okay to screw up in improv. The spirit of all this was so different from my job, where you can get fired for screwing up, that it felt like some sort of rehab for perfectionists.",
      "Then we moved on to juggling various invisible items between one another, including an invisible ball, which, humiliatingly, we had to refer to as \"invisible ball!\" I sensed that the others were as nervous as I was, but this being D.C., an air of try-hard overachievement subsumed everyone's true emotions. People, myself included, will behave ridiculously if they feel they have no alternative. I imagined all my fellow ball-jugglers back at work the next day, writing emails in which they promised to circle back and touch base. I wondered whether they would think back to this moment of whimsy at their brown-bag lunches, as they gravely discussed the situation in Burkina Faso. Maybe it would make the situation in Burkina Faso seem less chaotic by comparison.",
      "Soon it was time to call an invisible hawk to my arm. I noted with gratitude that at least the blinds were closed, so no one could see us from the street.",

    "summary": "Writer Olga Khazan, a lifelong introvert obsessed with work, was unhappy with who she was, and so vowed to redesign her personality by living outside her comfort zone \u2013 a journey she documented in her new book, \"Me, But Better.\"",
    "story": [
      "For years, Olga Khazan, a Virginia-based staff writer at The Atlantic, knew she had a big problem: she hated much of her own personality. \"I was constantly worried about everything,\" she said. \"Just never living in the moment. And I didn't really like doing anything fun with other people. Just wasn't my thing.\"",
      "How might she function at a party? \"I would kind of stand off to myself, and honestly, sometimes just, like, read articles on my phone or just basically not engage,\" she laughed.",
      "Not surprisingly, a lot of folks didn't want to engage with Khazan, either. \"One person called me a pressure addict, that I was sort of obsessed with working, and just doing as much work as possible, and never taking a minute to appreciate life,\" she said. \"One person told me that she was kind of afraid of me when we worked together.\"",
      "Predictably, when she took a personality test four years ago, she was off the charts \u2013 way off \u2013 in neuroticism, or negative emotions \u2026 not that she hadn't tried to find help: \"This whole time I'd been in therapy,\" Khazan said. \"I had taken different medications. I did yoga. And I did all the self-care things. Nothing was truly working.\"",
      "Frustrated, Khazan set out to do something much more radical: She vowed to redesign her whole personality. \"I decided to spend a year trying to change my personality traits,\" she laughed.",
      "Professor Shannon Sauer-Zavala described one's personality as \"your characteristic way of thinking, feeling, and behaving. It's how you think about your behavior and how you act.\"",
      "I asked, \"I always assumed that once you had reached a certain age, your personality was your personality?\"",
      "\"That really is, I think, the prevailing way to think about personality, but it doesn't line up with our science,\" Sauer-Zavala replied.",
      "Personality science is her specialty, and her research at the University of Kentucky could be a game-changer for how we approach mental health issues. She says data tells us it is possible to scientifically change your personality, and that, with the right intervention, introverts can become extroverts \u2026 sloppy people can get neater \u2026 slackers can gain ambition \u2026 and anxious people can learn to be calm. \"In my almost 20 years of treating people with anxiety disorders, I've seen dramatic changes in 12, 16, 20 weeks,\" Sauer-Zavala said.",
      "Step one is a baseline personality test, which asks questions such as: \"I sometimes manipulate people into doing what I want.\"",
      "The next step is forcing yourself to act the opposite of how you normally would. If you're shy, make conversations. If you're messy, make the bed.",
      "Sauer-Zavala said, \"When we make intentional changes to our thinking, our feeling, and our behaviors, and we maintain those changes over time, then we're essentially shifting our personality. We're changing the way we're gonna fill out those bubbles on the personality questionnaire.\"",
      "\"So, you consciously adopt the behavior of the personality that you think you want?\" I asked. \"You make it sound easy.\"",
      "\"It's not easy,\" Sauer-Zavala replied. \"The principles are simple, but the execution is difficult.\"",
      "It wasn't easy for Olga Khazan, the lifelong introvert. Among other strategies to tackle her social anxiety, she enrolled in an improv class with total strangers \u2026 something completely outside her comfort zone. \"I was very, very scared,\" she said. \"Probably for the first three or four months that I did it, my heart was really beating in my chest, and I was deeply uncomfortable.\"",
      "What about it scared her? \"I didn't like looking silly!\" she laughed.",
      "Murphy McHugh, who was Khazan's improv teacher, said, \"For me, doing improv was a life-changing thing. I opened up socially. I became a better listener, a better collaborator.\"",
      "He said as Khazan continued coming to class, he noticed changes in her: \"Relaxing, a little bit less of the cross-armed body language. You see someone relaxed, you see their shoulders drop. You see them laughing, and coming into scenes with an idea.\"",
      "Along with improv, Khazan meditated, went sailing, took conversation classes, and kept a journal, as she describes in a new book, \"Me, But Better: The Science and Promise of Personality Change.\"",
      "\"Journaling kind of helps you focus on some of the more positive elements of your life that, if you're very neurotic, you tend to kind of gloss over or forget,\" she said.",
      "I asked, \"Is this a case of fake it 'til you make it?\"",
      "\"Yeah, it is fake it 'til you make it,\" Khazan said. \"Because if you think about it, anything is gonna feel fake if it feels new, right? Anything that you're not accustomed to doing is gonna feel really unnatural. But the only way to make it natural is to do it over and over and over again\"",
      "\"And just incorporate it in who you are?\"",
      "\"Exactly.\"",
      "Today, Khazan is happily married, with a 14-month-old baby. As for that personality she once so disliked, she said, \"I feel like I am a different person today than I was three years ago. I think I genuinely have a different way of living my life, and approaching problems, than I did before.\"",
      "So, what advice does Shannon Sauer-Zavala have for everyone watching with completely unsatisfactory personalities? \"Not to get stuck in a personality-type box,\" she said. \"Think about the life that you want to have, and then know that you can intentionally develop the traits that will facilitate that journey for you.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 17 Jul 2025 10:25:21 -0400",
    "summary": "A groundbreaking IVF trial has raised hope that women with genetic mutations in their own DNA could one day have children without passing on deadly diseases.",
    "story": [
      "Eight healthy babies have been born in the U.K. using a new IVF technique that successfully reduced their risk of inheriting genetic diseases from their mothers, the people behind a world-first trial said Wednesday.",
      "The findings were hailed as a breakthrough, which raises hopes that women with mutations in their mitochondrial DNA could one day have children without passing debilitating or deadly diseases on to the children. One out of every 5,000 births is affected by mitochondrial diseases, which cannot be treated, and include symptoms such as impaired vision, diabetes and muscle wasting.",
      "In 2015, Britain became the first country to approve an in-vitro fertilization technique that uses a small amount of healthy mitochondrial DNA from the egg of a donor \u2014 along with the mother's egg and father's sperm.",
      "Some have called the result of this process \"three-parent babies,\" though researchers have pushed back at this term because only roughly 0.1% of the newborn's DNA comes from the donor.",
      "The results of the much-awaited U.K. trial were published in several papers in the New England Journal of Medicine.",
      "8 children with DNA from 3 people currently healthy",
      "Out of 22 women to undergo the treatment at the Newcastle Fertility Centre in northeast England, eight babies were born. The four boys and four girls now range from under 6 months to over 2 years old.",
      "The amount of mutated mitochondrial DNA \u2014 which causes disease \u2014   was reduced by 95-100% in six of the babies, according to the research. For the other two newborns, the amount fell by 77-88%, which is still below the range that causes disease.",
      "This indicates the technique was \"effective in reducing transmission\" of diseases between mother and child, one of the studies said.",
      "The eight children are currently healthy, though one had a disturbance of their heart's rhythm which was successfully treated, the researchers said.",
      "Their health will be followed up over the coming years to see if problems arise.",
      "Oxford University reproductive genetics expert Dagan Wells noted that among the eight children, three have shown some signs of what is known as \"reversal,\" which is still little understood.",
      "It is \"a phenomenon where the therapy initially succeeds in producing an embryo with very few defective mitochondria, but by the time the child is born the proportion of abnormal mitochondria in its cells has significantly increased,\" he explained.",
      "Nevertheless, Nils-Goran Larsson, a Swedish reproductive expert not involved in the research, hailed it as a \"breakthrough.\"",
      "The new technique offers a \"very important reproductive option\" for families affected by \"devastating\" mitochondrial diseases, he added.",
      "While the U.K. trial is the first to involve multiple mothers, the eight babies born to them are not the first to be born with DNA from three people. That first came in 2016, after a woman was treated by U.S. fertility specialists in Mexico, where there were no laws regulating the practice. A similar IVF method was used in that groundbreaking case.",
      "Ethical concerns over embryos and \"designer babies\"",
      "Mitochondrial donation remains controversial and has not been approved in many countries, including the United States and France.",
      "Religious leaders have opposed the procedure because it involves the destruction of human embryos. Other opponents have expressed fears it could pave the way for genetically engineered \"designer babies.\"",
      "An ethical review carried out by the U.K.'s independent Nuffield Council on Bioethics was \"instrumental\" in conducting the new research, the council's director Danielle Hamm said Wednesday.",
      "Peter Thompson, head of the U.K.'s Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, which approved the procedure, said only people with a \"very high risk\" of passing on a mitochondrial disease would be eligible for the treatment.",
      "Ethical concerns have also been raised over the use of mitochondrial donation for infertility in Greece and Ukraine.",
      "French mitochondrial disease specialist Julie Steffann told AFP that \"it is a question of the risk-benefit ratio: for a mitochondrial disease, the benefit is obvious.\"",
      "\"In the context of infertility, it has not been proven,\" she added.",

      "The AI Action Plan focuses on accelerating AI innovation and building out AI infrastructure to ensure the U.S. leads in international \"AI diplomacy,\" according to Sacks, who laid out the plan's major pillars during Wednesday's call.",
      "That includes expediting the construction of large-scale data centers, which house servers, networking gear and other technology used to power artificial intelligence.",
      "Thousands of data centers are scattered around the U.S. Most are connected to the nation's power grid and rely on massive amounts of electricity to operate. The proliferation of AI data centers has been cited as one of the drivers of burgeoning energy costs.",
      "The number of data centers is only expected to grow as technology companies \u2014 including Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, OpenAI and xAI \u2014 ramp up construction to meet the nation's growing energy demand stemming from the emergence of AI.",
      "In addition to investments in data centers, the new White House plan also focuses on \"expediting and modernizing programs\" for semiconductor fabrication plants, or fabs, and updating the nation's electric grid to support the enormous energy demands of AI supercomputing, Kratsios said.",
      "Another focus will be on reining in what White House officials have called an \"ideological bias\" in chatbots. This is something Sacks, a former PayPal executive, has highlighted after a 2024 incident in which Google's AI image generator created pictures of Black, Asian and Native American men when asked to show one of the countries Founding Fathers.",
      "\"We believe that AI systems should be free of ideological bias and not be designed to pursue socially engineered agendas,\" Sacks said on Wednesday. \"And so we have a number of proposals there on how to make sure that AI remains truth-seeking and trustworthy.\"",

      "As part of its efforts, the White House also seeks to remove what it refers to as \u00a0\"onerous regulation\" that the Trump administration says is hindering AI innovation. The official added that the plan calls for the removal of diversity, equity and inclusion and climate funding requirements from the Biden administration's CHIPS Act.",

    "summary": "Backers of the Genius Act, a potentially landmark bill that could help \"stablecoins\" go mainstream, say it would greatly speed electronic payments.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Friday is signing the Genius Act, the first major federal law governing cryptocurrencies.",
      "The law establishes federal regulations for \"stablecoins,\" which are viewed as a relatively safe type of cryptocurrency because their value is pegged to fixed assets, like the dollar.",
      "The Genius Act passed in the House on Thursday by a 308-122 vote after being approved\u00a0in the Senate\u00a0last month with broad bipartisan support. The measure is part of a broader push by Republican lawmakers and President Trump to support the cryptocurrency industry and ease regulations around the emerging sector.",
      "\"For the first time in history, Congress has passed bipartisan digital assets legislation through both the Senate and the House. The Genius Act marks a major milestone in securing America's leadership in payments innovation while protecting consumers and strengthening our national security,\" South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, a co-sponsor of the bill, said in a statement Thursday following the bill's passage by Congress.",
      "The Genius Act, which is sponsored by Republican Sen. Bill Hagerty, has two Democratic co-sponsors \u2014 Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Sen. Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland \u2014 and two Republican co-sponsors \u2014 South Carolina's Sen. Tim Scott and Wyoming's Sen. Cynthia Lummis.",
      "Here's what to know about stablecoin and how the Genius Act could affect its use.",
      "What is stablecoin?",
      "Cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin and ethereum, are prone to extreme swings in value, posing risks to investors. Stablecoins aim to reduce those risks by pegging their value to a less volatile financial asset, most commonly the U.S. dollar.",
      "In a recent interview with\u00a0CBS News' Caitlin Huey-Burns, Dante Disparte, chief strategy officer at financial technology company Circle,\u00a0 described stablecoins as \"digital dollars.\" As the name implies, stablecoins are intended to be less volatile and risky than other digital tokens, making them a better medium of exchange for bank payments and other financial services, he said.",
      "Circle is a large issuer of stablecoin and backed the passage of the Genius Act.",
      "\"At the end of the day, it's about being able to send dollars outside of banking hours and to send dollars the way you and I might interact with WhatsApp or messaging platforms,\" Disparte said.",
      "Disparte estimates that around 90% of stablecoins are linked to the dollar. Stablecoins are stored and exchanged on the blockchain, the public ledger technology underlying other cryptos.",
      "What will the Genius Act do?",
      "Backed by crypto advocates, the Genius Act (which stands for Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins) established guardrails and consumer protections for stablecoins.",
      "The bill also creates a legal category for stablecoins and establishes clear boundaries for which digital currencies could be referred to as stablecoins.",
      "With the Genius Act passed, banks, nonbanks and credit unions could dive into the market by issuing their own stablecoins.",
      "Along with being less volatile than other virtual currencies, stablecoins can facilitate faster, lower-cost financial transactions, supporters of the technology say. Before the Senate vote on the Genius Act in June, Sen. Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, the bill's sponsor,\u00a0said\u00a0stablecoins could allow businesses and consumers to settle payments \"nearly instantaneously,\" rather than taking weeks.",
      "Although considered less volatile than other cryptocurrencies, stablecoins come with risks. One of the biggest is that the digital currency can get \"depegged\" from its underlying asset if that asset's value or liquidity changes. This can trigger trading loses, or systemic market risks to insolvency and liquidity, according to S&P Global Ratings.",
      "In 2023, for example, the failure of U.S. banks Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and Silvergate Bank, caused two types of stablecoins \u2014 the USDC and DAI \u2014 to depeg.",
      "Stablecoins are also subject \"to market volatility, market confidence and adoption, technology risk, demand and supply and market liquidity,\" according to S&P Global.",
      "Are stablecoins catching on in financial services?",
      "As the Genius Act awaited approval from Congress, some of the nation's largest banks were already considering how they could integrate stablecoins into their business as they face mounting competition from fintech players like Circle.",
      "Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser said on the company's earnings call Tuesday that the bank is considering issuing its own form of the cryptocurrency. Citigroup, the third-largest U.S. bank by assets, is already developing its digital currency capabilities in an attempt to expand revenue and attract clients, she added.",

    "published": "Fri, 18 Jul 2025 15:30:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Content promoting extreme weight loss and cosmetic surgery is available to young TikTok users, breaching the social media platform's policies.",
    "story": [
      "Hundreds of extreme weight loss and cosmetic surgery videos were easily found with a simple search on TikTok and available to a user under the age of 18, in violation of the platform's own policies, CBS News has found.",
      "CBS News created a TikTok account for a hypothetical 15-year-old female user in the United States and found that, at the very least, hundreds of extreme weight loss and cosmetic surgery videos were searchable and watchable on the platform using the account.",
      "Once the CBS News account interacted with a handful of these videos, similar content was then recommended to the account on TikTok's \"For You\" feed.",
      "Searchable videos ranged from content with captions such as, \"nothing feels better than an empty stomach,\" to \"what I eat in a day\" videos promoting restrictive, 500-calorie-per-day diets. Guidelines published by the U.S. National Institutes of Health suggest that girls between the ages of 14 and 18 ingest between 1,800 and 2,400 calories per day.",
      "Many of the videos promoted thin body types as aspirational targets and included the hashtag \"harsh motivation\" to push extreme weight loss advice.",
      "Some of those videos included messages or slogans such as \"skinny is a status symbol\" and \"every time you say no to food, you say yes to skinny.\"",
      "TikTok's community guidelines say the platform only allows users over the age of 18 to see content promoting restrictive, low-calorie diets, including videos promoting medications for weight loss or idealizing certain body types. The Chinese-owned platform also says it bans users under the age of 18 from viewing videos that promote cosmetic surgery without warning of the risks, such as before-and-after images, videos of surgical procedures, and messages discussing elective cosmetic surgery.",
      "But CBS News found a range of videos by entering basic search terms on the platform, such as \"skinny,\" \"thin,\" and \"low cal,\" that promoted thin bodies as ideal, while also pushing harmful weight management behaviors. One such video showed an image of a scale with a weight of 39.9 kg (88 pounds) alongside a caption saying \"weight loss\" and the hashtag \"ed,\" which is a common abbreviation for \"eating disorder.\"",
      "Another graphic video with the caption \"ana gives you wings\" showed a series of models with protruding collar bones and spines. The term \"ana\" is an abbreviation for the eating disorder anorexia.",
      "Responding to CBS News' research, a TikTok spokesperson said Thursday that it was \"based on a very limited sample size and does not reflect the experience of the vast majority of our community.\"",
      "\"TikTok does not allow content that promotes disordered eating or extreme weight loss behaviours, and we work with health experts to provide in-app support resources where needed,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "The spokesperson pointed to a study published in May by the University of Southern California, which found that a majority of the eating disorder content on TikTok is discussion among users about recovery from such conditions.",
      "The same study noted, however, the platform's \"dual role in both challenging harmful cultural norms and potentially perpetuating them,\" regarding body image perceptions and eating disorders.",
      "\"We know that this isn't a one-off error on TikTok's part and that children are coming across this content on a scale,\" said Gareth Hill, a spokesperson for the Molly Russell foundation, a charity in the United Kingdom that works to prevent young people from committing self-harm.",
      "\"The question for TikTok is, if this is not representative, then why has this account [created by CBS News], which is a child's account, been shown this content in the first place, and then why is it continuing to get recommended to it?\"",
      "CBS News also found a wide variety of videos available to the under-18 user promoting the weight loss drug Ozempic and various forms of cosmetic surgery. That included videos that showed up on the recommended \"For You\" feed, which promotes cosmetic surgeries such as rhinoplasty, breast augmentation, and liposuction.",
      "In one case, a user talking about their waist reduction surgery included a voiceover saying: \"I would rather die hot than live ugly.\"",
      "A TikTok spokesperson declined to comment specifically on CBS News' findings regarding cosmetic surgeries being promoted to underage users.",
      "TikTok says it has taken a range of measures over the past several months to address criticism regarding the availability of extreme weight loss content on the platform. In early June, the platform suspended search results for the viral hashtag #SkinnyTok, after drawing criticism from health experts and European regulators. The hashtag had been associated primarily with videos promoting extreme weight loss, calorie restriction and negative body talk, often presented as wellness advice.",
      "A TikTok spokesperson also told CBS News on Thursday that searches for words or phrases such as #Anorexia would lead users to relevant assistance, including localized eating disorder helplines, where they can access further information and support.",
      "\"I think we're understanding more and more about how this content shows up and so even when you ban a particular hashtag, for example, it's not long until something similar jumps up in its place,\" Doreen Marshall, who leads the American nonprofit National Eating Disorders Association [NEDA], told CBS News.",
      "\"This is going to be an evolving landscape both for creating content guidelines, but also for the platforms themselves and, you know, while some progress has been made, there's clearly more that can be done,\" Marshall said.",
      "TikTok is not the only social media platform that has faced criticism for the accessibility of extreme weight loss content.",
      "In 2022, 60 Minutes reported on a leaked internal document from Meta that showed the company was aware, through its own research, of content on its Instagram platform promoting extreme weight loss and fueling eating disorders in young people.",
      "At the time, Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, declined 60 Minutes' request for an interview but its global head of safety, Antigone Davis, said, \"We want teens to be safe online\" and that Instagram doesn't \"allow content promoting self-harm or eating disorders.\"",
      "Last year, 60 Minutes reported that the Google-owned YouTube video platform, which is hugely popular among teenagers, was also serving up extreme weight loss and eating disorder content to children.",
      "Responding to that report, a YouTube representative said the platform \"continually works with mental health experts to refine [its] approach to content recommendations for teens.\"",

    "summary": "U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis barred federal immigration authorities from immediately taking Kilmar Abrego Garcia into custody once he is released from criminal confinement in Tennessee.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Wednesday barred federal immigration authorities from immediately taking Kilmar Abrego Garcia into custody once he is released from criminal confinement in Tennessee and ordered the Trump administration to provide him 72 hours' notice if it plans to initiate proceedings to remove him to a country that is not his place of origin.",
      "The order from U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis was issued as a federal judge in Tennessee, who is presiding over Abrego Garcia's criminal case, ruled that the Salvadoran national should be released from the custody of federal law enforcement under conditions that will be set by a magistrate judge.",
      "The Tennessee judge, Waverly Crenshaw, denied the Justice Department's request to revoke an order allowing Abrego Garcia to be released while awaiting a criminal trial, writing that the government \"failed to carry its burden of showing that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure Abrego's appearance or the safety of others.\"",
      "But Abrego Garcia will not be released from criminal custody immediately. The magistrate judge overseeing his case granted a request from his lawyers, made last week, to hold off on issuing the order directing Abrego Garcia's release for 30 days. The judge said he will continue to remain in the custody of U.S. Marshals.",
      "\"These rulings are a powerful rebuke of the government's lawless conduct and a critical safeguard for Kilmar's due process rights,\" Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, an attorney for Abrego Garcia, said in a statement. \"A federal judge has now barred ICE from taking him back into custody and ordered that any future deportation attempt must come with advance notice. After the government unlawfully deported him once without warning, this legal protection is essential.\"",
      "Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, attacked Xinis for her decision.",
      "\"The fact this unhinged judge is trying to tell ICE they can't arrest an MS-13 gang member, indicted by a grand jury for human trafficking, and subject to immigration arrest under federal law is LAWLESS AND INSANE,\" she said in a statement.",
      "Abrego Garcia was charged with two criminal counts of human smuggling last month and has pleaded not guilty. While a magistrate judge said he should be released from the custody of U.S. Marshals ahead of a trial, set to begin in January, the order prompted concerns that Abrego Garcia would then be swiftly detained by federal immigration authorities and deported.",
      "But Xinis' order limits the Trump administration's ability to swiftly remove him from the U.S. In addition to blocking Trump administration officials from taking Abrego Garcia into custody upon his release in Tennessee, Xinis ordered the Department of Homeland Security to return him to supervised release under U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Baltimore field office. She said Abrego Garcia should be returned to Maryland, where he lives with his family.",
      "Under that supervision order, issued in 2019, Abrego Garcia had permission to live in Maryland, as well as authorization to work. He was required to check in with an immigration officer at the ICE office in Baltimore. Court filings indicate Abrego Garcia was in compliance with ICE supervision order when he was deported to El Salvador.",
      "Xinis said her relief allows the Trump administration to initiate immigration proceedings once Abrego Garcia returns to Maryland, but said those proceedings must begin in Baltimore, which was handling the earlier ICE supervision order.",
      "\"Once Abrego Garcia is restored under the ICE Supervision Order out of the Baltimore Field Office, defendants may take whatever action is available to them under the law,\" Xinis said.",
      "Xinis, who sits on the federal district court in Maryland, wrote that she \"must accord modest relief\" that ensures Abrego Garcia is not subject to \"re-deportation without due process\" and ensures the fulfillment of her order earlier this year that required the Trump administration to return him to the U.S. from El Salvador.",
      "Administration officials, she wrote, \"have done little to assure the court that absent intervention, Abrego Garcia's due process rights will be protected.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia, who entered the U.S. illegally in 2011, was detained by ICE in March and sent to a Salvadoran prison along with hundreds of other deportees despite a 2019 court order that barred him from being sent back to El Salvador due to a fear of persecution by gangs. The Trump administration acknowledged Abrego Garcia's deportation to El Salvador was an \"administrative error,\" but he remained there for months \u2014 despite Xinis ordering the government to facilitate his return \u2014 until he was brought to Tennessee to face criminal charges.",
      "While the magistrate judge said he should be released pending trial, the prospect that Abrego Garcia would then swiftly be detained by the Department of Homeland Security for removal proceedings created a new tangle for the courts to unravel. He has remained in the custody of U.S. Marshals as the legal proceedings have continued.",
      "Abrego Garcia's lawyers asked the Tennessee court last week to put off his release from custody for 30 days if Crenshaw denied the Justice Department's bid to keep him in confinement while awaiting trial \u2014 which the judge did Wednesday.",
      "Abrego Garcia's lawyers said in seeking the delay in his release last week that they had been advised by the government that \"if the court denies the government's motion for revocation, the defendant would be transferred to the custody of the Department of Homeland Security ('DHS'), and DHS would begin removal proceedings.\"",
      "But earlier this month, Xinis heard testimony about how Abrego Garcia's deportation proceedings could be handled by ICE. An immigration official told the judge that if Abrego Garcia were to be released from pretrial detention in Tennessee, the agency had not determined where he would be sent.",
      "\"There's been no decision made, as he is not in ICE custody,\" Thomas Giles, assistant director for ICE enforcement and removal operations, testified in federal court in Maryland.",
      "Giles was in court after Xinis ordered the government to produce someone with firsthand knowledge of any third country other than El Salvador where Abrego Garcia could be deported to if he were released from criminal custody.",
      "If Abrego Garcia were to receive a notice of removal, up until his deportation, he would be able to express fear about going to a third country, a period of time that could range from \"a day to a week,\" Giles said.",
      "In a hearing on June 26, Justice Department attorney Jonathan Guynn said that if the Salvadoran man were to be released, ICE would begin removal proceedings to a third country, which is one that is not the country of origin, instead of his native El Salvador.",
      "During the arguments earlier this month, Xinis said she was not willing to allow for an \"unfettered release\" of Abrego Garcia into ICE custody so he can be \"spirited away\" and removed from the U.S. before she rules.",
      "\"We're a court of laws and we don't operate on 'take my word for it,'\" Xinis said. \"From day one, you have taken the presumption of regularity and destroyed it in my view.\"",

      "Bryan Kohberger\u00a0was sentenced to four life sentences without the possibility of parole on Wednesday after he pleaded guilty to the murders of four University of Idaho students in 2022.",
      "The surviving roommates and families of the victims delivered emotional statements at the sentencing hearing, held in a courtroom in Boise. When given the opportunity to speak, Kohberger declined to do so.",
      "Kohberger\u00a0pleaded guilty earlier this month to the murders\u00a0of Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle, Madison Mogen and Kaylee Goncalves as part of a plea deal that spared him\u00a0from the death penalty. He was in the courtroom Wednesday wearing an orange prison jumpsuit and listened as the families of the victims confronted him with powerful statements.",
      "The hearing lasted about three hours, with more than a dozen family impact statements read aloud.",
      "Chapin, Kernodle, Mogen and Goncalves were killed at a home in Moscow, Idaho, during the\u00a0early morning hours of Nov. 13, 2022. Kohberger was arrested at his\u00a0parents' home in Pennsylvania\u00a0six weeks later. Prosecutors said that if the case had gone to trial they would have used\u00a0DNA evidence\u00a0that linked Kohberger to the crime scene, his\u00a0online purchase history, surveillance video of Kohberger's car, and cellphone data that showed him in the vicinity of the killings. His motive is still unknown.",
      "Kohberger sentenced to life in prison",
      "Judge Steven Hippler spoke emotionally for several minutes before sentencing Kohberger. He called Kohberger a \"faceless coward\" and said he was in \"great awe\" of the family members who had given statements. He also criticized Kohberger for failing to show remorse or regret about the slayings. He said he could not legally force Kohberger to explain why he had committed the slayings, and said he did not believe Kohberger would answer the question truthfully either way.",
      "\"There is no reason for these crimes that could approach anything resembling rationality,\" Hippler said. \"No conceivable reason could make any sense, and in the end, the more we struggle to seek explanation for the unexplainable, the more we try to extract a reason, the more power and control we give to him. In my view, the time has now come to end Mr. Kohberger's 15 minutes of fame.\"",
      "After speaking, Hippler sentenced Kohberger to four consecutive sentences of life in prison without the possibility of parole. He was also sentenced to 10 years in prison on the burglary charge. Kohberger did not react after the sentence was read out.",
      "For each charge, Kohberger was also charged $50,000. He also owes a civil penalty of $5,000, payable to the family of the victim, for each murder charge.",
      "Kohberger will be required to submit DNA as part of the plea deal, Hippler said. Kohberger has waived his right to an appeal, but can file a notice of appeal, Hippler said, though that notice might violate the plea agreement.",
      "Victim impact statements",
      "About two hours of the hearing were dedicated to statements read by the loved ones of the victims. The first victim impact statement was read on behalf of Bethany Funke, who had lived with the murdered students and called 911 after finding their bodies.",
      "\"That was the worst day of my life, and I know it always will be,\" Funke said in the statement, which was read by friend Emily Alant. Funke added that she checks her room every night to ensure there is no one hiding in the space, and said she has struggled to sleep since the slayings. Alant cried as she read the statement, while Kohberger showed no emotion.",
      "Dylan Mortensen, the other surviving roommate, was the next to speak. She was visibly distraught and took several moments to collect herself before beginning to read her statement through tears. She said she has struggled with panic attacks since the killings.",
      "\"I was barely 19 when he did this,\" Mortensen said. \"We had just celebrated my birthday at the end of September. I should have been figuring out who I was. I should have been having the college experience and starting to establish my future. Instead, I was forced to learn how to survive the unimaginable.\"",
      "Scott Laramie, Madison Mogen's stepfather, then read a victim impact statement on behalf of himself and Mogen's mother, Karen Laramie. He remembered Mogen as someone who \"always brought us joy\" and who prioritized spending time with her family before she was \"taken senselessly and brutally in a sudden act of evil.\"",
      "\"This world was a better place with her in it,\" Laramie said.",
      "Karen Laramie had a second statement read on her behalf by her lawyer, Leander James. Mogen's paternal grandmother Kim Cheeley also spoke, thanking prosecutors and law enforcement officials for \"bringing this case to closure.\"",
      "Mogen's father, Ben Mogen, said that his daughter had already earned all of the credits necessary for her degree at the time of the slayings, and wiped his eyes as he spoke.",
      "\"Maddie was my only child that I ever had. She's the only great thing I ever did and the only thing I was ever proud of,\" Ben Mogen said. He recounted taking her to concerts with friends, and shared a Father's Day card that he said was the last thing his daughter ever wrote to him, where she'd written \"I can't wait till we can hang out again soon.\"",
      "Steve Goncalves, the father of Kaylee Goncalves, turned the podium to address Kohberger directly. Kohberger continued to not react, though he made eye contact with Steve Goncalves as he spoke.",
      "\"Today, we're here to finish what you started,\" Steve Goncalves said. He called Kohberger a \"complete joke\" and said the families of the victims \"took this disaster\" and kept it focused on their loved ones.",

      "\"No one is scared of you today. No one is impressed by you. No one thinks you're important,\" Alivea Goncalves said. There was applause in the courtroom after she finished speaking. She was followed by her and Kaylee Goncalves' mother, Kristi, who again directly addressed Kohberger. Goncalves family attorney Shannon Grey read statements from Kaylee Goncalves' aunt and grandmothers.",
      "Jazzmin Kernodle, the older sister of Xana Kernodle, was the first member of her family to speak. She remembered her younger sister as a \"kind, funny\" woman who \"was everyone's best friend.\" Her father Jeff Kernodle spoke next. He said that the night of the murders, he had been just seven miles from the house and wanted to drive over \u2014 but decided against it because he had been drinking.",
      "\"I wish I would have drunk and drove. They would have had a chance, all four of them,\" Jeff Kernodle said.",
      "Next to speak was Kim Kernodle, Xana's aunt. She told Kohberger that she had \"forgiven\" him for the slayings.",
      "\"I no longer could live with that hate in my heart, and for me to become a better person, I have forgiven you. Any time you want to talk and tell me what happened, find my number. I'm here. \u2026 I'll be that one that will listen to you.\"",
      "Kernodle's uncle Stratton Kernodle and stepfather Randy Davis also spoke briefly, with Davis receiving applause after telling Kohberger to \"Go to hell.\" Karen Worthington, Xana Kernodle's mother, then addressed Kohberger directly, facing in his direction as she read a prepared statement. She also said she had forgiven Kohberger.",
      "\"I do not fear you or even let you rent space in my head anymore. This forgiveness has released me from any and all evil you have released on me and my family,\" she said.",
      "Prosecutor details process behind plea deal",
      "After the families finished speaking, prosecutor Bill Thompson took the podium. He walked through the past few weeks of the case, and said the families of the victims had only been interested in a plea agreement that saw Kohberger plead guilty on all counts and waive appeal on all of his motions, which would have \"consumed years or decades in the future.\"",
      "The families of the victims were\u00a0divided over the plea deal. Mogen's father told CBS News he was relieved to learn of the deal, saying it will allow his family to \"actually put this behind us.\" The Goncalves family has bitterly criticized the agreement, and\u00a0told CBS News\u00a0after a\u00a0gag order was lifted\u00a0that they believe the plea deal gives Kohberger a chance to live a \"better and more rewarding life inside\" prison.",
      "Thompson said the deal was kept confidential until the last minute because officials did not want to taint a prospective jury pool if the case did proceed to trial.",
      "\"Now, it is time for the judicial system to impose final judgement and close the door on this chapter of these tragedies,\" Thompson said.",
      "He asked that the judge sentence Kohberger to four consecutive life sentences in prison, one for each murder, and 10 years in prison on the burglary charge. As Thompson named each victim, their photo was shown in the courtroom. He also shared a group photo of the foursome. Crying could be heard in the courtroom as Thompson spoke.",
      "Kohberger declines to speak",
      "After Thompson spoke, Hippler asked the defense if they had evidence or an argument to present. The team said no.",
      "Hippler asked Kohberger if he would like to make a statement.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge in Florida has denied the Justice Department's request to unseal grand jury material stemming from investigations in 2005 and 2007 into the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "Judge Robin Rosenberg, a federal judge with the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, wrote in an order on Wednesday that \"the court's hands are tied,\" given precedents about grand jury secrecy established by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, which includes southern Florida. She noted that the government conceded that she was bound by the 11th Circuit's decisions.",
      "Last week, Attorney General Pam Bondi and Justice Department lawyers asked several federal courts to\u00a0unseal\u00a0grand jury transcripts in cases involving Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, his longtime partner who is serving a 20-year prison sentence on sex trafficking charges. Epstein was convicted on state prostitution charges in 2008, and faced federal sex trafficking charges in 2019. He died in federal custody weeks later.",
      "Wednesday's ruling only applies to transcripts of proceedings by federal grand juries that were convened in West Palm Beach in 2005 and 2007. Separate grand juries in New York indicted Epstein in 2019, and Maxwell in 2020. The judges who oversaw those cases are still weighing the administration's request to unseal proceedings, and have asked the government, victims and defense teams for more information before issuing rulings.",
      "The New York federal court is bound by different circuit court precedent, meaning judges there could ultimately pave the way for more information to be released.",
      "It's not yet clear if the Trump administration will appeal the Florida court's decision. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Wednesday afternoon she will \"let this president speak to whether he wants to see an appeal.\"",
      "Pressure has been mounting on the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress to provide more transparency in the Epstein case, even as President Trump has said he doesn't understand why so many of his supporters are interested.",

    "published": "Wed, 23 Jul 2025 15:40:45 -0400",
    "summary": "Some scientists worried that maybe the Barbados threadsnake had become extinct before it was rediscovered in March.",
    "story": [
      "For nearly two decades, no one had spotted the world's smallest-known snake.",
      "Some scientists worried that maybe the Barbados threadsnake had become extinct, but one sunny morning, Connor Blades lifted a rock in a tiny forest in the eastern Caribbean island and held his breath.",
      "\"After a year of searching, you begin to get a little pessimistic,\" said Blades, project officer with the Ministry of Environment in Barbados.",
      "The snake can fit comfortably on a coin, so it was able to elude scientists for almost 20 years.",
      "Scientifically named Tetracheilostoma carlae, the petite creature is listed as Critically Endangered in the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List of Threatened Species when it was last assessed in 2015.",
      "Too tiny to identify with the naked eye, Blades placed it in a small glass jar and added soil, substrate and leaf litter.",
      "Several hours later, in front of a microscope at the University of the West Indies, Blades looked at the specimen. It wriggled in the petri dish, making it nearly impossible to identify.",
      "\"It was a struggle,\" Blades recalled, adding that he shot a video of the snake and finally identified it thanks to a still image.",
      "It had pale yellow dorsal lines running through its body, and its eyes were located on the side of its head.",
      "\"I tried to keep a level head,\" Blades recalled, knowing that the Barbados threadsnake looks very much like a Brahminy blind snake, best known as the flower pot snake, which is a bit longer and has no dorsal lines.",
      "On Wednesday, the Re:wild conservation group, which is collaborating with the local environment ministry, announced the rediscovery of the Barbados threadsnake.",
      "\"Rediscovering one of our endemics on many levels is significant,\" said Justin Springer, Caribbean program officer for Re:wild who helped rediscover the snake along with Blades. \"It reminds us that we still have something important left that plays an important role in our ecosystem.\"",
      "The Barbados threadsnake has only been seen a handful of times since 1889. It was on a list of 4,800 plant, animal and fungi species that Re:wild described as \"lost to science.\"",
      "There's no information on its population and the most recent record of the snake was a 2005 photograph from near Hillaby town in St. Thomas Parish, according to the IUCN. One of the oldest known records of the species dates back to 1918, and it has only been rarely spotted since then, with a few documentations from 1966, 1997 and 2008, the Switzerland-based conservation organization said.",
      "\"Given the dense human population on Barbados, if the species was simply underrecorded it seems likely that local people would be aware of additional records,\" the IUCN said on its website. \"The lack of records suggests that this species is genuinely rare and restricted.\"",
      "The snake is blind, burrows in the ground, eats termites and ants and lays one single, slender egg. Fully grown, it measures up to four inches.",
      "\"They're very cryptic,\" Blades said. \"You can do a survey for a number of hours, and even if they are there, you may actually not see them.\"",
      "But on March 20 at around 10:30 a.m., Blades and Springer surrounded a jack-in-the-box tree in central Barbados and started looking under rocks while the rest of the team began measuring the tree, whose distribution is very limited in Barbados.",
      "\"That's why the story is so exciting,\" Springer said. \"It all happened around the same time.\"",
      "S. Blair Hedges, a professor at Temple University and director of its center for biology, was the first to identify the Barbados threadsnake. Previously, it was mistakenly lumped in with another species.",
      "In 2008, Hedges' discovery was published in a scientific journal, with the snake baptized Tetracheilostoma carlae, in honor of his wife.",
      "\"I spent days searching for them,\" Hedges recalled. \"Based on my observations and the hundreds of rocks, objects that I turned over looking for this thing without success, I do think it is a rare species.\"",
      "That was June 2006, and there were only three other such specimens known at the time: two at a London museum and a third at a museum collection in California that was wrongly identified as being from Antigua instead of Barbados, Hedges said.",
      "Hedges said that he didn't realize he had collected a new species until he did a genetic analysis.",
      "\"The aha moment was in the laboratory,\" he said, noting that the discovery established the Barbados threadsnake as the world's smallest-known snake.",
      "Hedges then became inundated for years with letters, photographs and emails from people thinking they had found more Barbados threadsnakes. Some of the pictures were of earthworms, he recalled.",
      "\"It was literally years of distraction,\" he said.",
      "Scientists hope the rediscovery means that the Barbados threadsnake could become a champion for the protection of wildlife habitat.",
      "A lot of endemic species on the tiny island have gone extinct, including the Barbados racer, the Barbados skink and a particular species of cave shrimp.",
      "\"I hope they can get some interest in protecting it,\" Hedges said. \"Barbados is kind of unique in the Caribbean for a bad reason: it has the least amount of original forest, outside of Haiti.\""

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/un-court-polluters-greenhouse-gas-emissions/",
    "published": "Wed, 23 Jul 2025 15:19:21 -0400",
    "summary": "The island nation of Vanuatu prevailed in its landmark request to legally compel countries to cut emissions and compensate places facing impacts from climate change.",
    "story": [
      "The Republic of Vanuatu, a South Pacific island nation of 320,000 people, has led a growing effort since 2021 to compel the United Nations to answer one of the most crucial legal questions related to climate change: Can polluters be held legally accountable for the harm they've caused as a result of releasing large amounts of greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere?",
      "The short answer is: yes. Fifteen judges who make up the International Court of Justice, located at The Hague in the Netherlands, issued a unanimous advisory opinion saying countries \"have a duty to prevent significant harm to the environment by acting with due diligence and to use all means at their disposal to prevent activities carried out within their jurisdiction or control from causing significant harm to the climate system and other parts of the environment.\"",
      "The court further stated that existing environmental treaties, international human rights law, and participation in the United Nations further compels countries to do everything possible to protect the climate. Any wrongful act that violates these agreements must be immediately stopped, followed by \"full reparations\" and compensation made to the injured parties.",
      "\"Vanuatu looks forward to collaborating with other States on implementing the Court's decision,\" Ralph Regenvanu, Vanuatu's minister of climate change and environment, said in a statement. \"A victory in the world's highest court is just the beginning. Success will depend on what happens next through coordinated efforts across diplomacy, politics, litigation, and advocacy to turn this moment into a true turning point.\"",
      "For Vanuatu, a country that comprises 83 islands with a combined size roughly the same as Connecticut, the decision is monumental. Officials said the country was responsible for less than 0.0004% of global cumulative greenhouse gas emissions between 1962 and 2022, but experiences disproportionate impacts of climate change.",
      "In addition to its average temperature rising, Vanuatu is seeing more severe and intense tropical cyclones. In 2023, it was hit by three cyclones that were Category 4 or higher, impacting nearly 200,000 residents and costing the country more than $400 million in economic damages. The western tropical Pacific Ocean has risen 4-6 inches between 1992-2020, which is particularly dangerous for the country as much of it is low-lying and vulnerable to erosion. All of this, along with increased precipitation and periods of drought, has caused entire communities to be relocated by the government, and the impacts are anticipated to grow more severe.",
      "\"Today, the world's smallest countries have made history,\" Vishal Prasad, director of Pacific Island Students Fighting Climate Change, said in a statement. \"The ICJ's decision brings us closer to a world where governments can no longer turn a blind eye to their legal responsibilities. It affirms a simple truth of climate justice: those who did the least to fuel this crisis deserve protection, reparations, and a future. This ruling is a lifeline for Pacific communities on the frontline.\"",
      "While the advisory opinion is not legally binding, environmental organizations and law experts are hopeful that the ruling can set a legal precedent for the thousands of climate change cases around the world that are attempting to hold larger governments and companies accountable for climate pollution.",
      "\"This opinion can serve as a compass for countries who are thinking about how to prioritize justice and prioritize the safety of their citizens while also being in compliance with international law,\" said Carly Phillips, a research scientist with the Union of Concerned Scientists who worked with the legal teams of seven countries that submitted supporting statements to the court asking for the opinion.",
      "The United States does not accept the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice, but it did submit a written statement in March 2024 and participated in oral arguments, arguing that members of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the 2015 Paris Agreement already compel signatories to address climate change impacts and protects them from accountability for harming the climate.",
      "But Vanuatu's Prime Minister Jotham Napat has been skeptical of the power of the U.N. convention and the Paris Agreement, saying in a statement that neither are \"generating the actions the world urgently needs fast enough.\" He believes a favorable opinion from the court could \"support vulnerable nations in securing climate finance, technology, and loss and damage support.\"",
      "The court addressed this concern in its opinion and dismissed the legal argument that environmental treaties, like the Paris Agreement, protect polluters from accountability. In fact, the court emphasized that the Paris Agreement imposes strong mitigation and adaptation obligations on all parties and requires them to respond to loss and damages from climate change.",
      "Given that the United States is one of the largest emitters of greenhouse gases in the world, according to international data, the decision to hold large emitters responsible might be concerning, but President Trump withdrew the United States from the Paris Agreement for a second time earlier this year.",
      "The court called out countries like the United States, saying that nations that are not party to climate treaties but are members of the United Nations must meet \"equivalent obligations under customary international law.\"",
      "The impact of the opinion remains to be seen. \"It's likely not going to have a lot of influence in the United States,\" said Maria Antonia Tigre, director of global climate litigation at the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University.",
      "Tigre said that while the decision may not influence domestic court cases in the U.S. and the country can't be sued under the decision, the real impact could be seen internationally. A court in Brazil, for example, could cite the opinion in one of the 135 current climate change cases making its way through its domestic court system.",
      "The U.N. court also pointed out that corporate polluters are open to the advisory opinion, especially if they are based abroad in a country that is party to the U.N. and climate treaties. \"Countries have an obligation to put an end to wrongful acts,\" said Tigre. \"If a country is found to be in breach by giving permits to an oil company, they may need to revoke those permits.\"",
      "Representatives for Vanuatu said the next step is to take the decision back to the U.N. General Assembly to pursue a full resolution to support the implementation of the decision. The opinion will be a primary focus when U.N. countries meet in November for the next climate change conference, known as COP30, in Brazil.",

    "summary": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is facing protests and EU criticism for the first time since Russia invaded, over changes to national anti-corruption agencies.",
    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0In a first since Russia launched its full-scale invasion more than three years ago, widespread protests have taken place across Ukraine \u2014 not against Russia or its President Vladimir Putin, but against Ukraine's own President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and the country's parliament, the Rada.",
      "Late Tuesday night, Zelenskyy signed a bill into law, after it was fast-tracked through the Rada, that gives Ukraine's prosecutor general (roughly equivalent to the U.S. attorney general), more power over two anti-corruption agencies long known for their fierce independence. The prosecutor general is a political appointee, not an elected official.",
      "In the hours before Zelenskyy signed the measure, thousands of people in the capital Kyiv, the western city of Lviv, Dnipro in the east and Odessa in the south made their frustration and fear known, defying martial law bans on mass gatherings to come out and protest. Their concern is rooted in the continued autonomy of Ukraine's National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) and the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office (SAPO), which for years have sought to combat graft by public officials, regardless of their political affiliation.",
      "Some critics argue the new law is political retribution. In April, Ukraine's National Anti-Corruption Bureau charged a former deputy head of Zelenskyy's administration, Andrii Smyrnov, with money laundering and accepting a bribe. Others fear a potential backslide back into some degree of authoritarianism in the country that was previously led by pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych, who was known for his close ties to oligarchs.",
      "The 27-nation European Union, which has been a staunch supporter of Zelenskyy and Ukraine since Russia launched its invasion, also voiced concern over the changes to the management of the anti-corruption agencies. Demonstrably fighting corruption is crucial to Ukraine's bid to join the EU.",
      "EU Enlargement Commissioner Marta Kos called the vote by Ukraine's parliament \"a serious step back\" in a post on social media, adding that \"independent bodies like NABU & SAPO are essential for Ukraine's EU path. Rule of Law remains in the very center of EU accession negotiations.\"",
      "Zelenskyy appeared to acknowledge the anger in his country over the new legislation, saying in a statement posted on social media after the Rada's vote: \"We all hear what society is saying.\"",
      "\"We see what people expect from state institutions \u2014 ensured justice and the effective functioning of each institution. We discussed the necessary administrative and legislative decisions that would strengthen the work of each institution, resolve existing contradictions, and eliminate threats,\" Zelenskyy said. \"Everyone will work together. At the political level, we will provide support.\"",
      "Earlier he had stressed that the two anti-corruption agencies would still \"work,\" but he said they needed to be clear of what he claimed was \"Russian influence.\" He said some major corruption cases had been \"lying dormant\" with the agencies for years without any rational explanation, but offered no explanation of the alleged Russian influence.",
      "New round of Russia-Ukraine peace talks",
      "The Kremlin, meanwhile, confirmed that a third round of direct Russia-Ukraine peace talks would begin in Turkey on Wednesday evening.",
      "\"Our delegation is flying to Istanbul, and indeed negotiations are scheduled to take place there tonight,\" said spokesperson Dmitry Peskov. \"The main topic of discussion will be peace memorandums that were shared during the second round of talks.\"",
      "He said the two sides would discuss further prisoner swaps. Over the past two months, Russia and Ukraine have exchanged more than 1,000 prisoners of war, but the negotiations have thus far yielded little hope of a ceasefire in the war.",
      "On Tuesday, Peskov said Moscow did not expect any \"miraculous breakthrough\" in Turkey, calling the two sides \"diametrically opposed.\"",
      "Moscow has demanded a litany of concessions from Ukraine, including that it give up territory Russian troops have seized during the war. Russia currently occupies about a fifth of Ukraine's territory. Putin's government has also demanded that Ukraine abandon its ambitions of joining the EU and the U.S.-led NATO alliance, and even insisted that it should significantly downsize its military and make Russian the official language of Ukraine.",

      "Italy's national news agency ANSA said the venue had canceled the concert, offering no explanation. A representative at the Reggia di Caserta confirmed the cancellation to CBS News over the phone.",
      "The move came after criticism from Italian lawmakers, human rights advocates and Russian political dissidents.",
      "Among the most vocal opponents to Italy welcoming Gergiev was Yulia Navalnaya, the widow of the late Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny.

    "story": [
      "Seoul \u2014 A South Korean court reopened a decades-old case on Wednesday after the country's #MeToo movement inspired a woman to challenge her conviction for defending herself against sexual violence 61 years ago.",
      "Choi Mal-ja was 19 when she was attacked by a 21-year-old man in the southern town of Gimhae in 1964. He pinned her to the ground and forced his tongue into her mouth, court records showed. Choi managed to break free by biting off about half an inch of his tongue.",
      "In one of South Korea's most contentious rulings on sexual violence, the aggressor received only six months in prison, suspended for two years, for trespassing and intimidation \u2014   but not attempted rape.",
      "But Choi was convicted of causing grievous bodily harm and handed a 10-month prison sentence, suspended for two years.",
      "The court said at the time her action had \"exceeded the reasonable bounds of legally permissible self-defense.\"",
      "Her retrial began in the city of Busan on Wednesday, where prosecutors issued an apology and asked for the court to quash her guilty verdict, CBS News partner BBC News reported.",
      "Busan's Chief Prosecutor Jeong Myeong-won said \"we sincerely apologize,\" the BBC reported. \"We have caused Choi Mal-ja, a victim of a sex crime who should have been protected as one, indescribable pain and agony.\"",
      "Choi's case gained renewed momentum decades later after #MeToo movement, which took off globally in 2017 and inspired her to seek justice. In South Korea, massive women's rights protests led to victories on issues ranging from abortion access to tougher penalties for spycam crimes, and a reckoning for the international K-pop music industry.",
      "Choi filed for a retrial in 2020, but lower courts initially rejected her petition. After years of campaigning and an appeal, South Korea's top court finally ordered a retrial in 2024.",
      "\"For 61 years, the state made me live as a criminal,\" Choi told reporters outside the Busan District Court ahead of Wednesday's retrial hearing.",
      "She said she hoped future generations could \"live in a world free from sexual violence where they can enjoy human rights and a happy life.\"",
      "Choi Sun-hye, executive director of the Korea Women's Hotline counselling center, which supported her case, told AFP that her decision was also meant to \"become a source of strength for other victims of sexual violence and correct past wrongs.\"",

    "story": [
      "London\u00a0\u2014 The families of some British victims of the Air India plane crash in Ahmedabad have discovered that remains repatriated to the U.K. were wrongly identified as being their loved ones, a lawyer who says his firm is representing over 20 victims' families told CBS News. Of the 242 people on board the Air India flight from Ahmedabad to London's Gatwick airport that crashed on June 12 just minutes after takeoff, 52 were British citizens.",
      "The cause of the crash has not been confirmed, but a preliminary report released earlier this month by India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau found that cockpit cutoff switches for fuel supply to both of the Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner's engines had been switched, one after another, within one second, leading to both engines losing thrust.",
      "James Healy-Pratt, an aviation lawyer who said he was representing a number of U.K. families, told CBS News the remains of at least 12 British victims of the crash had been repatriated to the U.K., but that two of them had been misidentified.",
      "\"There was one family who believed they had accompanied their loved one back from India, having gone out there to give DNA for the identification, and then (when they returned to the U.K.) were informed that the remains in the casket were nothing to do with them,\" Healy-Pratt told CBS News.",
      "Healy-Pratt said the mistakes were discovered when the Inner West London coroner, Dr. Fiona Wilcox, sought to verify the victims' identities by matching their DNA to samples provided by the families.",
      "\"The first two caskets that arrived into the country \u2014 Dr. Wilcox and her team, assiduous as always, decided to check the verification and identity, and they discovered that DNA had been commingled in one of the caskets, which wasn't related to the person in the casket or the other person,\" Healy-Pratt said.",
      "Healy-Pratt said the family of one of the victims had to cancel funeral plans after being told the remains they thought belonged to their loved one were actually those of an unknown individual.",
      "\"It's a double psychological trauma. It's one thing to lose a loved one, but then you go to India, you sit in a hotel, you give your DNA, you pray to God that there'll be a DNA match. You're then told there is. You're assured everything's fine and certified. You come back, and then you're told either there's more remains in the casket than just your loved one, or there are no remains, in spite of having been certified, and we don't know who this is,\" Healy-Pratt told CBS News.",
      "Indian officials cited by local media soon after the crash said that, given the level of the destruction at the site and the extent to which the wreckage was burned, DNA testing would be required to confirm the final death toll from both the plane and from the buildings at the site in Ahmedabad.",
      "\"We have seen the report and have been working closely with the U.K. side from the moment these concerns and issues were brought to our attention,\" Indian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Shri Randhir Jaiswal said in a statement Wednesday. \"In the wake of the tragic crash, the concerned authorities had carried out identification of victims as per established protocols and technical requirements. All mortal remains were handled with utmost professionalism and with due regard for the dignity of the deceased. We are continuing to work with the U.K. authorities on addressing any concerns related to this issue.\"",
      "Healy-Pratt said the statement from the Indian Foreign Ministry statement was \"simply not good enough.\"",
      "\"It lacks specifics. It lacks any detailed explanation of the chain of custody of the remains from the time of identification to DNA matching to placing in caskets. It lacks any assurances that there may be remains, whether mislabeled, unidentified or identified, still in India,\" he said.",
      "\"The families want to draw a line under their emotional distress that's come out from this and so that requires detailed hard work by the Indian authorities to provide assurances that there are no further remains of British nationals either unidentified, identified or mislabeled, misidentified in India. And the line will not be drawn until that cast iron assurance is provided. And at the moment, it's not forthcoming,\" he said.",
      "U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi are set to meet in London this week, and Healy-Pratt said he hoped this issue would make it onto their agenda.",
      "Healy-Pratt also said that, in addition to seeking the remains of their loved ones, the British families want to know the cause of the Air India crash, so their lawyers are independently investigating. The families, Healy-Pratt said, want to make sure any safety recommendations that come from formal probes are implemented internationally.",
      "\"And then finally, they want financial justice,\" Healy-Pratt said.",
      "He said the families' legal team had \"already made an approach to the lawyers for Air India in London, and we're progressing claims there in the High Court. And we'll also be filing an action against Boeing in the U.S. courts to get more information about these fuel control cutoff switches, because they do have a checkered history.\"",

    "story": [
      "Special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff is scheduled to travel to Europe this week for meetings on a wide range of issues, including the Israel-Hamas conflict, and will continue pushing for a ceasefire and peace deal, according to a U.S. official.",
      "In a briefing with reporters Tuesday, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce suggested Witkoff could soon go to the Middle East, but declined to provide details about his itinerary.",
      "\"When it comes to the specific location of the envoy, I do not have that,\" Bruce said.",
      "Indirect negotiations between Israel and Hamas are ongoing, according to an Israeli official, and the Israeli government expects to soon receive Hamas' response to an offer made last week.",
      "So far, there have been no breakthroughs as they attempt to broker a 60-day ceasefire, initially proposed by the U.S., in the 21-month war. Doha, Qatar, hosted indirect talks between the two parties earlier this month.",
      "Witkoff, according to two diplomatic sources, was expected to travel to the Middle East if negotiations progressed and a deal could potentially be closed. He met last week with Qatari officials at the White House just before President Trump hosted the Qatari prime minister for a dinner that stretched late into the night. It took place as diplomatic efforts were reaching a critical moment in the pursuit of a deal to release the 20 living Israeli hostages, free some Palestinian detainees, allow the entry of much needed food and aid to civilians in Gaza, and bring about a cessation of violence and repositioning of Israeli Defense Forces.",
      "A U.S. official and a regional source familiar with the diplomacy told CBS News that Israel last week proposed a new map with new locations where the IDF would potentially withdraw within Gaza. The demarcation of these proposed withdrawal zones has been a sticking point in the ongoing diplomatic efforts to broker a deal acceptable to both Hamas and the Netanyahu government. The international mediators \u2014 Qatar, Egypt and the U.S. \u2014 planned to transit the Israeli proposal to Hamas for consideration.",
      "The two sources indicated that the Trump administration is cautiously optimistic about the possibility of an impending break in the Gaza negotiations that could lead to a 60-day ceasefire and hostage release.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was in Washington in early July to discuss the deal with the Trump administration but a sticking point emerged over the deployment of Israeli troops during the truce. Israel wants to keep forces in what it says is an important land corridor in southern Gaza, but Hamas views the presence of Israeli troops on that strip of land as an indication that Israel intends to continue the war once a temporary ceasefire expires.",
      "The Knesset goes into a three-month summer recess next week, on July 27, which would give Netanyahu more political flexibility in ceasefire negotiations.",
      "In the meantime, Israel has continued to carry out military operations in Gaza, and on Sunday, it issued new evacuation orders to include an area that has been somewhat less hard hit than others, indicating a new battleground may be opening up and squeezing Palestinians further south.",
      "In a social media post published Sunday, the Israel Defense Forces warned Palestinians that it was operating \"with great force to destroy the enemy's capabilities and terrorist infrastructure\" in the central city of Deir al-Balah, \"as it expands its activities in this region to operate in an area it has not operated in before.\"",

    "story": [
      "When a schoolboy going for a run found the ribs of a wooden ship poking through the dunes of a remote Scottish beach, it sparked a hunt by archaeologists, scientists and local historians to uncover its story.",
      "Through a mix of high-tech science and community research, they have an answer. Researchers announced Wednesday that the vessel is very likely the Earl of Chatham, an 18th-century warship that saw action in the American War of Independence before a second life hunting whales in the Arctic \u2014 and then a stormy demise.",
      "\"I would regard it as a lucky ship, which is a strange thing to say about a ship that's wrecked,\" said Ben Saunders, senior marine archaeologist at Wessex Archaeology, a charity that helped community researchers conduct the investigation. The group posted video about the shipwreck early Wednesday.",
      "\"I think if it had been found in many other places, it wouldn't necessarily have had that community drive, that desire to recover and study that material, and also the community spirit to do it,\" Saunders said.",
      "Uncovered after 250 years",
      "The wreck was discovered in February 2024 after a storm swept away sand covering it on Sanday, one of the rugged Orkney Islands that lie off Scotland's northern tip.",
      "As CBS News partner BBC News reported at the time, the timbers were held together with large wooden pegs, and locals on the island said they believed the ship may have been released from the seabed by violent winter storms.",
      "It excited interest on the island of 500 people, whose history is bound up with the sea and its dangers. Around 270 shipwrecks have been recorded around the 20-square-mile island since the 15th century.",
      "Resident David Walker told BBC Radio he was a history buff and he headed straight to the scene to take photos when he heard word of the discovery.",
      "\"My interest made me jump straight in the van and head over and have a look,\" he told BBC Radio Orkney. \"It's incredible, that was why I took so many pictures.\"",
      "Local farmers used their tractors and trailers to haul the 12 tons of oak timbers off the beach, before local researchers set to work trying to identify it.",
      "\"That was really good fun, and it was such a good feeling about the community \u2014 everybody pulling together to get it back,\" said Sylvia Thorne, one of the island's community researchers. \"Quite a few people are really getting interested in it and becoming experts.\"",
      "In September 2024, the shipwreck was put in a water tank for preservation and study, BBC News reported.",
      "Dendrochronology \u2014 the science of dating wood from tree rings \u2014 showed the timber came from southern England in the middle of the 18th century. That was one bit of luck, Saunders said, because it coincides with \"the point where British bureaucracy's really starting to kick off\" and detailed records were being kept.",
      "\"And so we can then start to look at the archive evidence that we have for the wrecks in Orkney,\" Saunders said. \"It becomes a process of elimination.",
      "\"You remove ones that are Northern European as opposed to British, you remove wrecks that are too small or operating out of the north of England and you really are down to two or three \u2026 and Earl of Chatham is the last one left.\"",
      "Wars and whaling",
      "Further research found that before it was the Earl of Chatham, the ship was HMS Hind, a 24-gun Royal Navy frigate built in Chichester on England's south coast in 1749.",
      "Its military career saw it play a part in the expansion \u2014 and contraction \u2014 of the British Empire. It helped Britain wrest control of Canada from France during the sieges of Louisbourg and Quebec in the 1750s, and in the 1770s served as a convoy escort during Britain's failed effort to hold onto its American colonies.",
      "Sold off by the navy in 1784 and renamed, the vessel became a whaling ship, hunting the huge mammals in the Arctic waters off Greenland.",
      "Whale oil was an essential fuel of the Industrial Revolution, used to lubricate machinery, soften fabric and light city streets. Saunders said that in 1787 there were 120 London-based whaling ships in the Greenland Sea, the Earl of Chatham among them.",
      "A year later, while heading out to the whaling ground, it was wrecked in bad weather off Sanday. All 56 crew members survived \u2014 more evidence, Saunders says, that this was a vessel blessed with luck.",
      "Community effort",
      "The ship's timbers are being preserved in a freshwater tank at the Sanday Heritage Centre while plans are discussed to put it on permanent display.",
      "Saunders said that the project is a model of community involvement in archaeology.",
      "\"The community have been so keen, have been so desirous to be involved and to find out things to learn, and they're so proud of it. It's down to them it was discovered, it's down to them it was recovered and it's been stabilized and been protected,\" he said.",
      "For locals, it's a link to the island's maritime past \u2014 and future. Finding long-buried wrecks could become more common as climate change alters the wind patterns around Britain and reshapes the coastline.",
      "\"One of the biggest things I've got out of this project is realizing how much the past in Sanday is just constantly with you \u2014 either visible or just under the surface,\" said Ruth Peace, another community researcher.",

      "Abu Salmiya told reporters that new cases of malnutrition and starvation were arriving at Gaza's remaining functioning hospitals \"every moment,\" adding: \"We are heading towards alarming numbers of deaths due to the starvation inflicted on the people of Gaza.\"",
      "In a statement issued Tuesday, the U.N. human rights office said many people were arriving at Gaza's hospitals \"in a state of severe exhaustion caused by a lack of food. Others are collapsing in the streets. Many more may be dying unreported ... These deaths and the horrendous physical and psychological suffering caused by hunger are the result of Israel's interference with and militarization of humanitarian assistance.\"",
      "Photos emerging from Gaza in recent days have shown children and infants with severe malnutrition, including some said by hospital workers to have died of the condition. According to the National Institutes of Health, severe malnutrition typically causes symptoms including dramatic wasting, or fat and muscle loss, poor circulation and extreme fatigue.",
      "\"Hospitals are already overwhelmed by the number of casualties from gunfire. They can't provide much more help for hunger-related symptoms because of food and medicine shortages,\" Khalil al-Deqran, a spokesperson for the Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health, told the Reuters news agency. Deqran said there were 600,000 people suffering from malnutrition symptoms such as dehydration and anemia, including 60,000 pregnant women.",

The U.N. and aid organizations say the quantity of food and other emergency supplies being allowed into Gaza since then has been vastly insufficient, however.",
      "Food stocks accumulated inside the Palestinian territory during the ceasefire have depleted, leaving the territory's more than two million inhabitants experiencing the worst shortages since the start of the war sparked by the Hamas-led terrorist attack on Oct. 7, 2023. Some 1,200 Israelis were killed and 251 others taken hostage during that siege more than 650 days ago, and 20 of the captives are still thought to be alive in Gaza.",
      "World Food Program director Carl Skau, who visited Gaza City in early July, called the situation \"the worst\" he had ever seen.",

      "On Monday, the governments of 25 countries, including Israeli and U.S. allies Britain, France, Australia and Canada, urged an immediate end to the war, the unconditional release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas, and the free flow of aid.",
      "In their joint statement, they accused Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's U.S.-backed government of the \"drip feeding of aid and the inhumane killing of civilians, including children\" in Gaza.",
      "The nations also condemned a new system for aid distribution backed by Israel's military that was launched in late May with the support of the Trump administration, but no support from other nations or humanitarian organizations.",
      "The U.N.'s human rights office said Tuesday that Israeli forces have killed more than 1,000 Palestinians trying to get food aid in Gaza since the controversial Gaza Humanitarian Foundation started operations on May 26.",
      "Officially a private effort, the GHF began working in Gaza \u2014 with virtually no information provided about its funding or management \u2014 after Israel imposed the more than two-month blockade on all supplies entering Gaza.",
      "The group's operations, focused around four \"humanitarian hubs\" for food distribution, have been marred by chaotic scenes and near-daily reports of Israeli forces firing on people waiting to collect rations in the Palestinian territory, where the Israeli military is seeking to destroy Hamas.",
      "\"As of July 21, we have recorded 1,054 people killed in Gaza while trying to get food; 766 of them were killed in the vicinity of GHF sites and 288 near U.N. and other humanitarian organizations' aid convoys,\" U.N. human rights office spokesman Thameen Al-Kheetan told the AFP news agency. He said the agency's data was \"based on information from multiple reliable sources on the ground, including medical teams, humanitarian and human rights organizations.\"",

      "The family's statement didn't provide additional details about the circumstances surrounding Osbourne's death.",
      "Osbourne revealed in 2020 that he was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, the movement disorder affecting the nervous system that gets worse over time. A year earlier, the rock star postponed all of his 2019 performances after falling at his home in Los Angeles, which aggravated injuries from a 2003 all-terrain vehicle accident. He announced in 2023 that he would retire from touring.",
      "\"Ozzy was someone who lived hard, rocked hard and retired over and over again, starting, I think, first in the '90s,\" Joe Levy, a contributor for Rolling Stone magazine, told CBS News on Tuesday following news of Osbourne's death. \"He retired at least two times, kept coming back, and the fact that his Parkinson's diagnosis kept him from performing made it all the more amazing that just two weeks ago, he took the stage for what absolutely would be the final time.\"",

      "Black Sabbath's 1969 self-titled debut LP has been likened to the Big Bang of heavy metal. It came during the height of the Vietnam War and crashed the hippie party, dripping menace and foreboding. The cover of the record was of a spooky figure against a stark landscape. The music was loud, dense and angry, and marked a shift in rock 'n' roll.",
      "The band's second album, \"Paranoid,\" included such classic metal tunes as \"War Pigs,\" \"Iron Man\" and \"Fairies Wear Boots.\" The song \"Paranoid\" only reached No. 61 on the Billboard Hot 100 but became in many ways the band's signature song. Both albums were voted among the top 10 greatest heavy metal albums of all time by readers of Rolling Stone magazine.",
      "\"Black Sabbath are the Beatles of heavy metal. Anybody who's serious about metal will tell you it all comes down to Sabbath,\" Dave Navarro of the band Jane's Addiction wrote in a 2010 tribute in Rolling Stone. \"There's a direct line you can draw back from today's metal, through Eighties bands like Iron Maiden, back to Sabbath.\"",
      "Sabbath fired Osbourne in 1979 for his legendary excesses, like showing up late for rehearsals and missing gigs. \"We knew we didn't really have a choice but to sack him because he was just so out of control. But we were all very down about the situation,\" wrote bassist Terry \"Geezer\" Butler in his memoir, \"Into the Void.\"",
      "Osbourne reemerged the next year as a solo artist with \"Blizzard of Ozz\" and the following year's \"Diary of a Madman,\" both hard rock classics that went multi-platinum and spawned enduring favorites such as \"Crazy Train,\" \"Goodbye to Romance,\" \"Flying High Again\" and \"You Can't Kill Rock and Roll.\" Osbourne was twice inducted to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame \u2014 once with Sabbath in 2006 and again in 2024 as a solo artist.",
      "The original Sabbath lineup reunited for the first time in 20 years in July 2025 in the U.K. for what Osborne said would be his final concert. \"Let the madness begin!\" he told 42,000 fans.",
      "Metallica, Guns N Roses, Slayer, Tool, Pantera, Gojira, Alice in Chains, Lamb of God, Halestorm, Anthrax, Rival Sons and Mastodon did sets. Tom Morello, Aerosmith's Steven Tyler, Billy Corgan, Ronnie Wood, Travis Barker, Sammy Hagar, Andrew Watt, Yungblud, Korn's Jonathan Davis, Nuno Bettencourt, Chad Smith and Vernon Reid made appearances. Actor Jason Momoa was the host for the festivities.",
      "\"Black Sabbath: we'd all be different people without them, that's the truth,\" said Pantera singer Phil Anselmo. \"I know I wouldn't be up here with a microphone in my hand without Black Sabbath.\"",
      "Outlandish exploits and a classic look",
      "Osbourne embodied the excesses of metal. His outlandish exploits included relieving himself on the Alamo, snorting a line of ants off a sidewalk and, most memorably, biting the head off a live bat that a fan threw onstage during a 1981 concert. (He said he thought it was rubber.)",
      "In a statement posted to its Facebook page Tuesday, the Alamo said it was \"saddened to hear\" of Osbourne's death.",
      "\"His relationship with the Alamo was marked initially by a deeply disrespectful incident in 1982,\" the statement reads. \"This act profoundly and rightfully upset many who hold this site sacred. However, redemption and reconciliation eventually became part of his history as well. In 1992, Ozzy personally apologized to then-Mayor Nelson Wolff and expressed genuine remorse for his actions. Decades later, in 2015, he revisited the Alamo grounds to learn and appreciate the site's profound history, openly demonstrating humility and understanding.\"",
      "Osbourne was sued in 1987 by parents of a 19-year-old teen who died by suicide while listening to his song \"Suicide Solution.\" The lawsuit was dismissed. Osbourne said the song was really about the dangers of alcohol, which caused the death of his friend Bon Scott, lead singer of AC/DC.",
      "Then-Cardinal John J. O'Connor of New York claimed in 1990 that Osbourne's songs led to demonic possession and even suicide. \"You are ignorant about the true meaning of my songs,\" the singer wrote back. \"You have also insulted the intelligence of rock fans all over the world.\"",
      "Audiences at Osbourne shows could be mooned or spit on by the singer. They would often be hectored to scream along with the song, but the Satan-invoking Osbourne would usually send the crowds home with their ears ringing and a hearty \"God bless!\"",
      "He started an annual tour \u2014 Ozzfest \u2014   in 1996 after he was rejected from the lineup of what was then the top touring music festival, Lollapalooza. Ozzfest has gone on to host such bands as Slipknot, Tool, Megadeth, Rob Zombie, System of a Down, Limp Bizkit and Linkin Park.",
      "Osbourne's look changed little over his life. He wore his long hair flat, heavy black eye makeup and round glasses, often wearing a cross around his neck. In 2013, he reunited with Black Sabbath for the dour, raw \"13,\" which reached No. 1 on the U.K. Albums Chart and peaked at No. 86 on the U.S. Billboard 200. In 2019, he had a Top 10 hit when featured on Post Malone's \"Take What You Want,\" Osbourne's first song in the Top 10 since 1989.",
      "In 2020, he released the album \"Ordinary Man,\" which had as its title song a duet with Elton John. \"I've been a bad guy, been higher than the blue sky/And the truth is I don't wanna die an ordinary man,\" he sang. In 2022, he landed his first career back-to-back No. 1 rock radio singles from his album \"Patient Number 9,\" which featured collaborations with Jeff Beck, Eric Clapton, Mike McCready, Chad Smith, Robert Trujillo and Duff McKagan. It earned four Grammy nominations.",
      "At the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony in 2024, Jack Black called him \"greatest frontman in the history of rock and roll\" and \"the Jack Nicholson of rock.\" Osbourne thanked his fans, his guitarist Randy Rhoads and his longtime wife, Sharon.",
      "The beginnings of Black Sabbath",
      "John Michael Osbourne was raised in the gritty city of Birmingham, England. Kids in school nicknamed him Ozzy, short for his surname. As a boy, he loved the Four Seasons, Chuck Berry and Little Richard. The Beatles made a huge impression.",
      "\"They came from Liverpool, which was approximately 60 miles north of where I come from,\" he told Billboard. \"So all of a sudden it was in my grasp, but I never thought it would be as successful as it became.\"",
      "In the late 1960s, Osbourne had teamed up with Butler, guitarist Tony Iommi and drummer Bill Ward as the Polka Tulk Blues Band. They decided to rename the band Earth, but found to their dismay there was another band with that name. So they changed the name to the American title of the classic Italian horror movie \"I Tre Volti Della Paura,\" starring Boris Karloff: Black Sabbath.",
      "Once they found their sludgy, ominous groove, the band was productive, putting out their self-titled debut and \"Paranoid\" in 1970, \"Master of Reality\" in 1971, \"Vol. 4\" in 1972 and \"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\" in 1973.",
      "The music was all about industrial guitar riffs and disorienting changes in time signatures, along with lyrics that spoke of alienation and doom. \"People think I'm insane because I am frowning all the time,\" Osbourne sang in one song. \"All day long I think of things but nothing seems to satisfy/Think I'll lose my mind if I don't find something to pacify.\"",
      "The Guardian newspaper in 2009 said the band \"introduced working-class anger, stoner sludge grooves and witchy horror-rock to flower power. Black Sabbath confronted the empty platitudes of the 1960s and, along with Altamont and Charles Manson, almost certainly helped kill off the hippy counterculture.\"",
      "After Sabbath, Osbourne had an uncanny knack for calling some of the most creative young guitarists to his side. When he went solo, he hired the brilliant innovator Rhoads, who played on two of Osbourne's finest solo albums, \"Blizzard of Ozz\" and \"Diary of a Madman.\" Rhoads was killed in a freak plane accident in 1982; Osbourne released the live album \"Tribute\" in 1987 in his memory.",
      "Osbourne then signed Jake E. Lee, who lent his talents to the platinum albums \"Bark at the Moon\" and \"The Ultimate Sin.\" Hotshot Zakk Wylde joined Osbourne's band for \"No Rest for the Wicked\" and the multiplatinum \"No More Tears.\"",
      "\"They come along, they sprout wings, they blossom, and they fly off,\" Osbourne said of his players in 1995 to The Associated Press. \"But I have to move on. To get a new player now and again boosts me on.\"",
      "Music world reacts to Osbourne's death",
      "Several musicians and celebrities, including Osbourne's Black Sabbath bandmates, took to social media to respond Tuesday to the news of his death.",
      "\"I just can't believe it! My dear dear friend Ozzy has passed away only weeks after our show at Villa Park,\" Black Sabbath guitarist and band co-founder Tony Iommi\u00a0wrote on X, referring to the farewell show earlier this month. \"It's just such heartbreaking news that I can't really find the words, there won't ever be another like him. Geezer, Bill and myself have lost our brother. My thoughts go out to Sharon and all the Osbourne family. Rest in peace Oz.\"",
      "Black Sabbath bassist Geezer Butler wrote on X: \"Goodbye dear friend - thanks for all those years - we had some great fun. 4 kids from Aston- who'd have thought, eh? So glad we got to do it one last time, back in Aston. Love you.\"",
      "On Instagram, Elton John described Osbourne as a \"dear friend and a huge trailblazer who secured his place in the pantheon of rock gods \u2014 a true legend. He was also one of the funniest people I've ever met. I will miss him dearly. To Sharon and the family, I send my condolences and love.\"",
      "Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood, who took part in Osbourne's farewell concert, wrote on X that he was \"so very sad to hear of the death of Ozzy Osbourne. What a lovely goodbye concert he had at Back To The Beginning in Birmingham.\"",
      "Kiss co-founder Gene Simmons called Osbourne a \"giant\" who was \"Admired and loved by millions of fans worldwide. Prayers and condolences go out to the Osborne family.\"",
      "Actor Jason Momoa, who hosted the farewell show, wrote on Instagram, \"Love you @ozzyosbourne All my aloha @sharonosbourne and ohana. So grateful. RIP.\"",
      "Mike McCready, lead guitarist and founding member of Pearl Jam, wrote on X that he discovered Black Sabbath's music in high school.",
      "\"'War Pigs' was terrifying and mesmerizing at the same time,\" McCready wrote. \"It was Ozzy's voice that took me away to a dark universe. A great escape. Then when The 'Blizzard of Ozz' record came out I was instantly a fan. Randy Rhoads was an influence on me to play lead guitar. Luckily I got to play on the song 'Immortal' on the last record. Thanks for the music, Ozzy it makes our journey in life better.\"",
      "Courting controversy \u2014 and wholesomeness",
      "Whomever he was playing with, Osbourne wasn't likely to back down from controversy. He had the last laugh when the TV evangelist the Rev. Jimmy Swaggart in 1986 lambasted various rock groups and rock magazines as \"the new pornography,\" prompting some retailers to pull Osbourne's album.",
      "When Swaggart later was caught with a sex worker in 1988, Osbourne put out the song \"Miracle Man\" about his foe: \"Miracle man got busted/miracle man got busted,\" he sang. \"Today I saw a Miracle Man, on TV cryin'/Such a hypocritical man, born again, dying.\"",
      "Much later, a whole new Osbourne would be revealed when \"The Osbournes,\" which ran on MTV from 2002-2005, showed this one-time self-proclaimed madman drinking Diet Cokes as he struggled to find the History Channel on his new satellite television or warning his kids not to smoke or drink before they embarked on a night on the town.",
      "Later, he and his son Jack toured America on the travel show \"Ozzy & Jack's World Detour,\" where the pair visited such places as Mount Rushmore and the Space Center Houston. Osbourne was honored in 2014 with the naming of a bat frog found in the Amazon that makes high-pitched, batlike calls. It was dubbed Dendropsophus ozzyi.",
      "He also met Queen Elizabeth II during her Golden Jubilee weekend. He was standing next to singer-actor Cliff Richard. \"She took one look at the two of us, said 'Oh, so this is what they call variety, is it?' then cracked up laughing. I honestly thought that Sharon had slipped some acid into my cornflakes that morning,\" he wrote in \"I Am Ozzy.\"",
      "Thelma Riley and Osbourne married in 1971; Osbourne adopted her son Elliot Kingsley, and they had two more children, Jessica and Louis. Osbourne later met Sharon, who became her own celebrity persona, when she was running her father's Los Angeles office. Her father was Don Arden, a top concert promoter and artist manager. She went to Osbourne's hotel in Los Angeles to collect money, which Osbourne had spent on drugs.",
      "\"She says she'll come back in three days and I'd better have it. I'd always fancied her and I thought, 'Ah, she's coming back! Maybe I have a chance.' I had pizza hanging from my hair, cigarette ashes on my shirt,\" he told the Los Angeles Times in 2000. They married in 1982, had three children \u2014 Kelly, Aimee and Jack \u2014 and endured periodic separations and reconciliations.",
      "He is survived by Sharon, and his children.",

    "story": [
      "An American airman who was killed after being trapped on a mountain with his unit during the Vietnam War has been accounted for nearly 60 years after his death, military officials said Monday.",
      "U.S. Air Force Tech. Sgt. Willis R. Hall was assigned to Lima Site 85, a tactical air navigation radio site on a remote mountain peak in Laos, the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency said in a news release. There were 18 other men assigned to the site. On March 11, 1968, the location was attacked by Vietnamese commandos, marking the start of a major offensive by communist Vietnamese forces in Laos, which was a neutral country at that time, according to newspaper clippings shared by the DPAA.",
      "The unit had to evacuate to a narrow ledge of the 5,600-foot mountain. A few hours later, an A-1 Skyraider aircraft was able to provide cover for a rescue operation. U.S. helicopters managed to rescue eight of the men and travel to a base in Thailand. One of the rescued men died while en route to the base, according to a newspaper clipping.",
      "Hall and 10 other American soldiers were killed, and their bodies were unable to be recovered, officials said. Hall, a native of Broward County, Florida,   was 40 years old at the time of his death and was survived by his wife Mary, according to newspaper clippings. His name has been engraved on the Courts of the Missing at the National Cemetery of the Pacific in Honolulu, and on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall in Washington, D.C., the DPAA said.",
      "In 1994, a joint recovery operation by the U.S. and Laos failed to find any of the 11 servicemembers' remains, but nine years later, a second operation found one set of remains. A 2005 newspaper clipping said that to find the remains, U.S. investigators spoke to Vietnamese commandos who had been involved in the attack. The commandos showed the investigators where they had thrown the bodies of the dead servicemembers off the mountain. Investigators threw dummies from those sites, and used a video camera mounted on a helicopter to see where they landed.",
      "In 2023, DPAA personnel and partner organization members discovered unexploded ordnance, incident-related materials and possible material evidence and bones near another site on the mountain. Those remains were found to be those of a second technician who died during the attack.",
      "Joint recovery teams returned to the mountain earlier this year. Across two operations, the teams found possible human remains and other evidence. Those remains were taken to the DPAA Laboratory.",
      "At the laboratory, DPAA scientists used anthropological analysis and DNA analysis to study the remains. They also used material evidence found at the site to identify the remains as Hall's.",
      "Hall's family was briefed on his identification in last month. A rosette will be placed on his name on the Courts of the Missing and at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial to show that he has been accounted for. Hall is set to be buried in Altoona, Kansas, in September.",

    "summary": "South Korean officials planned to publicize the results of an investigation into the cause of the crash but canceled the briefing after strong protests by relatives of victims.",
    "story": [
      "The initial results of an investigation into December's devastating Jeju Air crash in South Korea showed that, while the plane's both engines sustained bird strikes, its pilots turned off the less-damaged one just before its crash-landing. The finding, which implied human errors, drew quick, vehement protests from bereaved families and fellow pilots who accuse authorities of trying to shift responsibility for the disaster to the dead pilots.",
      "South Korea's Aviation and Railway Accident Investigation Board initially planned to publicize the results of an investigation of the plane's engines on Saturday. But it was forced to cancel its press briefing in the face of strong protests by relatives of crash victims who were informed of the findings earlier in the day, according to government officials and bereaved families.",
      "\"If they want to say their investigation was done in a reliable, independent manner, they should have come up with evidence that backs up their explanation,\" said Kim Yu-jin, head of an association of bereaved families. \"None of us resent the pilots.\"",
      "The Boeing 737-800 operated by Jeju Air landed on its belly without its land gear deployed at South Korea's southern Muan International Airport on Dec. 29. It overshoot a runaway, slammed into a concrete structure and burst into flames. It was the deadliest disaster in South Korea's aviation history in decades, killing all but two of the 181 people on board.",
      "According to a copy of an unpublished briefing report obtained by The Associated Press, a South Korean-led multilateral investigation team said it found no defects in the plane's engines built by France's Safran and GE.",
      "The report said thorough examinations of the engines found the plane's right engine suffered more serious internal damage following bird strikes as it was engulfed with big fires and black smoke. But the pilots switched off the plane's left engine, the report said citing probes on the cockpit voice recorder, the flight data recorder and the engines examinations.",
      "Officials earlier said the black boxes of the Boeing jetliner stopped recording about four minutes before the accident, complicating investigations into the cause of the disaster. The cockpit voice recorder and the flight data recorder cited in the briefing report refers to data stored before the recording stopped.",
      "The report didn't say why the pilots shut off the less-damaged engine and stopped short of saying whether it was an error by the pilots.",
      "Bereaved families and pilots at Jeju Air and other airlines lambasted the investigation findings, saying authorities must disclose the cockpit voice recorder and the flight data recorder.",
      "\"We, the 6,500 pilots at civilian airlines, can't contain our seething anger against the preposterous argument by the Aviation and Railway Accident Investigation Board that lost neutrality,\" the Korean Pilot Unions Alliance said in a statement Tuesday.",
      "Unionized pilots at Jeju Air also issued a statement urging authorities to present scientific evidence to show the plane should have landed normally if it flew with the less-damaged engine.",
      "The latest report focused only on engine issues and didn't mention other factors that could also be blamed for the crash. Among them is the concrete structure the plane crashed into. It housed a set of antennas called localizers designed to guide aircraft safely during landings, and many analysts say it should have been made with more easily breakable materials. Some pilots say they suspect the government wouldn't want to mainly and prominently blame the localizers or bird strikes for mass deaths as the Muan airport is under direct management of the Transport Ministry.",
      "The Aviation and Railway Accident Investigation Board and the Transport Ministry have offered no public response to the criticism. They said they also won't publicly discuss the engine investigations to respect demands by bereaved families.",
      "A person familiar with the investigation told the AP that authorities are looking at the localizers and other issues like whether air traffic controllers relayed the danger of bird strikes to the pilots swiftly enough and what emergency training Jeju Air offered to pilots. The person, who requested anonymity citing the sensitive nature of the investigation, said authorities earlier planned to publicize the results of probes after reviewing various issues, but changed the plan and tried to release the outcome of engine investigations at the request of bereaved families. He said authorities don't intend to lay the responsibility for the disaster to the pilots.",
      "Authorities aim to publish the investigation's final results by next June, the person said.",
      "But Kwon Bo Hun, dean of Aeronautics College at the Far East University in South Korea, called the government's planned announcement \"clumsy\" because it didn't disclose evidence that supported its finding on the pilots. He said it only irritated \"emotional parts of us that the investigation puts the whole blame on dead people.\"",
      "A former Transport Ministry-turned-university professor reached by the AP said the engine investigation report must be \"reliable\" as it's based on an analysis of cockpit voice and flight data recorders that \"don't lie.\" He spoke on condition of anonymity citing the delicate nature of the issue.",

      "Dr. Salvador Plasencia, one of Matthew Perry's ketamine providers, pleaded guilty Wednesday to four counts of distribution of the dissociative drug.",
      "Plasencia, 43, admitted to four counts of distribution of ketamine, a plea deal he agreed to last month. Standing before Judge Sherilyn Peace Garnett in a Los Angeles federal court, Plasencia said his legal team had \"considered everything\" when it came to the plea and subsequent sentencing.",
      "Prosecutors agreed to drop three additional counts against Plasencia in exchange for his guilty plea. He had been scheduled to go on trial next month alongside Jasveen Sangha, aka \"The Ketamine Queen.\"",
      "MATTHEW PERRY DOCTOR AGREES TO PLEAD GUILTY ON FOUR COUNTS IN CONNECTION TO STAR'S DEATH",
      "Matthew Perry died in October 2023 from \"acute effects of ketamine.\" (Gregg DeGuire)",
      "The \"Friends\" star died on Oct. 28, 2023, after an apparent drowning in the hot tub at his Pacific Palisades home, authorities confirmed to Fox News Digital at the time. He was 54.",
      "\"Dr. Plasencia is profoundly remorseful for the treatment decisions he made while providing ketamine to Matthew Perry,\" his attorney, Karen Goldstein, said in a statement provided to Fox News Digital.",
      "MATTHEW PERRY'S DOCTORS SHOWED \u2018DISDAIN' FOR HIS LIFE: \u2018IT\u2019S SICKENING'",
      "\"He is fully accepting responsibility by pleading guilty to drug distribution. Dr. Plasencia intends to voluntarily surrender his medical license, acknowledging his failure to protect Mr. Perry, a patient who was especially vulnerable due to addiction.\"",
      "She added, \"While Dr. Plasencia was not treating Mr. Perry at the time of his death, he hopes his case serves as a warning to other medical professionals and leads to stricter oversight and clear protocols for the rapidly growing at-home ketamine industry in order to prevent future tragedies like this one.\"",
      "Rither Alabre, partner at Blank Rome's White Collar Defense & Investigations Group and former prosecutor, told Fox News Digital that Plasencia's plea is important for the case, and also sends a message.",
      "Jasveen Sangha, the \"Ketamine Queen,\" allegedly rented a home in North Hollywood for the purpose of manufacturing, storing, and distributing controlled substances, according to the indictment. (United States Attorney's Office)",
      "Drug dealer Erik Fleming described the ketamine available to Perry and his assistant, Kenneth Iwamasa, in texts shown in the indictment. (United States Attorney's Office)",
      "\"The guilty plea by Dr. Plasencia is significant because he is the second doctor to plead guilty in relation to Mr. Perry\u2019s death, and the plea sends a strong message to drug dealers, as well as doctors and members of the medical community, that prosecutors are paying close attention and will vigorously prosecute these types of cases,\" Alabre said.",
      "Sentencing will be determined at a later date, but his charges may set the stage for prospective civil suits, according to entertainment and employment attorney Camron Dowlatshahi of MSD Lawyers.",
      "LIKE WHAT YOU\u2019RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS",
      "\"Because the burden of proof is much higher in criminal cases versus civil cases \u2013 beyond a reasonable doubt vs. preponderance of evidence \u2013 having a criminal conviction in the bag makes it much easier to win a civil case,\" Dowlatshahi told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"Typically, with a plea, the defendant will get much less prison time than the maximum, hence the agreement to plead guilty. Here, the maximum sentence is 40 years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of at least $2 million. I would expect significantly less in all aspects. The punishment should be a warning to all physicians handling and distributing substances to do so with extreme care and humanity toward everyone, including those who are extremely wealthy and famous.\"",
      "Neama Rahmani, president of West Coast Trial Lawyers, noted that Plasencia abused his position for financial gain, and caused a \"gross violation of trust.\"",
      "Matthew Perry described using ketamine therapy in his memoir, \"Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing.\" (Getty Images)",
      "\"The punishment does fit the crime because Plasencia did not provide the fatal dose of ketamine that killed Perry,\" Rahmani said. \"Perry's family could file a civil lawsuit, but they don't need the money, and even though Plasencia provided the supplies and training, that may not be enough to establish medical causation for a wrongful death case. Co-defendants Sangha, Fleming, and Iwamasa are more directly liable for Perry's death.\"",

During another sale, the dealers \"took advantage of Mr. Perry\" by selling approximately \"50 vials of ketamine for approximately $11,000 in cash.\"",
      "Plasencia, a ketamine source, was introduced to Perry by his assistant in September 2023. Plasencia, who obtained ketamine from Dr. Mark Chavez, allegedly taught the assistant how to inject Perry with the drug. Chavez previously ran a ketamine clinic and allegedly submitted a bogus prescription in the name of a former patient to secure the drug.",
      "Chavez agreed to plead guilty to one count of conspiracy to distribute ketamine as part of his plea agreement. The San Diego-based doctor admitted to selling ketamine to Plasencia, including ketamine that he had diverted from his former ketamine clinic.",

The investigation ultimately found that since December 2024, out of 351 cases involving patients who had been authorized for organ procurement, but the organs were ultimately not recovered, 29% showed neurological signs not conducive to organ procurement.",

      "In the final decision, Gibbons, however, rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 claims that the law is too vague to be constitutional under the Due Process Clause.

    "story": [
      "Rep. Mike Ezell, R-Miss., explains why establishing a secretary of the Coast Guard will benefit the service and better equip it to face national security threats.",
      "Efforts to overhaul the Coast Guard are gaining traction on Capitol Hill \u2014 coinciding with the Trump administration\u2019s endeavor to revamp the service to address illegal migrant crossings and drug seizures.",
      "Multiple initiatives to update the Coast Guard are underway in both chambers of Congress, and within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). All seek to elevate the service so it\u2019s on par with the other branches of the military that fall under the Department of Defense, and better equip it to tackle drug and immigration interdiction missions.",
      "House legislation authorizing funding for the service through 2029 recently cleared a committee vote and aims to empower the service to conduct these missions, according to Rep. Mike Ezell, R-Miss., a co-sponsor of the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2025.",
      "\"The Coast Guard is very similar to law enforcement,\" Ezell told Fox News Digital July 16. \"It's going to fight the narcotics epidemic that we have coming into the country. Our Coast Guard officers and men and women are going to really be able to go after that.\"",

      "Such missions are only increasing for the Coast Guard. DHS announced July 15 that the service had seized a total of 242,244 pounds of cocaine since President Donald Trump took office in January. That amounts to a more than 100% increase in seizures in comparison to the same timeframe in 2024 during the Biden administration, according to DHS.",
      "Ezell, along with Reps. Sam Graves, R-Mo., Rick Larsen, D-Wash., and Salud Carbajal, D-Calif., introduced the Coast Guard Authorization Act July 2, and the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee passed the measure July 15, paving the way for the measure to head to the House floor.",
      "One of the most significant provisions in the legislation would establish a civilian secretary of the Coast Guard to align more similarly with the other branches of the military that fall under the Department of Defense. The Coast Guard falls under the jurisdiction of DHS and does not have a top civilian leading the service.",
      "Installing a secretary of the service will \"streamline some of this red tape that we've seen over the years that\u2019s slowed progress down\" because he or she will report directly to the White House and Congress \u2014 eliminating multiple layers of bureaucracy, according to Ezell.",

      "\"Coming from my background as a sheriff and the chief of police, I know the importance of coordinating with other agencies to get the job done,\" Ezell said. \"When you have one person that's a point of contact who will put all the information out from the president, from the DHS Secretary, it'll be so much simpler.\"",

      "What is the coffee ring effect, and why does it matter in science?",
      "Ever wondered why spilled coffee, wine or tea dries in a ring rather than evenly? This common pattern is known as the \"coffee ring effect.\" The phenomenon occurs because of the liquid's surface tension. As the drop begins to dry, water at the edges evaporates more quickly since that area is thinner. To keep up, liquid from the center flows outward, carrying tiny particles with it. Once the drop is completely dry, these particles settle along the edge, creating the signature ring stain you see on tables and countertops every day.",

Researchers at UC Berkeley transformed this everyday nuisance into a powerful new at-home diagnostic test. This innovative test can identify diseases like COVID-19, prostate cancer and sepsis with remarkable accuracy. In fact, it is up to 100 times more sensitive than many current rapid tests. Even better, it delivers results in just twelve minutes, depending on the test.",
      "The idea began with Kamyar Behrouzi, a former Ph.D. student at UC Berkeley. While developing a COVID-19 biosensor in 2020, he noticed that virus particles, much like coffee particles, tend to gather at the edge of a droplet. By using this natural effect, the researchers designed a test that captures and concentrates disease markers, making detection much easier. Thanks to this stain-inspired science, fast and reliable testing is now possible right at home.",

      "How this coffee-inspired test detects COVID-19, sepsis, and more",
      "So, how does this innovative test actually work? First, you place a small sample from your nose or cheek onto a special membrane. As the sample dries, disease proteins concentrate at the edges to form a visible ring. Next, you add a second droplet containing light-reactive particles. If certain disease biomarkers are present, these nanoparticles light up when exposed to light. You can see positive results with the naked eye in some cases, or verify them more accurately using a special AI-powered smartphone app.",
      "This rapid test does more than detect COVID-19. It can also identify early signs of sepsis, a life-threatening infection that needs quick treatment.

      "How a Facebook impersonation scam begins: A familiar name with a dangerous message",
      "Jim, a retired tech industry veteran, received a message on Facebook from his longtime friend, Lynda. The message started casually,\u00a0\"How are you doing today, Jim?\" But it quickly shifted into a suspicious sales pitch for a government-backed grant. Lynda claimed she had received $150,000 from an organization called \"Global Empowerment\" and encouraged Jim to apply through an agent named David Kelvin. Although Jim was intrigued, he remained cautious. As their conversation progressed, he sensed something was off.",

      "The tech is called e-OPRA (Enhanced Osseointegrated Prostheses for the Rehabilitation of Amputees). It involves surgically implanting a titanium rod into the femur, which connects directly to a robotic prosthetic limb. This rod becomes the foundation of a new kind of interface between the body and machine. But it doesn't stop there.",
      "Using a specialized surgical technique known as Agonist-Antagonist Myoneural Interface (AMI), muscles are reconnected in functional pairs.

      "Why the bionic knee for amputees is a major breakthrough",
      "Traditional socket-based prosthetics can be uncomfortable, unstable, and prone to infections. They often feel foreign, like a tool strapped to the body rather than a part of it. The bionic knee bypasses the socket altogether. By connecting directly to bone and muscle, it improves load-bearing, reduces skin problems, and most importantly, restores a sense of control. And control isn't just physical, it's emotional and psychological. Patients using the e-OPRA system reported a greater sense of agency and body ownership than those with traditional or partially-integrated prosthetics.",

      "Professor Hugh Herr isn't just leading the research; he's living it. After losing both legs below the knee to frostbite in his teens, he returned to mountain climbing and dedicated his career to advancing prosthetic technology.

      "Photo showing fentanyl pills seized at the U.S. border. (Elizabeth Denis/Pacific Northwest National Laboratory)",
      "How VaporID detects drugs faster than swab tests",
      "This portable air scanner, created at the Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), is being brought to market by California-based instrument maker BaySpec. The device works by pulling in air and identifying molecules in real time using a miniature mass spectrometer.",
      "Unlike traditional swab tests that take five to thirty minutes, VaporID detects fentanyl in seconds, even at levels as low as six parts per trillion. That's like spotting a single pine needle in an entire forest.",
      "Why drug dogs may soon be outmatched by VaporID",
      "For decades, trained canines have been the gold standard at ports of entry. But dogs have limits; they tire, need handlers, and can't be reprogrammed with software updates. VaporID, on the other hand, never needs a nap. It can detect not only known drugs but also fentanyl analogs, lab-made variants designed to skirt detection.",
      "The system's cutting-edge design includes an atmospheric flow tube that allows tiny drug molecules more time to interact with charged ions. That chemical dance dramatically boosts sensitivity, making it possible to detect even the most elusive threats.",
      "During a real-world field trial at the Nogales, Arizona border crossing, the device detected trace amounts of several drugs, including fentanyl and cocaine, within seconds inside a Customs and Border Protection lab.",
      "Illustration of the action within the atmospheric flow tube that is a key to the detection of trace levels of fentanyl. (Sara Levine/Pacific Northwest National Laboratory)",
      "How VaporID works: Air, ions, and instant answers",
      "VaporID weighs about 40 pounds and draws in ambient air like a miniature vacuum. Suspicious molecules are filtered, tagged with electrically charged ions, and passed into a tiny mass spectrometer. Only the relevant particles make it through. This process filters out background interfering vapors from things like perfumes or cleaning agents, giving border agents a clear, accurate, and immediate read on potentially dangerous substances.",
      "What VaporID means for border security",
      "If deployed widely, VaporID could revolutionize how U.S. Customs and Border Protection detects narcotics and explosives. Its fast, hands-free scanning would help agents screen vehicles, cargo, luggage, and even people, without relying solely on canine units or invasive sampling.",
      "The device's sensitivity also opens doors for use beyond borders. The Department of Homeland Security is already working with PNNL and BaySpec to adapt the technology for mail screening, airport baggage checks, and large-scale cargo inspections.",
      "For materials like TNT (trinitrotoluene) and PETN (pentaerythritol tetranitrate), both powerful explosives that release very few molecules into the air, VaporID's ultra-sensitive detection provides a level of protection that's long been out of reach with current methods.",
      "Chemist Elizabeth Denis uses the PNNL system to check a substance in the laboratory. (Andrea Starr/Pacific Northwest National Laboratory)",
      "VaporID\u2019s role in combating drug and explosive smuggling",
      "The U.S. is facing a deadly influx of synthetic opioids. According to the CDC, over 80,000 Americans died from drug overdoses in 2024, including approximately 48,400 deaths linked to fentanyl and other synthetic opioids. Fast, contactless detection at ports of entry could help choke off the supply chain before these deadly substances ever hit the streets. And in an era of rising geopolitical tensions, having a portable scanner that can also detect explosives could be a critical layer in national defense.",

      "KR1 doesn't just move intelligently, it learns. Kinisi equipped the robot with built-in AI that allows it to adapt in real time to its surroundings. It recognizes obstacles, modifies its arm movement and executes precise trajectories even as the warehouse layout changes. This means workers don't need to reprogram the system each time workflows shift. One of KR1's most impressive features is its ability to learn from demonstration. Warehouse staff can guide the robot through a task once, and KR1 can replicate it accurately without complex coding. This speeds up onboarding and makes it easy to scale up operations. In a recent demo video, KR1 moved across a warehouse floor on its own. It approached various shelving units, selected a range of items, and placed them into totes with deliberate and smooth movements. It then transported the loaded containers to the correct location, all while avoiding obstacles and adjusting to its environment in real time.",
      "The Kinisi 01, also known as KR1, is a powerful autonomous humanoid robot. (Kinisi Robotics)",
      "This robot works offline without relying on cloud computing",
      "While many robots rely on cloud computing, Kinisi took a different approach. KR1 processes data locally, which means it can function reliably even in environments with weak or unstable internet connections. Local processing also improves response times and enhances data privacy. This design ensures KR1 continues working even during network disruptions. It also allows the robot to make split-second decisions, which is essential in fast-paced warehouses.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Where this humanoid warehouse robot can work beyond logistics",
      "KR1 is already proving useful in logistics, but its design makes it suitable for a wide range of industries. In addition to streamlining warehouse fulfillment, KR1 is built to assist with tasks in retail stocking, light manufacturing, and maintenance work. Kinisi developed the robot to blend into existing workflows, which eliminates the need for expensive infrastructure upgrades. Because the robot combines physical strength with the ability to learn, it can handle repetitive tasks that require both accuracy and endurance. As a result, companies can reduce labor costs, improve workplace safety and increase operational flexibility.",
      "The Kinisi 01, also known as KR1, is a powerful autonomous humanoid robot. (Kinisi Robotics)",
      "How much does KR1 cost? Here's what we know",
      "During a recent presentation at Automate 2025, Kinisi CEO Brennand Pierce revealed that the robot currently costs around $4,000 per month. That rate appears to be part of a subscription-based model, which may include the robot, its onboard AI and ongoing support. Instead of selling KR1 outright, Kinisi is targeting small to mid-size warehouses with a flexible, monthly pricing strategy.",
      "This approach allows businesses to adopt automation without making large upfront investments or overhauling their infrastructure. Although the company hasn't confirmed what the monthly fee includes, the model positions KR1 as a scalable, low-risk solution for logistics teams looking to boost productivity fast.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Kinisi KR1 shows that the future of work is already here. This robot lifts like a human, moves like a worker and learns like a fast-thinking employee.

      "Google Maps Location Sharing is now built into Android settings; no need for Maps settings. Tech expert Kurt Knutsson discusses the welcome improvement for Android users.",
      "A team of academic researchers has uncovered a new Android security exploit that raises a lot of questions about the platform\u2019s permission system. The technique, named TapTrap, uses user interface animations to visually deceive you into granting sensitive permissions or performing harmful actions. Unlike earlier tapjacking attacks, TapTrap Android attack works by launching transparent system prompts over regular app interfaces. The result is a near-invisible layer that silently captures your taps and interactions.",

      "A person holding an Android phone\u00a0(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How the TapTrap Android exploit tricks you into granting permissions",
      "As reported by Bleeping Computer, TapTrap takes advantage of how Android handles activity transitions between apps. A malicious app can launch a system-level screen using the standard start Activity function but modify how the screen appears using a custom animation. By setting both the start and end opacity to a very low value, such as 0.01, the activity becomes nearly invisible to the user.",
      "Touch input is still fully registered by the transparent screen, even though users only see the visible app underneath. Attackers can also apply a scaling animation that enlarges a specific user interface element, such as a permission button, so that it fills the screen. This increases the chance that a user will unknowingly tap the button.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The researchers released a video showing how this technique could be used in a gaming app to quietly launch a Chrome browser permission prompt. The prompt asks for camera access, and the user taps \"Allow\" without realizing what they have done. Because the malicious screen is transparent, there are no visual cues to suggest anything suspicious is happening.",
      "Image of an Android phone\u00a0(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why 76% of Android apps are vulnerable to TapTrap",
      "To assess how widespread the vulnerability might be, the researchers tested nearly 100,000 apps from the Play Store. About 76% were found to be potentially vulnerable, not because they are malicious, but because they lack key safeguards. These apps had at least one screen that could be launched by another app, shared the same task stack, failed to override the default transition animation, and did not block user input during the transition.",
      "Android enables these animations by default. Users can only disable them through settings that are typically hidden, such as Developer Options or Accessibility menus. Even the latest Android version, tested on a Google Pixel 8a, remains unprotected against this exploit.",
      "GrapheneOS, a security-focused operating system based on Android, confirmed that its current version is also affected. However, it plans to release a fix in its next update.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Google has acknowledged the issue and said a future Android update will contain a mitigation. While no exact timeline has been announced, Google is expected to change how input and animations are handled to prevent invisible tap interception.",
      "The company added that developers must follow strict Play Store policies and that any app found abusing this vulnerability will face enforcement actions.",
      "A person holding an Android phone\u00a0(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "4 ways you can stay safe from TapTrap attack",
      "1) Consider a mobile security app:\u00a0Use a trusted antivirus or mobile security app that can detect suspicious behavior or alert you to apps using overlays or accessibility features improperly.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices at\u00a0CyberGuy.com/LockUpYourTech",
      "2) Be selective about the apps you install:\u00a0Avoid installing apps just because they\u2019re trending or have flashy ads. Check developer credibility, recent reviews and app permissions before downloading.",
      "3) Stick to the Google Play Store:\u00a0While not perfect, the Play Store has better safeguards than random APK sources. Avoid installing apps from third-party stores or unknown websites.",
      "4) Pause before granting permissions:\u00a0If an app suddenly asks for access to your camera, microphone, or other sensitive features, take a moment. Always ask yourself if this app really needs this permission right now.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "TapTrap shows that security threats do not always come from complex code or aggressive malware. Sometimes, small oversights in visual behavior can open paths for serious abuse. In this case, the danger lies in what users do not see. People trust what they can see on their screens. This attack breaks that link by creating a visual mismatch between intent and outcome.",

      "Bring in the experts of 3D printing construction",
      "To tackle a project of this scale, UCC Holding brought in the experts. The company partnered with Danish firm COBOD, a global leader in 3D construction printing. As a result, COBOD supplied two massive, custom-built BOD2 printers. Each machine measures approximately 164 feet long, 90 feet wide, and 49 feet high, about the size of a Boeing 737 hangar.",
      "These industrial printers can build structures up to five stories tall. They enable fast, accurate and cost-effective construction that traditional methods can't match.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Before launching the project, UCC's team of architects, engineers and technicians carried out extensive tests. At a trial site in Doha, they completed more than 100 full-scale component prints using a BOD2 printer. To further prepare for Qatar's desert climate, the team engineered a custom concrete mix designed to cure properly in high heat. Additionally, they developed a special extrusion nozzle to ensure smooth, precise printing.",

Therefore, making this project one of unprecedented scale for the region.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Qatar's desert formations were the inspiration behind the architectural design of the schools.

      "UCC Holdings and COBOD construction team's launch Qatar\u2019s 3D Printed Schools Project. (UCC Holding)",
      "How 3D printing enhances sustainability and innovation",
      "Qatar's 3D-printed school project goes beyond architectural innovation; it also marks a major step toward sustainable construction. 3D printing technology reduces material waste by up to 60% compared to traditional building methods. It also minimizes labor requirements and shortens construction timelines, leading to lower overall emissions and energy use.",
      "Moreover, the ability to print complex, curved designs, like the dune-inspired walls of these schools, proves how digital construction methods can unlock new levels of creativity while staying cost-efficient. This approach not only supports Qatar's environmental goals but also sets a new global standard for eco-friendly building design.",

      "What is Amazon\u2019s Starfish AI project?",
      "Starfish is a multi-year initiative built around generative AI. According to an internal Amazon document obtained by Business Insider, the system gathers product data from across the web, including external websites and images. It then uses large language models (LLMs) to create \"complete, correct and consistent\" product listings. This isn't a small update. Amazon expects Starfish to boost sales by $7.5 billion in 2025 alone by improving conversion rates and expanding product variety.",

      "Now, with Starfish, Amazon wants to scale that effort across millions of listings. The AI will also collect data from 200,000 external brand websites by crawling, scraping and mapping their content to Amazon's catalog. It's not yet clear whether Amazon's own web crawler, Amazonbot, is powering Starfish. But the company confirmed to Business Insider that Starfish is already supporting its new \"Buy for Me\" feature. This feature recommends products from external websites and lets shoppers buy them directly within Amazon's app.",
      "A person shopping on Amazon (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why Amazon built the Starfish AI for marketplace listings",
      "Manually creating product listings is slow and often inconsistent. That's a problem when Amazon wants to offer a massive selection with reliable information. If shoppers can't find what they're looking for, or if the listings are vague, they may head elsewhere. Starfish addresses this by automating the tedious parts of listing creation. That helps sellers spend less time writing and more time selling. For Amazon, better listings mean higher conversion rates and happier customers. Plus, this move positions Amazon to compete more directly with Google Shopping, which also aims to be a central hub for product information.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Amazon\u2019s Starfish AI is expanding globally",
      "Amazon is testing Starfish's effectiveness with A/B comparisons, measuring sales performance of AI-enriched listings versus standard ones. It's also rolling out bulk listing tools and preparing to expand the system globally. This isn't just about improving Amazon's website. It's about changing the way product information is gathered, created and shared at scale.",
      "A person shopping on Amazon\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What does this mean for you as an Amazon shopper or seller",
      "If you're a shopper on Amazon, this could mean faster access to clearer, more accurate product listings, especially for obscure or hard-to-find items. As Amazon's AI fills in missing details and improves titles and descriptions, the results should help you make better decisions with less research.",
      "For sellers, this streamlines the work of creating listings. If you've struggled to write compelling descriptions or keep up with Amazon's catalog standards, the Starfish project may do much of the heavy lifting. That could save time, reduce errors and improve sales performance.",
      "However, there are some trade-offs. As Amazon scrapes more data from across the web to power its listings, brands and smaller websites may worry about how their product information is being used. And if AI-generated content becomes widespread, quality and trust in listings may vary depending on how well the system works.",
      "In short, expect a more automated Amazon shopping experience, with both conveniences and questions about how your data and the broader web are being used to power it.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Amazon's Starfish project signals a major shift in how e-commerce works. By combining web scraping, AI models and deep integration into its Marketplace, Amazon hopes to automate one of the most time-consuming parts of online selling. For buyers and sellers, this could mean more convenience and better results. But it also raises important questions about transparency, data ownership and the future role of AI in shaping what we see online.",

      "Keep in mind that this list may not include every product affected by these vulnerabilities. As more research emerges, the list could change. Furthermore, not every device faces all the same risks. For instance, at least one manufacturer seems to have already addressed CVE-2025-20700 and CVE-2025-20701. However, we do not know if this fix was intentional or accidental.",
      "Because of these factors, getting a complete and accurate picture of which devices are truly secure remains a challenge. As a consumer, you should stay alert for updates and check with your device's manufacturer for the latest information.",

These manufacturers are now responsible for building and distributing firmware updates to affected products. If you haven't seen an update yet, it should be arriving soon, though some may already be available.",
      "However, there's a catch. According to a report by German outlet Heise, many of the most recent firmware updates for affected devices were released before Airoha provided its official fix. This means some products may still be running vulnerable code, despite appearing up to date.",
      "To make matters more complicated, consumers typically aren't notified directly about these updates. Firmware patches for headphones and similar devices often install silently, or in some cases, may not be delivered at all. As a result, most users have no way of knowing whether their devices are secure or still exposed to risk.",

      "1. Regularly check for firmware updates:\u00a0Visit the manufacturer's app or website to manually check for firmware updates, even if you haven\u2019t received a notification. Automatic updates aren\u2019t always reliable, especially for headphones and earbuds.",
      "2. Turn off Bluetooth when not in use:\u00a0Disabling Bluetooth when you're not actively using it reduces your exposure window and makes it harder for attackers to target your device.",
      "3. Use devices in low-risk areas:\u00a0Since these attacks require close proximity, avoid using Bluetooth audio devices in crowded or unfamiliar public places where someone nearby could exploit vulnerabilities.",
      "4. Pair devices with trusted sources only:\u00a0Avoid pairing your Bluetooth headphones with unfamiliar phones, computers or public terminals. Once paired, those devices can sometimes maintain a connection or reestablish one without your knowledge, increasing the risk of abuse if they're compromised.",

      "\"Unfortunately, a lot of credentials are harvested and sold on the dark web between different threat actor groups despite strong passwords or MFA barriers. Maybe someone lost their password or an administrator had theirs saved on a laptop that was part of another breach. Once those passwords are collected, they get traded or sold,\" Daniel explained.",
      "While brute-force attacks still happen, most criminals don't waste time hammering away at complex passwords. Instead, they exploit simpler routes: snatching passwords from old breaches, targeting users directly or hijacking password vaults, especially those managed by social media admins.",

      "Tobok points out, \"There really isn't public-facing software that notifies you. Sometimes, you might get an email saying, 'We noticed unusual activity. Was this you?' That typically comes through MFA channels. But most executives don't manage their own social media accounts. It's usually someone on their team or a designated admin.

      "Researchers at the China Building Materials Academy (CBMA) and their partners designed the material to weigh just 12.5 pounds per cubic foot. That's about one-tenth the weight of standard concrete. Its strength comes from a network of microscopic bubbles, each coated with a special maleated rosin.

      "Why traditional runway safety systems fall short",
      "The most dangerous parts of any flight are takeoff and landing. To reduce risk, airports use Runway End Safety Areas (RESAs). These zones are meant to stop planes that overshoot the runway. In the past, airports used sand, soil, grass, or water pools for this purpose. But each of these materials has serious drawbacks.",
      "Soil becomes unstable in wet or freezing conditions. Water can freeze in winter and attract wildlife, creating new hazards. Sand and grass don't always perform well, especially with heavier aircraft. These weaknesses have made it clear that airports need a more reliable and consistent safety solution.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "How marshmallow concrete works: The science behind the softness",
      "Marshmallow concrete is engineered with a precise strength between 0.30 and 0.35 megapascals. If it's too strong, it won't crush and absorb energy. If it's too weak, it won't slow the plane. The research team compared the process to blowing bubbles into a concrete mix. These bubbles create the soft, crushable texture that helps stop a plane during an emergency.",
      "To make the bubbles strong enough to last until impact, the team used a special air-entraining agent. This forms a tough coating around each bubble. As a result, the material stays intact until an aircraft overruns the runway, then it collapses at the right moment to maximize safety.",
      "An airliner coming in for a landing (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Durability and cost benefits of marshmallow concrete for airports",
      "Unlike some international systems that rely on expensive calcium sulfoaluminate cement, marshmallow concrete uses ordinary cement, making it far more affordable for airports, especially those with limited budgets. The team also developed a two-stage strength-control system that helps the material adapt to harsh climates and maintain consistent performance throughout the year.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Real-world data from 14 airports in China, including one in the challenging climate of Tibet, show that the material's properties fluctuated by just three percent over a year. This result is well below the design tolerance of ten percent, which means airports can depend on the material to perform reliably, regardless of the weather.",

      "Marshmallow concrete airport safety: The future standard?",
      "With its unique combination of low cost, environmental resilience, and life-saving performance, marshmallow concrete is poised to become the new global standard for runway safety. The material has already been installed at 14 Chinese airports, where it has demonstrated consistent and reliable performance even in extreme conditions. As more airports seek affordable ways to enhance safety, marshmallow concrete offers a promising solution that can save lives and reduce costs worldwide.",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you fly in the U.S., whether for business, vacation, or visiting family, marshmallow concrete could soon make your journeys safer. While this breakthrough is currently being used at airports in China, its performance is turning heads worldwide, including among U.S. aviation experts looking for better runway safety solutions.",
      "Runway overruns don\u2019t happen often in the United States, but when they do, the consequences can be deadly. Think of high-traffic airports like LAX, JFK, or Atlanta, where a single overrun can disrupt thousands of flights and put lives at risk.

      "Illustration of a woman holding a PillTrek near her mouth, about to swallow it. (Caltech)",
      "How this high-tech pill changes gut health monitoring",
      "PillTrek stands out because it combines miniature size with advanced technology. The capsule measures only 7 millimeters in diameter and 25 millimeters in length, making it smaller than most capsule endoscopes. Despite its tiny size, PillTrek contains a suite of sensors that can detect electrolytes, metabolites, glucose, hormones such as serotonin and dopamine, pH, ionic strength and temperature. The design allows doctors to swap out sensors based on the specific biomarkers they need to monitor, making PillTrek a flexible and powerful diagnostic tool.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The capsule transmits data wirelessly as it moves through the digestive system, providing real-time updates on a patient's gut health. Unlike endoscopy or CT scans, PillTrek does not require hospital visits or recovery time. Its low-power electronics enable it to operate for extended periods, delivering continuous monitoring that traditional methods cannot provide.",
      "Illustration showing how the PillTrek is about the same size as a quarter. (Caltech)",
      "Why real-time gut health monitoring is essential for overall wellness",
      "Scientists now understand that the gastrointestinal tract influences far more than just digestion. The gut plays a critical role in hormone production, immune function and even mental health. Monitoring gut biomarkers helps identify conditions such as metabolic syndrome, which increases the risk of heart disease and diabetes, as well as inflammation and hormonal imbalances. Traditional diagnostic methods like biopsies and fecal analysis are invasive, costly, and do not offer real-time results. PillTrek's wireless smart capsule for gut health monitoring changes this landscape by providing immediate, actionable data from inside the body.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Inside the science of the ingestible diagnostic capsule",
      "Caltech's team developed PillTrek by leveraging breakthroughs in sensor materials and electrochemical measurement techniques. The capsule's reconfigurable design means that doctors can adapt it to monitor new biomarkers as medical science advances. Researchers tested PillTrek in animal models, successfully measuring pH, temperature, glucose and serotonin levels in real time. The capsule's sensors are inexpensive and mass-producible, making this technology accessible for widespread clinical use.",
      "Illustration of the various PillTrek components. (Caltech)",
      "The future of ingestible diagnostics: What\u2019s next",
      "The Caltech team continues to refine PillTrek, aiming to make it even smaller and more energy efficient. Future versions may use wireless power transfer and next-generation electronics, extending the capsule's lifespan and expanding its medical applications. As technology advances, PillTrek could become a standard tool for diagnosing and managing chronic GI conditions.",
      "Concerns and considerations for swallowing a\u00a0smart capsule",
      "While PillTrek offers exciting possibilities for non-invasive, real-time gut health monitoring, it also raises important questions. Some patients and healthcare professionals may have concerns about the safety of ingesting electronic devices, even if they are small and designed for medical use. Potential issues include the risk of the capsule getting stuck, allergic reactions to materials, or unforeseen interactions with other medical conditions.",
      "Data privacy is another consideration. As PillTrek transmits sensitive health information wirelessly, robust security measures are essential to protect patient data from unauthorized access.",
      "Additionally, long-term studies are needed to fully understand any potential side effects or complications. As with any new medical technology, regulatory approval and thorough clinical testing will play a crucial role in ensuring PillTrek's safety and effectiveness for widespread use.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Breakthroughs like PillTrek signal a new era in non-invasive, real-time gut health monitoring. This wireless smart capsule for gut health monitoring offers doctors and patients an unprecedented look inside the digestive system, making diagnosis and treatment more precise and less invasive than ever before. The future of personalized medicine could soon be as simple as swallowing a pill.",

      "Airfields face a constant battle with wildlife. Birds, rabbits and even deer can wander onto runways, creating dangerous situations for aircraft and crews. Birds are the biggest threat. When sucked into engines or hitting windscreens, they can cause catastrophic damage. In fact, the threat is so serious that the U.S. Civil Air Administration once built a \"chicken gun\" to fire bird carcasses at planes to test their resilience.",

      "Enter the robot coyote. The ERDC, in partnership with wildlife biologists Stephen Hammond and Jacob Jung and the USDA National Wildlife Research Center (NWRC), has spent five years developing these unique machines. The idea is simple. Most animals instinctively avoid coyotes, so why not use that fear to keep them away from airfields?",
      "The first prototypes, Coyote Rovers, started as Boston Dynamics Spot robots. However, these proved too slow to scare off wildlife. The team switched to four-wheeled Traxxas X-Maxx motorized cars, which can reach speeds of 20 mph. Each vehicle carries a plastic coyote dummy, blending just the right amount of realism and intimidation, all for about $3,000 each.",

These early trials showed promise. The robot coyotes successfully deterred birds and other animals, helping to keep runways clear and safe.",
      "But the ERDC isn't stopping there. The goal is to make these robot coyotes even smarter.

      "\"When I woke up, I felt shattered and heartbroken,\" she said.",
      "But the dream, she said, helped her to let go.",
      "\"He tried to take everything from me: my friends, my safety, my identity, my future,\" she said. \"He took their lives, but I will continue trying to be like them, to make them proud.\"",
      "\"Speaking today is to help me find some sort of justice for them,\" Mortensen said.",
      "Throughout Mortensen's statement, Kohberger sat expressionless and listened intently. Hers was among several powerful victim impact statements at the packed sentencing hearing on Wednesday.",
      "As a friend of Funke tearfully read a victim impact statement on her behalf, victims' relatives and University of Idaho students cried in the courtroom gallery.",
      "In the statement, Funke said that she still speaks to the four victims in her prayers every night, and she will continue to live in their memory.",
      "\"I hated and still hate that they are gone, but for some reason, I am still here, and I got to live. I still think about this every day. Why me? Why did I get to live and not them? For the longest time, I could not even look at their families without feeling sick with guilt,\" Funke wrote.",
      "Funke mentioned what she loved about each of her friends: Kernodle was \"one in a million\"; Goncalves was \"so full of energy and life\"; Mogen was \"a ray of sunshine\"; and Chapin was \"so kind and easy to talk to.\" Chapin's and Kernodle's relationship showed that a \"storybook love and true romances really do exist.\"",
      "\"Who they were was so beautiful, and they deserve to be remembered in the highest way,\" Funke wrote in the statement read in court."

    "summary": "A federal judge in Florida ruled Wednesday that its \"hands are tied\" in releasing federal grand jury transcripts from 2005 and 2007 in connection with an investigation into Jeffrey Epstein.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 A federal judge in Florida ruled Wednesday that its \"hands are tied\" in releasing federal grand jury transcripts from 2005 and 2007 in connection with an investigation into Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "The ruling was separate from a request that the Justice Department has pending related to a grand jury in the Southern District of New York, where Epstein was ultimately indicted. Epstein died in 2019 while awaiting trial in New York. His accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell was convicted in 2021 and is now serving a 20-year sentence.",
      "In the Florida case, U.S. District Judge Robin Rosenberg said that, though the government believes special circumstances exist and the policy reasons for grand jury secrecy have expired, its rationale \"are no exceptions\" to grand jury secrecy.",
      "The New York Times was first to report on the ruling.",
      "The government, Rosenberg wrote, \"has effectively conceded that the Court's hands are tied\" because of a binding precedent by the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.",
      "The judge noted that two other appeals courts have allowed additional exceptions to releasing grand jury material. One is the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, whose jurisdiction includes New York City and where the administration has moved to unseal additional grand jury testimony relating to the Epstein and Maxwell investigations.",
      "Trump last week directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to \u201cproduce any and all pertinent Grand Jury testimony\u201d in the Epstein case.",
      "The directive came after fierce public backlash to an unsigned joint DOJ-FBI memo saying it had reviewed the case against Epstein and Maxwell and that no other people would be charged in connection with their trafficking of minors and that no additional material or evidence would be released.",
      "Trump's order also came hours after The Wall Street Journal reported that Trump sent a \u201cbawdy\u201d 50th birthday letter to Epstein in 2003. NBC News has not independently verified the documents, and Trump denied sending such a letter. Trump has filed a lawsuit against the newspaper\u2019s publisher, two of its reporters and News Corp. founder Rupert Murdoch over the story (the newspaper has said that it stands by its reporting.)",
      "Epstein\u2019s criminal case and 2019 death, which was ruled a suicide, has long been the subject of conspiracy theories. Trump and his allies during his presidential campaign were among those who spread or supported such theories.",
      "The documents in Florida related to the initial investigation into Epstein in Florida in 2005. The ruling said there had been two grand juries in the case \u2014 one in 2005 and the other in 2007.",
      "Epstein, whose social circle had included the likes of Trump, former President Bill Clinton and Prince Andrew, struck a much-scrutinized deal that allowed him to plead guilty to state solicitation charges involving a single underage victim, despite investigations into dozens of others. Federal prosecutors now say he \u201charmed over 1,000 victims.\u201d",
      "Rosenberg's ruling said the government essentially conceded she did not have the authority to release the transcripts, but her swift decision will allow the administration to ask the 11th Circuit to reconsider its earlier ruling on grand jury secrecy.",
      "The Justice Department said it was reviewing the ruling and declined further comment.",
      "The 2nd Circuit has held that judges have inherent authority to release grand jury materials in special or exceptional circumstances, and held that one of the factors they can consider is \"historical interest\" and the passage of time.",
      "There are two separate judges considering the government's requests in New York. One is in the case that had been brought against Epstein and the other is in the case that had been brought against Maxwell, who's appealing her conviction to the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "Those judges are moving more methodically than Rosenberg and it will be at least two weeks \u2014 if not several weeks longer \u2014 before they make any decisions on the request.",
      "The judges in New York asked for far more information in the case while they weigh the government's motion and have directed DOJ to provide them with them with grand jury materials under seal and with proposed redaction by next week.",
      "They've also asked Maxwell and Epstein\u2019s attorneys to provide a letter setting out their respective positions about the materials becoming public on or by August 5. The judges also said victims can submit letters sharing their positions with the judges by August 5 as well.",
      "After those submissions are filed, the judges may or may not hold hearings in their respective cases. They could also take the submissions and issue a ruling at some point.",
      "Maxwell's attorneys had asked to review the transcripts themselves prior to stating their position, a request that a New York federal judge rejected on Wednesday.",
      "\u201cThe Court will review these transcripts expeditiously. In the event the Court determines it would benefit from Maxwell\u2019s commentary as to a discrete aspect of these transcripts, the Court stands ready to make that excerpt, or a synopsis thereof, available to her counsel to facilitate counsel\u2019s briefing,\u201d U.S. District Judge Paul Engelmayer wrote."

      "A magistrate judge on Wednesday paused Kilmar Abrego Garcia's release from federal custody, shortly after a separate judge ruled that the man, who was mistakenly deported in March to El Salvador, should be released while he awaits trial on human smuggling charges.",
      "Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes in the Middle District of Tennessee ordered Abrego\u2019s release from federal custody paused for 30 days, or until further court order.",
      "\u201cAbrego shall therefore remain in the custody of the United States Marshal pending further order,\u201d she wrote.",
      "The pause, which was asked for by both parties, will allow the government the opportunity to appeal, and Abrego\u2019s legal team the chance to seek further relief.",
      "It followed back-to-back rulings from U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw in Nashville, Tennessee, and Judge Paula Xinis in Maryland that ordered Abrego's release and blocked his detention by immigration authorities in Tennessee.",
      "Crenshaw's order denied the Trump administration\u2019s motion to block Abrego\u2019s release, writing that the government \u201cfails to provide any evidence that there is something in Abrego\u2019s history, or his exhibited characteristics, that warrants detention.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe pieces of evidence the Government cites to, taken alone or together, warrant a finding that Abrego is, at best, a low risk of nonappearance,\u201d Crenshaw wrote. \u201cThe Court agrees with Abrego that the nature of the crimes he is accused of do not, on their own, fall within the categories of crimes Congress specifically enumerated as warranting a presumption of detention.\u201d",
      "Minutes after Crenshaw\u2019s order, Xinis issued an order blocking the government from taking Garcia into immigration custody in Tennessee.",
      "At recent hearings for Abrego's case, Xinis had expressed concern that Abrego would be immediately deported if released from federal custody.",
      "\"The Court shares Plaintiffs\u2019 ongoing concern that, absent meaningful safeguards, Defendants may once again remove Abrego Garcia from the United States without having restored him to the status quo ante and without due process,\" Xinis wrote in Wednesday's order.",
      "She also ruled the government must restore Abrego to ICE supervision in Baltimore and, if third-country removal proceedings are initiated, the government must provide Abrego and his counsel 72 \"business hours\" notice of the intended third country.",
      "Abrego\u2019s deportation has generated national headlines for months, amid the Trump administration\u2019s broader push to reshape immigration policy in the United States.",
      "The 29-year-old was deported to a notorious mega-prison in El Salvador in March, in what the government called an \"administrative error.\" His deportation was in direct violation of a judge\u2019s order in 2019 that was issued to prevent Abrego\u2019s deportation to El Salvador, where he was born and claimed to have been in danger of gang violence.",
      "Abrego was brought back to the United States last month after months of legal back-and-forth between his defense and the federal government.",
      "Upon his return, he was immediately charged with two federal felonies in Federal District Court in Nashville: conspiracy to unlawfully transport illegal aliens for financial gain and unlawful transportation of illegal aliens for financial gain.",
      "Abrego has pleaded not guilty to both charges.",
      "For months, the Trump administration has repeatedly accused Abrego of being a violent member of an international crime gang, MS-13, which Abrego\u2019s attorneys and family members have denied.",
      "Crenshaw was not convinced by the administration\u2019s assertion. \u201cBased on the record before it, for the Court to find that Abrego is member of or in affiliation with MS-13, it would have to make so many inferences from the Government\u2019s proffered evidence in its favor that such conclusion would border on fanciful.\u201d",
      "On Tuesday, Abrego\u2019s attorneys asked Crenshaw to order members of the Trump administration to stop commenting on the case.",
      "Abrego\u2019s attorneys pointed to a Nashville news conference held last week, where Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem referred to Abrego as a \"horrible human being.\"",
      "\"He has a lifetime history of trafficking individuals and of taking advantage of minors, soliciting pornography from them, nude photos of them, abusing his wife, abusing other illegals, aliens that were in this country, women that were under his care while he was trafficking them,\" Noem said. \"He's a horrible human being and a monster, and he should never be released free.\"",
      "On Wednesday, Crenshaw wrote that the Trump administration \"fails to show by a preponderance of the evidence \u2014 let alone clear and convincing evidence \u2014 that Abrego is such a danger to others or the community that he such concerns cannot be mitigated by conditions of release.\""

    "story": [
      "As Covid cases begin to rise this summer, many may be wondering: What are my risks, and is it time to get another vaccine?",
      "As of July 15, Covid cases were growing or likely growing in 27 states including Texas, Illinois, Kentucky, Virginia and Ohio, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "Rates of positive Covid tests have also been increasing in recent weeks, the CDC says, specifically in the southern region of the country.",
      "N.B.1.8.1 is the current dominant variant in the United States, accounting for 43% of all new Covid cases, according to the CDC. It\u2019s an offshoot of the XVD.1.5.1 strain, a descendant of the omicron variant. N.B.1.8.1 was responsible for a surge in hospitalizations in China earlier this year.",
      "It\u2019s been nicknamed \u201crazor blade throat,\u201d as there have been anecdotal reports of some people getting painful sore throats, said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee. Schaffner noted, however, that sore throats have been a common symptom of Covid since it first began spreading.",
      "\u201cI doubt the clinical spectrum of Covid has changed substantially,\u201d Schaffner said.",
      "Do I need a Covid booster? When will the new vaccines be available?",
      "The uptick in cases comes as many Americans have likely gone a year or longer without a Covid shot.",
      "In May, the Food and Drug Administration asked drugmakers to update their Covid vaccines to target the LP.8.1 strain, a descendent of JN.1, which began spreading widely in 2023 and is another offshoot of omicron. LP.8.1 currently accounts for 31% of all new cases, per the CDC.",
      "The new shots won\u2019t be available until the fall, and are expected to be approved only for adults 65 and up and kids and adults with at least one medical condition that puts them at risk of severe illness. Healthy kids and adults who want a shot may have to find an older version or pay out of pocket. A single dose can cost as much as $140.",
      "Experts say, however, that population immunity \u2014 whether from vaccination, prior infection or both \u2014 may shield much of the public for now.",
      "\u201cWhile we don\u2019t have a lot of high level of immunity in the population right now, because it\u2019s been so long, we may have enough low level immunity to just make it a little bit harder for that virus to transmit easily from person to person,\u201d said Andy Pekosz, an infectious disease researcher at Johns Hopkins University.",
      "Indeed, weekly hospitalization rates have remained low, suggesting that the new variant may not be leading to severe illness.",
      "The number of cases are still drastically lower than those this time last year, when the test positivity rate peaked in August at 17.9%. The 2025 season has yet to scrape 5%.",
      "Pekosz said it isn\u2019t unusual for cases to rise during the summer time, when people are likely to crowd indoors to escape the heat. However, he believes that if there is a summer surge of cases, it will be a small one.",
      "\u201cThe variants have been around for a while and haven\u2019t caused any major surges up until date,\u201d Pekosz said. \u201cSo again, I\u2019m hopeful that if we see a surge, it\u2019ll be a low level surge compared to previous years.\u201d",
      "Dr. Ofer Levy, director of the precision vaccines program at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital, who has advised the FDA, said people who are at high risk of severe illness still may want to consider getting a Covid shot, if they can find one.",

      "\u201cIf you\u2019re in a high risk group and you\u2019re in a state where cases are rising, you may want to just get the first available appointment and get a shot to protect yourself,\u201d he said.",
      "People at high risk can then consider getting an additional Covid shot when the updated vaccines are distributed in the fall, he said.",
      "Covid has two waves a year",
      "Schaffner, of Vanderbilt, said people in the high risk groups may also want to consider wearing a mask during indoor activities, such as the movies.",
      "Healthy adults and children may be able to wait longer before getting another shot, Levy added.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re in a lower risk group, that\u2019s where things get fuzzy,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean if you want a vaccine and your health care provider concurs and you can get it.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "In 2001, Rod Aissa was one of a handful of MTV executives having lunch with Sharon Osbourne at a restaurant in Santa Monica, California, to discuss a potential collaboration with her family. Osbourne apologized for arriving late, blamed it on her husband\u2019s antics and immediately launched into a dizzying play-by-play of her home\u2019s hijinks that had everyone laughing \u2014 hard.",
      "\u201cWe are over-the-top and crazy, and there\u2019s a lot of cursing and fighting and dogs everywhere,\u201d Aissa recalled her saying then, \u201cbut there\u2019s so much love in our family.\u201d",
      "That family, of course, also includes Ozzy Osbourne, the heavy metal legend and Black Sabbath front man who accidentally became a pioneer in reality television, thanks to the early aughts phenomenon \u201cThe Osbournes.\u201d With the news that Ozzy died Tuesday at 76, fans flooded social media with footage of the Prince of Darkness\u2019 theatrical performances, as well as clips of him chasing his elusive cat through his backyard and unapologetically marveling at the assembly of a Chipotle burrito.",
      "Before \u201cThe Osbournes\u201d premiered in 2002, Ozzy Osbourne was known for pioneering heavy metal and popularizing \u201cmany of its over-the-top stereotypes: overindulgence, a disregard for obeying rules, a kind of cartoonish, perpetual adolescence,\u201d said Craig Marks, music journalist and executive editor of HITS magazine. \u201cTo other hard-rock musicians especially, he was a force of nature, someone whose appetite for drugs was practically heroic.\u201d",
      "But it was the family around the rocker that piqued the interest of MTV executives, including Aissa, and led to the creation of a series that launched an entire television subgenre, while introducing him to a new generation who were too young to experience Black Sabbath\u2019s heyday. A standout 2000 episode of \u201cMTV Cribs\u201d \u2014 in which teens Jack and Kelly Osbourne give MTV a tour of their home \u2014 had offered a glimpse into the chaotic but charming dynamics. It also presented Ozzy\u2019s various paradoxes: originally from working-class Birmingham, England, and now moving into a brand-new Beverly Hills mansion; singing about death and the occult onstage and just trying to watch the History Channel at home.",
      "\u201cWe knew we had lightning in a bottle because this family, with their love and dysfunction, represented so many of us in the world,\u201d Aissa continued. \u201cAnd it was going to be something special because of Ozzy \u2014 his sense of humor and his lack of inhibition to say anything or behave a certain way. You could never script him or ask him to do anything twice, because that wasn\u2019t who he was. You couldn\u2019t even ask Ozzy to walk through a door twice because the camera wasn\u2019t ready. He\u2019d just say, \u2018F--- off!\u2019\u201d",
      "Countless hours of footage over three years captured the family\u2019s everyday rhythms \u2014 tending to their many pets, meeting with famous friends and butting heads with neighbors \u2014 as well as their more major moments, like Sharon\u2019s cancer diagnosis, Ozzy\u2019s near-fatal quad bike accident, and the kids\u2019 struggles with substances and newfound fame. It was all edited together like an American sitcom, complete with nostalgic graphics, upbeat needle drops and a crooner cover of Ozzy\u2019s hit \u201cCrazy Train\u201d as its theme song.",
      "\u201cI had to watch the first episode with Ozzy, and it was the longest 22 minutes of my life,\u201d Aissa said with a laugh. Afterward, \u201cOzzy didn\u2019t say a word or laugh or anything; I thought he hated it. He stood up and said to me, \u2018I love them so much. Do not f--- this up.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cHe didn\u2019t love it, but he loved being at home with the family, and [the show] gave them all a reason to be together and really connect,\u201d he added. \u201cAt that point in his career \u2014 platinum records everywhere, sold-out worldwide tours, a recording studio in his house \u2014 Ozzy didn\u2019t need this show, and he had no real interest in it. But as the episodes aired, and as people started talking to him about what a real family they are, he started really appreciating what it was they were doing.\u201d",
      "The show\u2019s March 2002 premiere was an instant hit. It became both MTV\u2019s highest-rated series to date and the most-watched show on any cable channel; its first season went on to win the Emmy Award for best reality program. And its cultural impact was global, given the network\u2019s indisputable cultural standing.",
      "\u201cMTV was still the be-all end-all for youth culture when \u2018The Osbournes\u2019 debuted,\u201d said Marks, who also co-wrote the book \u201cI Want My MTV: The Uncensored Story of the Music Video Revolution.\u201d \u201cSocial media didn\u2019t really exist yet \u2014 Myspace would launch in 2003 \u2014 and \u2018MTV Cribs,\u2019 arguably the network\u2019s first \u2018celebrity\u2019 reality show, started in 2000 and was a hit. But nothing compared to the cataclysm of \u2018The Osbournes.\u2019\u201d",
      "In those days, unscripted shows were just emerging, especially those featuring the rich and famous. But the early 2000s were also the height of magazine tabloids and celebrity obsession, said Colette Shade, author of the book \u201cY2K: How the 2000s Became Everything (Essays on the Future That Never Was).\u201d The Osbournes and their bumbling patriarch simply arrived at the right moment.",
      "\u201cPeople enjoyed the fact that it was this behind-the-curtain look, and that he came off in the show as just shuffling around befuddled by various aspects of modern life, in an endearing and silly way that\u2019s very different from his public persona,\u201d Shade said. \u201cOzzy was known in a certain way by boomers, but as the old guy from \u2018The Osbournes,\u2019 he was able to connect with a new audience of millennials without even trying.\u201d",
      "After the show\u2019s run, each family member became a standalone TV personality: Sharon as an author, reality competition judge and talk show host; Kelly as a commentator on E!\u2019s \u201cFashion Police\u201d; and Jack as a travel reporter and docuseries producer (including shows with Ozzy and Sharon).",
      "Though \u201cThe Osbournes\u201d only ran for four seasons over three years, its impact continues. The series cemented MTV as a hub for zeitgeisty unscripted programming, with \u201cPunk\u2019d,\u201d \u201cNewlyweds: Nick & Jessica\u201d and \u201cLaguna Beach\u201d premiering in the years that followed. Networks tried to capitalize on unexpected juxtaposition of the ordinary and the ostentatious, like Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie\u2019s labor-centric \u201cThe Simple Life\u201d and the Playboy Mansion-set \u201cThe Girls Next Door.\u201d",
      "Numerous copycat projects \u2014 starring Hulk Hogan, Gene Simmons, Terry Bradshaw, Joseph \u201cRev Run\u201d Simmons, Snoop Dogg, Sylvester Stallone, Alec Baldwin, the Kardashians and more \u2014 have since attempted to replicate Ozzy\u2019s singular \u201ccelebrity at home\u201d charisma.",
      "\u201cIt was an extremely successful show that was brand-new and relatively cheap to produce,\u201d Shade said. \u201cThey created this whole new publicity tool for celebrities to burnish their image and revive their careers, and it\u2019s become its own category of reality show that\u2019s kind of played out. People now see it as more of a construction than maybe they did at the time.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s because, back then, it really wasn\u2019t. Unlike today\u2019s unscripted titles \u2014 oftentimes with prespecified storylines, setup scenes, talking-head interviews and personal branding plans \u2014 \u201cThe Osbournes\u201d was built with little strategy and no real expectations. \u201cTo be honest, we didn\u2019t really know what we were doing yet, because no one had done it before,\u201d Aissa admitted with a laugh.",
      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t set out to make reality television; we just set out to make television,\u201d he continued. \u201cThey weren\u2019t trying to be reality stars. They were just being their authentic selves, interacting with each other as if they didn\u2019t see the cameras. It was as if they didn\u2019t care, and I think that was a big part of the magic.\u201d"

      "A magistrate judge on Wednesday paused Kilmar Abrego Garcia's release from federal custody, shortly after a separate judge ruled that the man, who was mistakenly deported in March to El Salvador, should be released while he awaits trial on human smuggling charges.",
      "Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes in the Middle District of Tennessee ordered Abrego\u2019s release from federal custody paused for 30 days, or until further court order.",
      "\u201cAbrego shall therefore remain in the custody of the United States Marshal pending further order,\u201d she wrote.",
      "The pause, which was asked for by both parties, will allow the government the opportunity to appeal, and Abrego\u2019s legal team the chance to seek further relief.",
      "It followed back-to-back rulings from U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw in Nashville, Tennessee, and Judge Paula Xinis in Maryland that ordered Abrego's release and blocked his detention by immigration authorities in Tennessee.",
      "Crenshaw's order denied the Trump administration\u2019s motion to block Abrego\u2019s release, writing that the government \u201cfails to provide any evidence that there is something in Abrego\u2019s history, or his exhibited characteristics, that warrants detention.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe pieces of evidence the Government cites to, taken alone or together, warrant a finding that Abrego is, at best, a low risk of nonappearance,\u201d Crenshaw wrote. \u201cThe Court agrees with Abrego that the nature of the crimes he is accused of do not, on their own, fall within the categories of crimes Congress specifically enumerated as warranting a presumption of detention.\u201d",
      "Minutes after Crenshaw\u2019s order, Xinis issued an order blocking the government from taking Garcia into immigration custody in Tennessee.",
      "At recent hearings for Abrego's case, Xinis had expressed concern that Abrego would be immediately deported if released from federal custody.",
      "\"The Court shares Plaintiffs\u2019 ongoing concern that, absent meaningful safeguards, Defendants may once again remove Abrego Garcia from the United States without having restored him to the status quo ante and without due process,\" Xinis wrote in Wednesday's order.",
      "She also ruled the government must restore Abrego to ICE supervision in Baltimore and, if third-country removal proceedings are initiated, the government must provide Abrego and his counsel 72 \"business hours\" notice of the intended third country.",
      "Abrego\u2019s deportation has generated national headlines for months, amid the Trump administration\u2019s broader push to reshape immigration policy in the United States.",
      "The 29-year-old was deported to a notorious mega-prison in El Salvador in March, in what the government called an \"administrative error.\" His deportation was in direct violation of a judge\u2019s order in 2019 that was issued to prevent Abrego\u2019s deportation to El Salvador, where he was born and claimed to have been in danger of gang violence.",
      "Abrego was brought back to the United States last month after months of legal back-and-forth between his defense and the federal government.",
      "Upon his return, he was immediately charged with two federal felonies in Federal District Court in Nashville: conspiracy to unlawfully transport illegal aliens for financial gain and unlawful transportation of illegal aliens for financial gain.",
      "Abrego has pleaded not guilty to both charges.",
      "For months, the Trump administration has repeatedly accused Abrego of being a violent member of an international crime gang, MS-13, which Abrego\u2019s attorneys and family members have denied.",
      "Crenshaw was not convinced by the administration\u2019s assertion. \u201cBased on the record before it, for the Court to find that Abrego is member of or in affiliation with MS-13, it would have to make so many inferences from the Government\u2019s proffered evidence in its favor that such conclusion would border on fanciful.\u201d",
      "On Tuesday, Abrego\u2019s attorneys asked Crenshaw to order members of the Trump administration to stop commenting on the case.",
      "Abrego\u2019s attorneys pointed to a Nashville news conference held last week, where Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem referred to Abrego as a \"horrible human being.\"",
      "\"He has a lifetime history of trafficking individuals and of taking advantage of minors, soliciting pornography from them, nude photos of them, abusing his wife, abusing other illegals, aliens that were in this country, women that were under his care while he was trafficking them,\" Noem said. \"He's a horrible human being and a monster, and he should never be released free.\"",
      "On Wednesday, Crenshaw wrote that the Trump administration \"fails to show by a preponderance of the evidence \u2014 let alone clear and convincing evidence \u2014 that Abrego is such a danger to others or the community that he such concerns cannot be mitigated by conditions of release.\""

    "story": [
      "Beef prices are coming in hot this summer.",
      "Steak and ground beef prices just hit record highs, according to June inflation data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which has tracked beef prices going back to 1984. Still, demand has stayed strong. Beef is the second most-consumed meat in the U.S., after all, and summer barbecue season is a particularly popular time.",
      "\u201cPeak demand time for beef typically happens around the Fourth of July,\u201d said Bernt Nelson, an agricultural economist at the American Farm Bureau Federation. \u201cThrough the second half of the year, demand kind of slows down seasonally for beef.\u201d That means prices could also come down a bit.",
      "But even after Americans put their grills away for the season, the U.S. beef industry will continue grappling with long-term supply issues.",
      "Cattle herds have been shrinking over the last few decades. They dropped another 1% from 2024 to 2025, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The number of beef cows that have calved is also down 1%, reaching a new record low. That means the current cattle herd is the nation\u2019s smallest since 1951, according to the Farm Bureau.",
      "Climate issues have exacerbated the shortage. Agricultural experts say drought over the last few years in the Plains and Upper Midwest has dried up the supply of grass for cattle. It has forced farmers to reduce their flocks, and the cattle count still hasn\u2019t recovered.",
      "\u201cThe drought conditions really placed a lot of stress on our farmers and their pastures that they rely on to help feed cattle,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cWhen this happened, they placed high numbers of females on feed for market rather than holding them back to replace the herd. And so that led us to this slow but steady contraction in the cattle herd.\u201d",
      "Import issues have also restricted the cattle supply. The U.S. government suspended cattle imports from Mexico in May due to the parasitic screwworm affecting cattle there.",
      "More challenges await. President Donald Trump\u2019s threatened 50% tariff on imports from Brazil, slated to start Aug. 1, could tighten supply even more. About 8% of U.S. beef is imported from places like Brazil, Argentina and Australia, said Michael Swanson, Wells Fargo\u2019s chief agricultural economist. With the looming tariffs, Brazilian meatpackers are rethinking exporting to the U.S., according to an industry lobby group.",
      "Ground beef is averaging $6.12 per pound, up 11.84% from a year ago, according to the BLS, meaning a 6-ounce hamburger patty could cost around 24 cents more now than last summer. Steak is averaging $11.49 a pound, up 8.05% from a year ago.",
      "All told, the Agriculture Department predicts beef and veal prices could rise 6.8% overall this year. It expects smaller price increases for pork and poultry.",
      "Companies, in turn, are flocking more to chicken, with fast-food chains like McDonald\u2019s, Wendy\u2019s and Chipotle all offering new chicken options. Tyson Foods, one of America\u2019s largest meat companies, has also recently launched new chicken items.",
      "\u201cWhen we\u2019ve got an environment that is challenging in beef and you\u2019ve got an environment where there\u2019s probably less availability of beef, it\u2019s helpful and certainly in the total complex to be able to manage that multi-protein, multichannel portfolio,\u201d Tyson Foods Chief Financial Officer Curt Calaway said in a May presentation.",
      "Walmart is shifting its beef strategy, opening its first-ever owned and operated case-ready beef facility last month. The retail and grocery giant says the new facility will help it increase capacity and improve its supply chain, cutting costs and helping consumers get high-quality beef at low prices.",
      "While cattle farmers are trying to rebuild their herds, the recovery for the beef industry may take years, agricultural experts said.",
      "\u201cIf I want to have more chickens, I just have to wait three to six months,\u201d Swanson said. \u201cIf I want to wait for more cattle, I gotta wait three to four years to get a lot more cattle.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 A federal judge in Florida ruled Wednesday that its \"hands are tied\" in releasing federal grand jury transcripts from 2005 and 2007 in connection with an investigation into Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "The ruling was separate from a request that the Justice Department has pending related to a grand jury in the Southern District of New York, where Epstein was ultimately indicted. Epstein died in 2019 while awaiting trial in New York. His accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell was convicted in 2021 and is now serving a 20-year sentence.",
      "In the Florida case, U.S. District Judge Robin Rosenberg said that, though the government believes special circumstances exist and the policy reasons for grand jury secrecy have expired, its rationale \"are no exceptions\" to grand jury secrecy.",
      "The New York Times was first to report on the ruling.",
      "The government, Rosenberg wrote, \"has effectively conceded that the Court's hands are tied\" because of a binding precedent by the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.",
      "The judge noted that two other appeals courts have allowed additional exceptions to releasing grand jury material. One is the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, whose jurisdiction includes New York City and where the administration has moved to unseal additional grand jury testimony relating to the Epstein and Maxwell investigations.",
      "Trump last week directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to \u201cproduce any and all pertinent Grand Jury testimony\u201d in the Epstein case.",
      "The directive came after fierce public backlash to an unsigned joint DOJ-FBI memo saying it had reviewed the case against Epstein and Maxwell and that no other people would be charged in connection with their trafficking of minors and that no additional material or evidence would be released.",
      "Trump's order also came hours after The Wall Street Journal reported that Trump sent a \u201cbawdy\u201d 50th birthday letter to Epstein in 2003. NBC News has not independently verified the documents, and Trump denied sending such a letter. Trump has filed a lawsuit against the newspaper\u2019s publisher, two of its reporters and News Corp. founder Rupert Murdoch over the story (the newspaper has said that it stands by its reporting.)",
      "Epstein\u2019s criminal case and 2019 death, which was ruled a suicide, has long been the subject of conspiracy theories. Trump and his allies during his presidential campaign were among those who spread or supported such theories.",
      "The documents in Florida related to the initial investigation into Epstein in Florida in 2005. The ruling said there had been two grand juries in the case \u2014 one in 2005 and the other in 2007.",
      "Epstein, whose social circle had included the likes of Trump, former President Bill Clinton and Prince Andrew, struck a much-scrutinized deal that allowed him to plead guilty to state solicitation charges involving a single underage victim, despite investigations into dozens of others. Federal prosecutors now say he \u201charmed over 1,000 victims.\u201d",
      "Rosenberg's ruling said the government essentially conceded she did not have the authority to release the transcripts, but her swift decision will allow the administration to ask the 11th Circuit to reconsider its earlier ruling on grand jury secrecy.",
      "The Justice Department said it was reviewing the ruling and declined further comment.",
      "The 2nd Circuit has held that judges have inherent authority to release grand jury materials in special or exceptional circumstances, and held that one of the factors they can consider is \"historical interest\" and the passage of time.",
      "There are two separate judges considering the government's requests in New York. One is in the case that had been brought against Epstein and the other is in the case that had been brought against Maxwell, who's appealing her conviction to the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "Those judges are moving more methodically than Rosenberg and it will be at least two weeks \u2014 if not several weeks longer \u2014 before they make any decisions on the request.",
      "The judges in New York asked for far more information in the case while they weigh the government's motion and have directed DOJ to provide them with them with grand jury materials under seal and with proposed redaction by next week.",
      "They've also asked Maxwell and Epstein\u2019s attorneys to provide a letter setting out their respective positions about the materials becoming public on or by August 5. The judges also said victims can submit letters sharing their positions with the judges by August 5 as well.",
      "After those submissions are filed, the judges may or may not hold hearings in their respective cases. They could also take the submissions and issue a ruling at some point.",
      "Maxwell's attorneys had asked to review the transcripts themselves prior to stating their position, a request that a New York federal judge rejected on Wednesday.",
      "\u201cThe Court will review these transcripts expeditiously. In the event the Court determines it would benefit from Maxwell\u2019s commentary as to a discrete aspect of these transcripts, the Court stands ready to make that excerpt, or a synopsis thereof, available to her counsel to facilitate counsel\u2019s briefing,\u201d U.S. District Judge Paul Engelmayer wrote."

I look forward to announcing my future plans later this year.\u201d",
      "The Detroit News reported that Huizenga and Trump spoke last week. Trump has not yet endorsed a candidate in the Michigan Senate race, although he is expected to back former GOP Rep. Mike Rogers soon, according to two GOP sources.",
      "Huizenga's decision likely clears the Republican primary field for Rogers, who has already racked up endorsements from Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., and National Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman Tim Scott, R-S.C. Rogers lost a close Senate race last year to Democrat Elissa Slotkin as Trump won Michigan by 1 percentage point.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m grateful for all the unwavering support and successes so far. Our team is continuing to charge full steam ahead to win this seat and put Michigan First,\u201d Rogers said in a statement following Huizenga's announcement.",

Leader Thune and Chairman Scott supported Mike Rogers from the beginning and now is the time to unite and let Democrats fight over their First Place Loser.\u201d",

      "As Covid cases begin to rise this summer, many may be wondering: What are my risks, and is it time to get another vaccine?",
      "As of July 15, Covid cases were growing or likely growing in 27 states including Texas, Illinois, Kentucky, Virginia and Ohio, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "Rates of positive Covid tests have also been increasing in recent weeks, the CDC says, specifically in the southern region of the country.",
      "N.B.1.8.1 is the current dominant variant in the United States, accounting for 43% of all new Covid cases, according to the CDC. It\u2019s an offshoot of the XVD.1.5.1 strain, a descendant of the omicron variant. N.B.1.8.1 was responsible for a surge in hospitalizations in China earlier this year.",
      "It\u2019s been nicknamed \u201crazor blade throat,\u201d as there have been anecdotal reports of some people getting painful sore throats, said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee. Schaffner noted, however, that sore throats have been a common symptom of Covid since it first began spreading.",
      "\u201cI doubt the clinical spectrum of Covid has changed substantially,\u201d Schaffner said.",
      "Do I need a Covid booster? When will the new vaccines be available?",
      "The uptick in cases comes as many Americans have likely gone a year or longer without a Covid shot.",
      "In May, the Food and Drug Administration asked drugmakers to update their Covid vaccines to target the LP.8.1 strain, a descendent of JN.1, which began spreading widely in 2023 and is another offshoot of omicron. LP.8.1 currently accounts for 31% of all new cases, per the CDC.",
      "The new shots won\u2019t be available until the fall, and are expected to be approved only for adults 65 and up and kids and adults with at least one medical condition that puts them at risk of severe illness. Healthy kids and adults who want a shot may have to find an older version or pay out of pocket. A single dose can cost as much as $140.",
      "Experts say, however, that population immunity \u2014 whether from vaccination, prior infection or both \u2014 may shield much of the public for now.",
      "\u201cWhile we don\u2019t have a lot of high level of immunity in the population right now, because it\u2019s been so long, we may have enough low level immunity to just make it a little bit harder for that virus to transmit easily from person to person,\u201d said Andy Pekosz, an infectious disease researcher at Johns Hopkins University.",
      "Indeed, weekly hospitalization rates have remained low, suggesting that the new variant may not be leading to severe illness.",
      "The number of cases are still drastically lower than those this time last year, when the test positivity rate peaked in August at 17.9%. The 2025 season has yet to scrape 5%.",
      "Pekosz said it isn\u2019t unusual for cases to rise during the summer time, when people are likely to crowd indoors to escape the heat. However, he believes that if there is a summer surge of cases, it will be a small one.",
      "\u201cThe variants have been around for a while and haven\u2019t caused any major surges up until date,\u201d Pekosz said. \u201cSo again, I\u2019m hopeful that if we see a surge, it\u2019ll be a low level surge compared to previous years.\u201d",
      "Dr. Ofer Levy, director of the precision vaccines program at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital, who has advised the FDA, said people who are at high risk of severe illness still may want to consider getting a Covid shot, if they can find one.",

      "\u201cIf you\u2019re in a high risk group and you\u2019re in a state where cases are rising, you may want to just get the first available appointment and get a shot to protect yourself,\u201d he said.",
      "People at high risk can then consider getting an additional Covid shot when the updated vaccines are distributed in the fall, he said.",
      "Covid has two waves a year",
      "Schaffner, of Vanderbilt, said people in the high risk groups may also want to consider wearing a mask during indoor activities, such as the movies.",
      "Healthy adults and children may be able to wait longer before getting another shot, Levy added.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re in a lower risk group, that\u2019s where things get fuzzy,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean if you want a vaccine and your health care provider concurs and you can get it.\u201d",
      "Dr. Michael Phillips, an infectious disease doctor at NYU Langone, said that he sees mostly immunocompromised and older adults test positive for the virus. For those who haven\u2019t gotten a Covid shot in years, Phillips said he doesn\u2019t think they should worry just yet.",

    "published": "Wed, 23 Jul 2025 17:11:40 GMT",
    "summary": "Rep. Greg Casar wants to ban \"surveillance pricing,\" where companies use search history and other personal data to charge individualized prices.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014\u00a0From raising the price of diapers for parents who recently searched for them online, to stores excluding regular customers from discounts because they are likely to buy the product anyway, companies are using personal data to set different price points for different people.",
      "The practice, known as \u201csurveillance pricing,\" has caught the attention of Rep. Greg Casar, D-Texas, who wants to ban it at the federal level.",
      "Personal data collection has become commonplace in the internet age, with major corporations farming information to tailor marketing and sales pitches specifically to individual consumers. But companies are now using location data, browsing history and demographic background to individualize prices.",
      "Casar believes this practice, which is often done using artificial intelligence, could stack the deck against consumers, leading to higher, uneven prices. The lawmaker, who leads the Congressional Progressive Caucus, told NBC News he wants to ensure that prices are set \u201cbased on supply and demand and based on how much it costs to make and sell a thing, not based on spying on you and using your private data.\u201d",
      "The Stop AI Price Gouging and Wage Fixing Act of 2025, which Casar will introduce Wednesday, would prohibit the use of surveillance-based price and wage setting. The bill comes on the heels of a study by the Federal Trade Commission and as some states seek to ban surveillance pricing as well.",
      "Casar said there needs to be more transparency around the use of consumers\u2019 data and artificial intelligence. His bill would also prevent the use of AI to set wages based on personal data, like an individual's financial history, rather than performance.",
      "\u201cAI is a developing part of our lives, part of our world, but we need to make sure that it\u2019s used for good and not being exploited,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re already starting to see that, and if we don\u2019t intervene now and ban these sorts of price gouging and wage suppression right now, then I think it\u2019s just going to spread all over the economy.\u201d",
      "Casar\u2019s legislation comes after the FTC released the initial findings of its study of surveillance pricing in January. That report, released just before President Joe Biden left office, found that a \u201cperson\u2019s precise location or browser history can be frequently used to target individual consumers with different prices for the same goods and services.\u201d",
      "The FTC's findings are based on information it requested from eight companies that use consumer data when pricing products: Mastercard, Revionics, Bloomreach, JPMorgan Chase, Task Software, PROS, Accenture and McKinsey & Co.",
      "Lina Khan, who chaired the FTC under Biden, oversaw the study. It is unclear what the future of the FTC's role will be on this issue under the Trump administration, as the agency's call for public input on surveillance pricing was stopped when new leadership came in.",
      "\u201cOne of the most pernicious aspects of surveillance pricing is that people may have absolutely no idea that they\u2019re being targeted by it,\u201d Khan said in an interview with NBC News. \u201cIt\u2019s a total black box.\u201d",
      "Khan said the technology is rapidly evolving, making it easier for companies to forecast how much a consumer is able or willing to pay without them knowing. Khan described surveillance pricing as the \u201choly grail\u201d for companies looking to maximize profits in e-commerce.",
      "\u201cWe have quickly slipped into an environment where companies now increasingly have the ability to do this based on just the enormous troves of personal data that are being collected about us, they have the incentive to do it,\" Khan said, adding that \u201cunless law enforcers and lawmakers are very clear about these practices being prohibited, companies will think it\u2019s totally fair game.\u201d",
      "Casar noted that Delta Air Lines is one company that is integrating AI into its pricing. On an investor call this month, Delta president Glen Hauenstein said the airline's goal is to have a fifth of all its fares set by an artificial intelligence program, up from 3% currently. But the company disputed in a statement that prices would be set based on personal information.",
      "\u201cThere is no fare product Delta has ever used, is testing, or plans to use that targets customers with individualized offers based on personal information or otherwise,\u201d the company said. \u201cDelta always complies with regulations around pricing and disclosures.\u201d",
      "While Casar\u2019s legislation is the first at the national level, several state legislatures have attempted to take on the issue. For example, the New York Legislature passed and the governor signed legislation to require companies to disclose to consumers when a price is set by an algorithm using their data.",
      "Earlier this month, the National Retail Federation asked a federal court to block the New York law arguing that it would \u201cunfairly malign a system that helps merchants give customers lower prices and personalized offers.\u201d",
      "The California Assembly, meanwhile, passed a bill in May to stop businesses from using personal data when charging different prices for the same product. That legislation now heads to the California Senate.",
      "At the federal level, the House of Representatives is leaving for its August recess this week, so no action can be taken on Casar\u2019s bill until September at the earliest. The congressman said he hopes to \u201cbuild a broad coalition of members of Congress against this, because I think this is the kind of issue that energizes people all across the country.\u201d",
      "Casar sees a surveillance price ban as an issue that could attract bipartisan support. \u201cI think that\u2019s the kind of thing that pisses off Democratic and Republican and independent voters alike,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be a progressive Democrat to say these gigantic corporations in the tech world should not be spying on us and then using what they learn to put it into AI and make our life more expensive.\u201d"

      "Mortensen, who sat at the prosecution table as she emotionally spoke, did not identify Kohberger, who sat at the defense table wearing an orange jail jumpsuit and flanked by his lawyers. A second roommate, Bethany Funke, was not in court but had a written statement shared by a friend.",
      "\"What happened that night changed everything. Because of him, four beautiful, genuine, compassionate people were taken from this world for no reason,\" Mortensen said, her voice breaking repeatedly as she spoke. \"He didn't just take their lives. He took the light they carried into every room. He took away how they made everyone feel safe, loved, and full of joy.\"",
      "\"What he did shattered me in places I didn't know could break,\" Mortensen said. \"I was barely 19 when he did this.\"",
      "Kohberger, 30, was facing trial next month, but changed his plea to guilty to four counts of first-degree murder and burglary in a winding case that has left unanswered questions, including why he targeted the victims, whom he had no apparent connection with.",
      "Kohberger, a former Ph.D. student in criminology, also waived his right to appeal in exchange for prosecutors agreeing not to seek a death sentence.",
      "In her statement, Mortensen said the night of the murders changed her life, and she suffers from panic attacks, hypervigilance, exhaustion, scans rooms when she enters and flinches at sudden sounds.",
      "Still, Mortensen said, Kohberger \"may have shattered parts of me, but I'm still putting myself back together piece by piece.\"",
      "She said she had a dream a year ago in which she had to say goodbye to her friends.",
      "\"They all kept asking, 'Why?'\" she said. \"And all I could say was 'I can't tell you, but I have to.'\"",
      "\"When I woke up, I felt shattered and heartbroken,\" she said.",
      "But the dream, she said, helped her to let go.",
      "\"He tried to take everything from me: my friends, my safety, my identity, my future,\" she said. \"He took their lives, but I will continue trying to be like them, to make them proud.\"",
      "\"Speaking today is to help me find some sort of justice for them,\" Mortensen said.",
      "Throughout Mortensen's statement, Kohberger sat expressionless and listened intently. Hers was among several powerful victim impact statements at the packed sentencing hearing on Wednesday.",
      "As a friend of Funke tearfully read a victim impact statement on her behalf, victims' relatives and University of Idaho students cried in the courtroom gallery.",
      "In the statement, Funke said that she still speaks to the four victims in her prayers every night, and she will continue to live in their memory.",
      "\"I hated and still hate that they are gone, but for some reason, I am still here, and I got to live. I still think about this every day. Why me? Why did I get to live and not them? For the longest time, I could not even look at their families without feeling sick with guilt,\" Funke wrote.",
      "Funke mentioned what she loved about each of her friends: Kernodle was \"one in a million\"; Goncalves was \"so full of energy and life\"; Mogen was \"a ray of sunshine\"; and Chapin was \"so kind and easy to talk to.\" Chapin's and Kernodle's relationship showed that a \"storybook love and true romances really do exist.\"",

      "The post is a window into how the White House has approached its overall social media strategy during Trump\u2019s second term. Previously, official White House social media accounts were used largely to promote presidents\u2019 policies.",
      "Since January, however, the Trump administration has shifted its tone on social media to cater to its MAGA base. Many posts \u2014 several of which play off of trending memes \u2014 appear to showcase aggression toward some longtime political targets for Trump, such as immigrants and Democrats.",

      "But several official White House posts highlight or pull language from Trump\u2019s personal account on his platform, Truth Social, where he frequently blasts his political opponents or shares images that appear to have been made with artificial intelligence tools. White House accounts have also shared AI-generated images of Trump as the pope, a \u201cStar Wars\u201d character and Superman.",
      "Joshua Tucker, a co-director of New York University's Center for Social Media and Politics, said such posts are designed to \u201cget people\u2019s attention.\u201d",
      "Social media has drastically changed since Trump\u2019s first term \u2014 when users would mainly see posts from accounts they followed. Now, many social media platforms use an individualized algorithm for each account that Tucker said \u201cprivileges things that pop and that go viral.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not quite in the world where it\u2019s just like, \u2018If I just tweet, all my followers are going to see what I tweet,\u2019\u201d Tucker said. \u201cIt\u2019s \u2018I need to come up with something that\u2019s going to be catchy.\u2019\u201d",
      "Among the potential cons of the strategy, Tucker said, is the White House\u2019s \u201cpushing back against norms of what is proprietary in terms of official statements.\u201d",
      "Asked about the administration\u2019s use of social media during Trump\u2019s second term, White House spokesperson Liz Huston said, \u201cEvery day, the White House digital accounts highlight President Trump\u2019s widely popular America First agenda and the tangible quality-of-life improvements he has delivered for Americans nationwide.\u201d",
      "Other official government accounts for various agencies have taken on similar tones.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security\u2019s official account has promoted self-deportation through the CBP One app by posting a video set to the song \u201cTake Me Home, Country Roads.\u201d The song \u201cIce, Ice Baby\u201d is the soundtrack for another video pointing viewers to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement tip line.",
      "In June, DHS also posted what appeared to be an AI-made image of alligators with caps that read \u201cICE\u201d on them, writing in the post, \u201cComing soon!\u201d It came amid the opening of a controversial immigrant detention center in Florida, which state Republicans have informally dubbed \u201cAlligator Alcatraz.\u201d",
      "Asked whether she is concerned about the content\u2019s being divisive or making light of issues the administration wants people to take seriously, DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said: \u201cNot at all.\u201d",
      "McLaughlin said she sees the role of the DHS social media accounts as giving people \u201cthe truth\u201d and circumventing media outlets she deems hostile.",
      "\u201cEight years ago, under the first Trump administration, we didn\u2019t have the social media environment that we have today, and so I think that we were more beholden to what the media was saying, and we couldn\u2019t necessarily straighten out the facts,\u201d McLaughlin said. \u201cAnd now, you know, we have a presence that we\u2019re able to do that.\u201d",
      "Parker Butler, who ran the @KamalaHQ accounts as the director of digital rapid response for the Biden-turned-Harris 2024 presidential campaign, described what the White House is doing online as \u201ctrolling for the sake of trolling.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey are just basically throwing toxic sludge out there and trying to gin up people\u2019s reactions,\u201d Butler said. \u201cAnd they call that a digital strategy.\u201d",
      "They are just basically throwing toxic sludge out there and trying to gin up people\u2019s reactions.",
      "Parker Butler, who ran the @KamalaHQ accounts for the Biden-turned-Harris 2024 presidential campaign",
      "It\u2019s a perspective that has been echoed by others who follow politics and have also noticed the shift.",
      "\u201cLike a runaway train, the Republican Party is barreling toward a future in which posting is politics \u2014 or, the purest function of politics,\u201d writer Nathan Taylor Pemberton argued in a recent op-ed for The New York Times titled \u201cTrolling Democracy.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a grim, ugly and barren place.\u201d",
      "But the White House points to growth on multiple digital platforms as evidence its strategy is effective. A White House official said the administration\u2019s official social media accounts, including on Truth Social, have added over 16 million new followers across platforms since Inauguration Day.",
      "The administration also has engaged social media stars to try to generate a broader audience. In May, Trump gave comedian Theo Von \u2014 one of YouTube\u2019s most popular creators, particularly among young male conservatives \u2014 the role of warmup act at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, where Trump addressed U.S. service members.",
      "The White House\u2019s Instagram and X accounts have also taken a page out of the typical influencer\u2019s engagement playbook, with press secretary Karoline Leavitt uploading a weekly video segment called \u201cMAGA Minute.\u201d The videos post recaps \u2014 in 60 seconds \u2014 of things the president and the administration did that week that the White House wants to highlight.",
      "In May, Leavitt also held several separate \u201cinfluencer briefings.\u201d Of the 25 influencers identified by NBC News who attended the initial three briefings, all but one had histories of explicit support for Trump\u2019s administration, and some had direct connections to Trump.",
      "\u201cWe will ALWAYS find ways to meet people where they are,\u201d Kaelan Dorr, the White House deputy communications director, said in a statement at the time."

    "summary": "25 years ago, writer Liz Calvario's family attended the Backstreet Boys Millennium concert. In a full circle moment, they went to the anniversary show and celebrated the loss of her mother.",
    "story": [
      "25 YEARS AGO, my family created a lifelong connection with the Backstreet Boys. It might sound...unique for not just two fangirls, but also their parents, to be devoted to a boyband. But for our foursome, BSB has been the soundtrack to a shared life of love...and unexpected loss.",
      "The connection reached a full-circle moment this year when the group announced on TODAY their \u201cInto the Millennium\u201d Sphere residency in Las Vegas. It was a celebration of the 25-year anniversary of their hit album \u2014 but for my family, it was a reminder of a time that changed everything for us.",
      "It all began when I was about eight years old and my sister Leslie and I walked into Lucky\u2019s grocery store. She ran straight to the magazine section; four years older than me, she had recently discovered the Backstreet Boys and wanted to show me her favorite member, Nick Carter.",
      "Grabbing one of the bright teen magazines, my eyes went instead to dark-haired, green-eyed Kevin Richardson. From there, while my mom grocery shopped, our ritual became standing in that aisle, flipping the pages to every Backstreet Boys photo we could find.",
      "Our infatuation only grew as the years went by. We consumed every bit of information about all five \u201cboys,\u201d belted their songs on the radio and religiously watched \u201cTotal Request Live\u201d with Carson Daly on MTV. (My cheeks turned hot as I watched the rain scene in \u201cQuit Playing Games With My Heart.\u201d)",
      "Knowing how much we loved them, my mom often gave in to purchasing the BSB merch we saw at the mall and stores. When we begged to call \u201cTRL\u201d countless times, she always indulged us. And when we were in the car yelling every single lyric to every single song? She was right there singing along with us.",
      "By 1999, BSB was embarking on their \u201cInto the Millennium Tour,\u201d to accompany their sophomore album, \u201cMillennium.\u201d Desperate to see them in concert, Leslie and I begged our parents to let us go. By this time, our bedroom was covered in floor-to-ceiling posters; while my dad huffed about our decor choices, my mom never seemed to mind, often buying us more magazines to help us add to our collection.",
      "Finally, my dad gave in after endless pestering: \u201cIf you can save up the money to buy your own ticket, you can go.\u201d",
      "For months, my sister and I put aside the money we got from our birthdays and report cards, and we did chores around the house. I pocketed any spare change we found, including the coins by my dad's wallet. (To me, it was fair game!) When it was time to purchase tickets, we proudly stood in front of my dad with our savings: A grand total of around $100.",
      "Back in those days, we had to go to a JCPenney Ticketmaster concierge to purchase tickets. So we headed to the mall, plopped down our money and asked for two tickets to the Backstreet Boys show in Anaheim, California, the closest venue to our San Diego county town of Ramona.",
      "But then our dad chimed in saying he wanted four tickets. Perplexed, my sister and I looked at each other and told him we didn\u2019t have enough for two more.",
      "He looked at us. \u201cYou proved that you can save money for something you really want, and you did,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a treat, I will pay for your tickets, and your mom and I will also go.\u201d",
      "On Oct. 15, 1999, I attended my first Backstreet Boys concert (and first-ever concert) at the then-Arrowhead Pond of Anaheim (now the Honda Center). Our seats were high up, but I remember my dad borrowing a friend's camcorder to record the entire show. Sitting next to us, he zoomed in on the stage as my sister and I fangirled. The moment the band opened the show and flew in on futuristic surfboards, we couldn't contain our screams.",
      "My mom, dad, sister and I belted out the songs we all knew from repeatedly playing their albums. And when \u201cThe Perfect Fan\u201d \u2014 the group's ode to a mother's love \u2014 came on, we dedicated it to my mom.",
      "I saved my ticket from that show, which I still have to this day. My sister and I would rewatch the recording of the concert with my mom on the VCR until it stopped working. As a Mexican household, we also loved the group's songs in Spanish, like \u201cNunca Te Hare Llorar,\u201d as well as \u201cAnywhere For You,\u201d or \u201cDonde Quieras Yo Ir\u00e9.\u201d And it was known that my dad\u2019s favorite song was \u201cI\u2019ll Never Break Your Heart.\u201d But every single birthday and Mother's Day, for my mom, we'd always play \u201cThe Perfect Fan.\u201d",
      "And then, on May 14, 2015, she died unexpectedly in a car crash.",
      "The last day my sister and I saw our mom was on Mother\u2019s Day. We had played \u201cThe Perfect Fan\u201d for her that morning. Yet somehow, inexplicably, four days later we were grieving her.",
      "The Backstreet Boys' song \u201cShow Me the Meaning of Being Lonely,\u201d suddenly took on a new significance for me and my sister. The song is about losing someone close to you; at the time it was released, Kevin Richardson was mourning the death of his father, while Howie Dorough had a sister who had also passed. Additionally, the music video was dedicated to their late producer, Denniz Pop.",
      "Still, I never imagined I'd one day listen to the song while mourning myself.",
      "Fast forward to this summer, which marked 25 years since that first \u201cMillennium\u201d concert \u2014 and 10 years after my mom died. My sister, Dad and I decided we had to attend the anniversary show in Las Vegas; it would be a way to relive an important memory while also commemorating my mom. Plus, one thing my sister and I have learned is that time is sacred \u2014 and we won't always have our dad around to make memories with.",
      "A day before the July 11 opening night concert in Las Vegas, an ache settled in my chest as I thought about my mom not being able to experience this moment with us. I know she would have been so excited to dress up, and to sing every song while spending time with us. I can even picture her once again wearing the Backstreet Boys scarf we bought at the first concert around her ponytail like she once did, much to my delight.",
      "Ahead of their anniversary shows this summer, the Backstreet Boys asked their attendees to wear white. I didn't know if my dad would abide by the suggested dress code \u2014 but to my surprise, when we met up for the show, there he was in a white button-up and steel blue pants.",
      "The group opened the show with their hit \u201cLarger Than Life,\u201d a song my dad instantly knew. We laughed as he jammed out while recording the entire thing on his phone.",
      "As the show continued, we were all hyped up and tuned in to the graphics and visuals. But when photos appeared on the screen of the Backstreet Boys with their mothers, wives and kids, we knew what song was coming: \u201cThe Perfect Fan.\u201d",
      "As the piano played, Kevin took the mic for the first verse. But then, eyes closed, he lifted the mic to his mouth \u2014 then shook his head, unable to sing. We assumed he was overcome with grief and sadness as he remembered his own late mother Ann, who died in 2022.",
      "Tears rolled down my face. I looked over at my sister, and she was also crying. My dad's face was somber; even though my parents weren't in the best place when my mom died, I knew he must have been hurting, too. I even swore I could see him mouthing some of the lyrics.",
      "After that track, all I wanted was to embrace the three of us being together, feeling the power of this shared experience. I captured video of my dad recording \u201cEverybody\u201d and \u201cI Want It That Way\u201d as he proudly sang along to the chorus.",
      "Being the mega BSB fans that we are, my sister and I attended the show for a second time the following weekend.",
      "Once again, when \u201cThe Perfect Fan\u201d came on, my sister became emotional. This time, I put my arm around her. And just like Kevin now found himself able to sing the intro of the song without tearing up, I also managed to keep it together. I thought about how happy my mom would be that we still think of her \u2014 and the memories we shared at our first concert \u2014 whenever that song plays.",
      "And when we sent a selfie to my dad from the concert, he replied in Spanish, \u201cWhat are you doing there without me?\u201d",
      "Looks like we might have to make this a new family tradition."

      "According to legend, a celebrity death accompanies the birth of each of Paytas\u2019s three babies. Even though it doesn\u2019t add up \u2014 in a lot of ways \u2014 the theory persists, and memes abound suggesting that the recently departed musician will be reincarnated as the child of the podcaster who gained fame through viral YouTube videos.",
      "(For the record, TODAY.com does not endorse this theory, which is clearly meant to be tongue-in-cheek.)",
      "What? How? Why?",
      "The theory is part of an internet meme known as the \u201cTrisha Paytas Baby Curse,\u201d which links her pregnancies to the deaths, or illness, of public figures. While entirely speculative, the joke popped up when Pope Francis died while she was pregnant with her third child, who she named Aquaman.",

      "She had a cameo on Saturday Night Live in December 2024, and made her Broadway debut in February of 2025 \u2014 and event that started out as a joke, but then became reality.",
      "The Trisha Paytas Baby Curse, Explained",
      "The Trisha Paytas baby curse theory first took hold on Sept. 7, 2022. At the time, Paytas was pregnant with her first child and announced on X that she was 1 centimeter dilated. The update coincided with news of Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s declining health and the monarch\u2019s death one day later on Sept. 8, 2022.",
      "\u201cAnd Trisha Paytas is 1 cm dilated\u2026 the prophecy is being fulfilled,\u201d one person wrote of the timing.",

      "Not long after Paytas announced that she was expecting her second child, King Charles III publicly revealed his cancer diagnosis. Fans quickly began to suggest that the monarch\u2019s fate might be entangled with Paytas\u2019 pregnancy.",
      "Since his announcement in 2024, Charles has continued to undergo medical treatment for an undisclosed form of cancer. While the king is very much alive, and not reincarnated in the form of Paytas\u2019 child, the conspiracy theory continued to grow.",
      "The beloved pope died on April 21, 2025, and fans quickly connected his fate to Paytas\u2019 pregnancy. While addressing the conspiracy theory that her third child will be Pope Francis reincarnated during her April 22 podcast, Paytas leaned into the meme and joked about the possibility of naming her baby Pope or Francis.",
      "\u201cIf it\u2019s a boy, I guess we\u2019re naming it Pope. It\u2019s not a bad name,\u201d she commented. \u201cTechnically, there (are) girls named Frances too. So we could have a girl Frances; yeah, my dad is, my dad\u2019s name is Francis.\u201d",
      "When the revered heavy metal musician died at age 76, fans were quick to connect the dots.",
      "The meme may be coming to a natural end, however, as Paytas has publicly declared she does not intend to have more children.",

      "During an interview in February for an episode of Sirius XM\u2019s \u201cOzzy Speaks,\u201d Osbourne opened up about the effects the disease had on his body to co-host Billy Morrison.",
      "\u201cYou know what Billy, I go on about the way I can\u2019t walk and I can\u2019t do this. But you know what I was thinking over the holidays? For all my complaining, I\u2019m still alive,\u201d he shared. \u201cI may be moaning that I can\u2019t walk as well\u2026but as I look down the road, there\u2019s people that didn\u2019t do half as much as me and they didn\u2019t make it.\u201d",
      "So, he focused on preparing his body for his last performance with Black Sabbath, the group\u2019s first in 20 years. Ahead of the show, he spoke to British newspaper The Guardian via video call about training for the show and how he struggled over recent years.",
      "He described his recent years as \u201cthe worst of my life\u201d amid his health issues. \u201cHow many surgeries have I had?\u201d he asked himself, referring to the multiple procedures he had since falling on his face in January 2019. \u201cI\u2019ve got more f---ing metal in me than a scrap merchants.\u201d",
      "To get ready for his last time on stage, he started lifting weights, bike riding and working with a trainer. \u201cIt\u2019s tough \u2014 I\u2019ve been laid up for such a long time. I\u2019ve been lying on my back doing nothing and the first thing to go is your strength. It\u2019s like starting all over again,\u201d he said.",
      "Osbourne continued, \u201cI\u2019ve got a vocal coach coming round four days a week to keep my voice going. I have problems walking. I also get blood pressure issues, from blood clots on my legs. I\u2019m used to doing two hours on stage, jumping and running around. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be doing much jumping or running around this time. I may be sitting down, but the point is I\u2019ll be there, and I\u2019ll do the best I can. So all I can do is turn up.\u201d",
      "He was also asked during the interview if he was sure that the Birmingham gig would be his last.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d love to say \u2018never say never\u2019, but after the last six years or so \u2026 it is time,\u201d he said. \u201cI lived on the road for 50-odd years, and I\u2019ve kind of got used to not picking up my bags and getting on the bus again. I don\u2019t smoke dope or do any of the rock star lifestyle anymore. I\u2019m kind of like a homebody. I never go out. I never hang out in bars \u2014 I don\u2019t drink. So what the f--- is out there for me?\u201d",
      "He added that he hoped to spend his final days surrounded by his family.",
      "\u201cI hate going shopping with my wife. I feel like stabbing myself in the neck after half an hour. But it\u2019s time for me to spend some time with my grandkids, I don\u2019t want to die in a hotel room somewhere. I want to spend the rest of my life with my family,\u201d he said."

      "\u201cWe got the scripts initially, and I flipped back through it to make sure, like, is this actually what is happening? That is, honestly, what really drew me to the project,\u201d Wonders told TODAY.com following her appearance on the 3rd Hour of TODAY on July 21.",

      "Here's what happens at the end of \"I Know What You Did Last Summer.\"",
      "What Is 'I Know What You Did Last Summer' About?",
      "The sequel to the 1997 film \"I Know What You Did Last Summer\" unfolds in Southport, North Carolina, where a serial killer nicknamed the Fisherman once preyed on the group of 20-somethings.",
      "Now, the Fisherman is back, but targeting a new photogenic friend group. Wonders' character, Ava, is back in her hometown for a friend's engagement party when the consequences of their actions the summer prior come back to haunt them.",
      "What did they do last summer, exactly? Friends Ava Brucks, Danica Richards (Madelyn Cline), Ava's ex-boyfriend Milo Griffin (Jonah Hauer-King) and Danica's fianc\u00e9 Teddy Spencer (Tyriq Withers) were driving on the Fourth of July to see the town fireworks. They also picked up Stevie Ward (Sarah Pidgeon), a former friend who had recently gotten out of rehab.",
      "Teddy, driving the full car, was drunk and high when he came to Reaper\u2019s Curve, the same blind spot at the heart of the 1997 movie.",
      "Teddy ended up running a man named Sam Cooper off the road, and Teddy's father, Grant Spencer (Billy Campbell), was able to cover up what happened. A property developer and survivor of the 1997 killings, Grant is also trying to hide the town\u2019s history.",
      "But some things can't remain hidden. A year later, the friends start dying, one by one.",
      "Freddie Prinze Jr. and Jennifer Love Hewitt reprise their roles as Ray Bronson and Julie James, the survivors of the 1997 killer, who end up being roped back in to help the new group of targets.",

      "We find out who the Fisherman killer is \u2014 and it hits close to home.",
      "Many killings have already taken place by the time the revelations unfold, with three unfolding in close succession at the end. After being released from a police precinct, Danica and Ava find Teddy and his real-estate father, Grant, slain and hung up at the Southport marina. Immediately running to a police car, they find Ava\u2019s ex Milo dead.",
      "In shock and grief, they, along with Stevie, flee to a yacht at Ray Bronson\u2019s and make their escape. Out at sea on Ray's boat, Stevie confesses to being the killer. Gasp!",
      "Turns out Sam, the man who Teddy ran off the road the summer before, had been Stevie's boyfriend. They had met at a church group during at a low point for Stevie: She was fresh out of rehab and felt that her friends had abandoned her.",
      "In the car and feeling uncomfortable, Stevie had texted Sam to pick her up. Sam died on his way to her. Stevie only found out he was in the car later, but she was set on revenge.",
      "She's not alone. Ava figures out that Ray \u2014 yes, the Ray from the 1997 movie \u2014\u00a0was in on it with Stevie all along.",
      "Ray was Stevie's boss at the bar where she worked and became like a surrogate father for her. He vowed to stop at nothing to ensure Stevie's happiness, even if that included killing the friends who abandoned her at the time she needed them most.",
      "Ray was also stuck in the past, unable to move on from the 1997 murders, even if the rest of the town was. He expresses his rage that Grant, the (now dead) developer, has gentrified the town, overshadowing the trauma that he and his friends experienced.",
      "Ava, with Julie's last-minute help, kills Ray with a speargun.",
      "\u201cIt felt very euphoric, honestly, because doing stunts is such a thrill it has,\u201d Wonders told TODAY.com. \u201cThere\u2019s so much adrenaline involved that it just inherently adds to the whole journey that the character has been through \u2014 getting to slash, stab and knee in the nuts.\u201d",

      "Ava and Danica, who survives the squabble, have a conversation at the end of the movie that hints at a sequel.",
      "Ray had said that Stevie was still alive \u2014 even though he appeared to shoot her in the head. Ava and Danica joke about how they should finish the job. But are they joking?",
      "Already, by killing Ray, Ava has turned into a killer. Will she kill again?",
      "The movie is about \"catching people that have just been wrung dry by trauma, and how you don't even understand your trauma response can affect your actions,\" Wonders said.",
      "She teased that there\u2019s more planned in store for future installments as well.",
      "\u201cWe gotta get your butts in those seats so the box office Gods allow us to make a second one,\u201d Wonders said. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to make for a really interesting continuation.\u201d"

      "Avdic said he heard shots, felt sharp pain in his right side and right arm and blacked out. When he woke up, more prisoners were being lined up for execution. When the small truck that brought him to the site drove away, Avdic and another wounded man escaped in the darkness. After walking through the woods for days, they crossed into Muslim-controlled central Bosnia.",
      "Last week, Avdic recounted his experience to members of the German parliament at an event in Berlin marking the 30th anniversary of the fall of the United Nations-protected \u201csafe area\u201d of Srebrenica. Two international courts have ruled that Bosnian Serbs\u2019 systematic killing of male Bosnian Muslim prisoners \u2014 at least 7,000 in total \u2014 was the first genocide in Europe since World War II.",
      "The following day, members of the far-right Alternative for Germany, or AfD party, argued in parliament that the mass killings did not constitute genocide. \u201cThe Serbs shot men there, but generally spared women and children,\u201d Alexander Wolf said in a speech.",
      "A second AfD member, Martin Sichert, invoked a conspiracy theory, warning that Muslims were waging a \u201cbirth jihad\u201d in Germany, a reference to Muslim immigrants someday outnumbering Germans. \u201cSrebrenica reminds us to end multiculturalism before it\u2019s too late,\u201d Sichert warned.",
      "As disinformation spreads online, denialism about war crimes \u2014 both past and ongoing \u2014 is growing increasingly common worldwide, experts warn. From current conflicts in Ukraine, Israel and Gaza to past atrocities in Syria, Bosnia and Rwanda, as well as the Holocaust, basic facts are now disputed or dismissed.",
      "Denialism is proving politically profitable, as well. In February, the AfD won the second-most seats in Germany\u2019s parliament, the best showing by a far-right party since World War II. In Bosnia, a local Serb leader, Milorad Dodik, has gained support by spreading conspiracy theories about Srebrenica, calling it \u201can arranged tragedy.\u201d He dismisses the identification of 6,981 victims \u2014 part of the largest DNA identification project in history\u2014 as a hoax.",
      "Dodik's office did not respond to a request for comment. After this article was published, Sichert said in an email that he believes it's critical to investigate the causes of massacres \"because this way the death of the people at least has a little meaning.\"",
      "He went on to ask why is Srebenica recognized as a genocide but not Hiroshima. \"Because victors write history,\" Sichert said. \"Every civilian casualty should be considered equally no matter who won the war.\"",
      "Wolf, in a separate email, said that \"commemoration should not be one-sided\" and cited the killings of Serbs in the village of Kravica by Bosnian Muslim forces from Srebrenica during the war.",
      "But war crimes prosecutors and journalists found that of forty-five Serbs who died in Kravica, thirty-five were soldiers, including five who were killed after being taken prisoner. The number of Bosnian Muslims killed by Serb forces after being taken prisoner is in the thousands.",
      "Growing Denialism",
      "At a conference in Srebrenica marking the 30th anniversary of the mass killings here, the heads of the Kigali Genocide Memorial in Rwanda and the Auschwitz-Birkenau and Stutthof concentration camp museums in Poland warned that spreading lies online about war crimes has also become financially profitable.",
      "War crimes denialism generates so much traffic online that making money \u2014 not political or ideological gain \u2014 appears to motivate some of its purveyors.",
      "At one point, the directors discussed whether better influencers might help, and several of them agreed that they could.",
      "Avdic is determined to be one of them. As denialism spreads, he is more determined than ever to use what is left of his life to speak for the men and boys who died beside him on that gravel 30 years ago.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s becoming more aggressive day by day,\u201d he said, referring to denialism. \u201cYou have to know that we are all foreign bodies on this Earth, and we will all evaporate naturally sooner or later.\u201d",
      "A U.N.-protected \u2018safe area\u2019",
      "I first met Avdic 30 years ago covering the war in Bosnia as a reporter for The Christian Science Monitor. After the fall of Srebrenica, rumors spread that Bosnian Muslim men were describing mass executions. Avdic, then a shell-shocked teenager whose father was later found in a mass grave, was one of nine men who told me they had survived mass executions. When I later visited the gravel plateau beside an earthen dam in the village of Petkovci, I found two human femurs.",
      "Avdic and his father were among the roughly 10,000 Bosnian Muslim men who fled Srebrenica on foot when Bosnian Serb forces attacked in July 1995. The surrounded town had been declared an internationally protected \u201csafe area,\u201d but the United States, Europe and 600 Dutch U.N. peacekeepers did little to protect it",
      "Women, children and elderly men took refuge at a large battery factory that Dutch peacekeepers had turned into their main base. And men, most of them unarmed, set off through the woods on a 60-mile trek to Muslim-controlled central Bosnia.",
      "When Serb forces attacked the column, Avdic and his father were separated in the chaos. \u201cI lost him,\u201d Avdic recalled. \u201cI lost him immediately.\u201d He continued walking with strangers but was eventually captured. Two days later, he and other men were taken to the gravel plateau, and the executions began.",
      "Needing to speak",
      "For the next 12 years, Avdic testified at war crimes trials about the executions under a pseudonym and lived far from Srebrenica, fearing for his safety. In 2007, he returned to Srebrenica, his hometown. He and other Bosnian Muslims felt a duty to return to the area and preserve its Muslim community. Avdic, who had grown up in a village outside the town and also lost four uncles and three cousins in the killings, found being in Srebrenica comforting.",
      "\u201cI have less nightmares,\u201d he said, shrugging his shoulders. \u201cI cannot explain it.\u201d",
      "In 2014, when he visited the execution site during an event with mothers of the victims, he was filled with a desire to speak publicly about the mass killing he survived.",
      "\u201cWhen I came to the place, something forced me to say something; I felt a strong need to talk,\u201d he said. \u201cWords started to flow, something stronger than me.\u201d",
      "He met his wife, Elvisa, a Bosnian Muslim survivor whose uncle and cousin also died in the executions, in Srebrenica in 2008. The following year, they married. Now, Nedzad works as a manager at a company in Srebrenica that produces parts for luxury car interiors. Elvisa works at a local meteorological station. They have three daughters who attend local school alongside Serb children. Serbs and Muslims coexist but generally don\u2019t discuss the war.",
      "\u201cHatred destroys, first of all, those who hate,\u201d Avdic said.",
      "In recent years, Avdic has given dozens of speeches about the massacres in multiple countries and called for the protection of civilians in Ukraine and Syria. Speaking about Srebrenica is difficult but cathartic. \u201cIt was my choice to go to Berlin,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is not something that I wish. It is emotional, and it is difficult for me.\u201d",
      "Local Bosnian Muslims have transformed the cavernous former car battery factory that Dutch U.N. peacekeepers used as a base into a museum documenting the genocide. Across the street, the headstones of the thousands of Muslim men and boys killed in the massacres cover a lush green field and hillside.",
      "In recent years, though, Muslims have slowly left Srebrenica, many of them citing economic and safety concerns. Once a majority-Muslim town, Srebrenica is now roughly half-Serb, half-Muslim.",
      "Elvisa, Avdic\u2019s wife, said she worries about her children\u2019s future.",
      "\u201cI was 13 years old then in 1995. My daughter is now 13 years old,\u201d she said. \u201cNow, I\u2019m more emotional about that time. When we are older, we care more and we feel more.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur grandmother was killed,\u201d she added. \u201cThey cut her throat.\u201d",
      "Defiance and threats",
      "Avdic said provocations still happen, including when a local priest once played Serb nationalist songs to taunt Muslim residents.",
      "\u201cHe will die with his evil,\u201d Avdic said of the priest.",
      "As denialism spreads, Serb nationalists have grown more defiant. In nearby towns, Avdic is sometimes recognized and mocked by them.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not afraid of them,\u201d he said, though he acknowledged the danger. \u201cYou never know what could happen, because I\u2019m a witness.\u201d",
      "Avdic and his wife are torn. Leaving Srebrenica might be better for their children, but Avdic believes it is his duty to raise his family here and speak for the men and boys who died beside him.",
      "\u201cI will die proud,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I believe my children will be proud they were born here.\u201d"

    "summary": "A judgment by the U.K.\u2019s Supreme Court that said the legal definition of \u201cwoman\u201d is based on biological sex came a blow to campaigners for trans rights.",
    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 Soccer fans know it as \u201challowed ground,\u201d so when Billie Sky Walker walked onto the field at London\u2019s Wembley Stadium two years ago, she achieved a dream held by players around the world.",
      "Before a Community Shield men\u2019s match between Manchester City and Arsenal in August 2023, she proudly donned an official shirt as a representative of the Football Association, the regulatory body for soccer in England, that read, \u201cThe FA is for all.\u201d",
      "Today, the 28-year-old is barred from playing in FA-organized tournaments following a landmark judgment by Britain\u2019s Supreme Court in April that said the legal definition of \u201cwoman\u201d is based on biological sex \u2014 a huge blow to campaigners for transgender rights that could have far-reaching implications for a wide range of life in the U.K., be it admission to changing rooms or decisions on hospital beds, equal pay claims and domestic violence shelters.",
      "After the judgment, a number of sporting governing bodies, including the FA, changed their rules so that only those born biologically female are allowed to play, excluding Walker and 28 other transgender players across England from the association. The Scottish Football Association followed suit, and Northern Ireland\u2019s Irish Football Association appears likely to do the same.",
      "Describing the ruling as \u201cconfusing and upsetting,\u201d Walker said she had been welcomed \u201cinto this space\u201d by her cisgender peers, or women whose gender matches the sex they were assigned at birth.",
      "Calling the decision to bar Walker \u201cheartbreaking,\u201d her former teammate Lucy Leiter, 24, said it was not the case that \u201conly trans women think they should play,\u201d adding, \u201cThe support has been unequivocal from everyone I\u2019ve ever played with.\u201d",
      "Walker, who said she felt that she was a girl from the age of 5 and transitioned at the age of 24, said that playing soccer on a women\u2019s team \u201creally established a huge essence of who I am, because it gave me the safety and comfort and knowledge that I\u2019m enough.\u201d",
      "Intense debate",
      "The Supreme Court ruling came amid intense and sometimes toxic public debate in the U.K. over the intersection of transgender and women\u2019s rights. The debate has also simmered in the U.S., where President Donald Trump has made it one of his signature issues by signing an executive order in February banning trans women from women\u2019s sports at the national level.",
      "In December 2022, Scottish lawmakers approved a bill that allowed anyone over the age of 16 to change their gender identity using gender certificates, removing the need for a medical diagnosis of gender dysphoria, the medical term for the distress that results from the conflict between someone\u2019s gender identity and sex assigned at birth.",
      "The campaign group For Women Scotland later brought a legal case against the semiautonomous government, arguing that sex-based protections should apply only to people who were born female.",
      "And Britain\u2019s central government blocked the law the following year, invoking for the first time a section of the 25-year-old act that gave the Scottish Parliament control over most of its own affairs.",
      "The For Women Scotland case nonetheless worked its way through the court system, reaching the Supreme Court this spring.",
      "After the court\u2019s 12 justices ruled unanimously in the group\u2019s favor, the presiding judge, Lord Hodge, said the decision should not be seen as \u201ca triumph of one side over the other,\u201d and emphasized that transgender people remain protected under the law.",
      "For Women Scotland campaigners celebrated the verdict with hugs, tears of happiness and Champagne as they left the courtroom.",
      "\u201cThere was elation and disbelief and, yes, I was absolutely thrilled,\u201d Susan Smith, one of the group\u2019s co-founders, told NBC News in a telephone interview last month. \u201cIf people were entitled to say that their sex in law had changed, you can\u2019t control who applies for that.\u201d",
      "For Smith and her group, the issue of legal gender recognition touches on who gets to make decisions about women\u2019s lives and bodies, including their access to spaces from hospital wards to rape crisis centers and prisons."

      "Since Trump\u2019s so-called Liberation Day on April 2, the administration has yet to strike any formal trade deals, instead signing a handful of framework deals that can be turned into fully fledged deals later.",
      "Japan has been furiously trying to avoid as much of a hit from Trump\u2019s global tariffs as possible. Japan\u2019s lead trade negotiator has visited the United States at least eight times, most recently Monday, when he met with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick for more than two hours.",
      "As part of the agreement, Trump said Japan would \u201cinvest, at my direction, $550 Billion Dollars into the United States, which will receive 90% of the Profits.\u201d It was unclear how such an investment would work.",
      "Japan is already the biggest foreign investor in the United States, directly investing $754.1 billion last year according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.",

      "He added that Japan would form a joint venture with the United States related to liquefied natural gas in Alaska.",
      "Japan was the fifth-biggest source of U.S. imports last year, with American consumers and companies buying nearly $150 billion of goods from the country, according to Commerce Department data.",
      "The talks came at a tough time politically for Ishiba, whose Liberal Democratic Party recently lost both houses of parliament. Ishiba pledged to stay on as leader, in part to address economic headwinds.",

      "A podcast popular among young men shocked the internet this week with an unexpected interview guest: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.",
      "But Netanyahu\u2019s bid to appeal to young people appeared to backfire online, where the interview drew widespread criticism from viewers across the political spectrum.",
      "His interviewers, Kyle Forgeard and Aaron \u201cSteiny\u201d Steinberg, are members of the Nelk Boys, a group of social media influencers known for their vlogs and prank videos. The group, which has amassed more than 8.5 million subscribers on YouTube, attracted even more fans after its content began to highlight more conservative political figures, including President Donald Trump, whom the podcast interviewed in 2022, 2023 and 2024.",
      "Netanyahu\u2019s hourlong interview, which dropped on the Nelk Boys\u2019 \u201cFull Send Podcast\u201d on Monday, was met with overwhelmingly critical reception online, with viewers accusing the podcasters of asking softball questions and neglecting to push back against Netanyahu\u2019s claims.",
      "Netanyahu and his government continue to face worldwide outrage over the war in Gaza that followed the Hamas-led terrorist attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023.",
      "The podcast\u2019s YouTube channel lost more than 10,000 subscribers within a day, according to the social media tracking platform Social Blade. On YouTube, top comments on the episode were critical of the hosts\u2019 apparent lack of preparedness.",
      "\u201cI see so much stuff about what\u2019s going on in Israel and Iran and Palestine, and to be honest, I just really don\u2019t know what is going on there,\u201d Forgeard said in the episode. Steinberg said he was similarly hoping to \u201cget educated\u201d by interviewing Netanyahu.",
      "At one point, the topic of discussion turned to Netanyahu\u2019s and Trump\u2019s shared affection for hamburgers. Asked about his go-to McDonald\u2019s order, Netanyahu revealed that he prefers Burger King, leading Steinberg to respond, appalled: \u201cThat\u2019s your worst take, I think.\u201d",
      "Throughout the rest of the interview, Netanyahu condemned anti-Israel protesters as \u201cun-American\u201d and contrasted life in Israel with life under the oppressive regime in Iran. He also railed against New York\u2019s Democratic mayoral nominee, Zohran Mamdani, calling his proposals for the city \u201cnonsense.\u201d (Mamdani has called Israel\u2019s military actions in Gaza \u201cgenocide\u201d and has said he would arrest Netanyahu, who is the subject of a warrant for his arrest from the International Criminal Court, if he visited New York City.)",
      "Asked why he\u2019s \u201cso hated worldwide,\u201d Netanyahu answered: \u201cWell, a lot of propaganda. First of all, I\u2019m not hated worldwide.\u201d He said Israel has received a lot of goodwill from many in Europe, claiming that Israel\u2019s attack on Iran also \u201cliberated them, because those Iranian missiles were geared at Europe, too, and ultimately at America.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe propaganda is there, I don\u2019t deny it,\u201d Netanyahu said. \u201cBut people also have, you know, sometimes the truth beckons. And what Israel did with President Trump is safeguard free societies from a menace. I mean, this Iranian regime hangs gays from cranes.\u201d",
      "On Monday, 25 countries, including Britain, Japan and many European nations, called on Israel to end the war in Gaza \u2014 a sign of Israel\u2019s traditional allies\u2019 dismay over the conflict\u2019s humanitarian toll. Close to 60,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since Oct. 7, 2023, according to Palestinian health authorities, with much of the enclave\u2019s population driven from their homes and pushed to the edge of starvation.",
      "The Israeli military and government officials have repeatedly accused Hamas of exploiting civilian sites, including hospitals and schools, as cover for its operations, an accusation that health officials and Hamas have denied.",
      "Israel has also faced mounting accusations of war crimes and genocide, including in a case brought by South Africa before the International Court of Justice, the United Nations\u2019 top court. The court last year ordered Israel to do everything it could to prevent genocidal acts in Gaza. Both Israel and the United States have rejected accusations of genocide.",
      "Online, clips of Netanyahu\u2019s interview drew viral backlash from viewers, many of whom accused the Nelk Boys of platforming \u201cgenocide propaganda\u201d and compared interviewing Netanyahu to interviewing Adolf Hitler.",
      "Far-left political streamer Hasan Piker and far-right white supremacist Nick Fuentes were among those who criticized the latest \u201cFull Send Podcast\u201d episode Monday during separate livestreams on their platforms.",
      "\u201cYou just basically presented someone who is a war criminal, someone who is doing a genocide, in a somewhat neutral light,\u201d Piker told Forgeard and Steinberg in his stream. \u201cAnd you can\u2019t be neutral when you have someone like Benjamin Netanyahu directly in an opportunity to talk to him. But that\u2019s what happened, so there is moral culpability here for you guys individually.\u201d",
      "He added that while he would agree to interview Netanyahu if he were given the opportunity, he would be \u201cwell-equipped\u201d to fact-check his statements and push back against potentially dubious claims.",
      "Forgeard, in response, countered that their style of interviewing could \"give us the opportunity to get the biggest people in the world.\"",
      "\"And I think you\u2019ll know by the 'Full Send Podcast' when you watch it, it\u2019s like, 'Hey, these guys are going to get big guests. We might not necessarily get these guys grilling these people,'\" Forgeard said. \"And that\u2019s just what you\u2019re going to come to expect.\"",
      "Fuentes, in his own stream with Forgeard and Steinberg, also questioned the moral equivalency between himself, who has faced condemnation online for his views and beliefs, and \u201ca foreign head of state who is killing women and children.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is somebody who\u2019s in the process of committing what is effectively an ethnic cleansing and a genocide,\u201d Fuentes said.",
      "The interview struggled to land positively even among some supporters of Netanyahu\u2019s military agenda. In The Times of Israel on Tuesday, contributor Elkana Bar Eitan expressed his disappointment that Netanyahu \u201cblew it\u201d on the podcast, despite the lack of pushback he got from the hosts.",
      "\u201cIt was painful to witness how Netanyahu, once a master communicator, missed this opportunity and showed that he\u2019s lost his touch, even in English,\u201d he wrote in an opinion piece. \u201cDespite the friendly atmosphere and softball questions, Netanyahu came across as completely detached from reality.\u201d",
      "A representative for the \u201cFull Send Podcast\u201d declined to comment.",
      "In a video responding to the backlash, Steinberg and Forgeard said they plan to \u201cgive the other side the opportunity\u201d to speak on their next episode, though it\u2019s unclear what guest they\u2019re referring to.",
      "\u201cSomeone has to do it,\u201d Forgeard said. \u201cAnd if we have to take the fall and be the bad guys for having the controversial people on, I think we\u2019re willing to do it.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Despite all his years of experience and technical training, the doctor\u2019s voice trembled when he recalled how organized crime groups have taken control of emergency rooms and medical facilities in some parts of Mexico.",
      "\u201cThey force us to come in through threatening phone calls, in the early hours of the morning, and they tell us: \u2018We\u2019re just a few meters from where you live, and you\u2019re with your family. If you don\u2019t treat this person, we\u2019re going to pick you up right here,\u2019\u201d said the doctor, who works at a health center in Guanajuato, in central Mexico, and who requested complete anonymity for fear of reprisal.",
      "In many regions of Mexico, organized crime attacks have affected hospitals, even taking over operating rooms and emergency rooms, where hitmen kidnap medical personnel to force them to treat the wounded in the frequent clashes they wage with other cartels.",
      "The doctor interviewed by Noticias Telemundo in Guanajuato claimed that, on one occasion, he was contacted in the early hours by a high-ranking local drug operative, who made an unusual request.",
      "\u201cI received a call requesting treatment for a person who had been shot by a firearm. And they arrived at the main entrances of the hospitals with long guns, demanding treatment for their patient,\u201d the doctor said. On several occasions, the doctor said, the Jalisco New Generation Cartel forced him to use his equipment to treat hitmen.",
      "Noticias Telemundo confirmed that both the local boss and the hitman whose life was saved later died in a confrontation with the Mexican army. For the safety of the doctor interviewed in Guanajuato, their names are being withheld.",
      "According to the United Nations International Narcotics Control Board, cartels and criminal groups continue to contribute to the high levels of violence in Mexico.",
      "\u201cOrganized crime continues to be a key player in the lives of Mexicans. This is evident because some criminal groups have managed to force the Mexican state to lose control of certain territories, and because of the corruption and impunity that allow them to continue to reign and expand their capabilities,\u201d Guadalupe Correa-Cabrera, co-director of the Terrorism, Transnational Crime and Corruption Center at George Mason University, said in an interview with Noticias Telemundo.",
      "So far, official data shows that from September 2024 to April 2025, there was a 32.9% decrease in the daily average of intentional homicide victims, falling from 86.9 victims per day to 58.3.",
      "However, disappearances increased significantly: In the first 100 days of Claudia Sheinbaum\u2019s administration, 4,010 disappearances were recorded, an average of 40 per day, compared with the figure of 25 recorded during the previous six-year term.",
      "\u201cThere are many missing people who, in reality, have already been kidnapped by drug traffickers and buried in so-called narco-graves,\u201d said David Saucedo, a security analyst based in Mexico City. \u201cThe cartels are hiding the bodies, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re seeing a reduction in homicides in several states across the country. But it\u2019s not that there are fewer deaths; there are fewer bodies. They\u2019re hiding the bodies,\u201d Saucedo asserted.",
      "'This shouldn't be normal'",
      "According to the latest report from the Mexican government, Guanajuato is the state with the most (980 from January to April 2025). In February 2025, the daily average reached 12.5. Last year, the National Survey of Victimization and Perception of Public Safety revealed that 87.5% of the population considered public safety to be the state\u2019s most serious problem.",
      "\u201cIn Guanajuato, the Santa Rosa de Lima Cartel is fighting over drug trafficking with the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, and that\u2019s generating a lot of violence,\u201d Correa-Cabrera explained. \u201cThese organized crime groups are fighting for control of spaces because they need more street space, there are more feuds, and that\u2019s leading to more injuries and deaths, so they\u2019re taking control of medical centers.\u201d",
      "Noticias Telemundo visited Guanajuato to document the case of a health center in the city of Celaya, where wounded drug traffickers were treated. According to a state intelligence report, until three years ago, the Santa Rosa de Lima Cartel used the San Ferm\u00edn Clinic to treat its wounded hitmen. However, in November 2022, gunmen from the Jalisco New Generation Cartel killed two men there and set fire to the now-abandoned facility.",
      "\u201cThe hospital where I work in Guanajuato isn\u2019t the only one that\u2019s suffered this, nor am I the only doctor who\u2019s experienced this. We see in the news that these people are arriving at certain public hospitals,\u201d the Guanajuato doctor said, adding that \u201cI can say that more colleagues have experienced this. One lives with anxiety, and this shouldn\u2019t be normal for us.\u201d",
      "Due to the strong presence of criminal groups, the Guanajuato state police have implemented operations in clinics and hospitals in several municipalities of the state, to prevent drug cartels from continuing to infiltrate those places.",
      "\u201cWhen people injured with a firearm arrive, the prosecutor\u2019s office sends us a custody request. When these people arrive, we coordinate to provide security at the hospitals,\u201d said Bernardo Cajero, director of the Celaya police and in charge of these security operations.",
      "However, the Guanajuato doctor explained that although the Silver Code has been established in Mexico \u2014 a protocol that requires authorities to be notified when there are episodes of violence or when a person with a gunshot wound arrives at a health center \u2014\u00a0this is not always followed.",
      "\u201cThey come and take our cellphones, cut us off from communication, and start threatening us, saying that if they see anything strange, they could hurt us themselves,\u201d the doctor said, with fear in his voice. \u201cOne of the things they\u2019re asking is that we not activate Code Silver and that we not notify the authorities.\u201d",
      "'It affects us all'",
      "Although there are no official figures on armed takeovers of health centers, the Guanajuato case is not unique in Mexico. In April 2024, a 10-person armed group entered a private medical center in Cuernavaca and shot and killed a patient in intensive care. In September, gunmen threatened staff at the Mexican Social Security Institute in Mazatl\u00e1n with the phrase \u201cIf they die, you die,\u201d forcing them to care for their wounded. Two months later, two attacks were reported at the Culiac\u00e1n General Hospital.",
      "\u201cWhat the drug cartels do is take over hospitals, kidnap nurses, doctors, specialists, blood banks, operating rooms, and whatever else they need. They are hospital centers where the wounded are seen and treated, so they can return to their criminal activities,\u201d Saucedo said.",
      "In 2022, a report by Insecurity Insight for the Safeguarding Health in Conflict Coalition \u2014 a group of nongovernmental organizations focused on protecting health care \u2014 warned that Mexico had documented the most violent incidents against health care workers in Latin America: at that time, 14 recorded incidents, including three deaths, five kidnappings, two destroyed or damaged medical facilities and a damaged or looted  medical unit.",
      "\u201cBefore, they would leave their wounded in clinics, but then they would be finished off by rival groups,\u201d Saucedo said, \u201cnow, for added security, many drug trafficking groups are setting up private hospitals for themselves.\u201d",
      "Saucedo and other experts cited as examples of this trend the complaints about the hospital built by the leader of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes, known as   \u201cEl Mencho,\u201d and the mobile clinic set up by the Sinaloa Cartel\u2019s Ismael \u201cEl Mayo\u201d Zambada.",
      "Researchers like Correa-Cabrera warn that these incidents also occur in other countries experiencing major security crises, such as Haiti, Ecuador and the Argentine city of Rosario, or in contexts of conventional warfare, such as the conflicts in Syria, Lebanon, Somalia and Libya, among others.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t something new; this is part of any armed conflict, low-intensity conflict, or war,\u201d Correa-Cabrera said, \u201cbecause health care for members of these warring groups is very important.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, the Guanajuato doctor says the tension generated by these incidents, in which armed groups enter hospitals, is sometimes so great that medical staff request vacation time and psychological support.",
      "\u201cThe first thing is to save that person\u2019s life, regardless of the situation or the accusations, because they are human beings,\u201d the doctor said, \u201cbut it affects us all; it can cause trauma. In fact, there were colleagues who asked for their leave, and anyone would do that. It\u2019s normal when you live with that every day.\u201d",

    "summary": "Ukranian activists warn about corruption and authoritarianism after police raids against several high-profile anti-corruption campaigners and opposition figures.",
    "story": [
      "Ukraine risks backsliding on its endemic corruption problem \u2014 and even creeping toward authoritarianism \u2014 activists warn, following police raids against a high-profile anti-corruption campaigner and opposition figures.",
      "On July 11, armed police raided the home of Vitaliy Shabunin, the co-founder of Ukraine\u2019s Anti-Corruption Action Center. He has accused President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of \u201ctaking the first, but confident steps toward corrupt authoritarianism,\u201d including backing laws offering amnesty to those accused of corruption in the defense industry, and passing over an independently selected candidate for a key anti-graft role.",
      "The move has perturbed even some of Zelenskyy\u2019s supporters \u2014 people who are simultaneously worried about the heavy-handed and potentially spurious crackdown on dissent, and that such criticisms against the Ukrainian leader might be used in bad faith by opponents in Moscow or Washington.",
      "\u201cThis is the red line which President Zelensky has crossed \u2014 and the red line is in a very wrong direction in terms of the development of Ukraine,\u201d said Daria Kaleniuk, executive director of the Anti-Corruption Action Center, the Kyiv-based watchdog that Shabunin co-founded. She said the State Bureau of Investigations did not have the necessary court documents for the search.",
      "Shabunin has been charged with evading military service and fraud, with prosecutors alleging that while on secondment from the front lines to continue his activism back in Kyiv, he conducted activities unrelated to his military service. His defense team and supporters say the secondment was all aboveboard and ordered by his superiors, and that the allegations are trumped up and political.",
      "The case has caused grave alarm for many inside Ukraine and abroad, with even some of those who praise Zelenskyy for making progress on corruption flagging it as cause for concern that he may be engaging in some of the same questionable practices they\u2019d hoped he was rooting out.",
      "Zelenskyy pledged to reduce corruption when he was elected in 2019, and many expert observers say he has been effective at doing so, but the tide of criticism around Shabunin\u2019s arrest comes when the president is under intense pressure to fight off Russia and keep alive support from the United States and the West that has been at risk of faltering.",
      "It\u2019s not just Shabunin\u2019s own organization that\u2019s concerned. A group of 59 nongovernmental and civil society organizations, both inside Ukraine and abroad, have signed an open letter to Zelenskyy saying the arrest \u201cbears signs of political motivation, abuse of rights\u201d and either \u201cgross incompetence\u201d or \u201ca deliberate attack to pressure\u201d Shabunin.",
      "NBC News has contacted Zelenskyy\u2019s office and the State Bureau of Investigations for comment but has not received a response.",
      "The president has been a longtime vocal advocate on the issue of fighting corruption, particularly when it comes to suggestions from the U.S. and elsewhere that the billions of dollars in military aid his country is receiving might be being misappropriated.",
      "\u201cWhere we saw risks that something could be happening with weapons, we cracked down hard,\u201d he told the \u201cLex Fridman Podcast\u201d in January.",
      "Last year Shabunin himself dismissed the idea that foreign arms could be embezzled, telling the BBC that \u201call weapons supplied by Western allies end up in the hands of Ukrainian troops who use them effectively. It is impossible to steal Western weapons.\u201d",
      "Shabunin appeared in court Tuesday and was released on \u201crecognizance\u201d \u2014 essentially released without having to post bail \u2014 until the next hearing Aug. 20.",
      "The German Marshall Fund, a Washington think tank and one of the international signatories of the letter to Zelenskyy, said Ukraine had made \u201cmonumental strides\u201d on corruption in the past 11 years.",
      "Nevertheless, \u201cit\u2019s always concerning when a government targets its vocal critics with flimsy charges in politically motivated investigations,\u201d said Josh Rudolph, managing director and senior fellow of Strategic Democracy Initiatives at the fund. \u201cAlthough this is not a sign of corruption per se, it displays an alarming disregard for the fundamental values of freedom and the rule of law at a time when the international community has been rallying around Ukraine because it is defending those very values from Russia\u2019s brutal assault.\u201d",
      "Shabunin is not the only recent arrest to cause alarm. The opposition UDAR party, headed by former heavyweight boxing champion Vitali Klitschko, says that a raid in April on the home of Kyiv City Council deputy Dmytro Bilotserkivets \u2014 again, they said, without the necessary documents \u2014 was a clear attempt to put pressure on political dissent.",
      "Corruption in Ukraine is a fraught and delicate topic, ripe for weaponization often in bad faith.",
      "Russia uses it as an example to support its otherwise untrue criticisms \u2014 such as Ukraine being run by neo-Nazis \u2014 while American and European politicians hold up such examples to bolster their pre-existing arguments about whether to support Kyiv\u2019s defense against Moscow.",
      "\u201cThe issue of corruption in Ukraine has long been highly politicized,\u201d said Mariya Omelicheva, a professor at the Pentagon-funded National War College in Washington, D.C.",
      "Ukrainian \u201ccorruption is almost always co-opted \u2014 either by Ukraine\u2019s supporters or, more problematically, by its adversaries,\u201d she added. \u201cThis is particularly sensitive in the current U.S. political climate, where both parties \u2014 Democrats and Republicans \u2014 have used Ukrainian corruption narratives for domestic political purposes.\u201d",
      "There is also a feeling among some Ukrainians that President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d focus has allowed officials abroad to act with greater impunity knowing Washington\u2019s hitherto exacting gaze is currently less troubled by world affairs.",
      "\u201cOur international partners, particularly the United States, don\u2019t care anymore about good governance and anti-corruption and reforms,\u201d Kaleniuk said. Washington \u201cfor the last 12 years had a powerful impact on how Ukraine develops, and the U.S. was usually tough on good governance, anti-corruption reforms and developments critical for democracy,\u201d she said. \u201cBut now America doesn\u2019t care about that.\u201d",
      "While it\u2019s true Trump historically spoke warmly of Russian President Vladimir Putin and appeared to accept many of his war demands, in recent weeks he has been increasingly hostile to the Kremlin and signaled a renewed support for Ukraine, pledging Patriot missiles for Kyiv and tariffs on Moscow.",
      "It\u2019s also true that Ukraine \u2014 and Zelenskyy \u2014 have achieved some progress in the corruption fight in recent years. Transparency International, the best known international group that tracks this topic, says Ukraine has steadily improved in its annual \u201cCorruption Perceptions\u201d index \u2014 although it still ranks 105 of 180 countries worldwide.",
      "Nevertheless, domestically there are plenty of Ukrainians alarmed at what they see is a negative direction of travel when it comes to corruption in their country. Though the immediate fight is against Russia, the ultimate battle is for their values of liberty and democracy, supporters say, without which the battlefield struggle becomes pointless.",
      "\u201cWe are fighting for freedoms and for dignity,\u201d Kaleniuk said. If those are lost, \u201conly Russia will applaud.\u201d",
      "Alexander Smith and Freddie Clayton reported from London. Erin McLaughlin from Washington, D.C., and Anastasiia Parafeniuk and Daryna Mayer from Kyiv."

    "story": [
      "A genetic test may one day predict a child\u2019s risk of obesity in adulthood, paving the way for early interventions.",
      "Certain genetic variants can affect how a person\u2019s body stores fat or make them more prone to overeating. Genetic variation can also predict how well a person will respond to different weight loss drugs.",
      "In a study published Monday in the journal Nature Medicine, more than 600 researchers from around the world worked together to compile genetic data from more than 5 million people \u2014 the largest and most diverse genetic dataset to date. They also used genetic data from 23andMe.",
      "From the dataset, the researchers were able to create what\u2019s known as a polygenic risk score, which takes into account which genetic variants a person has that have been linked to a higher BMI in adulthood.",
      "The score, the researchers said, could be used to predict a person\u2019s risk of obesity as an adult \u2014 before they even turn 5.",
      "\u201cChildhood is the best time to intervene,\u201d said study co-author Ruth Loos, a professor at the University of Copenhagen\u2019s Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Basic Metabolic Research. (Research conducted at the center is not influenced by drugmaker Novo Nordisk, though some of the study authors had ties to pharmaceutical companies that make weight loss drugs.)",
      "The findings come as obesity is rising around the world. Rates of obesity in adults have more than doubled globally since 1990, and adolescent rates have quadrupled, according to the World Health Organization. About 16% of adults worldwide have obesity and the situation is worse in the United States, where more than 40% of adults have obesity, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention statistics show.",
      "Twice as effective",
      "The new test is not the first that predicts a person\u2019s risk of obesity, but Loos and her team showed it was about twice as effective as the method doctors currently use to assess their patients. That polygenetic score can account for about 8.5% of a person\u2019s risk for having a high BMI as an adult. The new score increased that to about 17.6%, at least in people with European ancestry.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a pretty powerful risk indicator for obesity, but it still leaves open a lot that is unknown,\u201d said Dr. Roy Kim, a pediatric endocrinologist at Cleveland Clinic Children\u2019s who was not involved with the research.",
      "Based on this score, more than 80% of a person\u2019s risk for obesity can be explained by other factors, such as where they live, what kinds of foods they have access to, and how much they exercise.",
      "The test was not nearly as effective in predicting obesity risk in non-Europeans. It explained about 16% of the risk for having a high BMI in East Asian Americans, but just 2.2% in rural Ugandans.",
      "About 70% of people whose data was included in the study were of predominantly European ancestry. About 14% were Hispanic and typically had a mix of ancestries. About 8% were of predominantly East Asian descent and just under 5% were of predominantly African ancestry. These samples were predominantly from African American people, who largely had mixed ancestry. Just 1.5% were of predominantly South Asian ancestry.",
      "Loos said the new score is a big step forward, but that it\u2019s still a prototype. The next step is to collect more \u2014 and more diverse \u2014 data on people with African ancestry in particular to improve how well the score works for everyone, not just white people.",
      "She said the score could offer one indicator \u2014 what high blood pressure is to heart disease, for example \u2014 that could help predict a person\u2019s risk of developing obesity.",
      "\u201cObesity is not only about genetics, so genetics alone can never accurately predict obesity,\u201d Loos said. \u201cFor the general obesity that we see all over the world, we need other factors such as lifestyle that need to be part of the predictions.\u201d Genetics play a bigger role in severe obesity, meaning a BMI of more than 40, she added.",
      "Still, identifying a person\u2019s genetic risk early on in childhood and intervening early with lifestyle coaching could make a big difference, she said. Research has shown that about 55% of children with obesity go on to have obesity in adolescence, and that about 80% of those individuals will have obesity in adulthood.",
      "\u201cBehavioral things are really important,\u201d Kim said. \u201cTheir environment, their access to healthy food, exercise opportunities, even their knowledge about healthy foods all affect a person\u2019s obesity risk.\u201d",
      "How important are genetics, really?",
      "Although studies in identical twins have found that genetics can account for as much as 80% of the reason a person has obesity, lifestyle factors still play a huge role, Kim said.",
      "\u201cEven with the same genetic makeup, people can have different body types,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom a very young age in my practice, we educate patients about the importance of eating protein-rich foods, a lot of fruits and vegetables and not too many refined carbs.\u201d",
      "Dr. Juliana Simonetti, co-director of the Comprehensive Weight Management Program at the University of Utah, has been using genetic testing in her adult patients for about five years. She said understanding a person\u2019s genes can help doctors better treat weight gain.",
      "\u201cObesity is not homogeneous. We have different kinds and different presentations,\u201d said Simonetti, who wasn\u2019t involved with the new study.",
      "Simonetti uses a person\u2019s genes to determine if a patient struggles with satiety, or feeling full.",
      "\u201cThey eat but do not feel full,\u201d Simonetti said, adding that this is a disorder caused by genetic mutations affecting certain pathways in the body. People who have these mutations \u201ctend to have higher weight,\u201d she said.",
      "But such mutations do not tell the whole genetic story of obesity, Simonetti said. The genes that a person inherits from either parent, even if they are not mutations, also determine how a person\u2019s body stores weight or uses energy. Both can play a big role in obesity risk.",
      "Genetic testing is also starting to be able to determine how well certain weight loss drugs will work for a person, Simonetti said, but she added this is just the beginning.",
      "\u201cWe are talking about three out of 80 mutations that we can treat,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are getting better, and the more data we have, I\u2019m hopeful that we are going to do a better job in being more precise in understanding treatment responses.\u201d"
