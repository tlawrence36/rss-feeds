      "A federal judge in Los Angeles has ruled that Mariah Carey did not steal her perennial holiday hit \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\u201d from other songwriters",
      "A federal judge in Los Angeles has ruled that Mariah Carey did not steal her perennial megahit \u201cAll I Want for Christmas Is You\" from other songwriters.",
      "Judge M\u00f3nica Ram\u00edrez Almadani granted Carey's request for summary judgment on Wednesday, giving her and co-writer and co-defendant Walter Afanasieff a victory without going to trial.",
      "In 2023, songwriters Andy Stone of Louisiana \u2014 who goes by the stage name Vince Vance \u2014 and Troy Powers of Tennessee filed the $20 million lawsuit alleging that Carey's 1994 song, which has since become a holiday standard and annual streaming sensation, infringed the copyright of their country 1989 song with the same title.",
      "Their lawyer Gerard P. Fox said he's \u201cdisappointed\" in an email to The Associated Press.",
      "Fox said it is his experience that judges at this level \"nearly always now dismiss a music copyright case and that one must appeal to reverse and get the case to the jury. My client will make a decision shortly on whether to appeal. We filed based on the opinions of two esteemed musicologists who teach at great colleges.\"",
      "Stone and Powers' suit said their \u201c'All I Want For Christmas Is You' contains a unique linguistic structure where a person, disillusioned with expensive gifts and seasonal comforts, wants to be with their loved one, and accordingly writes a letter to Santa Claus.\u201d",
      "They said there was an \u201coverwhelming likelihood\u201d Carey and Afanasieff had heard their song \u2014 which at one point reached No. 31 on Billboard's Hot Country chart \u2014 and infringed their copyright by taking significant elements from it.",
      "After hearing from two experts for each side, Ram\u00edrez Almadani agreed with those from the defense, who said the writers employed common Christmas cliches that existed prior to both songs, and that Carey's song used them differently. She said the plaintiffs had not met the burden of showing that the songs are substantially similar.",
      "Ram\u00edrez Almadani also ordered sanctions against the plaintiffs and their lawyers, saying their suit and subsequent filings were frivolous and that the plaintiffs' attorneys \u201cmade no reasonable effort to ensure that the factual contentions asserted have evidentiary support.\u201d",
      "She said they must pay at least part of the defendants' attorney fees.",
      "Defense attorneys and publicists for Carey did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Carey's Christmas colossus has become an even bigger hit in recent years than it was in the 1990s. It has reached No. 1 on Billboard\u2019s Hot 100 chart the past six years in a row \u2014 measuring the most popular songs each week \u2014 not just the holiday-themed \u2014 by airplay, sales and streaming.",
      "Carey and Afanasieff have had their own public disagreement \u2014 though not one that's gone to court \u2014 over who wrote how much of the song. But the case made them at least temporary allies.",

      "NEW YORK -- The new Paramount+ series \u201cHappy Face\u201d has all the elements of a gripping true-crime yarn: A serial killer, his estranged daughter, a race to get an innocent man off death row. But perhaps the most intriguing part? How it examines the warping nature of true crime itself.",
      "\u201cI was less interested in the specific psychology of a serial killer or glorifying the murders or seeing violence against women on screen,\" says Jennifer Cacicio, executive producer and showrunner. \"I just feel like we\u2019ve seen that. I was very interested in making a true-crime show told through a different lens.\u201d",
      "\u201cHappy Face,\u201d which begins airing Thursday, is inspired by the true story of Melissa Moore, whose father was a prolific serial killer infamous for drawing smiley faces on letters to the media and prosecutors. She was just 15 when he was captured.",
      "Decades later, as an adult with her own children, she finds herself drawn back into his orbit as she sets out to save an innocent man for a crime her father committed. She also has to tell her daughter the truth about her grandfather.",
      "Starring Annaleigh Ashford and Dennis Quaid, \u201cHappy Face\u201d is told from a female point of view and looks at how a shameful secret can echo through generations. It's also about the push and pull of infamy, with horrendous crimes somehow remaining an alluring draw.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of crime dramas out there that I think are very male-centric. It\u2019s either about the cops are the cool guys or the criminals are the cool guys, and it\u2019s all about kicking in doors. I\u2019ve written on those shows and they\u2019re fun and they serve a purpose. And I think that I really wanted to try something different,\u201d Cacicio says.",
      "\u201cWhat is it like for the rest of the family when there\u2019s this shameful secret and this series of crimes and these acts of violence and what are the ripple effects on everybody involved?\u201d",
      "Ashford, who earned a Tony Award nomination playing a serial killer on Broadway in \u201cSweeney Todd,\u201d plays Moore with tenderness and anger, saying she was interested in exploring generational trauma.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one of the worst nightmares,\u201d she says. \u201cThe worst nightmare of all is having a family member be a victim. And then the second worst nightmare is having a family member be the perpetrator. So what would you do if you\u2019re a parent or your sibling or your spouse or your child committed an atrocity?\u201d",
      "Moore previously shared her story in the bestselling memoir, \u201cShattered Silence\u201d and the 2018 \"Happy Face\" podcast, reaching out to her father's victims and advocating for other family members of killers. Cacicio was one of a number of writers interested in telling her story for TV.",
      "Cacicio approached Moore with this pitch: \u201cIf you want someone who\u2019s a straight-up journalist, who\u2019s just going to tell exactly the story of the podcast, you should let someone else do it,\u201d she told her. \u201cThere\u2019s also an opportunity for it to be a bigger story that\u2019s asking some questions about true crime.\u201d",
      "Cacicio and Moore, it turned out had plenty in common. They were the same age, and both the oldest of three kids. Both had close relationships with their fathers, who hid other lives \u2014 Moore's was a killer and Cacicio served time in prison for drug dealing.",
      "\u201cObviously, the crimes are different, the circumstances are different. But I think, in my family, it was something we didn\u2019t talk about and it was something I didn\u2019t want my friends to know,\u201d says Cacicio.",
      "\u201cA lot of it was really personal to me. And I think that\u2019s what made her trust me \u2014 that I really understood the feelings, even if I didn\u2019t necessarily understand the specific circumstances.\u201d",
      "Quaid plays Moore's father, but unlike other roles he's taken that involve a living person, he had no intention of meeting the prisoner. He didn't want to glorify the killer but also \u201cHappy Face\u201d isn't that kind of show.",
      "\u201cThis is told from Melissa\u2019s point of view, and I think it\u2019s actually truer than his point of view, because I think she knows him much better than he knows himself,\u201d he says. \u201cI think he shows emotions like a little boy who\u2019s trying to talk himself out of a whipping.\u201d",
      "Cacicio says it's time we took a look at the explosion in popularity of true crime, in which women are often the victims but women are also the chief consumers.",
      "\u201cAre we obsessed with these stories because we\u2019re trying to protect ourselves in case the worst happens?\u201d she asks. \u201cI read somewhere that it\u2019s an act of normalizing your own experiences, because usually it\u2019s whatever you\u2019re watching is worse than what\u2019s happened to you. So it kind of like makes you feel better about your own traumas.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The trade organization that represents movie theater owners in the U.S. and abroad is getting a rebrand",
      "In hindsight, NATO was an unnecessarily confusing acronym for a trade organization representing movie theater owners. For 60 years, the National Association of Theatre Owners has promoted interests of movie theaters, from the biggest chains to the one screen mom and pop shops. They\u2019ve also regularly gotten mail and phone calls intended for the other NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.",
      "But the theater owner\u2019s organization is looking to the future, with a new name and a refocused mission. The group will now be known as Cinema United, president and CEO Michael O\u2019Leary told The Associated Press Tuesday.",
      "\u201cIt can be a little complicated having the same name as a multinational military alliance,\u201d O\u2019Leary said. \u201cWe felt that it was time to look at our name and do a rebrand.\u201d",
      "They wanted the new name to reflect the \u201cpassion and energy of the people that run theaters,\u201d O\u2019Leary said, and to put the focus back on the exhibitors and movie theaters. Cinema United represents more than 32,000\u202fmovie screens in the U.S. and more than 30,000 screens in 88 countries. Their job, O\u2019Leary explained, is to promote and support theatrical exhibition. Moviegoing, the new tagline reads, is their mission.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve had a challenging four or five years. But with each passing day, we put those challenges in the rearview mirror a little bit more. Our focus right now is on the future,\u201d O\u2019Leary said. \u201cI think that we stand on the precipice of the next great era of cinema.\u201d",
      "Just a few weeks ago, \u201cAnora\u201d filmmaker Sean Baker made his own case for theaters on the national stage. In accepting his best director Oscar, he used his time at the podium to make a \u201cbattle cry\u201d for the theatrical experience \u2013 for filmmakers to keep making movies for the big screen and for studios to keep releasing them there.",
      "\u201cPeople were ecstatic about it,\u201d O\u2019Leary said. \u201cHe has earned the unyielding allegiance of theater owners all around the world for his strong support over the years, and certainly at the Oscars.\u201d",
      "Movie theaters big and small were hit hard by the pandemic \u2013 many closed and never re-opened. Last year, they also faced a depleted release calendar due to the Hollywood strikes. It\u2019s all resulted in a depleted domestic box office that has yet to reach pre-pandemic levels. In 2024, the industry finished just over $8.7 billion, down 3.3% from 2023 and 23.5% from 2019.",
      "A fuller release schedule is expected this year, but currently the box-office total is down about 5% from where the industry was last year at this time.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really important that we not put too much emphasis on a single year like 2025. We need to constantly be building and growing and moving forward,\u201d O\u2019Leary said.",
      "Despite challenges, it remains an all-ages and affordable entertainment pasttime. A recent study from the National Research Group said 76% of the American population ages 12 to 74 attended at least one movie in 2024.",
      "And though theater closures often make headlines, like the E Street Cinema in Washington D.C., where Cinema United is headquartered, there\u2019s also been a spate of investment and refurbishment in theaters around the country, some spearheaded by famous filmmakers and actors.",
      "Jason Reitman along with more than 30 directors including Steven Spielberg, Christopher Nolan and Bradley Cooper last February acquired Westwood\u2019s Village Theater in Los Angeles, which dates back to 1931. Patrick Wilson also purchased and helped restore an historic theater in New Canaan, CT, joining big screen disciples like Francis Ford Coppola, Martin Scorsese and Quentin Tarantino who have all invested in movie theaters.",
      "Last fall, the eight biggest theater chains in the U.S. and Canada announced that they planned to invest more than $2.2 billion to modernize 21,000 movie theater screens over the next three years. This includes anything from projectors, lighting and sound to features in the concessions area. But upgrades in theaters are nothing new, O\u2019Leary said, they\u2019re just helping to draw attention to it.",
      "\u201cThe entire membership reinvests in their theaters on a regular basis,\u201d O\u2019Leary said. \u201cPart of the reason we made that announcement was because I don\u2019t think it\u2019s obvious to people that theater owners are constantly in the process of reinventing themselves and reinvesting.\u201d",
      "The announcement comes just over a week before some 6,000 movie theater employees from around the world convene in Las Vegas for the annual CinemaCon conference, which Cinema United hosts.",
      "All the major Hollywood studios, including The Walt Disney Studios, Warner Bros. Pictures, Universal Pictures and even Amazon/MGM will be making big, starry presentations on the main stage at Caesar\u2019s Palace \u2014 where executives and stars will show off new footage and trailers to make the case that they have the goods to get audiences in the theaters.",
      "NATO was coined in 1965, a merger of the nation\u2019s largest movie theater trade organizations: The Theater Owners of America, itself a product of a merger dating back to 1948, and the Allied States Association of Motion Picture Exhibitors, which goes back to the 1920s.",
      "Those at Cinema United like to say that \"we\u2019re not a Hollywood industry. We\u2019re a Main Street industry.\u201d",
      "\u201cAt the end of the day, the vast majority of our members are small businesses, so they feel the same pushes and pulls that other small businesses feel throughout the United States and around the world, O\u2019Leary said. \u201cThe headquarters of our biggest members are not in Los Angeles or New York. They\u2019re in Knoxville, Dallas and Kansas.\"",

      "\u201cWalk This Road\u201d \u2014 with the always-welcome addition of Mavis Staples \u2014 is a horn-and-slide-guitar slice of bluesy, wailing rock that's also a celebration of a band that has endured changes and re-formed with members now in their 70s.",
      "\u201cSomehow, here we are,\u201d says McDonald. \u201cWe\u2019ve been friends throughout the years. Our kids have all grown up together and our kids have kind of kept us in contact even at times when we might have dropped off the radar for each other.\u201d",
      "The Doobie Brothers, who formed in 1970 and initially broke up in 1982, have a packed 2025 planned: A European tour that leads to a North American one, the strong new album and inclusion in the Songwriters Hall of Fame.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think any of us ever even really thought we\u2019d still be on stage at this age doing this, much less together,\u201d says McDonald. \u201cThat we\u2019re still able to express ourselves artistically is something that\u2019s not lost on us.\u201d",
      "The North American tour kicks off in Detroit on Aug. 4 and heads to such cities as New York, Boston, Chicago, Milwaukee, Cincinnati, St. Louis, Minneapolis and Toronto. The opening act will be The Coral Reefer Band.",
      "\u201cWalk This Road\u201d features 10 new songs sung by McDonald, Simmons and Johnston, who collaborated on writing the tracks and play on each other's tunes. Longtime collaborator John McFee also returned for the project.",
      "The album, out June 6, has something for everyone \u2014 honky-tonk, driving country, flirty Southern pop, moody folk and melodic rock. There are songs about New Orleans and Hawaii. Angels make the lyrics on two songs.",
      "\u201cOne of the strengths of our live show was the fact that you couldn\u2019t get bored with any one style of music because everything was kind of a different bag,\u201d says McDonald, who officially reunited with the band on tour in 2019. \u201cWe like to do that. You know, I think this album is hopefully no different in that respect.\u201d",
      "John Shanks, who produced the band's 2021 album \u201cLibert\u00e9,\u201d returned for \u201cWalk This Road,\u201d lending them his Los Angeles studio, with a writing room upstairs and a recording booth downstairs where each songwriter took turns cutting tracks.",
      "\u201cThe band, I think, presents all of us with an opportunity to do things that we might not do just as individual songwriters,\u201d says McDonald.",
      "While the Doobies have never been a concept band, the album explores seizing the moments, reflects on paths taken and coming to grips with the past.",
      "\u201cThis is a snapshot in time of where the band is and where the writers are,\u201d says Johnston. \u201cWe didn\u2019t consciously sit down and say, 'Well, we\u2019re going to try and do this.\u2019\u201d",
      "One track, \"Learn to Let Go,\" is an unrequited love song that's about letting go of things that hold you back, while \u201cSpeed of Pain\u201d is about how the worst things in life can become the best.",
      "\u201cIn many cases, it\u2019s just a situation where you have to lose it all. I can\u2019t tell you how many people I\u2019ve met over the years who have told me that going to jail was the best thing that ever happened to them,\u201d says McDonald. \u201cI think total defeat in this world is the great teacher.\u201d",
      "The Doobie Brothers are already members of the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame \u2014 with tracks like \u201cTakin\u2019 It To the Streets,\u201d \u201cWhat a Fool Believes\u201d and \u201cMinute By Minute\u201d \u2014 but shortly after the album comes out, they'll be inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame.",

      "McDonald and Johnston both expressed a little surprise that they're still making music with the folks they worked with in their 20s and are still a draw on the road.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just fun to visit all these places musically. It\u2019s fun to put that out in front of the crowd live. And to do an album now \u2014 I didn\u2019t picture doing this, but I\u2019m all for it,\u201d Johnston says.",

      "The Grammy-nominated Australian singer-songwriter whose legal name is Sia Furler filed the petition in Los Angeles Superior Court.",
      "It listed Tuesday as their separation date. As happens in the vast majority of California divorces, she cited irreconcilable differences as the reason. She asked the court to award no spousal support payments to Bernard.",
      "She's also seeking legal and physical custody of their 11-month-old child, Somersault Wonder Bernard.",
      "It's not clear when the secretive singer began dating Bernard, or how they met. They were legally married in December of 2022 and had a small marriage ceremony in Portofino, Italy, the following May.",
      "From 2014 to 2017, Sia was married to filmmaker Erik Anders Lang.",
      "The 49-year-old singer has been nominated for nine Grammys. Five of them were for her 2014 hit \u201cChandelier.\u201d",

      "Good intentions, like swirling bluebirds, flutter through the new live-action \u201cSnow White.\u201d",
      "Mirror mirror on the wall, what\u2019s the fairest Disney live-action remake of them all?",
      "Wait, mirror. Hold on a second. Maybe choosing from the likes of \u201cAlice in Wonderland\u201d (2010), \u201cMulan\u201d (2020) and \u201cThe Lion King\" (2019) isn\u2019t such a good idea. Mirror, on second thought, what\u2019s on Netflix?",
      "Even the most devoted fans would have to acknowledge that these have not been the most illustrious illustrations of Disney magic. At their best (\u201cPete\u2019s Dragon\u201d? \u201cCinderella\u201d?) they breathe life into old classics that could use a little updating. At their worst, well, blue Will Smith.",
      "Given the rapacious rate of remakes in modern Hollywood, it\u2019s remarkable that it\u2019s taken nearly 90 years for Disney to return to \u201cSnow White.\u201d It means going back to the very foundation of the Mouse House. The 1937 \u201cSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs\u201d was Disney\u2019s first animated feature; its grosses paid for the studio\u2019s Burbank lot.",
      "That legacy of \u201cSnow White,\u201d by comparison, doesn\u2019t do any favors to Marc Webb\u2019s inevitably lesser, inert live-action retread. Good intentions, like swirling bluebirds, flutter through this \u201cSnow White\u201d: to give its singing protagonist ( Rachel Zegler ) more agency; to expand that notion of \u201cfair\u201d beyond skin tone; to reframe that problematic prince. But all that updating adds up to a mishmash of a fable, caught in between now and once upon a time.",
      "It wouldn\u2019t be an earthshattering observation to note that a 1930s cartoon, let alone a 19th century German folk tale, might not be entirely in line with contemporary culture. Most of these Disney live-action remakes have carried with them more than a few notes of correction and atonement for the past \u2014 a laudable goal that means a generation of kids might not need a brief history lesson to go along with an old classic.",
      "But it\u2019s a tricky thing reworking a fable that\u2019s been around two centuries, and that\u2019s doubly true when leaping from the two-dimensional fantasy realm of animation to the more complicated land of flesh and bone. Webb\u2019s \u201cSnow White\u201d has been a veritable case study for the headaches that can arise when a window into the real world is cracked open. Everything from Israel's war in Gaza (Zegler and her co-star Gal Gadot, who plays the wicked stepmother, have differing opinions), the humanity of little people (there\u2019s a reason \u201cand the Seven Dwarfs\u201d has been stripped from the title) and the alleged \u201cwoke\u201d-ness of the production have been fuel for what we can gently refer to as online debate.",
      "Despite some gloriously lush production design, \u201cSnow White\u201d \u2014 innocent of most of those backlashes though not all \u2014 can\u2019t quite thread the needle. Even the new songs (by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul) that are good (\"Waiting on a Wish\") struggle to fit in alongside old standbys. Zegler does a spirited job remaking a classic Disney princess into a more modern woman; when she sings, the movie gets a lift. The last thing that's wrong with this \u201cSnow White\u201d is Zegler's casting.",
      "But like scaffolding that's been left up too long, the strain of renovation shows in Webb\u2019s film, particularly in its awkward handling of Dopey, Sneezy and company. The seven dwarfs, like the fawns and squirrels, are rendered in CGI. You could argue that this acknowledges the artificiality of a dated and offensive trope. But it also gives \u201cSnow White\u201d an uncanny quality, with all human characters but the dwarfs being played by real people. As if to Band-Aid over this, one of the woodsmen is played by an actor of short stature (George Appleby) whose presence seems like yet another atonement, only one for this \u201cSnow White,\u201d not 1937\u2019s.",
      "You might be thinking: But what about the movie? The problem with \u201cSnow White\u201d is that you never stop thinking about these much-strategized and sometimes superficial efforts to recontextualize the original movie. Erin Cressida Wilson's screenplay remakes Snow White's story as less a princess awaiting her Prince Charming (the song \u201cSomeday My Prince Will Come\" has been jettisoned) than an heir to a throne who loses her gumption. Though taught as a child to be \u201cfair\u201d as a leader by her father king (Hadley Fraser), Snow White has lost any ambition by the time Gadot's Evil Queen takes over the kingdom.",
      "Gadot sinks her teeth into the Evil Queen, a spikey, slinky villain who moves with a metallic rustle (the costumes are by Sandy Powell). But she feels cut off from the movie, without the lines that would elevate her flamboyant performance into something memorable. The prince has been altogether scrubbed; instead Andrew Burnap plays the blandly cocksure bandit Jonathan who encourages Snow White not to wait for her father's rescue.",
      "Presumably one of the reasons to bring actors into remakes of animated classics would be to add a warm-blooded pulse to these characters. Zegler manages that, but everyone else in \u201cSnow White\u201d \u2014 mortal or CGI \u2014 is as stiff as could be. You're left glumly scorekeeping the updates \u2014 one win here, a loss there \u2014 while pondering why, regardless of the final tally, recapturing the magic of long ago is so elusive.",
      "\u201cSnow White,\u201d a Walt Disney Co. release is rated PG by the Motion Picture Association for violence, some peril, thematic elements and brief rude humor. Running time: 109 minutes. Two stars out of four.",

      "\u201cA Thelma & Louise for our times,\u201d is how bestselling thriller writer Paula Hawkins describes the debut novel, \u201cKiller Potential,\u201d from Hannah Deitch",
      "When bestselling psychological thriller writer Paula Hawkins (\u201cThe Girl on the Train,\u201d 2015) stamps the cover of your debut novel with \u201cA Thelma & Louise for our times,\u201d your career is off to a fast start.",
      "The same goes for the plot pace of Hannah Deitch\u2019s book, \u201cKiller Potential,\u201d which opens at a breakneck clip and doesn\u2019t really slow down for about 200 pages. Evie Gordon is our narrator. She went to \u201ca liberal arts school, stupidly expensive,\u201d and is now working as an SAT tutor in pricey California zip codes. Her first sentence is a gem: \u201cI was once a famous murderess.\u201d The rest of the book reveals how she earned that appellation and the adverb \u201conce.\u201d",
      "The opening scene is at \u201cThe Victor House,\u201d which Evie describes in great detail \u2014 its \u201clive-edge table cut from Portuguese wood,\u201d the \u201cDe Gournay hand-painted silk wallpaper,\u201d and the \u201caquamarine Moroccan tile in the bathroom.\u201d It\u2019s where Evie discovers the dead bodies of Dinah and Peter Victor, the mother with her face bashed in and the father floating in a koi pond. As Evie flees, she hears a voice crying out for help and rescues a woman trapped behind a door under a staircase, before coming face-to-face with her tutoring student, Serena. Thinking Evie and her accomplice are killers fleeing the scene of their crime, Serena attacks with a lamp and the scene ends with Evie smashing a vase against Serena\u2019s head before escaping with the mystery woman in Evie\u2019s car.",
      "Cue the Hans Zimmer soundtrack for the next 100+ pages as Evie gets to know her partner in crime, who doesn\u2019t speak at first, traumatized by whatever happened to her in the house. Eventually we learn her name, Jae, and together they pull off a series of crimes, some petty (shoplifting, carjacking), some not (assaulting and shooting at a few men and boys who recognize them from TV). Throughout it all, Evie\u2019s inner monologue keeps readers engaged as she ponders things like how the language of courtship (Chase. Pursue. Stalk.) mirrors the language of hunting. It\u2019s clear after a while that Evie and Jae lust for one another and when that dam finally breaks, the novel takes on a torrid tone that feels authentic for two people on the run for weeks relying on only each other and their animal instincts to survive.",
      "Of course, Paula Hawkins doesn\u2019t blurb your book unless there\u2019s a well-earned twist, and \u201cKiller Potential\u201d delivers on that front. The final third or so of the novel is a real joy to read as Deitch fills in all the blanks using different narrative techniques. Saying anything more would spoil the fun, but \u201cKiller Potential\u201d earns Deitch a spot on the \u201cnew novelists to watch\u201d list.",

      "Jonathan Majors plays an amateur bodybuilder in the dark drama \u201cMagazine Dreams.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s rage simmering inside Killian Maddox, the amateur bodybuilder portrayed by Jonathan Majors at the heart of the dark and stylized film \u201cMagazine Dreams.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s a kind of \u201cTaxi Driver\u201d for the incel age, a harrowing portrait of untreated mental illness, violence, false idols, steroids and male loneliness. There was, from the beginning, lots to discuss and debate in the fabric of \u201cMagazine Dreams.\u201d But in the two years since it debuted at the Sundance Film Festival, it was also eclipsed by the very real-life travails of its star, who was convicted of assaulting his former girlfriend.",
      "In January 2023, \u201cMagazine Dreams\u201d had an exciting future with Oscar hopes for Majors. Searchlight Pictures won the distribution rights, reportedly over the likes of Neon and Sony Pictures Classics. And Majors was skyrocketing to the top, with big roles in \u201cCreed III\u201d and as Marvel\u2019s new main villain, Kang. But two months later, he was arrested. By that December, Majors was found guilty of one misdemeanor assault charge and one harassment violation and fired by Marvel. A month later, \u201cMagazine Dreams\u201d was without distribution. Majors has, throughout it all, maintained his innocence.",
      "The film was eventually picked up by Briarcliff Entertainment, the same distributor who jumped in to release the young Donald Trump movie \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d after the rest of the entertainment business shied away from it. \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d went on to get Oscar nominations for its two stars.",
      "But there\u2019s a different kind of stigma around \u201cMagazine Dreams,\u201d which is why this review has also been a bit eclipsed by what's happened in Majors' life. It\u2019s a film about a man teetering on the edge of violence, about the relentless pursuit of greatness \u2014 and it is deeply uncomfortable watching his descent.",
      "His simplistic devotion to one wild goal may be his undoing in a world that just doesn\u2019t care about him. This is not the movie that any public relations professional would choose as a \u201ccomeback role.\u201d Yet it\u2019s impossible to deny the monumental ferocity of Majors\u2019 performance, from his full transformation to his unsettling ability to show the pain behind (most of) the psychotic actions.",
      "Killian\u2019s life is nothing glamorous: He works in a grocery store and at home cares for his aging grandfather. But he has an intense, maniacal need to be seen and to be remembered. And the only way he\u2019s figured out how to achieve that is through physical perfection \u2014 or at least his very narrow idea. Success is a magazine cover, which he naively conflates with immortality.",
      "When co-worker Jessie (Haley Bennett, who does a lot with a small, somewhat thankless role) agrees to go out on a date with him, he is genuinely shocked that she isn\u2019t familiar with his bodybuilding idol, saying something to the effect of \u201cyou need to get out more.\u201d",
      "Writer-director Elijah Bynum effectively imbues his film with stylized intensity. You feel uneasy and captivated from the start, though you try to give Killian the benefit of the doubt \u2014 to look for his goodness, to root for his success, if only for the hope that it might keep him docile for a little longer. Though we\u2019re told early that he\u2019s had violent episodes, through his court-ordered therapist, the glass isn\u2019t fully shattered until Jessie starts to process that Killian is someone she needs to get away from, fast. This is notably after he orders perhaps $500 worth of protein on the date, just for himself. Sadly, we don\u2019t get to see the bill.",
      "While \u201cMagazine Dreams\u201d is an interesting character study, one many actors would love to play for all its dramatic opportunities, it also seems crafted entirely to provoke and shock \u2014 especially in the almost unbearably bleak final hour. After two viewings, one of which I had to take a break from during one of his violent outbursts, I\u2019m not actually sure what it\u2019s trying to say about men, about trauma, about 'roid rage. Killian seems less like an authentic person and more a simplistic stand-in for the forgotten person, the quiet weirdo who ends up a mass killer.",
      "And yet as movies are being accused of being too straightforward, too moralistic, too simple, perhaps some ambiguity, some discomfort, some unresolved unpleasantness is overdue. Majors is a force, and Bynum is certainly a director to watch. The question with \u201cMagazine Dreams,\u201d which was the same in January 2023 as it is in March 2025 is: Will anyone?",
      "\u201cMagazine Dreams,\u201d a Briarcliff Entertainment release in theaters Friday, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for \u201cviolent content, drug use, sexual material, nudity and language.\u201d Running time: 104 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four.",

      "NEW YORK -- As CBS corporate leaders ponder settling President Donald Trump's $20 billion lawsuit against the network's \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d America's storied newsmagazine has produced some fast and hard-hitting stories critical of the new administration in every episode since Trump was inaugurated.",
      "The latest was Sunday, when CBS News helped pay for a performance featuring non-white middle and high school musicians who had won a contest and with it, the right to play with the U.S. Marine Corps Band. The original concert, however, was canceled because of Trump's executive order ending diversity, equity and inclusion efforts.",
      "Correspondent Scott Pelley narrated six of the show's seven stories since Trump's inauguration, including Sunday's. He examined the administration\u2019s policies toward Ukraine and tariffs, looked at changes in the Justice Department and reported on firings of government watchdogs. Shortly after his piece on the dismantling of USAID, Elon Musk suggested \u201clong prison sentences\u201d for those working on the show.",
      "All came at a time when television's most popular and influential news broadcast was being watched to see how it would respond to a unique pressure.",
      "\u201cThis may be a lawsuit that is designed to intimidate, but they are clearly making a statement that they will not be intimidated,\u201d said Tom Bettag, a longtime television news producer who worked under Mike Wallace and Morley Safer at the CBS show.",
      "Pelley, meanwhile, has quickly become a polarizing figure.",
      "\u201cAnother week, another \u201860 Minutes\u2019 story trying to discredit Trump policies,\u201d Brent Baker, editor of the conservative media watchdog NewsBusters, wrote on X on Sunday night.",

CBS said Harris made both comments in her answer to Whitaker and that the two shows ended up using different parts of a long sound bite. CBS argued the apparent discrepancy was typical of editing and not, as Trump has suggested, that different remarks by Harris were used to make her look better.",
      "CBS parent Paramount Global filed new motions in the past two weeks to get both the lawsuit and the FCC probe dismissed. Still, Shari Redstone, head of Paramount, is reportedly anxious for a settlement, much like Disney agreed to pay $16 million in December to end Trump's lawsuit against ABC News' George Stephanopoulos.

      "Many at CBS News resist a settlement, insisting \u201c60 Minutes\u201d did nothing wrong. The show's executive producer, Bill Owens, told his staff last month that he would not apologize as part of any prospective settlement.",
      "\u201cMy precious \u201860 Minutes\u2019 is fighting, quite frankly, for our life,\u201d correspondent Lesley Stahl said earlier this month in accepting a First Amendment award from the Radio Television Digital News Association. \u201cI am so proud of \u201860 Minutes\u2019 that we are standing up and fighting for what is right.\u201d",

      "\u201cThe \u201860 Minutes\u2019 people are such committed journalists that they\u2019d consider it foolish to be doing these stories because of what is a frivolous lawsuit,\u201d he said. \u201cThe lawsuit pales in comparison with the monumental changes Trump is trying to implement. Those correspondents and producers know that this is a moment that requires their very best work.\"",
      "Some of the segments were unusually urgent for the newsmagazine, which tends to do longer-range stories that could take months to produce. Pelley's March 2 report about Ukraine came only days after the White House confrontation between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.",
      "Musk's angry comment on his X social media platform came after Pelley's Feb. 16 story about the billionaire's role in the quick shutdown of the USAID office. \u201cThe world's richest man had cut off assistance to the world's poorest families,\u201d Pelley said, noting that Musk collects \u201cbillions of taxpayer dollars\u201d for his SpaceX company.",
      "Hours later, Musk wrote on X: \u201c60 Minutes are the biggest liars in the world! They engaged in deliberate deception to interfere with the last election. They deserve a long prison sentence.\u201d",
      "Other news organizations have done admirable work under difficult circumstances, said Bill Grueskin, a Columbia University journalism professor.

      "Sunday\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes\u201d story involved some elite high school students \u2014 each of them either of either Black, Hispanic, Indian or Asian descent \u2014 who had earned the right to play with the Marine band before the show was called off.",
      "CBS worked with Equity Arc, an organization devoted to increasing the number of minority students playing classical music, to organize a show for family and friends of the students outside Washington, D.C.. Retired members of military bands were brought in to work with the students. CBS News, which wanted to interview the students, paid for the travel and lodging of 22 of them.",

      "\u201cThe original Marine Band concert would have been seen by hundreds,\u201d he said. \u201cHere tonight, these musicians are being heard by millions.\u201d",
      "Pelley's March 9 report, \u201cFiring the Watchdogs,\u201d was about Trump's efforts to fire inspector generals and thwart others who protect whistleblowers in government agencies. He quoted Trump as saying the firings were standard for a new administration taking office. \u201cHe's wrong,\u201d Pelley said.",

      "In his stories, Pelley's deadpan voice and methodical style could not hide the sharpness of some observations. While narrating the story about USAID, Pelley noted that \u201cIt's too soon to tell how serious President Trump is in defiance of the Constitution.\"",

      "An unprecedented exhibition at the Pompidou Center in Paris explores the presence and influence of Black artists in the city from the 1950s to 2000",
      "PARIS -- An unprecedented exhibition at the Pompidou Center in Paris explores the presence and influence of Black artists in the city from the 1950s to 2000, offering a vibrant immersion in France's cosmopolitan capital and a history of anti-colonial, civil rights struggles.",
      "The \u201cBlack Paris\u201d exhibition features the works of about 150 major artists of African descent, many of whom have never or rarely been displayed in France before. Running from March 19 to June 30, it's one of the final shows before the museum closes for a five-year renovation later this year.",
      "\u00c9va Barois De Caevel, associate curator, said that the exhibition is \u201cunprecedented,\u201d with more than 300 paintings and sculptures by artists of various backgrounds.",
      "\u201cSome are African Americans, some are Caribbeans, some are Africans, and some are Afro-descendants,\u201d said Barois De Caevel, adding that the focus of the exhibit is not geography or race, but rather \u201cBlack consciousness,\u201d shaped by the history of slavery and experience of racism shared by Black artists.",
      "After World War II, many African American painters, musicians, and intellectuals flocked to Paris, seeking a sense of freedom that they couldn't find in the United States at the time. Barois De Caevel pointed out that for many, Paris represented a break from the racial segregation that they faced back home.",
      "\u201cMany enjoyed being free in the streets of Paris \u2014 being able to go out with white women, enter cafes, bars and restaurants, and be treated like white people,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cBut they were not fooled,\" she added, noting that African American writer James Baldwin \"wrote about this early on, that in France, racism is especially targeting Black Africans and Algerians, who were really extremely mistreated. So it\u2019s an ambivalent relationship with Paris.\u201d",
      "The exhibition also shows how many African artists from French colonies \u2014 and later former colonies \u2014 came to Paris to join a political and intellectual movement fighting for civil rights and racial justice, while others from the Caribbean were supporting independentist movements, which were gaining strength there.",
      "Alicia Knock, curator of the exhibition, praised the ambitious scope of the show, which she described as \u201can incredible epic of decolonization,\u201d highlighting how Paris city served as both a \u201clab for Pan-Africanism,\u201d the movement that encouraged solidarity between peoples of African descent, and an \u201canti-colonial workshop.\u201d",
      "Visitors \u201cwill see how these artists contributed to rewriting the history of modernism and postmodernism,\u201d Knock said, and how they \u201dreframed abstraction and surrealism, and at the same time you will also see the Black solidarities that happened at the time.\u201d",
      "\"Many of these artists were not only creators, but also cultural ambassadors, teachers, poets, and philosophers,\u201d she added.",
      "For some coming from the U.S., Paris was also \u201ca gateway to Africa,\u201d Knock said, based on discussions she had with some of the artists' families: \"They told us that, in fact, they had come to Paris to go to Africa, and in the end they found Africa in Paris.\u201d",
      "The exhibition also includes installations from four artists chosen to provide contemporary insights, including Shuck One, a Black graffiti and visual artist native of the Caribbean island of Guadeloupe.",
      "In addition, the Pompidou Center has acquired around 40 of the show's artworks, which will remain part of the museum\u2019s collection.",
      "\u201cThis is just the beginning,\u201d Knock said. \u201cIt\u2019s a baby step for many French institutions, French museums and French universities to start working on these artists, start collecting them, writing about them, preserving their works in their archives and hopefully dedicating a lot of solo shows to many of these artists, because they really deserve it.\"",

    "story": [
      "Robert De Niro's doing double duty in \u201cThe Alto Knights,\u201d literally",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re the actor!\u201d shouts Anna Genovese at her estranged spouse, gangster Vito Genovese, in a courtroom where he\u2019s implausibly claiming he lacks funds to support her. \u201cThe best actor in the world! Better than Clark Gable!\u201d",
      "And we all chuckle. They probably all chuckled on set, too. Because the man playing Vito in \u201cThe Alto Knights\u201d is none other than Robert De Niro, indeed one of the best actors in the world, revered in our time as Gable was in his.",
      "It\u2019s a cute moment and an apt one, too, because Barry Levinson\u2019s film, which aims but fails to channel the magic of decades-old mob movies like \u201cGoodfellas\u201d \u2014 though penned by the same writer, Nicholas Pileggi \u2014 is all about De Niro. Actually, it\u2019s all about De Niro AND De Niro. The man plays both lead roles, feuding mobsters Genovese and Frank Costello, in a story based on real events.",
      "Is it a gimmick? Surely. Does it work? Well, there\u2019s the entertainment value \u2014 this is De Niro, after all \u2014 and if you feel that more De Niro minutes are always better, then it follows that two roles are better than one. Others may feel it has a mob-themed \u201cParent Trap\u201d vibe, less weighty than it should be given the obviously violent subject matter.",
      "Also, \u201cGoodfellas\u201d fans may wonder if the Vito role was once intended for Joe Pesci (the movie\u2019s been in development forever), so similar is the character to that actor\u2019s impulsive, manically suspicious persona. On the other hand, in two brief scenes where the De Niros appear together for momentous meetings, one might be forgiven for wondering if Al Pacino was in line at some point, for a \u201cHeat\u201d-like moment.",
      "Happily, De Niro relies here on makeup, and not de-aging as in \u201cThe Irishman,\u201d though it must be said that, at times, his two characters just don\u2019t look different enough. More importantly, \u201cThe Alto Knights,\u201d despite its pedigree, doesn't rise anywhere near the heights of its glorious predecessors. It is, rather, an enjoyable if choppily paced look at a relationship between two men, where unfortunately we\u2019re arriving pretty late in the game.",
      "There are, though, a few crackling surprises: that domestic courtroom scene; a tense, televised Senate committee grilling; and finally a climactic gathering of mob bosses in the countryside, with fabulous period vehicles parked on the lawn and sausages on the grill, that's disrupted in comically sudden fashion.",
      "We begin in 1957 in Manhattan. Costello, after a night partying respectably with high society, stops at his swank apartment building. \u201cThis one\u2019s for you,\u201d declares the nervous man who shoots him in the head in his lobby.",
      "The shooter (Cosmo Jarvis), sent by Genovese, makes a bad mistake, as his boss will remind him later: \u201cYou gotta go SEE if they\u2019re dead!\u201d Amazingly, Costello survives. \u201cI shoulda been paying more attention,\u201d says the genteel mobster who favors diplomacy over bloodletting, narrating from the future.",
      "We then go back in time to figure out how things got this bad.",
      "With the help of vintage photos and footage artfully edited to include actors playing the younger Frank and Vito, we learn the two were good friends as young Italian immigrants on the streets. But when Vito got mixed up in a murder case, he had to flee to Italy \u2014 leaving cooler-headed Frank in charge of the business.",
      "Years later, Vito returns, and wants his role at the top of the mob family. And so things go south, quickly.",
      "The women in their lives mirror the differences between the two men. Costello\u2019s wife of more than 50 years, Bobbie (Debra Messing, making a nice foray into drama), is a loyal partner who urges her husband to retire and leave New York \u2014 along with their adorable dogs (De Niro\u2019s own pooches, dressed in mink coats and hats \u2014 a costume design Oscar for this canine fashion, please!). Genovese\u2019s wife Anna (Kathrine Narducci, excellent) is a businesswoman \u2014 she owns a gay bar \u2014 whose fiery union with Vito turns disastrous.",
      "A mere glance at Wikipedia will tell you that both Genovese and Costello ultimately died in nonviolent ways. There\u2019s plenty in \u201cThe Alto Knights\u201d that you won\u2019t see there \u2014 for example, the movie's version of just who engineered that farmland mob summit, and why.",
      "But watching dozens of mobsters run like heck when police happen upon their gathering is a hoot, and it\u2019s hard to beat the moment when two of them insist to suspicious cops: \u201cWe\u2019re hunters!\u201d",
      "If only such witty moments were more frequent in a two-hour movie that somehow, alas, feels much longer.",
      "\u201cThe Alto Knights,\u201d a Warner Bros. Pictures release, has been rated R by the Motion Picture Association \u201cfor violence and pervasive language.\u201d Running time: 120 minutes. Two stars out of four.",

ESPN will have the lion's share of tournament games again, but Fox increased its footprint in the sport with five games in primetime on Saturday nights and 18 total on the network.",

      "A doubleheader on Feb. 16 was huge for ESPN: UConn vs. South Carolina drew 1.8 million viewers while LSU vs. Texas had 1.7 million. In all, 15 games on ESPN networks averaged over 500,000 viewers, the most in a single year.",
      "ESPN, which owns the rights to the NCAA Tournament and shows women's games every week during the season, has faith that March Madness will deliver.",

Clark, a generational player, had guided Iowa back to the championship game where they were facing an undefeated South Carolina team looking for its own place in history.",

Will it be better than pre-Caitlin? That floor should be much higher than it was.\u201d",

      "A federal judge has dismissed the charges against a Minnesota man accused of hiding a stolen pair of ruby slippers that Judy Garland wore in \u201cThe Wizard of Oz.\u201d Prosecutors informed the court Monday that he died Sunday",
      "ST. PAUL, Minn. -- A federal judge dismissed the charges Monday against a Minnesota man accused of hiding a stolen pair of ruby slippers that Judy Garland wore in the 1939 musical \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d after prosecutors informed the court that he died on Sunday.",
      "Jerry Hal Saliterman, 77, of Crystal, who had been in poor health with lung disease and other ailments, had been scheduled to change his plea to guilty in January but that hearing was postponed indefinitely after he was hospitalized.",
      "Federal prosecutor Matthew Greenley notified the court in a one-page motion Monday that Saliterman died Sunday but did not say how or where. U.S. District Judge Patrick Schiltz granted the request and dropped the charges.",
      "Defense attorney John Brink confirmed Monday that his client had died but declined to give details. A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office in Fargo, North Dakota, which is handling the case, did not immediately return a phone call seeking further information.",
      "According to court filings, Saliterman was hospitalized in early January \"for inability to walk and sepsis,\u201d an infection that can be life-threatening. He attended his arraignment three days later via video from what looked like a hospital room. In an update to the court late last month, Brink told the court that his client had been discharged to a hospice facility and that his prognosis was poor. An accompanying letter from his doctor listed severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease requiring supplemental oxygen and Parkinson's disease.",
      "Saliterman was in a wheelchair and on oxygen last March when he made his first court appearance. He was charged then with theft of a major artwork and witness tampering for his role in the ruby slippers case.",
      "The sequined red slippers were stolen in 2005 from the Judy Garland Museum in her hometown of Grand Rapids. Their whereabouts remained a mystery for nearly 13 years until the FBI recovered them in 2018. They fetched a record for movie memorabilia of $32.5 million in December, according to Heritage Auctions. The slippers were one of several pairs Garland wore during the filming. Only three other pairs remain.",
      "Terry Jon Martin, now 78, of Grand Rapids, used a hammer to smash the glass of the museum\u2019s door and display case to steal them. According to his attorney, an old associate with connections to the mob told him the shoes had to be adorned with real jewels to justify their $1 million insured value. But he got rid of the slippers when he learned they were fake, and they ended up with Saliterman. Martin pleaded guilty in 2023 and was sentenced last January to time served because of his poor health.",

In 2023, Dequenne revealed she had been diagnosed with adrenocortical carcinoma. Representatives for Dequenne did not immediately respond to inquires from The Associated Press on Monday.",
      "Dequenne was only 18 when she was selected as best actress at Cannes in 1999. In \u201cRosetta,\u201d from Luc and Jean-Pierre Dardenne, she portrayed a teenager trying to escape her difficult life in a caravan park with an alcoholic mother. The film also won the Palme d\u2019Or that year.",

      "More recently, she co-starred in \u201cClose,\u201d Lukas Dhont\u2019s tender boyhood drama, which brought her back to Cannes again in 2022. She saw similarities between her young co-star and her own breakout role with \u201cRosetta.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor me to be here and to come back here after 23 years, it\u2019s very emotional and there is like a reflection between Eden (Dambrine) and myself because I remember when I was here the first time with \u2018Rosetta,\u2019\u201d she told The Associated Press. \u201cIt was like a very powerful movie with this main character, which is in every scene, every, every shot.

      "BAMAKO, Mali -- Amadou Ndiaye meticulously ran his fingers across bumps in a piece of paper, making sense of the world he can no longer see.",
      "Two hundred years have passed since the invention of braille, the tactile writing system that has transformed the lives of many blind and partially sighted people by offering a path to literacy and independence.",
      "\u201cBraille helped me live my life,\" said Ndiaye, a social worker in Mali who lost his eyesight as a child. \u201cBefore, people asked themselves the question: Here is someone who can\u2019t see, how will he make it? How will he integrate into society?\u201d",
      "The West African country, with a population of over 20 million people, has long struggled to integrate blind and partially sighted people. According to eye care charity Sightsavers, around 170,000 people in Mali are thought to be blind.",
      "The 47-year-old Ndiaye was fortunate to attend the institute for the blind in Mali, where he learned to write in braille, and told himself: \u201cReally, everything that others do, I can do too.\u201d He later attended university.",
      "He said braille has allowed him to develop his main passion, playing the guitar, which also emphasizes the importance of touch.",
      "\u201cEach pressure on the strings, each movement of the finger on the neck, becomes a living note, loaded with meaning,\" Ndiaye said.",
      "The guitar is an integral part of Mali's griot tradition, the cultural practice of storytelling through music. Musicians adapted the guitar to emulate the sounds of traditional string instruments like the kora. Local artists such as Ali Farka Tour\u00e9 have fused Malian melodies with elements of the blues, creating a soulful, hypnotic sound that has gained international acclaim.",
      "Iconic Malian musical duo Amadou and Mariam awakened Ndiaye's passion for the instrument when he was a boy.",
      "\u201cOne day, near a photography studio, I heard their music resonating through the window, which pushed me to discover this universe,\u201d he said.",

      "The couple met at Mali's institute for the blind, where Doumbia was studying braille and teaching classes in dance and music.",
      "At such places, braille has allowed students to overcome educational barriers such as taking longer to learn how to read and write. They can then take the same exams as anyone else, which allows them to seek employment, said Ali Moustapha Dicko, who teaches at the institute for the blind in the capital, Bamako.",
      "Dicko is also blind. Using a special typewriter, he can create texts in braille for his students. But he says his students are still at a disadvantage.",
      "\u201cWe have a crisis of teaching materials,\u201d Dicko said. He has one reading book in braille for his entire class of dozens of students.",

      "Decades of road salt use is taking a toll on New York City\u2019s water reservoirs",
      "The suburban reservoirs that supply 10% of New York City's vaunted drinking water are getting saltier due to decades of road salt being spread near the system \u2014 and they will eventually have to be abandoned if nothing is done to reverse the trend, city officials warn.",
      "The plug wouldn't have to be pulled until early next century, according to a new study. But the soaring saltiness could eventually affect the famous taste of the Big Apple\u2019s water, which is sometimes called the champagne of tap water, and poses a challenge to managers of a system that serves more than 9 million people.",
      "\u201cThe conclusion of this study is that if we don\u2019t change our ways, in 2100 the Croton Water System becomes a nice recreational facility, but it ceases to be a water supply,\u201d Rohit Aggarwala, the city\u2019s environmental protection commissioner, said in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cAnd that will directly impact everybody who drinks New York City water.\u201d",
      "The Croton system dates back to 1842 \u2014 when the first Croton Aqueduct began delivering water to a reservoir in what is now Manhattan\u2019s Central Park \u2014 and is now comprised of 12 reservoirs and three controlled lakes north of the city.",
      "The report found the concentration of chlorides \u2014 an indicator of salinization \u2014 tripled from 1987 to 2019 in the system's main reservoir, which is about 20 miles (32 kilometers) north of the city line. Concentrations are on track to exceed the state\u2019s maximum contaminant level for chloride by 2108.",
      "The report found salinity increases across the sprawling system of city reservoirs in upstate New York. However, the problem is far less of an issue in the Delaware and Catskill watersheds west of the Hudson River, which supply about 90% of the city\u2019s water. That\u2019s likely because there\u2019s far less development in those watersheds.",
      "Road salt is considered a main driver of the increase, along with sewage treatment plant discharges and water softeners. Millions of tons of rock salt is spread on U.S. roads each winter as a cheap and effective way to reduce accidents.",
      "\u201cIt's really a problem across the country in areas with a lot of snow,\u201d said Shannon Roback, science director for the environmental group Riverkeeper. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen rising levels of salt in water in the Northeast, in the Midwest and in most places that use road salt.\u201d",
      "Roback noted that high salt levels in drinking water pose a host of environmental concerns and can be harmful to people on low-sodium diets.",
      "Aggarwala said the city has a few options.",
      "Salt can be removed from water supplies through reverse osmosis systems, though the technology is expensive and requires a lot of energy. The city also could mix Croton water with less salty water from its other two watersheds. But the commissioner said that would not be a solution for the more than a dozen municipalities north of New York City that draw water from the Croton system.",
      "City officials believe reducing the use of road salt locally is the most sensible option. That could involve persuading state and local road crews to use alternatives to salt, or sensors on plows to gauge road surface temperatures, or shutting off the applicators when plows make U-turns or K turns.",
      "State Sen. Pete Harckham, who represents the area, called the new report alarming, but not surprising given a number of community wells taken offline due to high chloride levels. The Democrat is sponsoring bills that would address the road salt issue, including one that would study the issue in the Croton watershed.",
      "\u201cState agencies, local governments, everyone needs to come together on this,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause this is a real challenge.\u201d",

      "A common blood test may miss ovarian cancer in some Black and Native American patients, delaying their treatment, a new study finds. It's the latest example of medical tests that contribute to health care disparities.",
      "Researchers have been working to uncover these kinds of biases in medicine. Recently, the Trump administration\u2019s crackdown on diversity, equity and inclusion has jeopardized such research as universities react to political pressure and federal agencies comb through grants looking for projects that violate the president's orders.",

      "The new study, supported by grants from the National Cancer Institute and published Thursday in JAMA Network Open, looked at a test called CA-125. The test measures a tumor marker in the blood, and doctors use it to determine if a woman with a suspicious lump should be referred to a cancer specialist.",
      "Doctors depend on the test during early evaluations, so understanding what the results mean for people of different races and ethnicities is critical, said Dr. Shannon Westin of MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, who was not involved in the research.",
      "\u201cThis is a perfect example of work that absolutely needed to be stratified based on race and ethnicity,\" Westin said. The findings alert doctors that they shouldn't be totally reassured by a normal test result, she said.",
      "So far, it\u2019s unknown why the test doesn't perform uniformly across groups. The researchers suspect it has something to do with a harmless genetic variation that is more common in people of African, Caribbean, Middle Eastern and West Indian descent.",
      "Initial studies of the test, published in the 1980s, didn\u2019t record people\u2019s races but were in mostly white populations.",
      "The test isn't perfect for white women either, said lead author Dr. Anna Jo Smith of the University of Pennsylvania's medical school.",
      "\u201cBut if we have worse performance in certain groups, then we may be further contributing to disparities in referral, disparities in treatment, and ultimately we may be contributing to the lower survival in Black women with ovarian cancer,\" Smith said.",
      "The researchers analyzed data from more than 200,000 women with ovarian cancer from 2004 through 2020 who'd had a CA-125 blood test.",
      "Black and Native American patients were 23% less likely to have an elevated CA-125 level at ovarian cancer diagnosis compared with white patients, suggesting the current thresholds are set too high.",
      "The researchers also found that patients with false negative results started chemotherapy on average nine days later than patients with elevated levels. That could make a difference for some patients, Smith said.",
      "Last week, Smith and her colleagues presented work at a Society of Gynecologic Oncology meeting proposing a new lower threshold for the blood test that would work better across all populations. The work could lead to changes in guidelines.",
      "\u201cNew thresholds for referral will ensure that all patients get in for rapid care when ovarian cancer is suspected,\u201d Smith said.",

      "NEW YORK -- U.S. births rose slightly last year, but experts don't see it as evidence of reversing a long-term decline.",
      "A little over 3.6 million births were reported for 2024, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention preliminary data. That's 22,250 more than the final tally of 2023 U.S. births, which was released Tuesday.",
      "The 2024 total is likely to grow at least a little when the numbers are finalized, but another set of preliminary data shows overall birth rates rose only for one group of people: Hispanic women.",
      "The rise \u2014 less than 1% \u2014 may just be a small fluctuation in the middle of a broader trend, said Hans-Peter Kohler, a University of Pennsylvania sociologist who studies family demographics.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d be hesitant to read much into the 2023-24 increase, and certainly not as an indication of a reversal of the trend towards lower or declining U.S. fertility,\u201d Kohler said, adding that more analysis is needed to understand any changes that happened in birth patterns last year.",
      "U.S. births and birth rates have been falling for years. They dropped most years after the 2008-09 recession, aside from a 2014 uptick. They also dropped in 2020, the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, then rose for two straight years after that, an increase experts partly attributed to pregnancies put off amid the pandemic.",
      "A 2% drop in 2023 put U.S. births at fewer than 3.6 million, the lowest one-year tally since 1979. Vermont had the lowest birth rate that year, and Utah had the highest, according to Tuesday's 86-page report on 2023 birth data.",
      "The report, based on a review of all the birth certificates filed that year, shows the average age of mothers at first birth has continued to rise, hitting 27 1/2 years. It was 21 1/2 in the early 1970s, before beginning a steady climb.",
      "Birth rates have long been falling for teenagers and younger women, but were rising for women in their 30s and 40s \u2014 a reflection of women pursuing education and careers before trying to start families, experts say. But in 2023, birth rates fell for women in almost all age groups, include women in their early 40s.",
      "Preliminary birth rate data for 2024 shows a continued decrease among teenagers and women in their early 20s. But it also showed increases for women in their late 20s, due entirely to a rise in births to Hispanic women.

    "story": [
      "A new report identifies ways to create resilient water and wastewater systems in communities hardest hit by climate change",
      "Malynndra Tome was helping to map livestock ponds in the Navajo Nation when she saw something that inspired her to act. An elderly woman was filling milk jugs with water at the back of a gas station in the Native American reservation, where about 30% of people live without running water.",
      "\u201cHow can we be living in the United States of America \u2026 one of the most powerful countries in the world, and people are living like this here?\u201d asked Tome, a citizen who grew up in the community of Ganado, Arizona, in the nation's largest Native American reservation at 27,000 square miles (69,930 square kilometers) in Arizona, New Mexico and Utah.",
      "A report published Tuesday identifies ways historically neglected communities most vulnerable to climate change, like Tome\u2019s, can create resilient water and wastewater systems. Its highlights include nature-based solutions, tailoring approaches to each community and using technology \u2014 all the while recognizing barriers to implementing them.",
      "\u201cWhat we hope to do with this report, what I hope, is that it actually gives people hope,\u201d said Shannon McNeeley, a report author and senior researcher with the Pacific Institute, which published the report with DigDeep and the Center for Water Security and Cooperation. \u201cIn spite of some of the major federal funding sources becoming uncertain and possibly not available, I think people will find other ways.\u201d",
      "Weather extremes made worse by climate change have disrupted people\u2019s access to water.",
      "In September, more than 100,000 residents in western North Carolina were under boil-water notices for nearly two months after Hurricane Helene destroyed much of a local water system. In January, several water providers declared their drinking water unsafe after wildfires roared through Los Angeles. One utility in Pasadena, California, sent out its first notice since it began serving water more than a century ago.",
      "Aging water systems leak trillions of gallons, leaving residents in some of the country\u2019s poorest communities with a substantial financial burden to fix them.",
      "An estimated 30% of the population in the Navajo Nation lives in homes that don\u2019t have running water, and many residents drive long distances to get water from public spigots, according to the Navajo Nation Department of Water Resources and the Natural Resources Defense Council.",
      "The report also notes that some federal resources and funding have become unavailable since Donald Trump returned to the White House. The Trump administration has cut or paused funding for critical water infrastructure projects, touted a reversal of diversity, equity and inclusion policies, and eliminated environmental justice policies meant to protect the communities the report centers on.",
      "Greg Pierce, director of the Human Right to Water Solutions Lab at the University of California, Los Angeles, said the report \u201ccomes at a very depressing moment where we're not going to see federal action in this space, it doesn't seem, for the next four years.\u201d",
      "The report synthesizes existing literature about water, climate change and solutions. Its authors reviewed academic studies, government and private reports and interviewed experts to identify ways low-income and communities of color can build water and wastewater systems to withstand extreme weather.",
      "The report highlights technology like rainwater harvesting and gray water reuse systems that can decrease water demand and increase resilience to drought. But it adds that implementing and maintaining technology like it can be too expensive for poorer communities.",
      "The report also advocates nature-based solutions such as wetlands, which studies find can reduce the length and severity of droughts, provide flood control, reduce or remove pollutants in water and protect water supplies. Communities across the country are increasingly recognizing the benefits of wetlands. In Florida\u2019s Everglades, for example, officials have spent billions of dollars to build engineered wetlands that clean and protect a vital drinking water source.",
      "The report argues for government-funded water assistance programs to help poorer households pay water and sewer bills, like the Low Income Household Water Assistance Program launched during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Gregory Moller, a professor in the soil and water systems department at the University of Idaho, notes that some approaches are too complex and expensive for smaller or poorer communities. \u201cOur innovations also have to be on a scale and stage that is adaptable to small systems,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s where I think some of the most serious challenges are.\u201d",
      "Some solutions the report highlights are benefiting communities. In the Navajo Nation, hundreds of solar-powered home water systems have brought running water to more than 2,000 people. Kimberly Lemme, an executive director at DigDeep, which is installing the systems, said it can be a complex and lengthy process. But it shows that solutions do exist.",
      "\u201cWater is a basic human right,\u201d said Tome, whose encounter with the elderly woman inspired her to pursue a doctorate in water resources. \u201cAnd in order for people to live productively, to have healthy lives, I think water is a big part of that.\u201d",

      "MINNEAPOLIS -- A jury found the alleged ringleader of a massive pandemic fraud case in Minnesota guilty on all counts Wednesday for her role in a scheme that federal prosecutors say stole $250 million from a program meant to feed children in need.",
      "Aimee Bock \u2014 founder of Feeding our Future, the group at the heart of the plot \u2014 was one of 70 defendants charged in the overall case, which prosecutors said was the nation's single largest fraud scheme against COVID-19 relief programs.",
      "The Minnesota case has also drawn attention for an attempt to bribe a juror in an earlier trial and witness tampering in Bock's trial, which began last month. Thirty-seven defendants have already pleaded guilty, while five were convicted in a group of defendants who were tried last year.",
      "The jury also convicted a co-defendant, Salim Ahmed Said, owner of the now-defunct Safari Restaurant in Minneapolis.",
      "Bock, 44, and Said, 36, were charged with multiple counts involving conspiracy, wire fraud and bribery. Said was also charged with money laundering. Bock allegedly pocketed nearly $2 million, while Said was accused of taking around $5 million. They both maintained their innocence and testified at trial.",
      "U.S. District Judge Nancy Brasel ordered them both held without bail pending their sentencing, for which she did not set a date.",
      "\u201cIt was the largest COVID fraud scheme in the country, and what Bock and and her co-defendants did was reprehensible.\u201d Lisa Kirkpatrick the acting U.S. attorney for Minnesota, said at a news conference afterward.",
      "\u201cDuring COVID, while so many were trying to be helpers, Bock and Said were thieves,\u201d she continued. \u201cThey used a time of crisis as their golden opportunity to enrich themselves and their criminal partners \u2014 outlandishly so. At every step of the way, Bock fought to keep her fraud scheme going. Today her efforts to lie, to blame others, to escape responsibility, all came to an end.\u201d",
      "Bock's attorney, Kenneth Udoibok, said there will be an appeal. While he has not decided what legal grounds might be used as its basis, he told The Associated Press that the jury could not have fairly considered all six weeks' worth of evidence in the few hours they deliberated after getting the case Wednesday morning.",
      "But lead prosecutor Joe Thompson called the scheme \u201cbrazen and corrupt\u201d and told reporters it tarnished Minnesota's reputation for good governance and civic mindedness as well as its high quality of life and low crime.",
      "\u201cThe Feeding Our Future case has come to symbolize the problem of fraud in our state,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cIt has become the shame of Minnesota. Hopefully today\u2019s verdict will help turn the page in this awful chapter in our state\u2019s history.\u201d",
      "Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, who came under heavy criticism from Republicans who said his administration should have caught the fraud earlier, told reporters he remains \u201cfurious\u201d with \u201ccriminals that preyed on the system that was meant to feed children.\u201d But he pointed out that nobody in state government, which administered the federal funding, was ever charged in the case.",
      "\u201cWe just need to make sure that we put up more firewalls, more security, more ability to make sure that these criminals aren\u2019t able to prey on this,\u201d Walz said.",
      "Thompson said authorities have recovered only about $60 million of the $250 million that was stolen. He declined to speculate on what prosecutors might recommend for sentences but said Bock and Said face \u201csubstantial\u201d prison time.",
      "The defendants are being tried in several groups. The first trial was marred by an alleged attempt by some defendants and people linked with them to bribe a juror with a bag of $120,000 in cash. That juror went straight to police. That led to tighter security for Bock\u2019s trial and additional precautions ordered by the judge.",
      "Despite all that, an allegation of witness tampering surfaced midway through the proceedings. A defendant scheduled for trial in August approached a government witness who was due to testify against Bock and Said and asked to speak with him in a courthouse bathroom. That witness declined and instead told his lawyer, who informed prosecutors.",
      "That defendant, Abdinasir Abshir, 32, of Lakeville, soon agreed to plead guilty to a wire fraud charge and to have his tampering attempt factored into a longer sentencing recommendation, which isn\u2019t binding on the judge.",

      "A three-judge panel has ruled that Ohio\u2019s ban on gender-affirming care for minors is unconstitutional and ordered it permanently blocked by a trial court",
      "COLUMBUS, Ohio -- Ohio's ban on gender-affirming care for minors is unconstitutional and must be permanently blocked from being enforced, a three-judge panel of appellate judges ruled Tuesday. The law also banned trans women and girls from participating in female sports.",
      "The state attorney general vowed an immediate appeal.",
      "On Tuesday, the state 10th District Court of Appeals reversed a lower court judge's decision last summer to allow the law to go into effect, after finding it \u201creasonably limits parents' rights.\u201d The law bans counseling, gender-affirming surgery and hormone therapy for minors, unless they are already receiving such therapies and a doctor deems it risky to stop.",
      "The litigation was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union, ACLU of Ohio and the global law firm Goodwin, who argued the law not only denies health care to transgender children and teens, but specifically discriminates against them accessing it.",
      "The appellate court agreed, in a 2-1 majority opinion written by Judge Carly Edelstein, and cited a number of flaws in the lower court's reasoning.",
      "The judge cited a number of flaws in the lower court\u2019s reasoning. She said that the Ohio law does not outlaw identical drugs when they're used for other reasons, only when they're used for gender transitioning, which makes it discriminatory. She also said that a prescription ban is not a reasonable exercise of the state's police power when it is weighed against the rights of parents to care for their children.",
      "Addressing proponents' arguments that minors are not in a position to understand the long-term impacts such procedures could have on their lives, the judge said that, while they may not be, their parents are.",
      "\u201cThus, in considering whether the H.B. 68 ban is reasonable, it is necessary to keep in mind that the law recognizes the maturity, experience, and capacity of parents to make difficult judgments and act in their children\u2019s best interest,\u201d she wrote.",
      "The ACLU called the ruling \u201chistoric.\u201d",
      "\"This win restores the right of trans youth in Ohio to choose vitally important health care, with the support of their families and physicians,\" Freda Levenson, legal director of the ACLU of Ohio, said in a statement. \u201cWe are gratified by the Court\u2019s decision, which soundly rejects this interference of politicians with Ohioans\u2019 bodily autonomy.\u201d",
      "Tuesday's ruling marked the second blow for the legislation.",
      "Republican Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine vetoed the law in December 2023, after touring the state to visit children\u2019s hospitals and talking to families of children with gender dysphoria. He cast his action as thoughtful, limited and \u201cpro-life\u201d \u2014 citing the suicide risks associated with minors who don't get proper treatment for gender dysphoria.",
      "DeWine simultaneously announced plans to move to administratively ban gender-affirming surgeries until a person is 18, and to position the state to better regulate and track gender-affirming treatments in both children and adults. He hoped the move would allay concerns of fellow Republicans at the Ohio Statehouse, but the administration swiftly backed off that plan after transgender adults raised serious concerns about how state regulations could impact their lives and health.",
      "Ohio lawmakers stood their ground on the bill, easily overriding his veto \u2014 making Ohio the 23rd state to ban gender-affirming health care for trans youth.",
      "Republican Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost, a candidate to succeed DeWine next year who serves as the Legislature's lawyer, quickly released a statement saying that he will appeal Tuesday's ruling.",
      "\u201cThis is a no-brainer \u2013 we are appealing that decision and will seek an immediate stay,\" he said. \u201cThere is no way I\u2019ll stop fighting to protect these unprotected children.\u201d",
      "Levenson acknowledged that Tuesday's ruling was likely not the end of the legal dispute, but she said in a statement that her organization remained \u201cfervently committed\u201d to preventing the bill from ever taking effect again.",

      "Members of the Sackler family who own the OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma would hand over the company and up to $7 billion in cash in the latest plan to settle thousands of lawsuits over the toll of opioids",
      "Purdue Pharma asked a bankruptcy judge late Tuesday to consider the latest version of its plan to settle thousands of lawsuits over the toll of the powerful prescription painkiller OxyContin, a deal that would have members of the Sackler family who own the company pay up to $7 billion.",
      "The filing is a milestone in a tumultuous legal saga that has gone on for more than five years.",
      "Under the deal the family members \u2014 estimated in documents from 2020 and 2021 to be worth about $11 billion \u2014 would give up ownership of the company in addition to contributing money over 15 years with the biggest payment up front.",
      "Family members resigned from Purdue's board, stopped receiving money from the company and ceased other involvement before it filed for bankruptcy protection in 2019 as it faced lawsuits from thousands of state and local governments, plus others.",
      "The new entity would be run by a board appointed by state governments, and its mission will be to abate the opioid crisis that has been linked to hundreds of thousands of deaths in the U.S. since OxyContin hit the market in 1996. The first wave of deadly overdoses were tied to OxyContin and other prescription drugs, and subsequent waves have involved first heroin and more recently illicit versions of fentanyl.",
      "This settlement plan was hammered out in months of mediation involving groups that sued Purdue, and nearly all of them are supporting it, according to mediator reports filed in court.",
      "Approval would take at least several more months.",
      "A previous version had bankruptcy court approval but was rejected last year by the U.S. Supreme Court because it protected members of the Sackler family from civil lawsuits even though none of them filed for bankruptcy protection themselves.",
      "Under the new version, plaintiffs will have to opt in to get full shares of the settlement. If they do not, they can still sue Sackler family members, who agreed to put in about $1 billion more than under earlier plans. The Sacklers' cash contribution would depends in part on how many parties join the settlement and on the sale of foreign drug companies. Some of the money they put into the settlement is to be reserved to pay any judgments if they are sued and lose; but if that doesn't happen, it's to go into the main settlement.",
      "Members of the family have been cast as villains and have seen their name removed from art galleries and universities around the world because of their role in the privately held company. They continue to deny any wrongdoing.",
      "Other drugmakers, distribution companies, pharmacy chains and others have already reached opioid lawsuit settlements worth about $50 billion, according to an Associated Press tally. Purdue's, which would also include about $900 million from company coffers, would be among the largest if finalized.",
      "The deals require most of the money be used to fight the opioid crisis.",
      "Purdue's is the only major one that also provides direct money for victims \u2014 potentially more than $850 million total in pools for people who became addicted, their families and babies born in withdrawal. That figure is more than in the previous incarnation.",
      "The deadline to apply for a piece of those funds passed years ago. In earlier versions, individuals were expected to receive between about $3,500 and $48,000. Families were split over the deal.",
      "Purdue would also provide millions of documents to a repository that would make them public. The company has also been producing a low-cost version of naloxone, a drug that reverses overdoses.",

      "Arizona highest court has created a pair of AI-generated avatars to deliver news of all rulings issued by the justices",
      "PHOENIX -- Arizona's highest court has created a pair of AI-generated avatars to deliver news of every ruling issued by the justices, marking what is believed to be the first example in the U.S. of a state court system tapping artificial intelligence to build more human-like characters to connect with the public.",
      "A court in Florida uses an animated chatbot to help visitors navigate its website, but the Arizona Supreme Court is charting new territory with the creation of Victoria and Daniel. Made of pixels, the two avatars have a different job in that they serve as the face of news coming from the court just as a spokesperson made of flesh and blood would do \u2014 but faster.",
      "The use of AI has touched nearly every profession and discipline, growing exponentially in recent years and showing infinite potential when it comes to things as simple as internet searches or as complex as brain surgery. For officials with the Arizona Supreme Court, their venture into AI is rooted in a desire to promote trust and confidence in the judicial system.",
      "There was a protest outside the state Capitol last April and calls for two justices to be booted after the Arizona Supreme Court ruled that a Civil War-era law that banned nearly all abortions, except when a woman\u2019s life is in jeopardy, could be enforced. Emotions flared on both sides of the issue.",
      "When Chief Justice Ann Timmer took over the court last summer, she made public trust a key pillar of her platform. She had already been thinking about ways to reach out to the public using digital media for a few years, and the abortion ruling, among other rulings, helped her to solidify the idea that the court needs to be part of the narrative as people learn about opinions and what they mean.",
      "\u201cWe serve the public better by saying, OK, we\u2019ve issued this decision,\" she said. \"Now, let us help you understand what it is.\u201d",
      "Timmer told The Associated Press earlier this year that if the court had to do the abortion ruling over again, it would have approached the dissemination of information differently. In a Wednesday interview, she said that a news release and avatar video could have helped the public better understand the legal underpinnings of the lengthy decision \u2014 possibly including what it didn't do, which she said some misunderstood.",
      "\u201cWe got a lot of backlash for it and probably deservedly so, in terms of how can we complain that people don\u2019t understand what we did when we didn\u2019t really do enough to give a simplified version,\" she said in the January interview, explaining that people want to know the basis for the court\u2019s decisions and what they can do, such as lobbying state lawmakers for whatever changes in law would support their positions.",
      "Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs signed a repeal of the ban last May, and in November, Arizona voters approved a constitutional amendment expanding abortion access up to the point of fetal viability.",
      "Created with a program called Creatify, Daniel and Victoria in a way bring to life the court's news releases. Videos featuring one or the other are being posted for every ruling by the high court, and may be used for Access to Justice projects, community programs and civics information in the future.",
      "The court has been sending out releases since October to summarize and explain rulings. After seeing success with the releases, it began exploring options to convey that information through video.",
      "The AI-generated avatars were the most efficient way to produce videos and get the information out, said court spokesperson Alberto Rodriguez. Producing a video usually can take hours, he said, but an AI-generated video is ready in about 30 minutes. The court might introduce more AI-generated reporters in the future, Rodriguez said in a news release.",
      "The justice who authors the legal opinion also drafts a news release, the wording of which must be approved by the entire bench. The justice then works with the court's communications team to craft a script for the avatars \u2014 the avatars aren't interpreting original court decisions or opinions, Rodriguez said.",
      "Daniel and Victoria's names and physical appearances were designed to represent a wide cross-section of people, Rodriguez said. He said they aren\u2019t meant to come off as real people and the court emphasizes their AI origins with disclaimers. The court is exploring different emotional deliveries, cadences and pronunciations as well as Spanish translations for the avatars, Rodriguez said.",
      "Mason Kortz, a clinical instructor at the Harvard Law School's Cyberlaw Clinic at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society, described the court's new cyber employees as \"quite realistic.\" While their voices might give them away, he said some people could be fooled into thinking that Daniel and Victoria are real reporters if viewers are only reading the subtitles and looking at the characters' movements and facial expressions.",
      "Kortz also said it would be better for the language of the disclaimer that is in the videos' text description to be featured more prominently.",
      "\u201cYou want to make it as hard as possible for someone to advertently or inadvertently remove the disclaimer,\u201d he said.",
      "Asheley Landrum, associate professor at the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication at Arizona State University, said the avatars feel robotic. She said a format that mimics real dialogue and storytelling might be more engaging than an AI reading of a news release.",
      "\u201cBecause it\u2019s not just about using AI or even creating videos,\u201d she said, \u201cbut about doing so in a way that really resonates with audiences.\u201d",
      "Still, it's fine line. She said engaging characteristics can help to build trust over time but the danger is that content could appear biased.",

      "The lawsuit brought by Parents Defending Education, a national Christian organization, against the Olentangy Local School District in 2023 has captured broad national attention from groups ranging from the American Civil Liberties Union to the conservative Manhattan Institute. Ohio's solicitor general has asked to participate in oral arguments on behalf of 22 U.S. states that have interests in the case.",

      "The district's electronic devices policy \u2014 which applies both on and off school time \u2014 prohibits transmitting \u201cdisruptive\u201d material or material that could be seen as harassing or disparaging other students based on their gender identity or sexual orientation, among other categories.",
      "A separate antidiscrimination policy prohibits students from engaging in \u201cdiscriminatory language\u201d during times when they're under the school's authority. That is defined as \u201cverbal or written comments, jokes, and slurs that are derogatory towards an individual or group based on one or more of the following characteristics: race, color, national origin, sex (including sexual orientation and transgender identity), disability, age, religion, ancestry, or genetic information.\u201d",

      "Parents Defending Education, founded in 2021 amid the culture wars over schools\u2019 teachings on race, diversity and sexuality, argues that the policies compel students and parents who belong to their group to \u201caffirm an idea that gender is fluid\u201d in contradiction of their religious beliefs.",
      "\u201cThese students have views that the District disfavors,\u201d the group wrote in a court filing. \u201cSpecifically, they believe that people are either male or female, that biological sex is immutable, and that sex does not change based on someone\u2019s internal feelings. Accordingly, they \u2018d(o) not want to be forced to \u2018affirm\u2019 that a biologically female classmate is actually a male \u2014 or vice versa \u2014 or that a classmate is \u2019nonbinary' and neither male nor female.\u201d",
      "The group argues that the policies unconstitutionally compel \u201cviewpoint-based\u201d speech by forcing students who believe in only two genders to use pronouns that suggest otherwise. They say that violates the First Amendment's guarantees to free speech and similar protections contained in the 14th Amendment, particularly since students are subject to punishment for violating the policies.",
      "Parents Defending Education further challenges the electronic devices policy for applying outside school hours and off school property. The ACLU has sided with the parents' group on this point, arguing the district's policies are overbroad.",
      "Olentangy Local School District outside Columbus, one of the state's largest districts, maintains the policies protect students against abuse and harassment and asserts that Parents Defending Education represents \u201cChristian, cisgender\u201d students \"seeking dispensation under the free speech clause of the First Amendment to harass other students based on their gender identity.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey are not illegal immigrants subject to deportation. They are not gay soldiers under Don't Ask Don't Tell. They're not African Americans in the Jim Crow south. They've not been systematically oppressed,\" the district's lawyers told the lower court. \"They're members of the majority who want to \u2014 under the guise of the First Amendment \u2014 openly voice their opposition to an historically maligned minority group, transgendered people.\u201d",
      "Olentangy argues that Parents Defending Education has failed to provide evidence of injury \u2014 as the lawsuit was filed before disciplinary action had been brought against any student. The district also says that its policies leave open other options for students who don't wish to use someone's preferred pronouns. That includes calling the person by their first name, using a gender-neutral pronoun or simply not referring to them at all.",
      "The availability of such options, an argument against the policies unconstitutionally compelling students to say certain things, played a role in the three-judge panel's 2-1 ruling in favor of the district last summer.",

      "A new study out Monday finds that even in the most optimistic scenarios, grass-fed beef is no less carbon-intensive than industrial beef",
      "For cattle fattened in fields instead of feedlots, the grass may be greener, but the carbon emissions are not.",
      "A study out Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences finds that even in the most optimistic scenarios, grass-fed beef produces no less planet-warming carbon emissions than industrial beef. The finding calls into question the frequent promotion of grass-fed beef as a more environmentally friendly option. Still, other scientists say grass-fed beef wins out on other factors like animal welfare or local environmental pollution, complicating the choice for conscientious consumers.",
      "\u201cI think that there is a large portion of the population who really do wish their purchasing decisions will reflect their values,\u201d said Gidon Eshel, a research professor of environmental physics at Bard College and one of the study's authors. \u201cBut they are being misled, essentially, by the wrong information.\u201d",
      "When it comes to food, beef contributes by far the most emissions fueling climate change and is one of the most resource- and land-intensive to produce. Yet demand for beef around the world is only expected to grow. And carefully weighing the benefits of grass-fed beef matters because in most parts of the world where beef production is expanding, such as South America, it\u2019s being done by deforesting land that would otherwise store carbon, said Richard Waite of the World Resources Institute.",
      "Experts say this study's finding makes sense because it's less efficient to produce grass-fed cattle than their industrial counterparts. Animals that are fattened up in fields instead of feedlots grow more slowly and don't get as big, so it takes more of them to produce the same amount of meat.",
      "The researchers used a numerical model of the emissions produced across the process of raising beef, then simulated many herds of industrial and grass-fed cattle. It compared differences in how much food they would eat, how much methane and carbon dioxide they would emit and how much meat they would produce. Those differences mirror real-life scenarios; cattle in arid New Mexico and lush northern Michigan have different inputs and outputs.",
      "Eshel and his team also analyzed previous studies that examined how much cattle grazing promotes carbon storage, but found that even in the best-case scenarios, the amount of carbon that grasses could sequester didn\u2019t make up for the emissions of the cattle.",
      "Randy Jackson, a professor of grassland ecology at University of Wisconsin-Madison who was not involved in the study, said he has found similar results in his own research showing that grass-fed beef has higher emissions assuming the same demand. In fact, Eshel's team cited his work. But he worries that the study is too focused on minimizing emissions \u201cwithout concern for the environmental impacts beyond GHG load to the atmosphere,\u201d like biodiversity and soil and water quality, he wrote in an email.",
      "The American Grassfed Association, a nonprofit membership group for producers of grass-fed livestock, did not immediately provide a comment on the study.",
      "Jennifer Schmitt, who studies the sustainability of U.S. agricultural supply chains at the University of Minnesota and also wasn't involved in the study, said she thinks the paper \u201chelps us get a little closer to answering the question of maybe how much beef should we have on the landscape versus plant proteins,\u201d she said.",
      "Schmitt said maybe if beef was scaled back on a large enough scale and if farmers could free up more cropland for other foods that humans eat, the localized environmental benefits of grass-fed cattle could make up for the fact that they come with higher emissions.",
      "It would be harder to convince Eshel, however. He thinks climate change is \u201csecond to none\u201d when it comes to global problems and should be prioritized as such.",
      "\u201cI have a hard time imagining, even, a situation in which it will prove environmentally, genuinely wise, genuinely beneficial, to raise beef,\" Eshel said.",
      "For consumers who truly want to be environmentally conscious, he added, \"don't make beef a habit.\"",

      "While many agencies switched to telework during the COVID-19 pandemic, the FDA began embracing the practice a decade earlier. Most employees had the option to work from home at least two days a week \u2014 flexibility that was seen as a competitive perk for recruiting highly trained experts who can often earn more working in industry.",
      "By 7:30 a.m., many on-campus parking lots were full, with cars parked along side streets, according to employees. Some workers reported waiting up to one hour to clear security checkpoints, and photos viewed by the AP showed lines of employees winding out doorways, along sidewalks and around corners.",

      "When employees did get situated, many shared cramped spaces with people from different divisions and teams, making it difficult to hold calls and meetings. Photos shared with the AP show folding chairs and tables setup in hallways and lobbies.",
      "An FDA spokesman said in an email Monday the agency \u201cis continuing its return-to-office activities to ensure staff remain able to conduct their important public health work.\u201d",
      "All the employees told the AP that they brought their own drinking water Monday. That\u2019s due to a monthslong issue involving Legionella, the bacteria that causes Legionnaires\u2019 disease, which was detected at several FDA buildings. The General Service Administration, which oversees federal buildings, has been working on the issue since last summer.",
      "FDA staff received an email earlier this month that all water is safe to drink, but it did not detail the latest testing results or corrective actions taken.",
      "Anthony Lee, who represents the local chapter of the federal union for FDA employees, said the agency has not granted the group's request for a meeting on the issue.",
      "Asked about the water, one staffer said: \u201cHonestly, none of us have tried it. After months of Legionella warnings, it\u2019s not very inviting.\"",

      "Thirteen people were killed and thousands were sickened when cult members released sarin nerve gas in the capital's subway trains on March 20, 1995. The attack remains one of the most shocking atrocities in Japan, a country known for its low crime rates.",

      "At 8 a.m. during the morning rush, five cult members got on separate train cars on three subway lines converging at Kasumigaseki, Japan\u2019s government center, each dropping bags of sarin on the train floors. They punctured the bags with umbrellas, releasing the gas inside the train cars.",
      "Within minutes, commuters poured out of the trains onto the platforms, rubbing their eyes and gasping for air. Some collapsed. Others fled onto the streets where ambulances and rescue workers in hazmat suits gave first-aid.",
      "Kazumasa Takahashi didn\u2019t know the puddle he was cleaning on the subway car floor was sarin. He collapsed as he removed a bag \u2014 a sacrifice some survivors say saved lives \u2014 and never woke up.",

      "Born Chizuo Matsumoto in 1955, Asahara founded Aum Shinrikyo in 1984. The cult combined Hinduism, Buddhism, Christianity and yoga, and attracted young people disillusioned with materialism. He taught that death could elevate their spirits and justified killing as a virtue.",

A 1994 sarin attack in the central Japanese city of Matsumoto killed eight and injured more than 140 others.",
      "In all, Aum killed 27 people in more than a dozen attacks that culminated in the subway gassing. It was part of a plot by Asahara to hasten Armageddon, envisioning overthrowing the government.",

      "The government has also enacted laws banning sarin production and possession, and restricted the activities of groups linked to mass killings. Police have since established nuclear, biological and chemical weapons units and beefed up training.",
      "Aum\u2019s main successor, Aleph, has ignored a court order to pay 1 billion yen ($6.7 million) in compensation to survivors and bereaved families. The group has allegedly hidden billions of yen of income from yoga and spiritual seminars.",

      "Vucic has accused the protesters of \u201cterrorizing\u201d people in Serbia and of violence, although the anti-graft protests \u2014 which are led by university students \u2014 have been largely peaceful.",
      "The latest rally in Belgrade last weekend was among the biggest ever held in the Balkan country, which has a long record of anti-government demonstrations. The populist authorities have faced accusations of using a sonic cannon against the protesters during the commemorative silence on Saturday evening, which Vucic and other government officials have denied.",
      "Initially, 14 people died and three were injured in the Novi Sad station crash. Belgrade's military hospital, which was treating him, said that Crncevic died due to \u201ccomplex injuries\u201d and \u201censuing complications.\u201d",

      "Mysterious deaths, unexplained noises and late-night apparitions are not the usual fodder of daily tours offered at New Zealand's parliament in Wellington",
      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- A veiled woman burst screaming from an elevator. The small crowd gathered in a basement corridor of New Zealand \u2019s parliament drew back nervously.",
      "Their guide, wearing a trailing, white gown, smiled sweetly. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome to take the elevator,\u201d she said. Nobody did.",
      "Mysterious deaths, unexplained noises and late-night apparitions are not the usual fodder of daily tours offered at the parliament buildings in Wellington. After hours on Thursday, however, guides donned Victorian-era garb to regale visitors with the precinct\u2019s less savory history \u2014 \u201cmostly factual\u201d tales of real-world tragedy and paranormal lore that have grown established among political staffers through decades of colorful retelling.",
      "The history of parliament\u2019s stately gothic library is particularly rich in woe. Constructed in the late 19th century and feared by some of parliament\u2019s night shift security guards and cleaners, it has survived two fires, a flood and being overrun by feral cats.",
      "\u201cThis is your last chance to back out,\u201d Lisa Brand, her face dripping with fake blood, told the group who had arrived for Thursday's tour \u2014 a recent initiative and one embraced by the visitors\u2019 center staff with gusto.",
      "Walking through a cavernous parliamentary atrium, the guide let out a hair-raising scream that echoed up to the open windows of lawmakers\u2019 offices. It explained why the so-called spooky tours are reserved for weeks when parliament is not in session.",
      "Parliament's library is a gloomy and ornate building where stained-glass windows and crystal chandeliers dimly reveal wrought iron bannisters and Venetian d\u00e9cor. Designed by Thomas Turnbull and completed in 1899, it remains in use by staff seeking information or some slightly eerie peace and quiet.",
      "When the visitors arrived Thursday, they were greeted by spectral figures who shrieked as they glided down staircases beneath the portraits of former head librarians and New Zealand prime ministers. Tour guides told a hushed audience that the library was imperiled by a savage storm that struck Wellington in 1968 \u2014 sinking a passenger ferry in the harbor with the deaths of 53 people.",
      "The tempest lashed parliament too, tearing out skylights and prompting librarians to climb onto the roof as they tried to protect the books, according to a guide who sported Victorian garb and dark shadows under her eyes.",
      "\u201cFor mysterious and unknown reasons they did this in their underwear,\u201d she told the visitors. \u201cThere seems to be a history of people losing their pants here in this parliament.\u201d",
      "The guide added, with relish: \u201cI haven\u2019t even started on the politicians.\u201d",
      "Eventually the tour turned to lawmakers, too. Well-known in New Zealand is the story of William Larnach, a politician who in 1898 was found dead in a room at parliament with a revolver in his hand while experiencing financial and family strife.",
      "Larnach\u2019s ghost, some claim, remains in the building. His skull, however, was stolen \u2014 and in 1972 was rediscovered in a college student\u2019s bedroom.",
      "Another spirit reported to linger is that of the first full-time librarian, Ewen McColl, whose death was partly attributed by some official sources to overwork.",
      "As the tour descended to the building's basement, the ceilings grew low and the corridors narrow. Frantic banging resounded from an apparently locked room.",
      "The subterranean floors are home to an archive containing the historical and esoteric. It's also the site of some of the building\u2019s strangest reported occurrences, tour guides said.",
      "Urban legends passed down by staff include stories of hands reaching out from the stacks, songs emanating from empty bathrooms, the apparition of a ghostly woman in a mirror, and locked doors swinging open. More earthly horrors included a cat, and subsequent flea, infestation in 1977.",
      "After one last fright, visitors emerged slightly shaken into Parliament\u2019s near-empty lobby as darkness fell. The tour was \u201ca bit spookier than I expected,\u201d said Holly Masters, who had last visited parliament as a child. \u201cThere was quite a few deaths here that I did not expect to find out about.\u201d",
      "Another visitor, Sally Giles, said she was fascinated to learn the stories of those who worked and died in the precinct \u201cand what they\u2019ve left behind and how that surfaces every now and then.\u201d",
      "The tour guides would return to their regular, authorized scripts on Friday\u2019s tours \u2014 but some said the building's spooky side was never far away.",
      "\u201cI always open up the tour route in the morning,\u201d said Brand, the team leader. \u201cIt does always feel a bit tingly when you\u2019re one of the first people walking around.\u201d",

      "Frustration runs high in sprawling camps of Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh after U.S. President Donald Trump ordered the freeze on American foreign aid",
      "COX\u2019S BAZAR, Bangladesh -- They first faced persecution in their country. Then a deadly crackdown by Myanmar\u2019s army sent hundreds of thousands fleeing into Bangladesh. Driven from their homes, many of the Rohingya have since lived in refugee settlements entirely dependent on humanitarian assistance.",
      "That assistance \u2014 largely led by the United States \u2014 is at the risk of being cut, following U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s decree to freeze most of his country\u2019s foreign aid. For more than 1 million Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh it means they could be left with too little food and money for survival.",
      "No cuts have happened yet. But the U.N. World Food Program said if it is not able to raise funds, it will have no option but to halve food rations to $6 a month from previous $12.50 in the country's southern coastal district of Cox\u2019s Bazar, where the Rohingya live in sprawling camps.",
      "It was not immediately clear if the WFP\u2019s decision was directly related to the Trump administration\u2019s action, but during a recent visit to the refugee camps, U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres criticized the U.S. and other countries in Europe for halting or reducing their aid budgets.",
      "To be sure, a large portion of funds needed for supporting Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh has come from the U.S. Agency for International Development, but the country\u2019s government and dozens of aid organizations also look after their daily needs. Yet, any drop in humanitarian aid could have extreme impact on the lives of Rohingya refugees.",
      "\u201cCox\u2019s Bazar is ground zero for the impact of budget cuts on people in desperate need,\u201d Guterres said last week during his visit to the camps. He said that drastic cuts in humanitarian aid are \u201ca crime\u201d and urged the international community to continue to support the Rohingya refugees.",
      "Aid workers have warned that aid cuts \u2014 if they become effective in April \u2014 will devastate the lives of the refugees, especially women and children. \u201cWe will have no choice but to reduce rations starting in April,\" said WFP spokesperson Kun Li.",
      "Before being forced from Myanmar, farmer Mahabub Alam was an influential figure in his community, serving as the chairman of a local government body in a village in western Rakhine state. Today, the 56-year-old says, he is broke and his nine-member family solely depends on aid, because like other refugees he is not formally allowed to work outside the refugee camps in Cox\u2019s Bazar.",
      "Alam has been worried, even shocked, since he first heard that food rations could be cut to half from next month.",
      "\u201cWe will not be able to live on that ($6 a month), and we will die here,\u201d said Alam, who has been living in the camp since 2017, after fleeing the Myanmar military's brutal attacks on the Rohingya.",
      "The $6 allowance per month will only be sufficient for minimum quantities of rations, Alam said. According to UNICEF, more than 15% of children in the camps are acutely malnourished.",
      "\u201cEarlier, we used to be able to eat something, have medications, and fish, but now we won\u2019t be able to have any of them,\u201d he said.",
      "Alam\u2019s worries are not only limited to having access to food and financial support. He said aid cuts could also fuel unrest in the camps, where groups among the refugees have sometimes clashed over essentials and to establish supremacy.",
      "\u201cThere will be an increase in number of thieves and robbers here. People will get kidnapped, things will be stolen, and unrest will increase. The situation will worsen,\u201d Alam said.",
      "He said he'd rather go back to Myanmar \u2014 but only if there are guarantees for safety. In reality, returning is not option for the refugees, as military-ruled Myanmar is mired in a civil war.",
      "The aid cuts \u2014 if they do come \u2014 could also cause major concern for camp residents who need money for medical treatment.",
      "\u201cIt will be very difficult for us to live,\u201d said Tomida Khatun, 46, who arrived to Cox's Bazar with her family in 2017. \u201cWe have diseases, high blood pressure and diabetes. We need money for treatment, but we will not have any.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are worried about how we are going to feed our children. How are we going to send them to school?\" Khatun said.",
      "The monthly food ration of $12.50 for each member of her family is already stretched to the limit, she said, and the funding shortfall could only makes things worse.",

The U.S. accuses China of doing too little to stop the export of precursor materials for fentanyl, a highly potent opiate blamed for tens of thousands of deaths in the U.S.",
      "China responded with a report detailing its efforts to control the illegal trade in fentanyl, specifically the ingredients for the opioid that are made in China, and the foreign minister blasted the U.S. for responding to Beijing\u2019s goodwill with tariffs.",
      "The report said that China and the U.S. have held multiple high-level meetings since early last year to promote cooperation, and that its Narcotics Control Bureau holds regular exchanges with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency.",
      "China is committed to cooperation, the report said, \u201cbut firmly opposes the U.S. imposition of unlawful sanctions and unreasonable pressure on China on the pretext of responding to fentanyl-related issues.\u201d",

      "The 30-year-old guitarist got his back, arms and legs tattooed to \u201clook cool\u201d when he was performing in a band. But these days Septura has a newfound zeal for Islam, including the conviction that Muslims should not alter the body that God gave them.",

      "Septura is among a growing number of people in Indonesia's capital who have signed up for free tattoo removal services offered by Amil Zakat National Agency, an Islamic charity organization, during Ramadan to give practicing Muslims an opportunity to \u201crepent.\"",
      "Launched in 2019, the tattoo removal program is now held every Ramadan, a month of fasting, increased worship, religious reflection and good deeds. Some 700 people have signed up for the services this year, and in total nearly 3,000 people have taken part.",
      "\u201cWe want to pave the way for people who want to hijrah (to move closer to God), including those who want to remove their tattoos\u201d said Mohammad Asep Wahyudi, a coordinator of the event.

      "Thousands of people have gathered outside Istanbul\u2019s city hall for a second consecutive night to rally against the arrest of the city\u2019s popular mayor",
      "ISTANBUL -- Thousands of people gathered at Istanbul\u2019s city hall for a second night Thursday to rally against the arrest of the city\u2019s mayor, which many see as a politically driven attempt to remove a key rival of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan from the next presidential race.",
      "Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu was arrested in a dawn raid on his residence on Wednesday over alleged corruption and terror links, escalating a crackdown on opposition figures and dissenting voices. Several other prominent figures, including two district mayors, were also detained.",
      "The detention of the popular opposition leader deepened concerns over democracy and sparked protests in Istanbul and elsewhere, despite road closures and a four-day ban on demonstrations in the city.",
      "It also caused a shockwave in the financial market, triggering temporary halts in trading on Wednesday to prevent panic selling.",
      "Addressing the rally outside city hall, Ozgur Ozel, the leader of mayor\u2019s Republican People\u2019s Party, or CHP, called on supporters to take to the streets to claim their rights without resorting to violence. \u201cYes, I am calling the people to the streets,\u201d he said.",
      "Mansur Yavas, the mayor of the capital Ankara and another popular opposition figure, joined the rally, calling on all opposition parties to join forces against \u201cinjustices.\u201d",
      "Police blocked a group of youths who attempted to breach a barricade in an effort to march toward Taksim, Istanbul's central square and used pepper spray to break them up. In Ankara, police deployed tear gas and water cannons to disperse a protest at the city's prestigious Middle East Technical University. Protests also broke out in the cities of Adana and Izmir.",
      "The Interior Ministry said six police officers were injured in scuffles with demonstrators in Istanbul.",
      "Critics see the crackdown as an effort by Erdogan to extend his more then two-decade rule following significant losses by the ruling party in local elections last year. Government officials reject claims that legal actions against opposition figures are politically motivated and insist that the courts operate independently.",
      "Omer Celik, the spokesman of Erdogan's ruling Justice and Development Party, disputed allegations by the opposition that the detentions were government-orchestrated and urged respect for the judicial process.",
      "\u201cWhat a politician should do is to follow the judicial process,\u201d Celik told journalists. \u201cNone of us have any information about the content of the (criminal) file.\u201d",
      "He also rejected accusations leveled by the main opposition Republican People's Party, or CHP, that the mayor\u2019s arrest amounted to a \u201ccoup\u201d saying, \u201cThe name of our party, our president can only be associated with democracy \u2014 on the opposite side of a coup.\u201d",
      "In his first comments on the mayor's detention, Erdogan accused the opposition of failing to respond to the allegations of corruption with evidence or legal arguments.",
      "\"The opposition never responds to the allegations brought forward by the judiciary,\" Erdogan said. \u201cInstead, they confine the matter to political slogans, resorting to the easy way of provoking their base and deceiving the public.\u201d",
      "Earlier, Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said authorities had detained dozens of people for sharing \u201cprovocative\u201d social media content related to the mayor's detention.",
      "The authorities identified 261 social media accounts that shared posts that allegedly incited public hatred or crime, including 62 that are run by people based abroad, Yerlikaya wrote on X. At least 37 of the suspected owners were detained and efforts to detain other suspects were continuing.",
      "Imamoglu's arrest came just days before he was expected to be nominated as the opposition Republican People\u2019s Party's presidential candidate in a primary scheduled for Sunday. The party\u2019s leader has said the primary will go ahead as planned.",
      "German Chancellor Olaf Scholz expressed concern over the mayor\u2019s detention, saying it was a \u201cvery, very bad sign\u201d for Turkey\u2019s relations with the European Union.",
      "Scholz said it was \u201cdepressing for democracy in Turkey, but certainly also depressing for the relationship between Europe and Turkey.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe can only call for this to end immediately and for opposition and government to stand in competition with each other, and not the opposition being brought to court,\u201d he said.",
      "Prosecutors accused Imamoglu of exploiting his position for financial gain, including the improper allocation of government contracts.",
      "In a separate investigation, prosecutors also accuse Imamoglu of aiding the outlawed Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or PKK, by allegedly forming an alliance with Kurdish groups for the Istanbul municipal elections. The PKK, behind a decades-long insurgency in Turkey, is designated a terrorist organization by Ankara, Washington and other allies.",
      "It was not clear when authorities would begin questioning the mayor, who can be detained without charges for up to four days. Analysts say Imamoglu could be removed from office and replaced by a \u201ctrustee mayor\u201d if he is formally charged with links to the PKK.",
      "Before his detention, Imamoglu already faced multiple criminal cases that could result in prison sentences and a political ban. He is also appealing a 2022 conviction for insulting members of Turkey\u2019s Supreme Electoral Council, a case that could result in a political ban.",
      "This week, a university nullified his diploma, citing alleged irregularities in his 1990 transfer from a private university in northern Cyprus to its business faculty, a decision Imamoglu said he would challenge. The decision effectively bars him from running for president, since the position requires candidates to be university graduates.",
      "Imamoglu was elected mayor of Turkey\u2019s largest city in March 2019, a historic blow to Erdogan and the president\u2019s Justice and Development Party, which had controlled Istanbul for a quarter-century. Erdogan's party pushed to void the municipal election results in the city of 16 million, alleging irregularities.",
      "The challenge resulted in a repeat of the election a few months later, which Imamoglu also won. The mayor retained his seat following local elections last year, during which his party made significant gains against Erdogan\u2019s governing party.",

      "GOMA, Congo -- Rwanda-backed M23 rebels entered the strategic town of Walikale in eastern Congo late Wednesday, according to residents and civil society leaders, a day after the Congolese and Rwandan presidents called for an immediate ceasefire.",
      "\u201cThe information is confirmed: the rebels are visible at the monument and at the Bakusu group office,\" Prince Kihangi, a former provincial deputy elected for the Walikale territory told The Associated Press over the phone, referring to locations in the centre of Walikale. \"This confirms the presence of the M23 in the territorial capital.\"",
      "By taking control of Walikale, the M23 rebels seized a road linking four provinces in the east of the country: North Kivu, South Kivu, Tshopo and Maniema, cutting off Congolese army's positions.",
      "Heavy artillery fire could be heard throughout the day but ceased in the evening, giving way to sporadic gunfire, Fiston Misona, a civil society activist in Walikale, told the AP over the phone.",
      "\u201cOur Congolese army is no longer fighting,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s as if we were being sacrificed.\u201d",
      "There was no immediate comment from the M23 or the Congolese government.",
      "The escalation in fighting comes a day after the presidents of Congo and Rwanda held unexpected talks in Qatar and called for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire.",
      "The meeting followed a failed attempt to bring Congo\u2019s government and M23 leaders together for ceasefire negotiations on Tuesday. The rebels pulled out Monday after the European Union announced sanctions on rebel leaders.",
      "The decades-long conflict in eastern Congo escalated in January when the Rwanda-backed rebels advanced and seized the strategic city of Goma, followed by Bukavu in February.",
      "M23 is one of about 100 armed groups that have been vying for a foothold in mineral-rich eastern Congo near the border with Rwanda, in a conflict that has created one of the world\u2019s most significant humanitarian crises. More than 7 million people have been displaced.",
      "The rebels are supported by about 4,000 troops from neighboring Rwanda, according to U.N. experts, and at times have vowed to march as far as Congo\u2019s capital, Kinshasa, about 1,600 kilometers (1,000 miles) to the east.",
      "The U.N. Human Rights Council last month launched a commission to investigate atrocities, including allegations of rape and killing akin to \u201csummary executions\u201d by both sides.",
      "The Walikale area is home to the largest tin deposits in Congo and to several significant gold mines. The Bisie tin mine, around 60 kilometers (35 miles) northwest of the town, accounts for the majority of tin exports from North Kivu province. Last week, its operator Alphamin Resources said it was temporarily halting mining operations due to the rebels' advance.",

      "A preliminary report into why a Delta Air Lines jet burst into flames and flipped upside down as it tried to land in Toronto has been released",
      "TORONTO -- The alert system on a Delta Air Lines jet that flipped upside down and burst into flames as it tried to land in Toronto last month indicated a high rate of descent less than three seconds before touchdown, a preliminary report said Thursday.",
      "The Transportation Safety Board of Canada, which issued the report, continues to investigate the Feb. 17 crash-landing in which 21 people were hospitalized.",
      "All 76 passengers and four crew members survived when the Delta plane arriving from Minneapolis burst into flames after flipping over and skidding on the tarmac.",
      "The TSB of Canada report says that when the plane\u2019s ground proximity warning system sounded 2.6 seconds before touchdown, the airspeed was 136 knots, or approximately 250 kph (155 mph). It says the plane\u2019s landing gear folded into the retracted position at touchdown and the wing detached from the fuselage, releasing a cloud of jet fuel, which caught fire as the plane slid along the runway.",
      "The fuselage rolled upside down and a large portion of the tail came off in the process, the report says.",
      "\u201cAccidents and incidents rarely stem from a single cause,\u201d TSB chair Yoan Marier said in a video statement Thursday. \u201cThey\u2019re often the result of multiple complex, interconnected factors, many extending beyond the aircraft and its operation to wider systemic issues.\u201d",
      "The crew and passengers started evacuating once the plane came to a stop, the report says, adding that some of the passengers were injured when they unbuckled their seatbelts and fell to the ceiling.",
      "The TSB says it\u2019s not aware of any issues with the seatbelts or seats during the incident.",
      "The cockpit door was jammed shut, forcing pilots to escape through the emergency hatch on the ceiling of the cockpit after everyone else was out, the report says.",
      "Emergency response personnel then went into the fuselage, and there was an explosion outside the plane near the left wing root shortly afterward, the TSB says. The cause of the explosion has not yet been determined.",
      "So far, the investigation has found no pre-existing problems with the flight controls, though some components were damaged in the crash, the board said.",
      "The safety board says its ongoing investigation is focusing on several key areas, including metallurgical examination of the wing structure, landing techniques, pilot training and the passenger evacuation process.",
      "All of those who were hospitalized were released within days of the crash.",
      "At least two lawsuits have been filed in the United States, and a law firm in Canada has said that it\u2019s been retained by several passengers.",
      "Delta declined to comment on the preliminary report.",
      "\u201cWe remain fully engaged as participants in the investigation led by the Transportation Safety Board of Canada. Out of respect for the integrity of this work that will continue through their final report, Endeavor Air and Delta will refrain from comment,\u201d the airline said.",

      "Turkey's opposition party has urged supporters to take to the streets for peaceful demonstrations against the arrest of Istanbul\u2019s mayor and top rival to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan",
      "ISTANBUL -- The leader of Turkey\u2019s main opposition on Friday renewed a call on supporters to take to the streets for peaceful demonstrations against the arrest of Istanbul\u2019s mayor and top rival to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, even as authorities widened a ban on protests and criticized the call as irresponsible.",
      "Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu was arrested in a dawn raid on his residence on Wednesday over alleged corruption and terror links, escalating a crackdown on opposition figures and dissenting voices. Several other prominent figures, including two district mayors, were also detained.",
      "Many view the arrest as a politically driven attempt to remove a popular opposition figure and key challenger to Erdogan from the next presidential race, currently scheduled for 2028. Government officials reject claims that legal actions against opposition figures are politically motivated and insist that the courts operate independently.",
      "Since Imamoglu\u2019s arrest, thousands of people have gathered at Istanbul\u2019s city hall for night-time rallies, and clashes have erupted between demonstrators and police in Istanbul, the capital, Ankara, and Turkey\u2019s third largest city, Izmir.",
      "The most violent clash took place at Ankara\u2019s Middle East Technical University, where police deployed tear gas and water cannons to disperse the demonstration and students claimed rubber bullets were used. The government has denied the use of the bullets.",
      "On Friday, authorities in Ankara and Izmir announced a five-day prohibition on demonstrations, following a similar ban imposed earlier by the Istanbul governor's office. The bans came after the country\u2019s justice minister acknowledged people\u2019s right to demonstrate but said street protests amid ongoing judicial investigations were unacceptable.",
      "Still, Ozgur Ozel, the chairman of the Republican People\u2019s Party, CHP, made a fresh appeal for people to gather and demonstrate.",
      "\u201cI invite tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, and millions to peacefully demonstrate, express our democratic reaction, and exercise our constitutional rights,\u201d he said.",
      "Ozel said: \u201cTo those who say that calling people to the streets is irresponsible, I say this: We are not the ones filling these streets and squares. It is your lawlessness and injustices that have brought people out.\u201d",
      "Imamoglu\u2019s arrest came just days before he was expected to be nominated as the opposition Republican People\u2019s Party\u2019s presidential candidate in a primary on Sunday. Ozel has said the primary, where some 1.5 million delegates can vote, will go ahead as planned.",
      "The CHP has also urged citizens to participate in a symbolic election on Sunday - through ballot boxes to be set up across Turkey - to show solidarity with Imamoglu.",
      "It was not clear when authorities would begin questioning the mayor, who can be detained without charges for up to four days. Analysts say Imamoglu could be removed from office and replaced by a \u201ctrustee mayor\u201d if he is formally charged with links to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, which is listed as a terrorist organization by Turkey and its Western allies.",

      "French officials say a French citizen imprisoned in Iran for over 880 days has been freed",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- A French citizen imprisoned in Iran for over 880 days has been freed, French officials said Thursday.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron wrote online that French citizen Olivier Grondeau had been freed. He offered no immediate details of what led to Grondeau\u2019s release, though it came on Nowruz, the Persian New Year, when Iran has released prisoners in the past.",
      "Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot, France's minister for Europe and foreign affairs, posted a picture online of Grondeau smiling aboard what appeared to be a private jet. On his lap appeared to be a picture of the pop star Britney Spears, something the official did not acknowledge in welcoming Grondeau's release.",
      "\u201cWe will tirelessly continue our efforts to ensure that all our compatriots still held hostage, including C\u00e9cile Kohler and Jacques Paris, are in turn released,\u201d Barrot wrote. Macron also raised the case of the other two French nationals held in Iran.",
      "The Iranian government did not immediately acknowledge Grondeau\u2019s release. Such releases of Westerners in Iran typically come in exchange for something. Early this week, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmail Baghaei said that France had arrested an Iranian women who supported Palestinians, but said Tehran was still trying to gather more details about her case.",

      "CAPE TOWN, South Africa -- The United States Embassy in South Africa said Thursday it received a list of more than 67,000 people interested in refugee status in the U.S. under President Donald Trump's plan to relocate members of a white minority group he claims are victims of racial discrimination by their Black-led government.",
      "The list was given to the embassy by the South African Chamber of Commerce in the U.S., which said it became a point of contact for white South Africans asking about the program announced by the Trump administration last month. The chamber said the list does not constitute official applications.",
      "Trump issued an executive order on Feb. 7 cutting U.S. funding to South Africa and citing \u201cgovernment actions fueling disproportionate violence against racially disfavored landowners.\u201d",
      "Trump's executive order specifically referred to Afrikaners, a white minority group who are descendants of mainly Dutch and French colonial settlers who first came to South Africa in the 17th century. The order directed Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem to prioritize humanitarian relief to Afrikaners who are victims of \u201cunjust racial discrimination\u201d and resettle them in the U.S. under the refugee program.",
      "There are approximately 2.7 million Afrikaners in South Africa, which has a population of 62 million. Trump\u2019s decision to offer some white South Africans refugee status went against his larger policy to halt the U.S. refugee resettlement program.",
      "The South African government has said that Trump's allegations that it is targeting Afrikaners through a land expropriation law are inaccurate and largely driven by misinformation. Trump has posted on his Truth Social platform that Afrikaners were having their farmland seized, when no land has been taken under the new law.",
      "The executive order also criticized South Africa's foreign policy, specifically its decision to accuse Israel of genocide against Palestinians in Gaza in a case at the United Nations' top court. The Trump administration has accused South Africa of supporting the Palestinian militant group Hamas and Iran and taking an anti-American stance. The U.S. has also expelled the South African ambassador, accusing him of being anti-America and anti-Trump.",
      "An official at the U.S. Embassy in the South African capital, Pretoria, confirmed receipt of the list of names from the South African Chamber of Commerce in the U.S. but gave no more detail.",
      "Neil Diamond, the president of the chamber, said the list contains 67,042 names. Most were people between 25 and 45 years old and have children.",
      "He told the Newzroom Afrika television channel that his organization had been inundated with requests for more information since Trump's order and had contacted the State Department and the embassy in Pretoria \u201cto indicate that we would like them to make a channel available for South Africans that would like to get more information and register for refugee status.\"",
      "\u201cThat cannot be the responsibility of the chamber,\u201d he said.",
      "Diamond said only U.S. authorities could officially register applications for resettlement in the U.S. The U.S. Embassy in South Africa said it is awaiting further instructions on the implementation of Trump's order.",

      "Most of these programs have been stopped. The USAID staffers who oversaw them have been placed on administrative leave and told not to work, as they face the threat of termination.",

      "JAKARTA, Indonesia -- Indonesia\u2019s Parliament unanimously voted to pass a controversial revision of its military law on Thursday that will allow military officers to serve in more government posts without resigning from the armed forces, despite growing opposition from pro-democracy and rights groups who see it as a threat to the country\u2019s young democracy.",
      "In a plenary session, all eight political parties represented in Parliament backed the bill. The House of Representatives is largely controlled by parties supporting President Prabowo Subianto, a former army general with ties to the country\u2019s dictatorial past.",
      "Currently, active military officers can only serve in ministries or state institutions related to security, defense or intelligence under a landmark 2004 law that reduced the military\u2019s role in civil affairs.",
      "The amendment to the 2004 Law on the Indonesian Armed Forces introduces several changes that aim to broaden the military's role beyond defense.",
      "Once in force, the new law will allow active officers to take civilian positions without having to retire or resign from service in four more bodies, including the Attorney General\u2019s Office, the Supreme Court and the Coordinating Ministry for Political and Security Affairs.",
      "Under current law, military personnel are permitted to serve in only 10 ministries and state institutions, including the Ministry of Defense, the National Intelligence Agency and the Search and Rescue Agency. But that number will now be expanded to 14 for non-combat military functions.",
      "A new clause also grants the president the authority to appoint military personnel to other ministries as needed, according to the draft.",
      "The revision has raised concerns among pro-democracy activists and students who fear that expanding the military in civilian roles would restore the \u201cdual function\u201d of the armed services that they had in the era under the dictator Suharto.",
      "At that time, seats in the legislature were reserved for the military, and officers occupied thousands of civilian roles from district chiefs to Cabinet ministers. The dual-function system effectively turned the armed forces into a tool for Suharto when he later became president to crush his political opponents.",
      "Al Araf, the director of Indonesian rights group Imparsial, said Thursday the new law is inconsistent with the spirit of the reforms that followed the end of more than three decades of rule by Suharto in 1998 and returned the military to the barracks.",
      "\u201cThe move has the potential to restore the authoritarian system,\u201d Araf said.",
      "Another major criticisms of the law is the way it has been discussed: behind closed doors, with little public input and in a fast-tracked process.",
      "The latest draft was introduced less than a month ago, following a letter to the House from Subianto endorsing the bill. Pro-democracy activists discovered that lawmakers and government officials met in secret to discuss draft revisions at a five-star hotel in South Jakarta on March 15.",
      "Dominique Nicky Fahrizal, a researcher at Indonesia\u2019s Centre for Strategic and International Studies, said Thursday the way in which the law was drafted could prompt backlash.",

      "In a speech after the parliament passed the bill into law, he said the amendments were necessary because the geopolitical changes and global technology require the military to transform \u201cto face conventional and non-conventional conflicts.\u201d",

      "They were among more than 400 Palestinians, most of them women and children, killed when Israel launched a surprise bombardment across the Gaza Strip, according to the territory\u2019s Health Ministry. Israel said it struck Hamas targets to force the militant group to free hostages and relinquish control of Gaza.",

      "Dozens of independent pharmacies have shuttered in Alabama over the last two years, according to the Alabama Independent Pharmacy Alliance. Pharmacists said that is because of financial pressures, in part, because it can often cost more to dispense a drug than they are reimbursed by pharmacy benefit managers.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re losing almost one drugstore per week going out of business because they are paid such a small amount of money from the PBM industry to fill prescriptions for their patients at their drugstore,\u201d Sen. Billy Beasley, a Democratic senator and retired pharmacist, said.",
      "Alabama is one of several states considering new regulations on pharmacy benefit managers, the middlemen between health insurance companies, drug companies and pharmacies. The Alabama Senate voted 32-0 Thursday to advance legislation to require minimum reimbursement rates to community pharmacists. The bill now moves to the Alabama House of Representatives.",
      "Legislation seeking regulations on the benefit managers have also been proposed in Mississippi, Arkansas and other states. Both large retail chains and independent pharmacists have closed stores across the country as drugstores face reimbursement issues, rising costs and other challenges.",
      "Pharmacy benefit managers leverage purchasing power with drug companies with the goal of driving down drug costs for consumers. However, independent pharmacists say the business practices of benefit managers cause them to lose money on about 20% of prescriptions.",
      "\u201cThe biggest issue is we\u2019re not getting paid what it actually cost to fill a prescription, including labor,\u201d Trent McLemore, a pharmacist with Star Discount Pharmacy.",
      "The Alabama bill would require that PBMs reimburse community pharmacies at the Alabama Medicaid Agency reimbursement rate. It would also prohibit the practice of \u201cspread pricing\u201d where a benefits manager charges health plans more for drugs than they pay pharmacies.",
      "Groups opposed to the bill have said it would effectively put a new $10.64 fee on prescriptions under the requirement to match state Medicaid rates, which include a $10.64 dispensing fee. That fee, they argued, will eventually get passed down to consumers and businesses.",
      "Helena Duncan, president of the Business Council of Alabama, told a legislative committee on Wednesday that small businesses, which might already be struggling to provide insurance to their workers, will have to either absorb the increased cost or pass it along to employees through premium increases.",
      "\u201cShifting the financial burdens from pharmacies to the Alabama employers is fundamentally unfair,\u201d Duncan told a legislative committee on Wednesday.",

    "story": [
      "Turkey's opposition party has urged supporters to take to the streets for peaceful demonstrations against the arrest of Istanbul\u2019s mayor and top rival to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan",
      "ISTANBUL -- The leader of Turkey\u2019s main opposition on Friday renewed a call on supporters to take to the streets for peaceful demonstrations against the arrest of Istanbul\u2019s mayor and top rival to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, even as authorities widened a ban on protests and criticized the appeal as irresponsible.",
      "Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu was arrested in a dawn raid on his residence on Wednesday over alleged corruption and terror links, escalating a crackdown on opposition figures and dissenting voices. Several other prominent figures, including two district mayors, were also detained.",
      "Many view the arrest as a politically driven attempt to remove a popular opposition figure and key challenger to Erdogan from the next presidential race, currently scheduled for 2028. Government officials reject accusations that legal actions against opposition figures are politically motivated and insist that Turkey's courts operate independently.",
      "Cumhuriyet newspaper and other media reported that police began questioning Imamoglu on Friday afternoon. The mayor can be detained without charges for up to four days.",
      "Erdogan said that the government wouldn't tolerate street protests and accused the opposition party of being associated with corruption, marginal groups and terrorist organizations.",
      "\u201cWe see that an anti-corruption operation in Istanbul is being used as an excuse to stir unrest in our streets. I want it to be known that we will not allow a handful of opportunists to bring unrest to Turkey just to protect their plundering schemes,\u201d Erdogan said.",
      "\u201cPointing to the streets instead of courtrooms to defend theft, plunder, lawlessness and fraud is a grave irresponsibility,\u201d Erdogan said. \u201cJust as we have not surrendered to street terrorism until now, we will not bow to vandalism in the future either.\u201d",
      "Since Imamoglu\u2019s arrest, thousands of people have gathered at Istanbul\u2019s city hall for nighttime rallies, and clashes have erupted between demonstrators and police in Istanbul, Turkish capital Ankara and Turkey\u2019s third-largest city, Izmir.",
      "The most violent clash took place at Ankara\u2019s Middle East Technical University late Thursday, when police deployed tear gas and water cannons to disperse the demonstration. Students said that rubber bullets were used, but the government has denied that.",
      "The Interior Ministry said that more than 50 people were detained, and 16 police officers were injured, following the protests.",
      "On Friday, authorities in Ankara and Izmir announced a five-day prohibition on demonstrations, following a similar ban imposed earlier by the Istanbul governor's office. The bans came after the country\u2019s justice minister acknowledged people\u2019s right to demonstrate, but said that street protests amid ongoing judicial investigations were unacceptable.",
      "Still, Ozgur Ozel, the chairman of the Republican People\u2019s Party, CHP, made a new appeal for people to gather and demonstrate.",
      "\u201cI invite tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, and millions to peacefully demonstrate, express our democratic reaction, and exercise our constitutional rights,\u201d he said.",
      "Ozel said: \u201cTo those who say that calling people to the streets is irresponsible, I say this: We are not the ones filling these streets and squares. It is your lawlessness and injustices that have brought people out.\u201d",
      "Imamoglu\u2019s arrest came just days before he was expected to be nominated as the opposition Republican People\u2019s Party\u2019s presidential candidate in a primary on Sunday. Ozel has said that the primary, where around 1.5 million delegates can vote, will go ahead as planned.",
      "The CHP has also urged citizens to participate in a symbolic election on Sunday \u2014 through ballot boxes to be set up across Turkey \u2014 to show solidarity with Imamoglu.",
      "Analysts say Imamoglu could be removed from office and replaced by a \u201ctrustee mayor,\u201d if he is formally charged with links to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or PKK, which is listed as a terrorist organization by Turkey and its Western allies.",
      "Meanwhile, Ozel announced that the CHP has decided to hold an extraordinary party congress on April 6, to thwart an alleged attempt by the authorities to appoint a \u201ctrustee chairman\u201d to lead the party. The decision came amid speculation that the authorities may be seeking to annul the party\u2019s last congress held in 2023 over alleged vote-buying and other irregularities, and appoint a handpicked leader.",
      "On Friday, the Borsa Istanbul's benchmark index dropped by around 7%, prompting temporary trading suspensions aimed at preventing panic-driven sell-offs.",

      "A North Dakota jury has found Greenpeace must pay hundreds of millions of dollars to a pipeline company in connection with protests against the Dakota Access oil pipeline",
      "A North Dakota jury on Wednesday found Greenpeace must pay hundreds of millions of dollars to a pipeline company in connection with protests against the Dakota Access oil pipeline.",
      "The jury found Greenpeace liable for defamation and other claims and awarded Dallas-based Energy Transfer and subsidiary Dakota Access more than $650 million in damages.",
      "The lawsuit accused Netherlands-based Greenpeace International, Greenpeace USA and funding arm Greenpeace Fund Inc. of defamation, trespass, nuisance, civil conspiracy and other acts.",
      "Greenpeace said earlier that a large award to the pipeline company would threaten to bankrupt the environmental group. Following the nine-person jury\u2019s verdict, Greenpeace\u2019s senior legal adviser said the organization's work \u201cis never going to stop.\u201d",
      "The independent global campaigning network has been fighting for a wide array of environmental issues for more than half a century and has a long history of contentious legal battles.",
      "Here are some things to know:",
      "Environmental activists founded the group in Vancouver, Canada, in 1971.",
      "The network's first action was to work to stop more nuclear weapons tests on Amchitka Island in the Aleutian island chain in southwest Alaska. They took a ship toward the island to \u201cbear witness,\" which is a Quaker protest tradition, but were intercepted by the U.S. Navy, according to the Greenpeace website.",
      "The U.S. later opted to abandon their nuclear testing grounds on the island, marking Greenpeace's first major victory.",
      "During initial work to stop the nuclear weapons tests on Amchitka, Canadian ecologist Bill Darnell was leaving one of the group's meetings when someone held up two fingers and said \u201cpeace!\u201d according to Greenpeace\u2019s website.",
      "Darnell, who is considered a founding member of Greenpeace, replied: \u201cLet\u2019s make it a Green Peace.\u201d",
      "The name was condensed into one word so it could fit on buttons for the group's first fundraiser.",
      "Greenpeace describes itself as the largest environmental campaigning organization in the world. It is made up of dozens of independent national or regional organizations in more than 55 countries, according to its website.",
      "Its work to preserve and restore valuable ecosystems and push back on fossil fuel corporations is centered on nonviolent action. Its protests have ranged from efforts to stop Shell from drilling for oil in the Alaskan Arctic to demonstrations to put an end to France's atmospheric tests in the South Pacific to campaigns to conserve Canada's coastal rainforest.",
      "Greenpeace and its activists have also been the target of charges and lawsuits, including in 2023 when four activists were arrested for scaling the country estate of former U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and draping it in black fabric to protest his plan to expand oil and gas drilling in the North Sea. They were later cleared of criminal charges.",
      "It was also one of the environmental groups that filed a lawsuit seeking to block the Willow oil project in Alaska in recent years.",
      "Greenpeace is an independent network that does not take money from governments, corporations or political parties, according to its website. Its funding comes from individual contributions, along with foundation grants.",
      "In 2023, Greenpeace USA had about $40 million in revenue and support, and about $38 million in expenses, according to its online financial statement.",
      "Its website says it does not consider anyone a permanent friend or enemy.",
      "\u201cIf your government or company is willing to change, we will work with you to achieve your aims,\" its website states. \u201cReverse course, and we will be back.\u201d",

      "Maryland Gov. Wes Moore has announced an agreement on a state budget framework with the state\u2019s Democratic leadership",
      "ANNAPOLIS, Md. -- Maryland Gov. Wes Moore announced an agreement on a state budget framework with the state's Democratic leadership Thursday, criticizing President Donald Trump's tariffs and dramatic downsizing of the federal government while announcing tax increases and cuts to address a $3.3 billion state deficit for the next fiscal year.",
      "The tax increases include a new 3% tax on information technology services, as well as a new income tax bracket for the state's wealthiest residents",
      "\u201cWe \u2019ve spoken to Marylanders at all income levels about this plan, and there is consensus that if a person is making over $750,000 a year, it is reasonable to ask them to give roughly $1,800 more to help us invest in the success of our state,\" Moore, a Democrat, said.",
      "The plans also include tax increases on gambling and cannabis, as well as a new 1% tax on capital gains for people with incomes over $350,000.",
      "Moore and other leading lawmakers criticized the Republican president frequently at a news conference at the state Capitol. The governor pointed out that the ratings agency Moody's recently noted that federal cuts pose a greater threat to Maryland than any other state.",
      "\u201cThe president has launched a reckless trade war with our allies, including our largest trading partners, and those tariffs could mean over a $2 billion impact on our economy and directly harm our people,\u201d Moore said,",
      "He added that Trump dealt a further blow to the state last week by announcing plans to cancel relocating a new FBI headquarters in Maryland.",
      "Republicans said it was wrong to blame the president for the state\u2019s fiscal woes, because Maryland's budget deficit existed long before Trump returned to office in January.",
      "\u201cYou didn\u2019t hear one bit of accountability from any of the Democratic leaders,\u201d Del. Jesse Pippy, a Republican who is the House minority whip, said. \u201cYou didn\u2019t. You heard them blame Trump for every single problem we have in the state, and they just raised our taxes at least a billion dollars.\u201d",
      "But the governor emphasized that 94% of Marylanders \u201cwill either get a tax cut or see no change in their income taxes.\u201d However, he did not provide an estimated average tax cut for those seeing reductions, saying work was ongoing to determine those numbers.",
      "Moore and other leading Democrats, who heavily control the state's legislature, described the budget plan as a much-needed modernization of the state's revenue streams.",
      "\u201cAs our economy increasingly becomes digital, this revenue expansion acknowledges the growing role of IT in our daily lives and business operations and the use of technology to replace workers,\" Senate President Bill Ferguson, a Baltimore Democrat, said. \"It also acknowledges that many goods, such as software programs, are now sold as yearly or monthly services.\u201d",
      "The new tax would apply to services like website building, as well as services that help people store information on the cloud, such as Amazon Web Services.",
      "Ferguson said the new tax on capital gains will be used to invest in transportation and help add a new revenue stream to the budget, and he linked the new tax to Trump's plan for a tax cut for the wealthy.",
      "\u201cWhat we do know is that the Trump tax cuts that are focused on billionaires are likely to help those who have done the best, and so this is the right place for Maryland to look to have sustainable investment in our infrastructure and in our budget,\" Ferguson said.",
      "The plan includes about $2.3 billion in cuts, about $500 million more than the governor included in his initial budget proposal in January. Del. Ben Barnes, a Democrat who chairs the House Appropriations Committee, noted that previous cuts to the Developmental Disabilities Administration have been restored.",
      "Moore described the cuts as the most significant in 16 years, but few details about them were offered at the news conference, an omission sharply criticized by Republicans.",
      "Del. Jason Buckel, a western Maryland Republican and the House minority leader, described it as \u201cvery disappointing, the incredible lack of detail.\u201d",
      "\u201cBasically all I took away from it was we\u2019re going to increase people\u2019s taxes,\" Buckel said. \"We\u2019re making cuts. We can\u2019t tell you what the cuts are.\u201d",
      "Lawmakers still have to pass a balanced budget before the end of the legislative session on April 7. The governor described the agreement on Thursday as a framework on its main components, though work remains in the coming weeks.",
      "\u201cThis framework will inform the final budget and the final bill that goes from the House to the Senate, and I look forward to signing it when it makes it to my desk,\" Moore said.",

      "BERLIN -- The prospective next German government's plans to enable higher defense spending by loosening strict debt rules and to set up a huge infrastructure fund that's aimed at boosting Europe's biggest economy cleared their final parliamentary hurdle Friday with approval by the upper house.",
      "The chamber, which represents Germany's 16 state governments, approved the measure proposed by likely next chancellor Friedrich Merz with the necessary two-thirds majority. Its endorsement followed approval on Tuesday by the lower house.",
      "Conservative leader Merz, who won last month's election, and his prospective center-left coalition partners say recent weeks have brought new urgency to efforts to further strengthen Germany\u2019s long-neglected military, as doubts have grown about the United States' commitment to the trans-Atlantic alliance.",
      "The plans needed a two-thirds majority in both houses of parliament because they involve changes to Germany\u2019s strict self-imposed borrowing rules \u2014 the so-called \u201cdebt brake,\u201d which allows new borrowing worth only 0.35% of annual gross domestic product and is anchored in the constitution. That forced the would-be coalition partners into negotiations with the environmentalist Greens, whose votes were needed to get enough support.",
      "The package exempts from the debt rules spending on defense and security, including intelligence agencies and assistance to Ukraine, of more than 1% of GDP. It also foresees setting up a 500 billion-euro ($544 billion) fund, financed by borrowing, to pour money into Germany\u2019s creaking infrastructure over the next 12 years and help restore the stagnant economy to growth.",
      "At the Greens\u2019 insistence, 100 billion euros from the investment fund will go into climate-related spending. The package also will give state governments more freedom to borrow money.",
      "The parties that negotiated the plans control 41 of the 69 votes in the upper house of parliament. Another 12 votes from states where other parties are also in government gave the package the necessary majority. Four states whose governments contain parties that oppose the plans abstained.",
      "Friday's vote completed a successful first test for Merz, but he still faces plenty of work to put together a coalition of his Union bloc and the center-left Social Democrats of outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration's cuts to foreign aid have defunded groups that campaign for LGBTQ+ communities and for democracy around the world",
      "In early 2024, Matthew Hart took a hard look at the upcoming elections around the world and worried that the outcomes did not look promising.",
      "\u201cWhat we knew was that the winds were not in our favor. The winds were not in our sail, and we saw all around the world a kind of moral panic,\u201d said Hart, executive director of the Global Philanthropy Project, a network of funders for LGBTQ+ people internationally.",
      "Rising authoritarianism and religiously motivated political movements were mixing into a \u201ctoxic blend\" that regularly targets trans, intersex and gay people, they said in an interview with The Associated Press.",
      "Hart was among the philanthropic leaders who tried to prepare for not just changes under the Trump administration, but growing trends toward autocracy and crackdowns on human rights around the world.",
      "As a result, last year, Global Philanthropy Project quietly launched a campaign called \u201cFund Our Futures\u201d to raise money for LGBTQ+ organizations around the world. In November, they announced they had secured more than $100 million and have since raised the bar to try to bring in another $50 million. Donors will award the funds over the next three to five years and GPP will track their commitments.",
      "While few anticipated the speed and breadth of the Trump administration's policy changes, Hart had seen funders grapple with fear and paralysis in moments of crisis.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a history in philanthropy that that you sort of wait and see. What\u2019s going to happen?\u201d Hart said. \u201cWe thought, \u2019Oh, we have got to get ahead of this. Because if we don\u2019t secure the commitments now, we\u2019re talking two years of internal, philanthropic field work that would need to be done.\u201d",
      "Phil Buchanan, president of The Center for Effective Philanthropy, said the early preparation will allow funders to identify and support organizations aligned with their goals. But he said, no funder can expect to always be accurate in their forecasting.",
      "\u201cPreparation is really important,\u201d he said, \u201cAnd then also, so is being responsive when the context looks different than what you prepared for.\u201d",
      "For example, few funders contemplated the wholesale termination of most U.S. foreign aid, which has had vast and cascading effects on organizations across every geography and issue. Trump singled out foundations with large endowments for investigation in one of his executive orders on diversity, equity and inclusion and in a memo in February, he accused many nonprofits who have received federal funding of engaging \u201cin actions that actively undermine the security, prosperity, and safety of the American people.\"",
      "Funders who support democracy movements in inhospitable environments have some experience adapting to these kinds of threats. Even so, Kellea Miller, executive director of the Human Rights Funders Network, said they were caught off guard.",
      "\u201cThere are areas that Trump has very quickly shifted that we knew he would touch, but the scale and rapidity of it is beyond what most of us had imagined,\u201d she said, adding that she had expected more action from Congress.",
      "Starting in 2021, HRFN convened funders to coordinate their responses to crises like the presidential assassination Haiti and the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. Those conversations grew into a framework called Better Preparedness, which encourages foundations to consider in advance of a crisis how they want to react.",
      "\u201cSo we\u2019re not all funding the same groups and that we\u2019re also able to distribute the risk and risk appetite in a way that we can\u2019t if we\u2019re not honest and and working together,\u201d Miller said.",
      "Miller said now in the U.S., funders of democracy and human rights movements worry the Trump administration will threaten their ability to operate.",
      "\u201cA lot of foundations are very, very cautious right now because they\u2019re worried that their assets could be frozen. They\u2019re concerned that they will be targeted politically,\u201d she said.",
      "The commitments to the Fund Our Futures campaign represent a noticeable portion of the funding for groups that serve gay, transgender and intersex people around the world even as some government funding has been taken away.",
      "In 2021-2022, private philanthropy and donor governments together gave $905 million to these groups, according to the most recent research by GPP.",
      "Of that total, 20 foundations alone gave $522 million, or around 50% of the total, highlighting the importance of these private donations to supporting international LGBTQ+ communities. Sixteen governments and multilateral donors gave $175 million to LGBTQ+ groups, with the largest funder being the Netherlands.",
      "As part of its dramatic reduction in U.S. foreign aid, the Trump administration has also ended its policy of supporting the rights of LGBTQ+ people abroad, which the Biden administration had made a priority. In an exit memo from January, USAID staff under Biden wrote that the agency increased funding for programs for LBGTQ+ communities abroad from $6 million in 2021 to $25 million in 2024.",
      "The Netherlands and another major funder of LGBTQ+ communities, Sweden, both recently announced cuts to their foreign assistance. Canada, which is another major funder, has so far not changed their commitments.",
      "Even with the new resources in the pipeline, the cuts from government funders have significantly disrupted groups that serve LGBTQ+ communities, Hart said. In their view, every philanthropic dollar they can raise will help save the lives of trans, intersex and gay people around the world, who will be under greater attack as support for democracy more broadly falters.",
      "\u201cGender justice, feminist movements, freedom of movement and LGBTI people are all being attacked at the same time,\u201d Hart said. \u201cThat is a fundamental disruption to some of the core tenets of how modern democracy was proposed to function.\u201d",

      "LONDON -- The Bank of England kept its main U.K. interest rate unchanged at 4.50% on Thursday even though the economy is barely growing and the nation faces more uncertainty in light of the tariff policies being enacted by the Trump administration in the U.S.",
      "The decision by the nine-member Monetary Policy Committee was widely expected, and comes a day after the U.S. Federal Reserve also kept interest rates unchanged.",
      "Minutes from the meeting showed that eight members voted to keep policy unchanged, with one backing a quarter-point reduction.",
      "The rate-setting panel has reduced the Bank of England\u2019s main rate from a 16-year high of 5.25% by a quarter of a percentage on three occasions since last August, most recently in February, after inflation fell from the multi-decade highs of over 10% reached in the wake of the sharp spike in energy prices following Russia's full-blown invasion of Ukraine in early 2022 .",
      "However, inflation, at 3%, remains above the bank\u2019s 2% target and is set to push higher in coming months, even without accounting for any tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. Many economists think it could rise as high as 4% in the coming months as businesses are raise prices as a result of a big increase in the minimum wage and higher payroll taxes.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of economic uncertainty at the moment,\" said Bank Gov. Andrew Bailey. \u201cWe still think that interest rates are on a gradually declining path, but we\u2019ve held them at 4.5% today.\u201d",
      "If policymakers continue to pursue their recent gradual approach, then another cut is likely in May, when they will be armed with the bank\u2019s latest economic projections and Bank Gov. Andrew Bailey next holds a press conference.",
      "Bailey said rate-setters will be \u201clooking very closely at how the global and domestic economies are evolving\u201d and that whatever happens, \"it\u2019s our job to make sure that inflation stays low and stable.\u201d",
      "The U.S. Federal Reserve, which kept borrowing rates unchanged Wednesday, also expressed uncertainty about the near-term economic outlook, particularly in light of U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff policies, which economists worry would lower global growth and lead to an uptick in prices.",
      "The British economy, the sixth-largest, eked out modest growth of 0.1% in the fourth quarter, a hugely disappointing outcome for the new Labour government, which has made boosting growth its number one economic policy. Since the global financial crisis in 2008-2009, the British economy\u2019s growth performance has been notably below its long-run average.",
      "Critics say Treasury chief Rachel Reeves is partly responsible for the gloomy economic news since Labour returned to power in July after 14 years, because she was overly downbeat when taking on her role and has since increased taxes, particularly on businesses.",
      "Reeves, who on March 26 will deliver a keenly-watched statement on the state of the public finances to lawmakers, will be hoping that the Bank of England does cut borrowing rates further over coming months as it will likely help shore up growth.",
      "Economists said the latest update from the bank did little to clear up the outlook, though most said a further quarter-point reduction in May remained on the cards.",
      "\u201cBut beyond that, much will depend on trade policy out of the U.S. and the fiscal announcements coming from the Chancellor,\u201d said Luke Bartholomew, deputy chief economist at asset management firm Aberdeen.",

      "HONG KONG -- Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing\u2019s business empire is in the crosshairs after CK Hutchison Holdings chose to sell its Panama Canal port assets to a consortium that includes U.S. investment firm BlackRock Inc., apparently angering Beijing.",
      "Over the past week, Beijing's Hong Kong affairs offices have posted scathing commentaries from a local state-backed media outlet over the tentative deal by Hutchison, which is controlled by Li\u2019s family.",
      "That raises questions about the deal and highlights the difficulties Hong Kong businesses face as they balance demands from Beijing for national loyalty and their own capitalist interests in the once free-wheeling Asian financial hub. Here's what to know about the issue.",
      "Nicknamed \u201cSuperman,\u201d Li is among the world\u2019s 50 richest people, with Forbes calculating his net worth at $38 billion. Li, 96, retired from his position as chairman of CK Hutchison in 2018, succeeded by his elder son Victor. But he's still one of Hong Kong's most influential figures.",
      "Li's rags-to-riches story paralleled the former British colony\u2019s rise. His business empire touches almost every aspect of daily life in Hong Kong, from properties and supermarkets to telecommunications and utilities. Globally, his conglomerate owns assets including British drugstore chain Superdrug and European mobile phone network operator Three.",
      "A Hutchison subsidiary has operated ports at both ends of the Panama Canal since 1997. That was one reason U.S. President Donald Trump has alleged Chinese interference with the critical shipping lane's operations.",
      "Li\u2019s influence extends beyond business. He has met with top Chinese leaders and has served on the elite committee that selected Hong Kong\u2019s leader.",
      "Experts on ties between Beijing and Hong Kong said ruling Communist Party leaders once understood that support from the business sector was crucial for maintaining Hong Kong\u2019s capitalist system. It's has been strategically vital for mainland China\u2019s economy, given the role their global networks and resources play in the country\u2019s development. So, Li has had notable political influence.",
      "But Li has faced criticism over some business decisions. When he sold off some mainland Chinese assets in 2015, an article published by a think tank affiliated with Chinese official news agency Xinhua accused him of being immoral.",
      "During pro-democracy protests in 2019, Li was blasted by some pro-Beijing supporters for his perceived ambivalence about the unrest. Some other Hong Kong business leaders adopted a harsher stance.",
      "CK Hutchison announced March 4 that it would sell all its shares in Hutchison Port Holdings and in Hutchison Port Group Holdings to the consortium that also includes BlackRock subsidiary Global Infrastructure Partners and Terminal Investment Limited, which is chaired by Italian shipping scion Diego Aponte, whose family reportedly has a longstanding relationship with Li\u2019s.",
      "If approved, the deal, valued at nearly $23 billion including $5 billion in debt, will give the consortium control over 43 ports in 23 countries, including the ports of Balboa and Cristobal, located at either end of the canal. The transaction does not include ports in Hong Kong or mainland China. CK Hutchison said the transaction was purely commercial in nature.",
      "The deal pleased Trump but angered Beijing.",
      "One of the Beijing-backed newspaper commentaries described the deal as a betrayal of all Chinese and said the company should think about which side to take. The other said great entrepreneurs are patriots, suggesting that businesspeople who \u201cdance with\u201d predatory American politicians would be doomed to infamy.",
      "Comments on popular posts about the deal on Chinese social media platform Weibo tend to be more critical than favorable toward Li.",
      "Chief Executive John Lee avoided direct criticism of the deal or Trump, but told reporters on Tuesday his government opposes bullying tactics in international economic and trade relations, reiterating Beijing's stance.",
      "Some unconfirmed reports have suggested Chinese leaders were angry not to have been consulted in advance about the deal.",
      "George Chen, managing director for Hong Kong at The Asia Group, a Washington-headquartered business and policy consulting firm, said Beijing may have been disappointed because it had almost no time to devise a response in advance.",
      "Ports are valuable strategic assets and transactions involving them are always sensitive, said Wilson Chan, co-founder of the Pagoda Institute, a think tank focusing on public policy and the global political economy.",
      "It is unclear whether pressure from Beijing will affect the deal, which has to be approved by Panama's government. China\u2019s Foreign Ministry deflected a question about whether authorities are investigating the deal, saying reporters should ask other authorities.",
      "CK Hutchison has not commented on the controversy. It was due to report its 2024 financial results on Thursday, but said it was not planning a news conference.",
      "Cancelling the deal would be risky, Chan said.",
      "\u201cStrictly speaking, you just let Trump take credit for it, then you later say \u2018Sorry, I\u2019m canceling the deal.\u2019 You can imagine what Trump\u2019s reaction would be,\u201d he said, adding that would also affect how the outside world views Hong Kong businesses.",
      "The first Trump administration sanctioned Chinese and Hong Kong officials for undermining the autonomy of the territory promised when Britain handed its colony to Beijing in 1997 under a concept dubbed \u201cOne country, two systems.\u201d It promised the city could keep its Western-style civil liberties and economic autonomy for at least 50 years, but following the 2019 protests, Beijing has doubled-down on its political control of the city.",
      "Li could try to placate critics who deem him insufficiently patriotic, Chan said, by using proceeds from selling the port assets for investments aligned with Beijing\u2019s policies, particularly in developing Hong Kong and mainland port businesses.",
      "But relations between private businesses and Beijing remain uncertain, said The Asia Group's Chen. Even though Chinese President Xi Jinping recently met with private sector business leaders in a show of support, some may wonder if they must follow the party line even if that might conflict with their business interests, he said.",
      "If Beijing steps up pressure on Li to scrap the deal, the Trump administration could hit back with more sanctions and restrictions on Hong Kong and Chinese businesses and some individuals, he said.",
      "The situation shows that Washington\u2019s concerns about Hong Kong's business autonomy are valid, Chen said.",
      "\u201cThis is bad when it comes to the defense of \u2018one country, two systems,\u2019\u201d Chen said.",

      "The average rate on a 30-year mortgage in the U.S. rose slightly for the second week in a row, a modest setback for prospective home shoppers as the spring homebuying season ramps up",
      "Associated Press -- The average rate on a 30-year mortgage in the U.S. rose slightly for the second week in a row, a modest setback for prospective home shoppers as the spring homebuying season ramps up.",
      "The rate rose to 6.67% from 6.65% last week, mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Thursday. A year ago, the rate averaged 6.87%.",
      "Including this week, the average rate on a 30-year home loan has risen only twice in the past nine weeks, a welcome trend for aspiring homebuyers struggling to afford a home after years of soaring home prices.",
      "\u201cThe 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has stayed under 7% for nine consecutive weeks, which is helpful for potential buyers and sellers alike,\u201d said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac\u2019s chief economist.",
      "Borrowing costs on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages, popular with homeowners refinancing their home loans, also rose this week, pushing the average rate to 5.83% from 5.8% last week. A year ago, it averaged 6.21%, Freddie Mac said.",
      "Mortgage rates are influenced by several factors, including bond market investors\u2019 expectations for future inflation, global demand for U.S. Treasurys and the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate policy decisions.",
      "After climbing to just above 7% in mid-January, the average rate on a 30-year mortgage has been mostly declining, loosely following the moves in the 10-year Treasury yield, which lenders use as a guide to pricing home loans.",
      "The yield, which was nearing 4.8% in mid-January, has mostly fallen since then, reflecting worries about the economy\u2019s growth and the fallout from the Trump administration\u2019s decision to impose tariffs on imported goods from many of the nation\u2019s key trade partners. The yield was at 4.23% in midday trading Thursday.",
      "Tariffs can drive inflation higher, which could translate into higher yields on the 10-year Treasury note, pushing up mortgage rates. That\u2019s because bond investors demand higher returns as long as inflation remains elevated.",
      "The Fed has been holding its key interest rate steady this year, after cutting it sharply through the end of last year. While lower rates can help give the economy a boost, they can also stoke inflation.",
      "On Wednesday, the central bank kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged. It also signaled that it still expects to cut rates twice this year, even as it sees inflation staying stubbornly elevated.",
      "While the Fed doesn\u2019t set mortgage rates, its actions can ultimately influence borrowing costs for mortgages and other consumer loans.",
      "\u201cIn the near term, we expect mortgage rates to remain in a fairly narrow range, between 6.5% and 7%, which should support the spring housing market,\u201d said Mike Fratantoni, chief economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association.",
      "The U.S. housing market has been in a sales slump dating back to 2022, when mortgage rates began to climb from pandemic-era lows. Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes fell last year to their lowest level in nearly 30 years. They rose 4.2% last month from January, but were down 1.2% from February last year, the National Association of Realtors said Thursday.",

      "That's because last week U.S. President Donald Trump threatened a tariff of that amount on European wine, Champagne and other spirits if the European Union went ahead with retaliatory tariffs on some U.S. products. The top wine producers in Europe could face crippling costs that would hit smaller wineries especially hard.",
      "Europe's wine industry is the latest to find itself in the crosshairs of a possible trade spat with the U.S.",

      "\u201cThere's no debate about that. We agree that Mr. Trump creates and likes to create contests of strength. We have to adapt to that,\u201d he said.",
      "In Italy, the wine industry has called for calm, hoping that negotiators in Brussels and Washington can back down from the growing trade spat.",
      "The U.S. is Italy\u2019s largest wine market, with sales having tripled in value over the past 20 years. Last year, exports grew by nearly 7% to over 2 billion euros ($2.2 billion) according to Italy's main farming lobby Coldiretti.",
      "Strong sales at high-end restaurants, in particular, make the U.S. market difficult to replace, said Piero Mastroberardino, vice president of the national winemakers\u2019 association Federvini.",
      "Mastroberardino\u2019s \u201cTaurasi Radici\u201d red wine, for example, was rated the fifth-best wine in the world in 2023 by Wine Spectator, an American wine and lifestyle magazine. It sells for around $80 a bottle retail in the U.S., roughly twice how much it costs in Italy, so any tariffs would push it to an \u201cunthinkable price point,\u201d he said.",
      "In January, Mastroberardino's U.S. import partners increased orders by about 20% in January anticipating possible Trump tariffs. But the increase in orders would not offset the impact of tariffs, particularly that high, he said, for long.",

      "Spain was the fourth-largest exporter of wine to the U.S. last year in sales, and the seventh-largest by volume, according to the trade group. Spanish wine exports to the U.S. grew by 7% last year. And the wine industry represents about 2% of the country's overall economic output, the trade group said.",
      "For Spain's producers of Cava, the threat of U.S. tariffs hit especially hard. The U.S. is the number two market for the Spanish bubbly wine, which like Champagne has a designation of origin meaning it can only be made in Spain.",

      "Germany\u2019s would-be next chancellor, Friedrich Merz, is asking lawmakers to allow the country to put \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d into defense and to authorize an enormous fund for investment in its creaking infrastructure",
      "BERLIN -- Germany's would-be next chancellor, Friedrich Merz, is asking lawmakers Tuesday to allow the country to put \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d into defense as doubts mount about the strength of the trans-Atlantic alliance, and to authorize an enormous fund for investment in its creaking infrastructure, financed by hefty borrowing.",
      "The outgoing parliament is set to meet for a final time to vote on the plans as Merz's center-right Union bloc works to put together a governing coalition with the center-left Social Democrats of outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz after winning last month's election.",
      "The plans will need a two-thirds majority in parliament's lower house, the Bundestag, because they involve changes to Germany's strict self-imposed borrowing rules \u2014 the so-called \u201cdebt brake,\u201d which allows new borrowing worth only 0.35% of annual gross domestic product and is anchored in the constitution. That forced the prospective coalition partners into negotiations with the environmentalist Greens, whose votes will be needed to get enough support.",
      "The package would exempt from the debt rules spending on defense and security, including intelligence agencies and assistance to Ukraine, of more than 1% of GDP. It also foresees setting up a 500 billion-euro ($544 billion) fund, financed by borrowing, to pour funding into Germany's infrastructure over the next 12 years and help restore the economy \u2014 Europe's biggest \u2014 to growth.",
      "At the Greens' insistence, 100 billion euros from the investment fund will go into climate-related spending.",
      "The plans amount to an about-turn for Merz, whose party had spoken out against running up new debt before the election without entirely closing the door to future changes to the \u201cdebt brake.\u201d The Social Democrats and Greens had long argued for a reform of the borrowing rules.",
      "Recent weeks have brought new urgency to efforts to further strengthen Germany's long-neglected military. The outgoing government created a special 100 billion-euro fund to modernize it, which also helped Berlin meet the current NATO target of spending 2% of GDP on defense. But that pot will be used up in 2027, and doubts have grown recently about the Trump administration's commitment to European allies.",
      "Merz said earlier this month that Germany and Europe must quickly strengthen their defense capability and that \u201c\u2018whatever it takes\u2019 must also go for our defense now.\"",
      "He told ARD television Sunday that \u201cthe situation has once again escalated dramatically in recent weeks\u201d and that Germany's budget had turned out to be in worse shape than previously known.",
      "Of Tuesday's vote, he said: \u201cIt will be close, but it will work.\u201d",
      "\u201cOf course there is still persuasion to be done in all three parliamentary groups, but we should not less this opportunity go unused,\u201d he said.",
      "The package is being brought to the old parliament \u2014 rather than the newly elected one, which will hold its first session on March 25 \u2014 because parties that are unlikely to agree have just over one-third of the seats in the new chamber. The far-right Alternative for Germany portrays itself as a staunch defender of the \u201cdebt brake,\u201d while the Left Party opposes it but is skeptical about military spending.",
      "In the outgoing Bundestag, the Union, Social Democrats and Greens have a combined 520 of the 733 lawmakers \u2014 31 more than are required for a two-thirds majority.",
      "If the package is approved Tuesday, it faces another hurdle Friday in parliament's upper house, which represents Germany's 16 state governments. They are also set to be given more freedom to borrow money.",
      "A two-thirds majority will also be needed in the upper house. That initially was uncertain because the parties behind the plans control only 41 of the 69 upper-house votes. But on Monday, the conservative-led governing coalition in Bavaria, which has six votes, also agreed to support the package.",

      "The Recovery Rebate Credit is a refundable credit for individuals who didn\u2019t receive the Economic Impact Payments, also known as stimulus payments, during 2020 and 2021. A refundable tax credit is a credit you can get as a refund even if you don\u2019t owe any tax.",
      "The IRS announced this initiative after reviewing its internal data and finding that many eligible taxpayers who filed a 2021 tax return didn\u2019t claim the credit.",
      "\u201cTo minimize headaches and get this money to eligible taxpayers, we\u2019re making these payments automatic, meaning these people will not be required to go through the extensive process of filing an amended return to receive it,\u201d said Werfel.",
      "If you qualify for the Recovery Rebate Credit you don\u2019t have to take any action. The IRS plans to send letters to eligible taxpayers notifying them of the special payment. The payments will go out automatically this month and should arrive by direct deposit or check by late January. They\u2019ll be sent to the bank account listed on the taxpayer\u2019s 2023 return or to the address IRS has on file.",
      "You still might be able to receive the money. However, taxpayers need to file a tax return and claim the Recovery Rebate Credit by the April 15, 2025 deadline, even if any income from a job, business or other source was minimal or nonexistent, according to the IRS.",
      "There were three rounds of payments to households impacted by the pandemic, totaling $814 billion. IRS based the amounts that taxpayers received on their income, tax filing status and number of children or qualifying dependents.",
      "In March 2020, eligible individuals received up to $1,200 per income tax filer and $500 per child under the CARES Act. In December 2020, eligible individuals received up to $600 per income tax filer and $600 per child under the Consolidated Appropriations Act.

Authorities said at least one person threw Molotov cocktails \u2014 crude bombs filled with gasoline or another flammable liquid \u2014 and fired several rounds from a weapon into the vehicles.",
      "\u201cWas this terrorism? Was it something else? It certainly has some of the hallmarks that we might think \u2014 the writing on the wall, potential political agenda, an act of violence,\u201d Spencer Evans, the special agent in charge of the Las Vegas FBI office, said at a news conference. \u201cNone of those factors are lost on us.\u201d",
      "Tesla was once the darling of the left. Helped to viability by a $465 million federal loan during the Obama administration, the company popularized electric vehicles and proved, despite their early reputation, that they didn\u2019t have to be small, stodgy, underpowered and limited in range.",

      "Tesla stock doubled in value in the weeks after Trump\u2019s election but has since shed all those gains.",
      "Trump gave a boost to the company when he turned the White House driveway into an electric vehicle showroom. The president promoted the vehicles and said he would purchase an $80,000 Model S, eschewing his fierce past criticism of electric vehicles.",
      "Tesla did not respond to a request for comment. Musk briefly addressed the vandalism Monday during an appearance on Sen. Ted Cruz\u2019s podcast, saying \u201cat least some of it is organized and paid for\u201d by \u201cleftwing organizations in America, funded by leftwing billionaires, essentially.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis level of violence is insane and deeply wrong,\u201d Musk wrote Tuesday on X, sharing a video of burning Teslas in Las Vegas. \u201cTesla just makes electric cars and has done nothing to deserve these evil attacks.\u201d",

      "Some Tesla owners have resorted to cheeky bumper stickers to distance themselves from their vehicle\u2019s new stigma, and perhaps deter would-be vandals. They say things like \u201cI bought this before we knew Elon was crazy,\u201d or \u201cI just wanted an electric car. Sorry guys.\u201d",
      "Prices for used Cybertrucks, Tesla\u2019s most distinctive product, have dropped nearly 8% since Trump took office, according to CarGurus, which aggregates used car vehicle listings. The market as a whole remained steady over the period.",
      "The White House has thrown its weight behind Musk, the highest-profile member of the administration and a key donor to committees promoting Trump's political interests.

      "Commercial fishermen and seafood processors and distributors seeking to convert to new, lower-carbon emission systems say they are finding federal funding they were counting on for the work is frozen or unavailable in the wake of sweeping budget cuts t...",
      "BREMEN, Maine -- Commercial fishermen and seafood processors and distributors looking to switch to new, lower-carbon emission systems say the federal funding they relied on for this work is either frozen or unavailable due to significant budget cuts promoted by President Donald Trump\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "The changes are designed to replace old diesel-burning engines and outdated at-sea cooling systems and are touted by environmentalists as a way to reduce seafood's carbon footprint. Salmon harvesters in Washington state, scallop distributors in Maine and halibut fishermen in Alaska are among those who told The Associated Press their federal commitments for projects like new boat engines and refrigeration systems have been rescinded or are under review.",
      "\u201cThe uncertainty. This is not a business-friendly environment,\u201d said Togue Brawn, a Maine seafood distributor who said she is out tens of thousands of dollars. \u201cIf they want to make America great again, then honor your word and tell people what's going on.\"",
      "Decarbonization of the fishing fleet has been a target of environmental activists in recent years. One study published in the  Marine Policy journal states that more than 200 million tons of carbon dioxide were released via fishing in 2016.",
      "That is far less than agriculture, but still a significant piece of the worldwide emissions puzzle. With Earth experiencing worsening storms and its hottest year on record in 2024, reducing the burning of fossil fuels across different industry sectors is critical to fighting climate change, scientists have said.",
      "But climate-friendly projects often cost tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars, leading fishermen to seek U.S. Department of Agriculture or Environmental Protection Agency funds to cover some costs. DOGE, a commission assembled to cut federal spending, has targeted both agencies for cutbacks.",
      "That has left fishermen like Robert Buchmayr of Seattle on the hook for huge bills. Buchmayr said he is nearing completion of a refrigeration project for a salmon boat and was counting on a $45,000 USDA grant to pay for a chunk of it. The agency told him last month the funding is on hold until further notice, he said.",
      "\u201cI'm scrambling, where does the money come from. I was counting on the grant,\u201d Buchmayr said. \u201cI was under the impression that if you got a grant from the United States, it was a commitment. Nothing in the letter was saying, 'Yes, we'll guarantee you the funds depending on who is elected.'\u201d",
      "The full extent of the cuts is unclear, and fishermen affected by them described the situation as chaotic and confusing.",
      "Representatives for the USDA and EPA did not respond to requests for comment from The Associated Press about the value of the cuts and whether they were permanent. Dan Smith, USDA Rural Development's state energy director for Alaska, said updates about some grants could arrive in April.",
      "Numerous fishermen, commercial fishing groups and advocates for working waterfronts told The Associated Press they learned about the changed status of their grant money in February and March. Some were told the money would not be coming and others were told the funds were frozen while they were subject to a review.",
      "Many prospective grant recipients said they have had difficulty getting updates from the agencies. The lack of certainty has fishermen worried and seeking answers, said Sarah Schumann, a Rhode Island fisherman and director of the Fishery Friendly Climate Action Campaign, a fishermen-led network that works on climate issues.",
      "\u201cThey've started contacting me in the last couple of weeks because they've had the plug pulled on money that was already committed,\u201d Schumann said. \u201cIf they miss a season they could go out of business.\u201d",
      "In Homer, Alaska, Lacey Velsko of Kaia Fisheries was excited for her decarbonization project, which she said hinged on hundreds of thousands of dollars via a USDA grant to improve a refrigeration system on one of her boats. The recently completed project burns less fuel and yields a higher quality project for the company, which fishes for halibut, Pacific cod and other fish, she said.",
      "But, now the company is told the money is unavailable, leaving a huge cost to bear, Velsko said.",
      "\u201cOf course we think it was unfair that we signed a contract and were told we would be funded and now we\u2019re not funded. If six months down the road we\u2019re still not funded I don\u2019t know what avenue to take,\u201d she said.",
      "The funding cuts have also hurt seafood processors and distributors, such as Brawn in Bremen, Maine. Brawn said she received a little more than half of a USDA grant of about $350,000 before learning the rest might not arrive.",
      "Brawn received the grant for Dayboat Blue, a project that uses a membership-based model to get Maine seafood to nationwide customers while reducing the carbon footprint of transportation and packaging.",
      "\u201cThis model can really help fishermen, it can help consumers, it can help communities,\u201d Brawn said. \u201cWhat it's going to do is it's going to stop the program.\u201d",
      "The confusion on the waterfront is another example of the bumpy rollout of government cutbacks under Trump. The Trump administration halted its firings of hundreds of federal employees who worked on nuclear weapons programs last month. It also moved to rehire medical device, food safety and other workers lost to mass firings at the Food and Drug Administration. New tariffs on key trading partners have also been chaotic.",
      "In Bellingham, Washington, EPA funding was paused for five engine replacement projects split between three companies, said Dan Tucker, executive director of the Working Waterfront Coalition of Whatcom County. He said the uncertainty about funding has made it difficult for fishermen to move ahead with projects that will ultimately benefit their businesses and the community at large.",
      "\u201cA lot of the small guys are like, 'Well, I really want to help out with climate change but I can't afford it,'\u201d Tucker said.",

      "The 2025 season couldn't have had a much better start for the sport, which showcased its international appeal over the past week in Japan. The Tokyo Dome hosted a capacity crowd of roughly 42,000 for all four games \u2014 two exhibitions against Japanese teams and two regular-season games \u2014 and thousands more came downtown to enjoy the spectacle of a wildly successful overseas trip.",
      "It\u2019s all part of MLB\u2019s winning streak as it barrels toward its domestic opening day on March 27. The game is in solid health with a slight increase in stadium attendance and a quicker pace of play thanks to a series of rules changes that started in 2023.",
      "\u201cTo the city of Tokyo and the country of Japan, on behalf of the Dodgers and Major League Baseball, we just want to say thank you,\u201d Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. \"You guys were all such great hosts.",
      "\u201cHopefully we put on a good show.\u201d",
      "It's hard to argue otherwise. Ohtani's towering solo homer in the Dodgers' 6-3 win on Wednesday night put an exclamation point on a two-game sweep in which five Japanese players returned home, including four who played quite well, navigating the suffocating pressure of performing in front of their home fans.",
      "Chicago's Shota Imanaga and Los Angeles' Yoshinobu Yamamoto got things started with the first all-Japanese starting pitching duel in opening day history. Both delivered, with Imanaga throwing four scoreless innings and Yamamoto responding with five quality frames of his own, giving up just one run over five innings in the Dodgers' 4-1 win.",
      "In the second game, Dodgers rookie Roki Sasaki made his big league debut, firing four 100 mph fastballs to start his career in three electrifying \u2014 if a little erratic \u2014 innings that showcased his potential. Chicago's Seiya Suzuki was the only one with a quiet homecoming, going hitless in the two games.",
      "But the center of attention was undoubtedly Ohtani, who handled the massive expectations with grace and skill. He went 3 for 8 with a pair of walks, including the solo homer that just cleared the wall in right-center field, giving the Dodgers a 6-2 lead.",
      "Even Chicago's Pete Crow-Armstrong unwittingly contributed to the fairy tale scene, flipping Ohtani's home run ball into the stands where a 10-year-old Japanese boy caught it and became an instant celebrity.",
      "\u201cYou know, it's not surprising,\u201d Roberts said. \"Nothing Shohei does surprises me. Everyone here tonight came to watch Shohei perform and put on a show. And like Shohei does, he always seems to deliver.",
      "\u201cIt was a great moment for everyone for him to hit a home run here at the Tokyo Dome.\u201d",
      "The festive scene was in stark contrast to last year's two-game series in South Korea between the Dodgers and San Diego Padres, when news of a gambling scandal involving Ohtani's translator Ippei Mizuhara marred the series and briefly tarnished Ohtani's spotless reputation.",
      "Mizuhara later pleaded guilty to bank and tax fraud after he stole nearly $17 million from the Dodgers player\u2019s bank account. He was sentenced to nearly five years in federal prison in February.",
      "Ohtani was never implicated in the scandal, and the slugger responded to the turmoil with one of the greatest seasons in MLB history, becoming the first player to have at least 50 homers and 50 stolen bases in one season and helping the Dodgers win the World Series over the New York Yankees.",
      "The 30-year-old's baseball heroics over the past year have made the stunning $700 million, 10-year deal he signed with the Dodgers seem like a bargain. Now he's trying to return to the field as a two-way player, targeting a May return to the mound as he tries to pitch for the first time since elbow surgery in 2023.",
      "It's fair to wonder how much longer Ohtani's surgically repaired body can keep up this pace. He had left (non-throwing) shoulder surgery during the offseason to repair a torn labrum after an injury sustained in Game 2 of the World Series and has now had two major surgeries on his pitching elbow.",

      "Aday Mara, a 7-foot-3 reserve center, added 10 points for coach Mick Cronin's Bruins (23-10), who will face second-seeded Tennessee on Saturday in the Midwest Region as they seek their fourth Sweet 16 appearance in the past five editions of March Madness. The Volunteers also cruised to an easy win, 77-62 over Wofford.",
      "Mason Falslev scored 17 points and Deyton Albury had 12 for Utah State (26-8), which reached its third consecutive NCAA Tournament \u2014 this time under Jarrod Calhoun, the Aggies' third coach in that span.",
      "UCLA broke the game open by holding the Mountain West school to just two free throws in a 12-2 run for a 39-27 halftime advantage. Then the Bruins had a 17-7 surge early in the second half to build a 20-point lead.",
      "The Bruins finished at 48% from the field after shooting 55% in the first half. They made 10 of 24 3-pointers, eight of 10 players scored, and they had 22 assists on 26 baskets.",
      "\u201cThe guys just did a great job,\u201d Cronin said. \u201cAnd it helped us to have three days because against a matchup zone defense you have to score on passing and cutting. You can\u2019t dribble your way into it. They\u2019re going to steal the ball. So guys just did a great job.\u201d",
      "Utah State shot 30% while committing 11 turnovers, leading to 20 UCLA points.",
      "\u201cI thought in the first half, they made shots,\u201d Calhoun said. \u201cSo much this time of year is about shot-making, right? And when you don\u2019t make shots, it affects your defense.\u201d",
      "Calhoun, a West Virginia assistant under Bob Huggins, has been mentioned as a possible candidate for the Mountaineers' coaching vacancy. He didn't address that speculation and said only that he had been \u201coffered a tremendous opportunity\u201d by Utah State athletic director Diana Sabau and the staff \u201cover the last really 24 hours,\u201d without being specific.",
      "\u201cI think Utah State can win a national championship,\u201d he said, following earlier comments noting the school raising $1 million for name, image and likeness payments to athletes. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that if I didn\u2019t believe it.\u201d",
      "UCLA guard Sebastian Mack left midway through the second half with what Cronin said was a groin injury. The Bruins were safely ahead by then but stayed aggressive to put away an offense that ranked 14th in the country in shooting at nearly 49%.",
      "\u201cIf you just let them come back in the game, they will,\u201d Clark said. \u201cAnd so just doing everything we could to try to get them out of rhythm and not let them run their offense, that was the key.\u201d",
      "Utah State: The Aggies outscored UCLA 17-10 in second-chance points, 28-22 in the paint and 16-9 on the break. None of that could offset 4-of-31 3-point shooting.",
      "UCLA: The Bruins won their 12th of 16 games by making sure everybody was involved. Dylan Andrews had eight assists and eight points, while Kobe Johnson also scored eight. UCLA edged Utah State 38-35 on the glass, including 29-19 advantage on the defensive end.",

      "The 6-foot-9 forward said he needed further tests to determine the nature and extent of the injury.",
      "While lying on the court, Rogers reached out to grab Simpkins' hand as trainers looked at his knee. Rogers was helped to the locker room and quickly ruled out. He returned to the bench using crutches for the start of the second half, with his mother watching from the stands with tears rolling down her cheeks.",
      "\u201cYeah, I feel terrible for him,\u201d Mount St. Mary's coach Donny Lind said. \u201cHis versatility really stood out. he plays really, really hard. I hope he gets better.\u201d",

I was proud of the guys and how they responded and how they adapted with me not being out there.\u201d",
      "The Washington Post reported Wednesday that Rogers turned down what his father called \u201clife-changing money\u201d from an unnamed school to stay at American, which could only promise him free parking on its Northwest Washington campus and the occasional free meal if he chose to remain with the Eagles.",
      "\u201cFor me to go out like that, unfortunately, I wish I could have done more for us and for the AU community because they deserved an NCAA win,\u201d Rogers said.",

      "He ran his own Jordan team in the 1990s and 2000s in F1 and became a popular pundit on TV after selling the team in 2005.",
      "Jordan had been undergoing treatment for what he had called \u201cquite aggressive\u201d cancer of the bladder and prostate which spread to his spine and pelvis.",
      "The family statement said Jordan \u201cpassed away peacefully with family by his side in Cape Town\u201d early Thursday.",
      "\u201cEJ brought an abundance of charisma, energy and Irish charm everywhere he went. We all have a huge hole missing without his presence. He will be missed by so many people, but he leaves us with tonnes of great memories to keep us smiling through our sorrow.\u201d",
      "Irish businessman Jordan operated his own racing team in lower-level series before moving up to F1 in 1991, giving future seven-time champion Michael Schumacher his first race that year.",
      "Other drivers over the years included Damon Hill, who won the 1996 championship with Williams, future Ferrari driver Rubens Barrichello, and Heinz-Harald Frentzen, who was third in the championship for Jordan in 1999.",
      "Jordan Grand Prix won four races before Jordan sold the team in 2005. Following more sales and name changes since then, the team competes as Aston Martin.",
      "The 76-year-old Jordan also acted as the manager for car design great Adrian Newey when he left Red Bull for Aston Martin last year.",

      "SHANGHAI -- Lewis Hamilton surprised the crowd and himself by securing his first sprint pole position for Ferrari in the final moments of qualifying Friday at the Chinese Formula 1 Grand Prix.",
      "Hamilton arrived in Shanghai after his disappointing season-opening race last weekend in Australia, where he finished 10th in his first race for Ferrari. He only managed fourth fastest in opening practice here for a modest improvement on that.",
      "He topped the first section of sprint qualifying for the season, before the dominant McLaren of Lando Norris took over in SQ2. An aborted lap from the McLaren driver, following a mistake on his final lap, handed Hamilton his chance \u2013 and the seven-time world champion took it in stunning style with less than a minute remaining.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just a bit gobsmacked, honestly, I\u2019m a bit taken back by it,\u201d Hamilton said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know when we would get to this position. Even though it\u2019s not the main pole that gives me real inspiration to go into tomorrow to find more performance and see if we can compete again.\u201d",
      "Hamilton's time was just 18 thousandths of a second ahead of Red Bull\u2019s Max Verstappen, with Norris\u2019 McLaren teammate Oscar Piastri third. Ferrari\u2019s Charles Leclerc was fourth, with Mercedes\u2019 George Russell closing out the top five.",
      "Verstappen said he was pleased with second place after also benefiting from Norris' mishap.",
      "\u201cI do think in the first practice we were quite a bit off, and so I\u2019m very happy to be on the front row, honestly,\" Verstappen said.",
      "Piastri questioned McLaren's decision to go out early in the third qualifying session even though the team had been comfortably fastest up until then.",
      "\u201cWe tried something a bit different and went out much earlier and tried two laps, which I\u2019m not sure was the best thing in the end,\" Piastri said. \"But I think it\u2019s something we need to look at. The pace in the car is still very strong, and I\u2019m confident to fight from third tomorrow.\u201d",
      "Norris, who won the Australian GP ahead of Verstappen, will start the sprint race from sixth on the grid and looked distraught at the end of the session.",
      "\u201cI made a mistake, I locked-up at the last corner,\u201d Norris said. \u201cBut, yeah, we just struggled a bit more now, just not quick enough simply. But, yeah, just our difficulties that we\u2019ve been struggling with showed a lot more today. So nothing more than that, honestly. Just too many mistakes, (and) just too difficult of a car to drive.\u201d",
      "Ferrari\u2019s Charles Leclerc was fourth and Mercedes\u2019 George Russell closed out the top five, two spots ahead of his rookie teammate Andrea Kimi Antonelli.",
      "Red Bull\u2019s Liam Lawson exited in the first qualifying session, just as in Australia.",
      "\u201cOn just my second lap, I went off,\u201d Lawson said. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously a shame. I think from a starting point, it wasn\u2019t too bad, the first lap was alright. And then we were just looking to build on that. But, we stayed out to try and cool the tires on track, and to be honest I really struggled to get the temperatures down starting the second lap.\u201d",

      "Kirsty Coventry has been elected president of the International Olympic Committee",
      "COSTA NAVARINO, Greece -- Kirsty Coventry was elected president of the International Olympic Committee on Thursday and became the first woman and first African to get perhaps the biggest job in world sports.",
      "\u201cIt is a signal that we are truly global,\u201d the Zimbabwe sports minister and two-time Olympic swimming gold medalist said.",
      "Hers was a stunning first-round win in the seven-candidate contest after voting by 97 IOC members.",
      "She gets an eight-year mandate into 2033 aged just 41 \u2014 youthful by the historical standards of the IOC.",
      "It was the most open and hard-to-call IOC presidential election in decades with Coventry expected to lead the first round short of an absolute majority. Though several rounds of votes were widely predicted, she got the exact majority of 49 needed.",
      "Coventry\u2019s win also was a victory for outgoing IOC president Thomas Bach, who has long been seen as promoting her as his successor. He did not use his right to vote.",
      "\u201cI will make all of you very, very proud and hopefully extremely confident in the decision you have taken,\u201d Coventry said in her acceptance speech. \u201cNow we have got some work together.\u201d",
      "Walking to the podium, she was congratulated and kissed on both cheeks by Juan Antonio Samaranch, her expected closest rival who got 28 votes.",
      "Also in the race were four presidents of sports governing bodies: Track and field's Sebastian Coe, skiing's Johan Eliasch, cycling\u2019s David Lappartient, and gymnastics' Morinari Watanabe. Also contending was Prince Feisal al Hussein of Jordan.",
      "Coventry will formally replace her mentor Bach on June 23 \u2014 officially Olympic Day \u2014 as the 10th IOC president in its 131-year history. Bach reached the maximum 12 years in office.",
      "Key challenges for the 41-year-old Auburn University graduate will be steering the Olympic movement through political and sporting issues toward the 2028 Summer Games in Los Angeles, including engaging in diplomacy with U.S. President Donald Trump.",
      "Coventry\u2019s IOC will also need to find a host for the 2036 Summer Games which could go to India or the Middle East.",
      "The strongest candidates in a five-month campaign with tightly controlled rules drafted by the Bach-led IOC seemed to be Coventry \u2014 who gave birth to her second child \u2014 IOC vice president Samaranch and Coe.",
      "Coventry's manifesto offered mostly continuity from Bach with little new detail, while her rivals had specifics to benefit Olympic athletes, which she was as recently as 2016 in Rio de Janeiro.",
      "Coe's World Athletics broke an Olympic taboo by paying $50,000 to track and field gold medalists in Paris last year. Samaranch promised to relax strict IOC commercial rules and give athletes control of footage of their Olympic performances.",
      "Samaranch tried to follow his father, also Juan Antonio Samaranch, who was the IOC\u2019s seventh president from 1980 to 2001.",
      "Coe aimed to add to a remarkable career of Olympic triumphs: A two-time Olympic gold medalist in the 1,500 meters, he led a bidding team for the 2012 London Olympics, then worked for the next seven years to head the organizing team of those widely praised Games. He got just eight votes.",
      "It has been a stellar week for Bach, who greeted Coventry and shared warm smiles after her acceptance speech.",
      "Bach was feted on Wednesday in an emotional start to the IOC annual meeting, getting lavish praise and the title of honorary president for life. He repeated his wish to offer advice to the next president.",
      "His hands-on executive-style presidency will deliver over a financially secure IOC, on track to earn more than $8 billion in revenue through the 2028 LA Olympics, and with a slate of future hosts through 2034: in Italy, the United States, France, Australia and finally the U.S. again, when the Winter Games return to Salt Lake City.",
      "A signature Bach policy also has been gender parity, with equal quotas of men and women athletes at the 2024 Paris Olympics and giving a better balance of female members of the IOC and the executive board he chairs, which now has seven women among its 15 members, including Coventry.",
      "Her win on Thursday will only add to Bach's legacy for promoting women.",
      "Coventry won back-to-back titles in 200-meters backstroke at the 2004 Athens Olympics and Beijing four years later. She joined the IOC in 2013, almost one year after a disputed athlete election at the London Olympics. Her place among the four athletes elected was eventually awarded after Court of Arbitration for Sport rulings against two opponents.",
      "The next president can oversee the IOC making a statement choice for its host for the 2036 Summer Games.",
      "\u201cThere is one and one only,\u201d Samaranch said on Wednesday when asked about challenges ahead. \u201cWe must concentrate (on) successful and relevant Olympic Games. The rest comes with success in the Games.\u201d",
      "The voters in the exclusive invited club of IOC members include royal family members, former lawmakers and diplomats, business leaders, sports officials and Olympic athletes. Even an Oscar-winning actress, Michelle Yeoh.",
      "Members voted without hearing further presentations from the candidates in an election that swung on a discreet network of friendships and alliances largely forged out of sight.",

      "Blackwell also had five rebounds and three assists for the Badgers (27-9), but it was backup forward Carter Gilmore\u2019s burst early in the second half that helped them grab breathing room in what had been a tight, single-digit contest to that point.",
      "After the 14th-seeded Grizzlies cut their deficit to 51-47 with a poke-away steal, then an easy layup by Money Williams, Gilmore came back with a quick 3 that he punctuated by putting a finger over his mouth and taunting the Montana crowd to \u201cshhhh.\u201d",
      "Gilmore (8 points) drew a charge on Montana\u2019s next possession, then altered Te'Jon Sawyer's shot on the next, part of an 8-0 run that gave Wisconsin its biggest lead of the game to that point -- one that would expand to 21 points.",
      "Sawyer and Kai Johnson led the Grizzlies (25-10) with 15 points each.",
      "The other Wisconsin double-digit scorers were Steven Crowl (18 points on 8 for 10 from the floor), John Tonje (15), Xavier Amos (11) and Nolan Winter (10). Tonje, the second-team All-American who played his first four years of college up the road at Colorado State, made all nine of his free throws.",

      "Williams, the Grizzlies\u2019 leading scorer this season, was blanketed by Blackwell most of the game and finished with eight points on 2-for-8 shooting.",
      "The commotion rippling through Ball Arena over a couple of late garbage-time possessions for Montana likely had to do with the 16 1/2-point spread on this game.",
      "Adam Shoff and Jeremiah Dargan each had relatively open 3-point looks in the last minute, but neither hit the rim and the Badgers covered.",

      "Baseball in Japan \u2014 the game is called \"yakyu\" (field ball) in Japanese \u2014 carries more of a rock-concert vibe than its American cousin. And with Shohei Ohtani teasing fans for a week in Tokyo as the two-game series approached, it\u2019s a true spectacle.",
      "You don't see the following routinely in North America. You did Tuesday in the Tokyo Dome.",
      "Young women carry beer kegs on their backs, drawing a cold draft while you're seated watching the game. Fans are clearly more animated. Even elderly men come with a glove \u2014 just in case. And chopsticks are in use as fans watching the game snack on noodles or a rice dish.",
      "The food selection at the concession stands is mostly Asian, but popcorn and beer are plentiful. You can even buy a version of Cracker Jack.",
      "Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said he played baseball in Puerto Rico and Mexico and suggested the Japanese game and the Latin American game were linked.",
      "\u201cI would say the similarity is the passion from the fans. I think in Tokyo it's a little more controlled emotion, chaos. Where in Latin America, playing winter ball \u2014 in the best possible way \u2014 it's chaotic and a lot of passion.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt's definitely close,\" Dodgers Venezuelan shortstop Miguel Rojas said. \u201cThey enjoy the game a little bit different than the United States. This is the closest thing you will find (to Latin America).\"",

      "The two biggest names in college basketball these days will be playing in the women\u2019s tournament when March Madness gets into full swing",
      "It\u2019s no stretch to say the two biggest names in college basketball these days will be playing in the women\u2019s tournament when March Madness goes into full swing later this week.",
      "Whether the presence of Juju Watkins of USC and Paige Bueckers of UConn will overcome the game\u2019s loss of Caitlin Clark and drive a repeat of last year\u2019s history-making surge in viewership is among the underlying questions over the next three weeks.",
      "One of the surest signs of the growing popularity of the women's game came last year, when the final of the tournament, featuring Clark's Iowa Hawkeyes against coach Dawn Staley\u2019s South Carolina juggernaut,drew more viewers than the men\u2019s final between UConn and Purdue.",
      "It was a first, driven in part by the fact that the men\u2019s game wasn\u2019t on an over-the-air network and the women\u2019s was, but also thanks to the legion of Clark fans, many of whom have followed her to the WNBA.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m hard-pressed to believe they\u2019re going to reach the Caitlin Clark number again, because that was a comet that probably won\u2019t be repeated this year,\u201d Kevin Hull, a sports media professor at South Carolina, said of the 18.87 million who tuned into the women's title game last year. \u201cBut they\u2019re going to get a really good number again. It\u2019s a great time to be in women\u2019s sports.\u201d",
      "Besides Duke freshman Cooper Flagg, there aren\u2019t any men\u2019s players who can rival the numbers Bueckers or Watkins put up in what might be the most important metric in today's world \u2013 their social media followings. Last week, in a notable transaction, Watkins became the first woman college athlete to sign an endorsement deal with Fanatics.",
      "It\u2019s not to say there aren\u2019t compelling story lines in the men\u2019s tournament. But as has often been the case, they have more to do with coaches \u2013 think, Rick Pitino at St. John\u2019s \u2013 or programs \u2013 think Duke or North Carolina \u2014 than with individual players.",
      "Last year's biggest name on the men's side was Purdue's Zach Edey, a well-spoken but generally quiet 7-foot-4 center from Canada whose old-school post-up game sparked a fascinating debate for hardcore hoops junkies, but didn't bring the rest of the world in.",
      "For decades, though, none of that ever prevented the men\u2019s tournament from outdrawing the women. Among the advantages for the men: more backing from the NCAA, a longer history as a sport and a deeper, more competitive field from 1-68, which, in turn, spawns more upsets and Cinderella stories.",
      "Without some of those built-in advantages, the women\u2019s game has had to embark on a slow, steady climb.",
      "Hull believes one landmark moment was the success of the U.S. women\u2019s soccer team in the 1990s, which \u201ckind of changed the game when it came to all women\u2019s sports.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd we\u2019ve seen it in the years since, with the WNBA and all these other sports,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd Caitlin Clark was the right person at the right time, who just sort of turned the spark into a flame.\u201d",
      "The women\u2019s tournament was already surging in popularity in 2021 (the first year ESPN broadcast every game nationally) when Sedona Prince lit a fuse with her viral video of the sparse weight room available to the players at their base in San Antonio.",
      "It forced a reckoning with some of the longstanding inequalities between the men\u2019s and women\u2019s games. The most devastating was the huge disparity of the TV contracts but perhaps the best illustration of the imbalance came in the fact that the NCAA didn\u2019t even use the \u201cMarch Madness\u201d title for the women\u2019s tournament.",
      "The renegotiation of the TV contract (some say for not enough), combined with Clark\u2019s rise and a layering of some Magic-vs.-Bird-like racial tension between Clark and Angel Reese (who say they have no problem with each other) helped push popularity and viewership to the heights seen last year.",
      "Len Elmore, the longtime player and TV analyst who now teaches sports management at Columbia, suggested the Clark vs. Reese vibe created a tension that many Americans can't turn away from. He also said \u201csome people like the women\u2019s game better than the men\u2019s game for a number of fundamental basketball reasons.\u201d",
      "Earlier this year, the NCAA announced that women's teams, for the first time, would receive payments \u2014 known as \u201cunits\u201d \u2014 for playing in March Madness.",
      "\u201cA lot of it has to do with us being treated like a sport now,\u201d said Staley, whose Gamecocks are top seeded as they embark on their quest for back-to-back titles. \u201cWhen you treat us like a sport, you will get a return on your investment.\u201d",
      "Most signs point toward last year\u2019s ratings as part of a sustainable trend.",
      "A matchup between Watkins and Bueckers in December averaged 2.2 million viewers, making it the second-most watched women\u2019s game ever on Fox, behind one last season in which Clark set the NCAA scoring record. ESPN\u2019s regular-season ratings were up 3% from last year and 41% from two seasons ago.",
      "Next comes March Madness, where Watkins and Bueckers could face a rematch in the regional finals, while Staley and South Carolina are positioned on the other side of the bracket, setting up a possible meeting with one of them in the final on April 6.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m pretty confident in saying that the days of the men\u2019s Final Four dwarfing the women\u2019s -- double, three-times viewership \u2013 those days are long gone,\u201d Hull said. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t surprise me if the women\u2019s gets more. There\u2019s buzz now, and the TV networks are treating it as a big deal.\u201d",

      "Now, it\u2019s the super sophomore\u2019s time to shine, leading No. 1 seed Southern California in pursuit of a deeper run than its Elite Eight appearance a year ago.",
      "\u201cEvery year the goal is to break others\u2019 opinions,\u201d she said.",
      "The Trojans (28-3) host 16th-seeded UNC Greensboro (25-6) in a first-round game Saturday at Galen Center.",
      "USC was the Big Ten regular-season champion in its first year in the league, losing to crosstown rival and overall NCAA Tournament No. 1 seed UCLA in the tournament title game. The Trojans' other defeats were to Notre Dame and Iowa.",
      "Watkins is averaging 24.6 points \u2014 2.5 less than last year \u2014 and 6.9 rebounds while playing 35 minutes a game. She\u2019s notched six games with 30 or more points, her best being a 40-point effort against California Baptist.",
      "Last season, Watkins led USC to the program\u2019s deepest run in the NCAA Tournament in over 25 years. She was the nation\u2019s No. 2 scorer, averaging 27.1 points, and she led all freshmen in scoring with a record 920 points. She had 14 games with 30 or more points, including a 51-point outburst at Stanford, the most points by any men\u2019s or women\u2019s player in the nation.",
      "Still, the urge to be better is always there.",
      "\u201cShe looks at what she can improve first. She never points a finger at somebody else,\u201d USC coach Lindsay Gottlieb said. \u201cIt\u2019s always where can she grow and that\u2019s a pretty remarkable trait for a 19-year-old.\u201d",
      "Part of Watkins\u2019 support system is Phil Handy, a 53-year-old former Los Angeles Lakers assistant who coached in the women\u2019s Unrivaled Basketball League this season. They met through a mutual family friend when Watkins was in eighth grade.",
      "\u201cI saw the drive in her, I saw her curiousness, what does it look like to be great,\u201d Handy recalled in a phone interview.",
      "Watkins credits Handy for being \u201cvery there for me.\u201d He views himself as her \u201ctrainer, coach, big brother, uncle.\u201d They text regularly and watch game film together over Zoom. When Handy is in town, they hit the gym.",
      "\u201cWhenever there\u2019s work to do, she\u2019s never saying no,\u201d he said.",
      "Through watching more film this season, Watkins has toiled to match her basketball knowledge with her formidable skills on the court.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s really challenged herself in that way to become a smarter player to where she understands how to read defenses and what teams are doing,\u201d Handy said.",
      "Watkins chose to attend college in her hometown \u2014 just a few miles from her primarily Hispanic and Black neighborhood of Watts \u2014 and the community comes out to support her. Men, women and children of all ages and races clamor for photos and autographs after games and Watkins patiently rewards them.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s pretty remarkable in how she handles the sort of craziness around her,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cShe\u2019s a natural introvert.\u201d",
      "A massive three-panel mural of Watkins wearing her iconic bun in a Nike ad went up on a building in downtown Los Angeles last month.",
      "\u201cHow cool,\u201d Gottlieb said, \u201cbut she shows up here and I tell her to play better defense or make the right read. She\u2019s so coachable and humble.\u201d",
      "Watkins downplays talk of her succeeding Caitlin Clark as the face of women\u2019s college basketball.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s an honor, but I don\u2019t really think about that much,\u201d she said. \u201cThe main goal is just staying present here and handling business.\u201d",
      "Her off-court business overseen by Klutch Sports is thriving. She has NIL deals with Nike, Fanatics, snack maker Mondelez, United Airlines, Degree deodorant, State Farm, Gatorade and collectibles company Funko, among others. Her NIL valuation is one of the highest in the country at an estimated $739,000, according to On3.com.",
      "Watkins is bolstered by her family, including parents Robert and Sari, both former college athletes who are ever-present in the front row. Her sister, Mali, sometimes sings the national anthem at games.",
      "\u201cThey always tell me, \u2018Just go out there and do you,'\" she said.",
      "Seeing Watkins in person has become a hotter ticket. The Trojans\u2019 average home attendance rose to 5,932 this season from last year\u2019s 4,421. Celebrities like Snoop Dogg, Kevin Hart, Jason Sudeikis, Michael B. Jordan and Sanaa Lathan, who starred in \u201cLove & Basketball,\u201d one of Watkins\u2019 favorite movies, have showed up. The year before she arrived attendance averaged 1,037.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re trying to make it feel like football,\u201d she said, referring to USC\u2019s biggest sport. \u201cThat\u2019s my goal here, to make it feel like a big thing.\u201d",
      "Watkins, of course, is the main focus of opposing defenders who by now know her go-to spots on the floor and try to take them away. But she\u2019s got a running mate in forward Kiki Iriafen, a graduate transfer from Stanford who returned to her hometown.",
      "Iriafen\u2019s 18.2-point average is second to Watkins while her field goal, 3-point and free throw averages are all higher than the sophomore.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s raising my IQ in all ways and pushing me to be a better player,\u201d Watkins said.",
      "UCLA coach Cori Close has seen Watkins up close, with the Bruins losing two of three to the Trojans this season. Close cites Watkins\u2019 \u201celite-level work ethic\u201d as one of the reasons she\u2019s so good. Watkins is known for hitting USC\u2019s gym at night to put up hundreds of shots, similar to the late Kobe Bryant\u2019s diligence.",
      "\u201cWhen you\u2019re driven by success sometimes there is no balance,\u201d Handy said.",
      "Last year, a loss pushed Watkins to lonely hours of work, but she\u2019s learning moderation.",
      "\u201cSometimes it\u2019s OK to walk away from it for a little bit,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m watching \u2018Severance\u2019 right now. Just watch a TV show, chill and get back to it the next day.\u201d",
      "Watkins' placid facial expression belies whatever is happening on the court. Behind closed doors, however, Handy sees her fiery side when she misses shots or doesn't pick up something as quick as she expects.",
      "\u201cShe just has an appetite,\u201d he said. \u201cIt definitely reminds you of great athletes before her time, the Kobes, the MJs, the women's players.\u201d",
      "It's almost go-time for the Trojans and that means Watkins is narrowing her mental focus.",
      "\u201cNow I'm kind of in this space where nothing else is around me,\u201d she said. \u201cJust go tunnel vision for as long as possible.\u201d",

      "MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. -- Calling the groups in charge of professional tennis \u201ca cartel,\u201d the players' association co-founded by Novak Djokovic filed an antitrust lawsuit against the women's and men's tours, the International Tennis Federation and the sport's integrity agency on Tuesday in federal court in New York.",
      "The suit by the Professional Tennis Players' Association says the organizations that run the sport hold \u201ccomplete control over the players\u2019 pay and working conditions\u201d and their setup constitutes \u201ctextbook violations of state and federal law\u201d that \u201cimmunize professional tennis from ordinary market forces and deny professional tennis players and other industry participants their right to fair competition.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit seeks a jury trial and wants players to gain access to more earnings, arguing that the governing bodies that oversee the four Grand Slam tournaments \u2014 Wimbledon, the U.S. Open, the French Open and the Australian Open \u2014 and other professional events \u201ccap the prize money tournaments award and limit players\u2019 ability to earn money off the court.\u201d",

      "\u201cThe PTPA has consistently chosen division and distraction through misinformation over progress,\u201d the ATP's statement said. \u201cFive years on from its inception in 2020, the PTPA has struggled to establish a meaningful role in tennis, making its decision to pursue legal action at this juncture unsurprising.\u201d",
      "The ITF and the International Tennis Integrity Agency \u2014 which investigates and adjudicates doping and corruption cases \u2014 declined to comment.",
      "The PTPA was founded by 24-time Grand Slam champion Djokovic and Vasek Pospisil in August 2020, aiming to offer representation for players who are independent contractors in a largely individual sport. One of the goals made clear along the way was to become a sort of full-fledged union that negotiates collective bargaining agreements like those that exist in team sports.",
      "\u201cFor the past few years, the PTPA, an organization I\u2019ve worked on tirelessly since its inception, has made countless efforts to collaborate with the tours in hopes of achieving positive change for players. Despite these efforts and attempts to engage in constructive dialogue, we were met with resistance and a lack of meaningful action. It is because of this ongoing disregard for players that we were left with no alternative but to take action of our own,\u201d Pospisil posted on social media. \u201cFor too long, players have been forced to accept a broken system that ignores our well-being, undervalues our contributions, and leaves us without real representation.\u201d",
      "Djokovic is not one of the players listed as a plaintiff.",
      "\u201cHis support for this is already explicit. It\u2019s redundant since PTPA (is) named as plaintiff, and he is on (the executive committee),\u201d PTPA spokesman David Cooper wrote in an email. \u201cHe wanted to allow others to step up since this is not just Novak\u2019s (organization).\u201d",
      "The PTPA said it met with more than 250 players \u2014 women and men, and a majority of the top 20 in the WTA and ATP rankings \u2014 before going to court.",
      "\u201cTennis is broken,\u201d PTPA executive director Ahmad Nassar said in a news release. \u201cBehind the glamorous veneer that the defendants promote, players are trapped in an unfair system that exploits their talent, suppresses their earnings, and jeopardizes their health and safety. We have exhausted all options for reform through dialogue, and the governing bodies have left us no choice but to seek accountability through the courts. Fixing these systemic failures isn\u2019t about disrupting tennis \u2014 it\u2019s about saving it for the generations of players and fans to come.\u201d",

      "\u201cThe track\u2019s structure is done. We had it in our calendars to finish by March 16 and that\u2019s when it was finished,\u201d Fabio Saldini, the government commissioner in charge of rebuilding the century-old track in Cortina d\u2019Ampezzo, told The Associated Press on Tuesday.",
      "Construction workers celebrated Sunday\u2019s milestone by laying down a branch of an evergreen tree across the track.",
      "\u201cThe tree branch represents a starting point, like when (bobsled) teams get ready to push off before launching themselves down the track,\u201d said Luca Zaia, president of the Veneto region that includes Cortina. \u201cI hope that the enthusiasm builds minute by minute in a crescendo worthy of an event of this magnitude.\u201d",
      "Twenty workers preparing ice on the track day and night are slated to finish by Sunday.",
      "Then starting on Monday, bobsled, luge and skeleton athletes will perform test runs in order to secure preliminary certification \u2014 homologation is the technical word \u2014 for the track. Also coming are 26 coaches, plus officials from the International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation, International Luge Federation, and the International Olympic Committee.",
      "Even preliminary approval would go a long way toward avoiding a backup Plan B option that the IOC had demanded and which would require moving the three sliding sports all the way to Lake Placid, New York, if the track in Italy wasn\u2019t finished in time.",
      "\u201cAs of today, 50% of the ice is ready,\u201d Saldini said. \u201cWe had some trouble last week due to high temperatures, rain and snow. But then we covered the track with nets and yesterday we actually put down too much ice.\u201d",
      "Security has been increased around the track since a refrigeration tube was removed and placed across a road in a reported act of sabotage last month, according to the government agency, Simico.",
      "Besides the sliding events, Cortina will also host women\u2019s Alpine skiing and curling during the Winter Games.",
      "Pre-fabricated mobile homes that will host up to 1,400 athletes in an Athletes' Village in Cortina are being put in place this month. The mobile homes will also be used for athletes during the Paralympics.",

      "Democratic lawmakers are courting online content creators, podcasters and celebrities in a bid to find new ways to boost their message to voters",
      "WASHINGTON -- For weeks, Democratic lawmakers have met with and mimicked figures they believe may offer them a path back to power in Washington: online influencers and content creators.",
      "Hours before President Donald Trump\u2019s joint address to Congress this month, Senate Democrats huddled with a dozen online progressive personalities who have millions of followers. House Democrats were introduced, without staff, to 40 content creators who Democratic leaders said could help them grow their audience online.",
      "An earlier tutorial session in February featured online personalities like the YouTube commentator Brian Tyler Cohen.",
      "The result has been a burst of Democratic online content, including direct-to-camera explainers in parked cars, scripted vertical videos, podcast appearances and livestreams \u2014 some topping trending charts online, others drawing mockery from liberal allies and Republicans in Congress.",
      "But while the Democratic Party is largely divided over the path forward after last year's election losses, party leaders agree that, no matter the message, how they connect with voters in the digital media landscape will be key to a political comeback.",
      "More than a dozen Democratic senators, asked about the party\u2019s digital strategy, pointed to Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey as the architect of their new push.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve seen tremendous growth of Democratic senators now. They\u2019re engaging in the tools and strategies necessary to elevate their voice in a new, changing media market, where legacy media is not the place that people get their news now,\u201d Booker said. \u201cWe\u2019re just weeks into this, but just by making key changes ... we\u2019re seeing a massive growth in engagement with the content that our senators are creating, and we\u2019ve only just begun.\"",
      "Booker said he's aiming for Democratic senators to double online engagement with their content over the next year \u2014 and early metrics have been noticeable. Democratic senators racked up more than 87 million views on content they published in response to Trump's joint address to Congress, according to Booker's office.",
      "Not all of that online engagement is positive. After more than two dozen Democratic senators posted identical scripted videos knocking Trump's speech, saying he should have addressed the cost of living and his support for billionaire adviser Elon Musk, conservatives mocked them as inauthentic and out of touch.",
      "\"They are all actors reading a script,\" Musk wrote on X, the social media platform he owns.",
      "There's no doubt that Democrats are playing catch-up. Trump and his fellow Republicans built a digital operation that fed on bombast and celebrity, and it's a strategy they've taken with them to the White House. Official government accounts are new filled with right-wing memes, cinematic videos and pugnacious statements.",
      "The Democratic embrace of influencers has also yielded mixed early results. Democrats were ridiculed online after a food and wellness influencer who attended the House Democrats' creators event created a \u201cChoose Your Fighter\" video collage of Democratic congresswomen for Women's History Month.",
      "The White House posted a video in response that read \u201cAmerica chose its fighters last November,\u201d and the Pentagon, normally known for being studiously non-partisan, posted a video stating \u201cWe chose our fighters a long time ago.\u201d",
      "But Booker and other Democratic leaders don't consider the sneers to be a downside. Missteps are to be expected, they say, but the path to Americans' attention will require some discomfort from lawmakers.",
      "\u201cI do think that the caucus as a whole is trying to figure out how we show people that we are real people,\u201d said Rep. Jasmine Crockett of Texas, one of the congresswomen featured in the viral \u201cFighter\u201d video. Crockett, whose posts regularly garner millions of views online, said she was used to criticism for her often frank statements and was more interested in combating perceptions that Democrats are \u201celitist\u201d or \u201crobotic.\u201d",
      "\u201cI didn't like the jumping, I'm going to be honest, though,\u201d Crockett added about the viral \u201cChoose Your Fighter\u201d video.",
      "Democrats adopted a more combative stance online in recent weeks as Trump's moves to slash the federal workforce drew protests from liberals and pushback at GOP town halls. Top Democratic digital operatives who worked for the 2024 presidential campaign of then-Vice President Kamala Harris have been in high demand, with many Democrats anticipating close 2026 races in which digital strategies may be key.",
      "Some of the most prominent Democrats across the country have been engaging more in new media since the election. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York has touted the party's message on progressive podcasts over the last month, including from the comedian Jon Stewart and the progressive outlet MeidasTouch. Clips of those videos were also lampooned online but garnered millions of views.",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a potential Democratic presidential contender in 2028, has launched a podcast of his own on which he has welcomed close Trump allies like the right-wing activist Charlie Kirk and former Trump aide Steve Bannon to discuss hot-button political topics.",
      "\u201cWe want to make sure we hit the podcasters that normally don\u2019t have Democrats on there,\u201d said Rep. Derek Tran, a Democrat from a competitive California House district. \u201cThe ones that are more right-leaning or independent, and be able to address a crowd and an audience that\u2019s not typical for the Democratic base.\u201d",
      "Some House Democrats have expressed frustration that the guidance from Democratic leaders about social media is too vague, while others grumble that leaders are too prescriptive in their approach to messaging on platforms they don\u2019t intuitively understand. Meanwhile, Democratic strategists have cautioned lawmakers that garnering attention online is secondary to the goal of using social media as a tool in specific policy fights and campaigns.",
      "\u201cI think there\u2019s a fine line before we\u2019re being cringe and trying too hard and seeming too thirsty. I think the most important thing in any of this is being as authentic and genuine as we can be,\u201d said Rep. Sara Jacobs, D-Calif.",
      "\u201cWhen it comes to authenticity, it also means leaning into what makes each of us unique. Like many of my colleagues probably should not be doing \u2018get ready with me\u2019 videos. It would look super cringe. But I\u2019m a 36-year-old woman, and I do my makeup all the time, and I watch a lot of makeup tutorial videos, so it makes sense for me to do it,\u201d said Jacobs.",
      "Some Democrats think that the party's messaging strategy hinges as much on the messengers as the medium it\u2019s communicated on.",
      "\u201cIf you know how to talk to people, it doesn\u2019t matter what medium is going to exist,\u201d said Sen. Ruben Gallego, a freshman Democratic senator from Arizona. \u201cYou could be the best freaking spokesperson in the world, but if you don\u2019t know how to talk to working-class people, it doesn\u2019t matter if you have the best TikTok following, it\u2019s just not going to translate.\u201d",

      "Fishermen say the swarms began about three weeks ago and blame a 2024 mass die-off of juvenile fish, known as fry, that are the main predators of midge larvae. Similar invasions have occurred in the past, and fishermen say the die-offs are the result of overall oxygen depletion in the lagoon ecosystem.",
      "On Thursday, Orbetello city hall allocated 300,000 euros ($327,000) and promised a series of specific emergency interventions to combat the invasion, following a meeting with key trade associations.",
      "A permanent commission was created and the emergency measures would aim to \u201cprotect citizens and economic activities in the area,\u201d Mayor Andrea Casamenti said in a statement. But no details were immediately released.",
      "Local residents want more, demanding that the Tuscan region declare a state of emergency to free up even further funding. A change.org petition \u201cSave the Orbetello Lagoon\u201d had registered more than 19,000 signatures by late Thursday.",
      "\u201cWe cannot take a walk in the open air. We cannot open the windows. We are segregated in the house\" like during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, the petition read. It blamed ineffective management of the lagoon for the calamity.",
      "Pier Luigi Piro, president of the Orbetello fishermen cooperative, said that the lagoon ecosystem needs serious infrastructural investments to clean out canals and favor the exchange of water between the lagoon and the Tyrrhenian. He said that he hoped that the consortium of the mayor's office and trade groups that have come together to deal with the crisis gets to work as soon as possible.",
      "\u201cEverything we're doing, we hope to have a serene tourist season, otherwise beyond the damage a lot of activities will risk closure,\u201d he warned.",

      "As a devastating wildfire burned through a Maui town, killing more than 100 people, emergency management employees traded dozens of text messages, creating a record that would later help investigators piece together the government's response to the 2023 tragedy.",
      "One text exchange hinted officials might also be using a second, untraceable messaging service.",
      "\u201cThat's what Signal was supposed to be for,\u201d then-Maui Emergency Management Agency Administrator Herman Andaya texted a colleague.",
      "Signal is one of many end-to-end encrypted messaging apps that include message auto-delete functions.",
      "While such apps promise increased security and privacy, they often skirt open records laws meant to increase transparency around and public awareness of government decision-making. Without special archiving software, the messages frequently aren't returned under public information requests.",
      "An Associated Press review in all 50 states found accounts on encrypted platforms registered to cellphone numbers for over 1,100 government workers and elected officials.",
      "It's unclear if Maui officials actually used the app or simply considered it \u2014 a county spokesperson did not respond to questions \u2014 but the situation highlights a growing challenge: How can government entities use technological advancements for added security while staying on the right side of public information laws?",
      "The AP found accounts for state, local and federal officials in nearly every state, including many legislators and their staff, but also staff for governors, state attorneys general, education departments and school board members.",
      "The AP is not naming the officials because having an account is neither against the rules in most states, nor proof they use the apps for government business. While many of those accounts were registered to government cellphone numbers, some were registered to personal numbers. The AP's list is likely incomplete because users can make accounts unsearchable.",
      "Improper use of the apps has been reported over the past decade in places like Missouri, Oregon, Oklahoma, Maryland and elsewhere, almost always because of leaked messages.",
      "Public officials and private citizens are consistently warned about hacking and data leaks, but technologies designed to increase privacy often decrease government transparency.",
      "Apps like Signal, WhatsApp, Confide, Telegram and others use encryption to scramble messages so only the intended end-user can read them, and they typically aren\u2019t stored on government servers. Some automatically delete messages, and some prevent users from screenshotting or sharing messages.",
      "\u201cThe fundamental problem is that people do have a right to use encrypted apps for their personal communications, and have those on their personal devices. That\u2019s not against the law,\u201d said Matt Kelly, editor of Radical Compliance, a newsletter that focuses on corporate compliance and governance issues. \u201cBut how would an organization be able to distinguish how an employee is using it?\u201d",
      "The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, has recommended that \u201chighly valued targets\u201d \u2014 senior officials who handle sensitive information \u2014 use encryption apps for confidential communications. Those communications are not typically releasable under public record laws.",
      "CISA leaders also say encrypted communications could be a useful security measure for the public, but did not encourage government officials to use the apps to skirt public information laws.",
      "Journalists, including many at the AP, often use encrypted messages when talking to sources or whistleblowers.",
      "While some cities and states are grappling with how to stay transparent, public record laws aren\u2019t evolving as quickly as technology, said Smarsh general manager Lanika Mamac. The Portland, Oregon-based company helps governments and businesses archive digital communications.",
      "\u201cPeople are worried more about cybersecurity attacks. They\u2019re trying to make sure it\u2019s secure,\u201d Mamac said. \u201cI think that they are really trying to figure out, \u2018How do I balance being secure and giving transparency?\u2019\u201d",
      "Mamac said Smarsh has seen an uptick in inquiries, mostly from local governments. But many others have done little to restrict the apps or clarify rules for their use.",
      "In 2020, the New Mexico Child, Youth and Families Department\u2019s new division director told employees to use the app Signal for internal communications and to delete messages after 24 hours. A 2021 investigation into the possible violation of New Mexico\u2019s document retention rules was followed by a court settlement with two whistleblowers and the division director's departure.",
      "But New Mexico still lacks regulations on using encrypted apps. The AP's review found at least three department or agency directors had Signal accounts as of December 2024.",
      "In Michigan, State Police leaders were found in 2021 to be using Signal on state-issued cellphones. Michigan lawmakers responded by banning the use of encrypted messaging apps on state employees\u2019 work-issued devices if they hinder public record requests.",
      "However, Michigan's law did not include penalties for violations, and monitoring the government-owned devices used by 48,000 executive branch employees is a monumental task.",
      "The best remedy is stronger public record laws, said David Cuillier, director of the Brechner Freedom of Information Project at the University of Florida. Most state laws already make clear that the content of communication \u2014 not the method \u2014 is what makes something a public record, but many of those laws lack teeth, he said.",
      "\u201cThey should only be using apps if they are able to report the communications and archive them like any other public record,\u201d he said.",
      "Generally, Cuillier said, there\u2019s been a decrease in government transparency over the past few decades. To reverse that, governments could create independent enforcement agencies, add punishments for violations, and create a transparent culture that supports technology, he said.",
      "\u201cWe used to be a beacon of light when it came to transparency. Now, we\u2019re not. We have lost our way,\u201d Cuillier said.",

But that amount of carbon removal is a tiny fraction of what scientists say will be required to keep the planet livable for centuries to come.",
      "Those leading the efforts, including Will Burt, Planetary\u2019s chief ocean scientist, acknowledge they\u2019re entering uncharted territory \u2014 but say the bigger danger for the planet and the oceans is not moving quickly enough.",
      "\u201cWe need to understand if it\u2019s going to work or not. The faster we do, the better.\u201d",
      "Efforts to capture carbon dioxide have exploded in recent years.",
      "Most climate models now show that cutting emissions won\u2019t be enough to curb global warming, according to the United Nations\u2019 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The world needs to actively remove heat-trapping gases, as well \u2014 and the ocean could be a logical place to capture them.",
      "Money has already poured into different strategies on land \u2014 among them, pumping carbon dioxide from the air, developing sites to store carbon underground and replanting forests, which naturally store CO2. But many of those projects are limited by space and could impact nearby communities. The ocean already regulates Earth\u2019s climate by absorbing heat and carbon, and by comparison, it seems limitless.",
      "\u201cIs that huge surface area an option to help us deal with and mitigate the worst effects of climate change?\u201d asked Adam Subhas, who is leading a carbon removal project with the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, based on Cape Cod, Massachusetts.",
      "On a Tuesday afternoon along the edge of Halifax Harbour, Burt stashed his bike helmet and donned a hard hat to give two engineering students a tour of Planetary\u2019s site.",
      "A detached truck trailer sat in a clearing, storing massive bags of magnesium oxide mined in Spain and shipped across the Atlantic to Canada.",
      "Most companies looking offshore for climate solutions are trying to reduce or transform the carbon dioxide stored in the ocean. If they can achieve that, Burt said, the oceans will act \u201clike a vacuum\u201d to absorb more gases from the air.",
      "Planetary is using magnesium oxide to create that vacuum. When dissolved into seawater, it transforms carbon dioxide from a gas to stable molecules that won\u2019t interact with the atmosphere for thousands of years. Limestone, olivine and other alkaline rocks have the same effect.",
      "Other companies are focused on growing seaweed and algae to capture the gas. These marine organisms act like plants on land, absorbing carbon dioxide from the ocean just as trees do from the air. The company Gigablue, for instance, has begun pouring nutrients in New Zealand waters to grow tiny organisms known as phytoplankton where they otherwise couldn\u2019t survive.",
      "Still others view the deepest parts of the ocean as a place to store organic material that would emit greenhouse gases if left on land.",
      "Companies have sunk wood chips off the coast of Iceland and are planning to sink Sargassum, a yellowish-brown seaweed, to extreme depths. The startup Carboniferous is preparing a federal permit to place sugarcane pulp at the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico, also referred to as the Gulf of America as declared by President Donald Trump.",
      "Though Planetary's work can sound like some \u201cscary science experiment,\u201d Burt said, the company\u2019s testing so far suggests that magnesium oxide poses minimal risks to marine ecosystems, plankton or fish. The mineral has long been used at water treatment plants and industrial facilities to de-acidify water.",
      "Halifax Harbour is just one location where Planetary hopes to operate. The company has set up another site at a wastewater treatment plant in coastal Virginia and plans to begin testing in Vancouver later this year.",
      "According to the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, the industry needs to remove billions of tons of carbon dioxide per year by mid-century to meet climate goals set nearly a decade ago during the Paris climate agreement.",
      "\u201cThe whole point here is to mitigate against a rapidly accelerating climate crisis,\u201d Burt said. \u201cWe have to act with safety and integrity, but we also have to act fast.\u201d",
      "While there\u2019s broad enthusiasm in the industry, coastal communities aren\u2019t always quick to jump on board.",
      "In North Carolina, a request to dump shiploads of olivine near the beachside town of Duck prompted questions that downsized the project by more than half.",
      "The company Vesta, formed in 2021, promotes the greenish-hued mineral as a tool to draw down carbon into the ocean and create mounds that buffer coastal towns from storm surges and waves.",
      "During the permitting process, officials at the state Wildlife Resources Commission, Division of Marine Fisheries and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service raised a long list of concerns.",
      "\u201cAs proposed, the project is a short term study with the potential for long term impacts and no remediation plans,\u201d a field supervisor for the Fish and Wildlife Service wrote. The agencies said olivine could smother the seafloor ecosystem and threaten a hotspot for sea turtles and Atlantic sturgeon.",
      "Vesta CEO Tom Green said the company never expected its original application to be approved as written. \u201cIt\u2019s more the start of a dialogue with regulators and the community,\u201d he said.",
      "The project went forward last summer with a much smaller scope, a restoration plan, and more detailed requirements to monitor deep-water species. Eight thousand metric tons of olivine shipped from Norway are now submerged beneath North Carolina\u2019s waves.",
      "Green said he understands why people are skeptical, and that he tries to remind them Vesta\u2019s goal is to save the environment, not to harm it. It\u2019s the company\u2019s job, he says, \u201cto show up in local communities, physically show up, and listen and share our data and build trust that way.\u201d",
      "Fishing communities have opposed another climate project led by Subhas of the Woods Hole research center that has generated 10 months of conversation and debate.",
      "The project as proposed last spring would have poured 66,000 gallons of sodium hydroxide solution into ocean waters near Cape Cod. Woods Hole later proposed downsizing the project to use less than 17,000 gallons of the chemical, with federal approval still pending.",
      "In two separate reviews, the Environmental Protection Agency said it believes the project\u2019s scientific merit outweighs the environmental risks, and noted it doesn\u2019t foresee \u201cunacceptable impacts\u201d on water quality or fishing.",
      "But fifth-generation fisherman Jerry Leeman III wants to know what will happen to the lobster, pollock and flounder eggs that float in the water column and on the ocean surface if they are suddenly doused with the harsh chemical.",
      "\u201cAre you telling all the fishermen not to fish in this area while you\u2019re doing this project? And who compensates these individuals for displacing everybody?\u201d he said.",
      "Subhas\u2019 team expects the chemical\u2019s most potent concentrations to last for less than two minutes in the ocean before it\u2019s diluted. They\u2019ve also agreed to delay or relocate the project if schools of fish or patches of fish eggs are visible in the surrounding waters.",
      "Sarah Schumann, who fishes commercially for bluefish in Rhode Island and leads a campaign for \u201cfishery friendly\u201d climate action, said after attending four listening sessions she\u2019s still unsure how to balance her support for the research with the apprehension she hears in the fishing community.",
      "\u201cIf I was actually trying to decide where I land on this issue, I\u2019d be twisted in knots,\u201d she said.",
      "And Planetary, which has seen little pushback from locals along Halifax Harbour, faced a series of protests against a climate project it proposed in Cornwall, England.",
      "In April last year, more than a hundred people marched along a beach carrying signs that read \u201cKeep our sea chemical free.\u201d",
      "Sue Sayer, who runs a research group studying seals, said she realized in discussions with Planetary that \u201cthey had no idea about what animals or plants or species live in St. Ives Bay.\u201d The company\u2019s initial release of magnesium hydroxide into the bay, she said, fired up a community that is \u201cmassively, scientifically passionate about the sea.\u201d",
      "David Santillo, a senior scientist with Greenpeace Research Laboratories at the University of Exeter, took issue with how Planetary proposed tracking the impact of its work. According to a recorded presentation viewed by AP, the company\u2019s baseline measurements in Cornwall were drawn from just a few days.",
      "\u201cIf you don\u2019t have a baseline over a number of years and seasons,\u201d Santillo said, \u201cyou don\u2019t know whether you would even be able to detect any of your effects.\u201d",
      "An audit commissioned by the United Kingdom\u2019s Environment Agency found that Planetary\u2019s experiments posed a \u201cvery low\u201d risk to marine life, and a potential for significant carbon removal.",
      "Still, the company put its proposal to pump another 200 metric tons of minerals on pause. Following a government recommendation, Planetary said it would search for a source of magnesium hydroxide closer to the Cornwall site, rather than shipping it from China. It also assured locals that it wouldn\u2019t sell carbon credits from its past chemical release.",
      "Sara Nawaz, research director at American University\u2019s Institute for Responsible Carbon Removal, said she understood why scientists sometimes struggle to connect with communities and gain their support. Early research shows the public is reluctant to the idea of \u201cengineering\u201d the climate.",
      "Many people have a strong emotional connection to the ocean, she added. There\u2019s a fear that once you put something in the ocean, \u201cyou can\u2019t take it back.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s not just locals who have questions about whether these technologies will work. Scientists, too, have acknowledged major unknowns. But some of the principles behind the technologies have been studied for decades by now, and the laboratory can only simulate so much.",
      "During a recent EPA listening session about the Woods Hole project, a chorus of oceanographers and industry supporters said it\u2019s time for ocean-scale tests.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s an urgency to move ahead and conduct this work,\u201d said Ken Buesseler, another Woods Hole scientist who studies the carbon captured by algae.",
      "Even so, the ocean is a dynamic, challenging landscape to work in. Scientists are still uncovering new details about how it absorbs and recycles carbon, and any materials they add to seawater are liable to sink, become diluted or wash away to other locations, challenging efforts to track how the ocean responds.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s so hard to get the ocean to do what you want it to,\u201d said Sarah Cooley, a carbon cycle scientist who has worked for the nonprofit Ocean Conservancy and the federal government.",
      "Katja Fennel, chair of the oceanography department at Dalhousie University, works on modeling how much carbon Planetary has captured in Halifax Harbour\u2014 a number that comes with some uncertainty.",
      "She co-leads a group of academics that monitors the company\u2019s project using water samples, sensors and sediment cores taken from locations around the bay. Some days, her team adds a red dye to the pipes to watch how the minerals dissolve and flow out to sea.",
      "The models are necessary to simulate what would happen if Planetary did nothing, Fennel said. They\u2019re also necessary because the ocean is so large and deep it\u2019s impossible to collect enough data to give a complete picture of it.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t measure everywhere all the time,\u201d she said.",
      "Questions also linger about how long the carbon capture will last.",
      "It\u2019s a point especially important to companies working with algae, wood chips, or other organic materials, because depending on where they decompose, they could release carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere.",
      "The deeper the plants and algae sink, the longer the carbon stays locked away. But that\u2019s no easy feat to ensure. Running Tide, a now-shuttered company that sank nearly 20,000 metric tons of wood chips in Icelandic waters, said carbon could be sequestered for as long as three millennia or as little as 50 years.",
      "Even if these solutions do work long term, most companies are operating on too small of a scale to influence the climate. Expanding to meet current climate goals will take massive amounts of resources, energy and money.",
      "\u201cThe question is, what happens when you scale it up to billions of tons every year?\u201d said David Ho, co-founder and chief science officer of the nonprofit (C)Worthy, which works on verifying the impact of ocean-based carbon removal. \u201cAnd that\u2019s still to be determined.\u201d",
      "Planetary\u2019s Burt imagines a future in which minerals are pumped out through power plants and water treatment facilities on every major coastline in the world. But that would require a large, steady volume of magnesium oxide or similar minerals, along with the energy to mine and transport them.",
      "Seaweed and algae growth would need to expand exponentially. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine has estimated that nearly two-thirds of the world\u2019s coastline would need to be encircled by kelp to even begin to make a dent in global warming. The company Seafields, which is running tests in the Caribbean, says it envisions building a Sargassum farm between Brazil and West Africa more than 200 miles wide.",
      "There\u2019s the risk that these expansions exacerbate environmental harm that isn\u2019t detectable in small trials, and because of global water circulation, could be felt around the world.",
      "But the alternative to never trying, Ho said, is unabated climate change.",
      "Late last year, Planetary announced that its Nova Scotia project successfully captured 138 metric tons of carbon \u2013 allowing it to deliver exactly 138 carbon credits to two of the company\u2019s early investors, Shopify and Stripe.",
      "Monetizing the work is uncomfortable for many who study the ocean.",
      "\u201cOn one hand, it\u2019s encouraging more research and more science, which is good. On the other hand, it\u2019s opening doors for abuse of the system,\u201d said Paytan, the Santa Cruz professor, who has been contacted by several startups asking to collaborate.",
      "She pointed to companies that are accused of drastically overestimating the carbon they sequestered, though they bragged of restoring rainforests in Peru and replacing smoke-producing stoves in Africa.",
      "But absent more government-funded research, several companies told AP there\u2019s little way for the field to advance without selling credits.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, that\u2019s the way we\u2019ve set things up now, is that we put it in the hands of these startups to develop the techniques,\u201d said Ho.",
      "Back in his shipping container office along Halifax Harbour, Burt said he understood the unease around selling credits, and said Planetary takes seriously the need to operate openly, responsibly and cautiously. But he also says there\u2019s a need for startups that can move at a faster pace than academia.",
      "\u201cWe cannot study this solution at the same rate that we\u2019ve been studying the problems,\u201d he said. He says there\u2019s not enough time.",
      "Last year marked the hottest year in Earth\u2019s history, even as global carbon emissions are projected to reach another all-time high.",
      "\u201cWe need to reduce emissions urgently, drastically,\u201d said Fennel, the researcher studying Planetary\u2019s project. \u201cAny removal of CO2 from the atmosphere is much more difficult and costly than avoiding CO2 emissions to begin with.\u201d",
      "The industry continues to push forward. Planetary said in February that it had sequestered a total of 1,000 metric tons of carbon in the ocean, and Carboniferous completed its first test of sinking sugarcane to the seafloor. Early this year, Gigablue signed a deal for 200,000 carbon credits for dispersing nutrient-filled particles in the ocean.",
      "A growing number of companies are also using electricity to alter seawater molecules, with the same goal of prompting the ocean to absorb more carbon dioxide. The startup Ebb Carbon recently struck a deal with Microsoft to provide up to 350,000 carbon credits, and Captura, which is funded in part by investors affiliated with oil and gas production, expanded its operations from California to Hawaii.",
      "It\u2019s unclear whether the U.S. government will stall or support ocean climate work going forward. The policy landscape continues to shift as the Trump administration seeks to roll back a wide range of environmental regulations and reconsider the scientific finding that greenhouse gases endanger public health.",
      "Though White House adviser Musk has downplayed some of his past statements about global warming, four years ago his foundation committed $100 million to fund a competition for the best solution for carbon capture, of which Planetary is in the running for the top prize.",
      "The winner will be announced April 23 \u2014 the day after Earth Day.",

      "IQALUIT, Nunavut -- Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney on Tuesday announced a radar purchase from Australia and an expansion of military operations in the Arctic while visiting Canada's far north in an effort to assert sovereignty over the increasingly contested region.",
      "The prime minister's office said the Canadian $6 billion ($4.2 billion) Over-the-Horizon Radar system will provide early warning radar coverage from the Canada-United States border into the Arctic.",
      "Carney announced the purchase at a military base in the capital of the Inuit-governed territory of Nunavut on his last stop after visiting Paris and London for meetings with leaders there.",
      "\u201cArctic sovereignty is a strategic priority of our government,\u201d Carney said. \u201c\u201cCanada is, and forever will be, an Arctic nation.\"",
      "The Australian radar system will consist of a series of pillars almost a mile (1.6 kilometers) in length. Officials said that the system would have a smaller footprint than what the similar American system would take up.",

      "\u201cObviously, there are issues taking place, particularly between Canada and the United States, I wouldn\u2019t have expected to have been happening in my lifetime,\" Albanese said.",
      "Senior Canadian government officials, who briefed reporters on Carney's plane before the announcement, said the purchase has been well received by top military officials in the North American Aerospace Defense Command, the joint U.S.-Canadian military command that overseas threats over the two countries.",
      "But the officials said they couldn't say how the Australian purchase would be received politically by Washington. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak publicly.",
      "Carney also announced the government will spend Canadian $420 million ($294 million) to expand Canada\u2019s Arctic operations and training exercises and deploy more personnel. He said Canada will have a \u201cgreater sustained year-round presence.\u201d",
      "The prime minister\u2019s flight path took him over Greenland. U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s interest in Greenland, northeast of Nunavut, comes as part of an aggressively \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy platform that has included threats to take control of the Panama Canal and suggestions that Canada should become the 51st U.S. state.",
      "\u201cThe United States priorities, once closely aligned with our own, are beginning to shift,\" Carney said.",
      "Trump has threatened economic coercion to make Canada the 51st state. His constant talk of annexation has infuriated Canadians and turned around the political fortunes of the governing Liberal party, which was headed for a historic defeat but now has a chance of winning a fourth term. Carney is expected to call a general election by the end of the week.",
      "The president is threatening sweeping tariffs on all Canadian products and has already placed them on steel and aluminum.",
      "Carney and Trump have not spoken since Carney was elected as the new Liberal party leader and prime minister more than a week ago.

I don\u2019t know, but he said negative things,\u201d Trump said. \u201cSo, when he says negative things, I couldn\u2019t care less. I think it\u2019s easier to deal actually with a Liberal. And maybe they\u2019re going to win, but I don\u2019t really care. It doesn\u2019t matter to me at all.\u201d",
      "Carney visited Iqaluit, which is by far the largest municipality in Nunavut, a vast territory straddling the Arctic Circle. Nunavut is roughly the size of the U.S. states of Alaska and California combined, with a mostly Inuit population of about 40,000.",

      "\u201cHis behavior has escalated to a point that is deeply disturbing,\u201d the email said, according to The Sunday Times. \u201cI remain deeply concerned about my own safety, constantly wondering if I might become the next victim.\u201d The report said the man allegedly made a death threat.",
      "South Africa\u2019s Ministry of Environment, which oversees the research missions, said in a statement Monday night that the alleged assault on the base leader was reported on Feb. 27, and officials and counselors intervened remotely \u201cto mediate and restore relationships at the base.\u201d They were speaking with team members almost daily, it said.",
      "\u201cThe alleged perpetrator has willingly participated in further psychological evaluation, has shown remorse and is willingly cooperative,\u201d the ministry said, adding that he had written a formal apology to the victim of the alleged assault. It said the allegations were being investigated. No one was identified.",
      "The nine-member team, which includes scientists, a doctor and engineers, is expected to stay at the base for about 13 months until next year, authorities said, living in close quarters through the hostile Antarctic winter, whose six months of darkness begin in June.",
      "The base is on a cliff in Queen Maud Land and is surrounded by a glacial ice sheet, more than 4,000 kilometers (2,485 miles) from South Africa.",
      "The next planned visit by a supply ship is in December, according to the South African National Antarctic Program. It takes the ship around 10 days to travel from Cape Town.",
      "Authorities said they had decided not to evacuate anyone from SANAE IV, where the onset of unpredictable weather conditions meant the team was now confined to the base.",
      "The ministry said all team members had undergone evaluations ahead of the trip to ensure they are able to cope with the \u201cextreme nature of the environment in Antarctica\u201d and the isolation and confinement, and no problems were identified.",
      "\u201cIt is not uncommon that once individuals arrive at the extremely remote areas where the scientific bases are located, an initial adjustment to the environment is required,\u201d it said.",
      "Previous problems have been reported at another of South Africa's remote research bases on Marion Island, a South African territory near Antarctica.",
      "In 2017, a member of a research team there smashed a colleague's room with an ax over an apparent love triangle, according to a report to South Africa's Parliament. Lawmakers said it appeared the researchers were living in highly stressful conditions.",
      "The National Science Foundation, the federal agency that oversees the U.S. Antarctic Program, published a report in 2022 in which 59% of women in the U.S. program said they\u2019d experienced harassment or assault while on research trips in Antarctica.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Amazon has sued the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission for finding the e-commerce giant legally responsible for the recalls of hundreds of thousands of products sold on its site.",
      "The independent federal agency ordered Amazon in January to take several actions, including notifying customers who bought more than 400,000 items covered by recalls and giving refunds to those who could prove the products were properly disposed of or destroyed.",
      "The order followed the commission's unanimous determination last summer that Amazon was a \u201cdistributor\u201d of faulty items sold on its website by third-party sellers and shipped through the company\u2019s fulfillment service",
      "But Amazon has long disputed it qualifies as a \u201cdistributor\u201d of products offered by other sellers. In its lawsuit filed on March 14, the company maintained it serves as a \u201cthird-party logistics provider\" and therefore should not be held liable for recalls of products that were made, owned and sold by others.",
      "The commission sued Amazon in 2021 for allegedly distributing hazardous items, accusing the company of putting consumer safety at risk by failing to properly notify the public about recalled products that included defective carbon monoxide detectors and flammable children\u2019s pajamas.",
      "Amazon said in its lawsuit that it issued previous recall notices and some refunds shortly after the CPSC raised safety concerns several years ago. The company argues the commission is an \u201cunconstitutionally structured agency\u201d that overstepped its authority with the new directive.",
      "\u201cThe remedies ordered by the CPSC are largely duplicative of the steps we took several years ago to protect customers, which are the same steps we take whenever we learn about unsafe products,\u201d Amazon said in a statement sent to The Associated Press. The Seattle-based company said it could not comment further on its lawsuit filed last week.",
      "Amazon and Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX also have active lawsuits challenging the structure of the National Labor Relations Board as unconstitutional. The two companies initiated the cases after the labor agency filed complaints against them in disputes about workers\u2019 rights and union organizing.",
      "The Consumer Product Safety Commission declined to comment Wednesday on Amazon's lawsuit complaint. In a Jan. 17 statement about the hazardous products order, Commissioner Richard L. Trumka Jr. said it was the CPSC's job to \u201chold companies like Amazon accountable\" and \u201cno company is above the law.\u201d",

      "An experimental treatment appears to delay Alzheimer\u2019s symptoms in some people genetically destined to get the disease in their 40s or 50s, according to new findings from ongoing research now caught up in Trump administration funding delays.",
      "The early results \u2014 a scientific first \u2014 were published Wednesday even as study participants worried that politics could cut their access to a possible lifeline.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s still a study but it has given me an extension to my life that I never banked on having,\u201d said Jake Heinrichs of New York City.",
      "Now 50, Heinrichs has been treated in that study for more than a decade and remains symptom-free despite inheriting an Alzheimer\u2019s-causing gene that killed his father and brother around the same age.",
      "If blocked funding stops Heinrichs\u2019 doses, \u201chow much time do we have?\u201d asked his wife, Rachel Chavkin. \u201cThis trial is life.\u201d",
      "Two drugs sold in the U.S. can modestly slow worsening of early-stage Alzheimer\u2019s by clearing the brain of one of its hallmarks, a sticky gunk called amyloid. But until now, there haven't been hints that removing amyloid far earlier \u2013 many years before the first symptoms appear \u2013 just might postpone the disease.",
      "The research led by Washington University in St. Louis involves families that pass down rare gene mutations almost guaranteeing they\u2019ll develop symptoms at the same age their affected relatives did \u2013 information that helps scientists tell if treatments are having any effect.",
      "The new findings center on a subset of 22 participants who received amyloid-removing drugs the longest, on average eight years. Long-term amyloid removal cut in half their risk of symptom onset, researchers reported Wednesday in the journal Lancet Neurology.",
      "Despite the study\u2019s small size, \u201cit\u2019s incredibly important,\u201d said Northwestern University neuroscientist David Gate, who wasn\u2019t involved with the research.",
      "Now participants have been switched from an earlier experimental drug to Leqembi, an IV treatment approved in the U.S., to try to answer the obvious next question.",
      "\u201cWhat we want to determine over the next five years is how strong is the protection,\u201d said Washington University\u2019s Dr. Randall Bateman, who directs the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer\u2019s Network of studies involving families with these rare genes. \u201cWill they ever get the symptoms of Alzheimer\u2019s disease if we keep treating them?\u201d",
      "Here\u2019s the worry: Bateman raised money to start that confirmatory study while seeking National Institutes of Health funding for the full project but his grant has been delayed as required reviews were canceled. It's one example of how millions of dollars in research have been stalled as NIH grapples with funding restrictions and mass firings.",
      "At the same time researchers wonder if NIH will shift focus away from amyloid research after comments by Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, nominated as the agency's new director.",
      "\u201cOne of the reasons I think that we have not made progress in Alzheimer\u2019s, as much as we ought to have, is because the NIH has not supported a sufficiently wide range of hypotheses,\u201d Bhattacharya told senators, responding to one who brought up an example of earlier science misconduct unrelated to current research.",
      "Scientists don\u2019t know exactly what causes Alzheimer\u2019s, a mind-destroying disease that affects nearly 7 million Americans, mostly late in life. What\u2019s clear is that silent changes occur in the brain at least two decades before the first symptoms -- and that sticky amyloid is a major contributor. At some point amyloid buildup appears to trigger a protein named tau to begin killing neurons, which drives cognitive decline.",
      "Tau-fighting drugs now are being tested. Researchers also are studying other factors including inflammation, the brain\u2019s immune cells and certain viruses.",
      "NIH\u2019s focus expanded as researchers found more potential culprits. In 2013, NIH\u2019s National Institute on Aging funded 14 trials of possible Alzheimer\u2019s drugs, over a third targeting amyloid. By last fall, there were 68 drug trials and about 18% targeted amyloid.",
      "Northwestern\u2019s Gate counts himself among scientists who \u201cthink amyloid isn\u2019t everything,\u201d but said nothing has invalidated the amyloid hypothesis. He recently used brain tissue preserved from an old amyloid study to learn how immune cells called microglia can clear those plaques and then switch to helping the brain heal, possible clues for improving today's modest therapies.",
      "For now, amyloid clearly is implicated somehow and families with Alzheimer's-causing genes are helping answer a critical question for anyone at risk: Can blocking amyloid buildup really stave off symptoms? Without NIH funding, Bateman said, that opportunity will be lost.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely insane,\u201d said longtime study participant June Ward, who lives near Asheville, North Carolina, and plans to ask friends to complain to lawmakers.",
      "Ward turns 64 in June and is healthy, two years older than when her mother's symptoms appeared. \u201cIt is exciting to think about the possibility that Alzheimer\u2019s disease might not be what gets me,\u201d she said.",
      "In New York, Heinrichs said he has hope that his 3-year-old son won\u2019t \u201cexperience the stress and sorrow that I lived through as a young man to watch my father fade away.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe need the NIH to be not politicized,\u201d added Chavkin, his wife. \u201cIt\u2019s just about keeping people alive or helping them live better. And in this case, it\u2019s helping my husband survive.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Scientists are homing in on the nature of a mysterious force called dark energy, and nothing short of the fate of the universe hangs in the balance.",
      "The force is enormous \u2014 it makes up nearly 70% of the universe. And it is powerful \u2014 it is pushing all the stars and galaxies away from each other at an ever faster rate.",
      "And now scientists are getting a little closer to understanding how it behaves. The big question is whether this dark energy is a constant force, which scientists have long thought, or whether the force is weakening, a surprising wrinkle tentatively proposed last year.",
      "Results presented at a meeting of the American Physical Society Wednesday bolster the case that the force is weakening, though scientists are not yet certain and they still haven't worked out what this means for the rest of their understanding of the universe.",
      "The updated findings come from an international research collaboration that is creating a three-dimensional map to see how galaxies have spread and clustered over 11 billion years of the universe\u2019s history. Carefully tracking how galaxies move helps scientists learn about the forces that are moving them around.",
      "Called the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument, the collaboration released its first analysis of 6 million galaxies and quasars last year and has now added more data, bringing the count to nearly 15 million. Their updated results, taken with other measurements \u2014 exploding stars, leftover light from the young universe and distortions in galaxy shape \u2014 support the idea presented last year that dark energy may be waning.",

      "It's not time to completely rule out the idea that dark energy is constant because the new results are still shy of the gold standard level of statistical proof physics requires. The collaboration aims to map around 50 million galaxies and quasars by the end of its survey in 2026. And other efforts around the globe have an eye on dark energy and aim to release their own data in the coming years, including the European Space Agency\u2019s Euclid mission and the Vera C.

      "If dark energy ebbs with time, which now seems plausible, the universe could one day stop expanding and then eventually collapse on itself in what\u2019s called the Big Crunch.

A light year is nearly 6 trillion miles.",
      "The observatory, which blasted off in 2023 from Florida, is creating a cosmic atlas to gain clues about how our ever-expanding universe works and how mysterious forces called dark energy and dark matter may play a role. The elusive duo make up most of our universe, but researchers don't know exactly what they are.",

      "Arizona highest court has created a pair of AI-generated avatars to deliver news of all rulings issued by the justices",
      "PHOENIX -- Arizona's highest court has created a pair of AI-generated avatars to deliver news of every ruling issued by the justices, marking what is believed to be the first example in the U.S. of a state court system tapping artificial intelligence to build more human-like characters to connect with the public.",
      "A court in Florida uses an animated chatbot to help visitors navigate its website, but the Arizona Supreme Court is charting new territory with the creation of Victoria and Daniel. Made of pixels, the two avatars have a different job in that they serve as the face of news coming from the court just as a spokesperson made of flesh and blood would do \u2014 but faster.",
      "The use of AI has touched nearly every profession and discipline, growing exponentially in recent years and showing infinite potential when it comes to things as simple as internet searches or as complex as brain surgery. For officials with the Arizona Supreme Court, their venture into AI is rooted in a desire to promote trust and confidence in the judicial system.",
      "There was a protest outside the state Capitol last April and calls for two justices to be booted after the Arizona Supreme Court ruled that a Civil War-era law that banned nearly all abortions, except when a woman\u2019s life is in jeopardy, could be enforced. Emotions flared on both sides of the issue.",
      "When Chief Justice Ann Timmer took over the court last summer, she made public trust a key pillar of her platform. She had already been thinking about ways to reach out to the public using digital media for a few years, and the abortion ruling, among other rulings, helped her to solidify the idea that the court needs to be part of the narrative as people learn about opinions and what they mean.",
      "\u201cWe serve the public better by saying, OK, we\u2019ve issued this decision,\" she said. \"Now, let us help you understand what it is.\u201d",
      "Timmer told The Associated Press earlier this year that if the court had to do the abortion ruling over again, it would have approached the dissemination of information differently. In a Wednesday interview, she said that a news release and avatar video could have helped the public better understand the legal underpinnings of the lengthy decision \u2014 possibly including what it didn't do, which she said some misunderstood.",
      "\u201cWe got a lot of backlash for it and probably deservedly so, in terms of how can we complain that people don\u2019t understand what we did when we didn\u2019t really do enough to give a simplified version,\" she said in the January interview, explaining that people want to know the basis for the court\u2019s decisions and what they can do, such as lobbying state lawmakers for whatever changes in law would support their positions.",
      "Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs signed a repeal of the ban last May, and in November, Arizona voters approved a constitutional amendment expanding abortion access up to the point of fetal viability.",
      "Created with a program called Creatify, Daniel and Victoria in a way bring to life the court's news releases. Videos featuring one or the other are being posted for every ruling by the high court, and may be used for Access to Justice projects, community programs and civics information in the future.",
      "The court has been sending out releases since October to summarize and explain rulings. After seeing success with the releases, it began exploring options to convey that information through video.",
      "The AI-generated avatars were the most efficient way to produce videos and get the information out, said court spokesperson Alberto Rodriguez. Producing a video usually can take hours, he said, but an AI-generated video is ready in about 30 minutes. The court might introduce more AI-generated reporters in the future, Rodriguez said in a news release.",
      "The justice who authors the legal opinion also drafts a news release, the wording of which must be approved by the entire bench. The justice then works with the court's communications team to craft a script for the avatars \u2014 the avatars aren't interpreting original court decisions or opinions, Rodriguez said.",
      "Daniel and Victoria's names and physical appearances were designed to represent a wide cross-section of people, Rodriguez said. He said they aren\u2019t meant to come off as real people and the court emphasizes their AI origins with disclaimers. The court is exploring different emotional deliveries, cadences and pronunciations as well as Spanish translations for the avatars, Rodriguez said.",
      "Mason Kortz, a clinical instructor at the Harvard Law School's Cyberlaw Clinic at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society, described the court's new cyber employees as \"quite realistic.\" While their voices might give them away, he said some people could be fooled into thinking that Daniel and Victoria are real reporters if viewers are only reading the subtitles and looking at the characters' movements and facial expressions.",
      "Kortz also said it would be better for the language of the disclaimer that is in the videos' text description to be featured more prominently.",
      "\u201cYou want to make it as hard as possible for someone to advertently or inadvertently remove the disclaimer,\u201d he said.",
      "Asheley Landrum, associate professor at the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication at Arizona State University, said the avatars feel robotic. She said a format that mimics real dialogue and storytelling might be more engaging than an AI reading of a news release.",
      "\u201cBecause it\u2019s not just about using AI or even creating videos,\u201d she said, \u201cbut about doing so in a way that really resonates with audiences.\u201d",
      "Still, it's fine line. She said engaging characteristics can help to build trust over time but the danger is that content could appear biased.",

      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams were barely known outside space circles when they strapped in for what was supposed to be a quick test flight of Boeing's Starliner capsule last June. Nine months later, they've captured the world's attention \u2014 and hearts \u2014 as NASA's stuck astronauts.",
      "Their homecoming is imminent now that a new crew has arrived at the International Space Station to replace them after launching from Florida last week. They'll fly back with SpaceX as soon as Tuesday, their problem-plagued Starliner having returned to Earth empty months ago, leaving them behind in orbit.",
      "Here's a look at \u201cSuni and Butch\u201d and their drama-filled mission:",
      "The two test pilots came to NASA via the Navy. Wilmore, 62, played high school and college football in his home state of Tennessee before joining the Navy. Williams, 59, grew up in Needham, Massachusetts, a competitive swimmer and distance runner.",
      "Wilmore racked up 663 aircraft carrier landings, while Williams served in combat helicopter squadrons.",
      "NASA picked Williams as an astronaut in 1998 followed by Wilmore in 2000. Each had two spaceflights behind them including monthslong stints at the space station before signing up as Starliner's first crew.",
      "While they accepted their repeated homecoming delays, they noted it was much harder on their families. Wilmore\u2019s wife Deanna has held down the fort, according to her husband. Their oldest daughter is in college and their youngest in her last year of high school.",
      "Williams\u2019 husband, Mike, a retired federal marshal, has been caring for their two Labrador retrievers. She said her mother is the worrier.",
      "Besides reuniting with loved ones, Wilmore, an elder with his Baptist church, can\u2019t wait to get back to face-to-face ministering and smelling fresh-cut grass.",
      "Wilmore kept in touch with members of his congregation over the months, taking part in occasional prayer services and calling ailing members via the space station's internet phone.",
      "Williams looks forward to long walks with her dogs and an ocean swim.",
      "Several other astronauts have spent even longer in space so no special precautions should be needed for these two once they're back, according to NASA.",
      "\u201cEvery astronaut that launches into space, we teach them don't think about when you're coming home. Think about how well your mission's going and if you're lucky, you might get to stay longer,\u201d NASA's space operations mission chief and former astronaut Ken Bowersox said last week.",
      "Wilmore and Williams found themselves in the middle of a political storm when President Donald Trump and SpaceX founder Elon Musk announced at the end of January they would accelerate the astronauts' return and blamed the Biden Administration on keeping them up there too long.",
      "NASA officials stood by their decision to wait for the next scheduled SpaceX flight to bring them home, targeting a February return. But their replacements got held up back on Earth because of battery work on their brand new SpaceX capsule.",
      "SpaceX switched capsules to speed things up, moving up their return by a couple of weeks. The two will come back in the capsule that's been up there since last fall.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s great to see how much people care about our astronauts,\u201d Bowersox said, describing the pair as \u201cprofessional, devoted, committed, really outstanding.\u201d",
      "Astronauts almost always fly back in the same spacecraft they launched in. Wilmore and Williams launched aboard Boeing's Starliner and will return in SpaceX's Dragon.",
      "Their first flights were aboard NASA's space shuttle, followed by Russia's Soyuz capsule. Both the Starliner and Dragon are completely autonomous but capable of manual command if necessary.",
      "As test pilots, they were in charge of the Starliner. The Dragon had fellow astronaut Nick Hague in command; he launched in it last September with a Russian and two empty seats reserved for Wilmore and Williams.",
      "Starliner almost didn't make it to the space station. Soon after the June 5 liftoff, helium leaked and thrusters malfunctioned on the way to the orbiting lab.",
      "NASA and Boeing spent the summer trying to figure out what went wrong and whether the problems would repeat on the flight back, endangering its two test pilots. NASA ultimately decided it was too risky and ordered the capsule back empty in September.",
      "Engineers are still investigating the thruster breakdowns, and it's unclear when Starliner will fly again \u2014 with astronauts or just cargo. NASA went into its commercial crew program wanting two competing U.S. companies for taxi service for redundancy's sake and stand by that choice.",

      "A new study out Monday finds that even in the most optimistic scenarios, grass-fed beef is no less carbon-intensive than industrial beef",
      "For cattle fattened in fields instead of feedlots, the grass may be greener, but the carbon emissions are not.",
      "A study out Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences finds that even in the most optimistic scenarios, grass-fed beef produces no less planet-warming carbon emissions than industrial beef. The finding calls into question the frequent promotion of grass-fed beef as a more environmentally friendly option. Still, other scientists say grass-fed beef wins out on other factors like animal welfare or local environmental pollution, complicating the choice for conscientious consumers.",
      "\u201cI think that there is a large portion of the population who really do wish their purchasing decisions will reflect their values,\u201d said Gidon Eshel, a research professor of environmental physics at Bard College and one of the study's authors. \u201cBut they are being misled, essentially, by the wrong information.\u201d",
      "When it comes to food, beef contributes by far the most emissions fueling climate change and is one of the most resource- and land-intensive to produce. Yet demand for beef around the world is only expected to grow. And carefully weighing the benefits of grass-fed beef matters because in most parts of the world where beef production is expanding, such as South America, it\u2019s being done by deforesting land that would otherwise store carbon, said Richard Waite of the World Resources Institute.",
      "Experts say this study's finding makes sense because it's less efficient to produce grass-fed cattle than their industrial counterparts. Animals that are fattened up in fields instead of feedlots grow more slowly and don't get as big, so it takes more of them to produce the same amount of meat.",
      "The researchers used a numerical model of the emissions produced across the process of raising beef, then simulated many herds of industrial and grass-fed cattle. It compared differences in how much food they would eat, how much methane and carbon dioxide they would emit and how much meat they would produce. Those differences mirror real-life scenarios; cattle in arid New Mexico and lush northern Michigan have different inputs and outputs.",
      "Eshel and his team also analyzed previous studies that examined how much cattle grazing promotes carbon storage, but found that even in the best-case scenarios, the amount of carbon that grasses could sequester didn\u2019t make up for the emissions of the cattle.",
      "Randy Jackson, a professor of grassland ecology at University of Wisconsin-Madison who was not involved in the study, said he has found similar results in his own research showing that grass-fed beef has higher emissions assuming the same demand. In fact, Eshel's team cited his work. But he worries that the study is too focused on minimizing emissions \u201cwithout concern for the environmental impacts beyond GHG load to the atmosphere,\u201d like biodiversity and soil and water quality, he wrote in an email.",
      "The American Grassfed Association, a nonprofit membership group for producers of grass-fed livestock, did not immediately provide a comment on the study.",
      "Jennifer Schmitt, who studies the sustainability of U.S. agricultural supply chains at the University of Minnesota and also wasn't involved in the study, said she thinks the paper \u201chelps us get a little closer to answering the question of maybe how much beef should we have on the landscape versus plant proteins,\u201d she said.",
      "Schmitt said maybe if beef was scaled back on a large enough scale and if farmers could free up more cropland for other foods that humans eat, the localized environmental benefits of grass-fed cattle could make up for the fact that they come with higher emissions.",
      "It would be harder to convince Eshel, however. He thinks climate change is \u201csecond to none\u201d when it comes to global problems and should be prioritized as such.",
      "\u201cI have a hard time imagining, even, a situation in which it will prove environmentally, genuinely wise, genuinely beneficial, to raise beef,\" Eshel said.",
      "For consumers who truly want to be environmentally conscious, he added, \"don't make beef a habit.\"",

That journey is thought to be a record \u2014 further than any other land-dwelling vertebrate has ever traveled on the ocean.",
      "Scientists think that's how iguanas got to the Galapagos Islands off of Ecuador and between islands in the Caribbean. Initially they thought Fiji might be a bit too far for such a trip, but in a new study, researchers inspected the genes of 14 iguana species spanning the Americas, the Caribbean and Fiji. They discovered that Fijian iguanas were most closely related to desert iguanas from North America, and that the two groups split off around 31 million years ago.",

    "link": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/doj-returning-court-defend-deportation-venezuelan-migrants-due/story?id=120024244",
    "published": "Fri, 21 Mar 2025 16:20:59 -0400",
    "summary": "Lawyers with the DOJ returned to court Friday afternoon to defend the deportation of more than two hundred Venezuelan migrants under the Alien Enemies Act.",
    "story": [
      "Trump last Saturday invoked the Alien Enemies Act to deport noncitizens.",
      "President Donald Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport more than 200 alleged Venezuelan gang members is an \"incredibly troublesome and problematic\" application of the centuries-old wartime law, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg said during a court hearing Friday, in his strongest rebuke to date of the Trump administration's deportation actions.",
      "Trump last Saturday invoked the Alien Enemies Act -- a wartime authority used to deport noncitizens with little-to-no due process -- by arguing that the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua is a \"hybrid criminal state\" that is invading the U.S.",
      "\"I agree the policy ramifications of this are incredibly troublesome and problematic and concerning, and I agree it's an unprecedented and expanded use of an act that has been used ... in the War of 1812, World War I and World War II, when there was no question there was a declaration of war and who the enemy was,\" Boasberg said at Friday's hearing.",
      "The judge noted that the Trump administration's arguments about the extent of the president's powers are \"awfully frightening\" and a \"long way from\" the intent of the law.",
      "He also vowed to hold the Trump administration accountable, if necessary, if they violated his court order last weekend blocking the use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport the Venezuelan migrants.",
      "\"The government's not being terribly cooperative at this point, but I will get to the bottom of whether they violated my word and who ordered this and what's the consequence,\" he said.",
      "When Boasberg asked if the DOJ could vow that the Trump administration would hold individual hearings before they deport anyone under the AEA to confirm they are members of Tren de Aragua, Deputy Assistant Attorney General Drew Ensign declined to make that commitment.",
      "\"No, Your Honor, I don't have authorization to do that,\" he said.",
      "Boasberg concluded the hearing without issuing any ruling from the bench.",
      "Earlier in the hearing, the judge probed the timing and motive behind the Trump administration's \"rushed\" deportations last weekend, which took place despite Boasberg ordering that they turn around two flights the administration said were deporting alleged migrant gang members to El Salvador. Officials failed to turn the flights around, saying they were already in international waters by the time they got the order, according to sources.",
      "Ensign confirmed to Boasberg during Friday's hearing that he understood the judge's 6:45 p.m. oral directive to turn both flights around and conveyed that to immigration authorities, seemingly undermining arguments made by the Justice Department earlier this week about the timing of the order.",
      "\"Can I ask you now how you interpreted that statement when we had a conversation on Saturday?\" Judge Boasberg asked. \"Did you not understand my statement during that hearing?\"",
      "\"I understood your statements and relayed your directive to the clients, which I have done,\" Ensign said.",
      "\"What did you understand? Did you think that that was hypothetical, not serious, that it was going to be modified? Or did you understand that when I said do that immediately?\" Judge Boasberg asked.",
      "\"I understood your intent -- that you meant that to be effective at that time,\" Ensign said, appearing to undermine the DOJ's arguments.",
      "Judge Boasberg also raised concerns about the timing of Trump's proclamation invoking the Alien Enemies Act, suggesting it was \"signed in the dark\" to rush the deportations before someone could bring a legal challenge.",
      "\"Why is this proclamation essentially signed in the dark on Friday night, early Saturday morning, when people rushed on the plane?\" Judge Boasberg asked. \"To me, the only reason to do that is if you know the problem and you want to get them out of the country before a suit is filed.\"",
      "\"I don't have knowledge of those operational details,\" Ensign said.",
      "Judge Boasberg also raised concerns that the rushed deportations prevented the men from being able to challenge the allegation they belonged to Tren de Aragua.",
      "\"They're simply saying, don't remove me, particularly to a country that's going to torture me,\" Boasberg said.",
      "With Ensign appearing to undermine arguments made earlier this week about the timing of the order and continuing to struggle to answer Judge Boasberg's questions, the judge suggested that the DOJ might be risking its reputation and credibility with its recent conduct.",
      "\"I often tell my clerks before they go out into the world to practice law, the most valuable treasure they possess is their reputation and their credibility,\" Boasberg said. \"I just ask you make sure your team [understands] that lesson.\"",
      "Trump is the first president since World War II to use the Alien Enemies Act and the first president to use it against a non-state actor.",
      "An official with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement acknowledged in a sworn declaration earlier this week that \"many\" of the noncitizens deported last wekend under the Alien Enemies Act did not have criminal records in the United States.",
      "Trump, asked by ABC News' Karen Travers Friday during an Oval Office press availability if he believes he has the authority to round up people and deport them without having to show the evidence against them, replied, \"That's what the law says, and that's what our country needs.\"",
      "\"You can't take that away from the people that are responsible,\" Trump said. \"And you can't stop that with a judge sitting behind a bench that has no idea what goes on.\"",
      "\"They're bad people,\" Trump said of the alleged gang members while criticizing the Biden administration's border policy. \"We don't want them in our country. We can't let a judge say that he wants them. You know, he didn't run for president. ... I won on the basis of getting criminals out of our country.\"",
      "Friday's hearing comes as cabinet-level officials in the Trump administration are considering invoking the state secrets privilege to prevent the disclosure of information about last week's deportations, according to sworn filing from Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche.",
      "Judge Boasberg gave the administration a deadline of 10 a.m. ET to submit a sworn filing from someone with direct knowledge of the cabinet-level discussions regarding the deportations.",
      "The Trump administration has until March 25 to confirm whether they are invoking state secrets privilege to prevent the disclosure of information about the deportation flights based on national security concerns.",
      "Elizabeth Goitein, senior director of the Liberty and National Security Program at the nonprofit Brennan Center for Justice, said the Trump administration's potential use of state secrets privilege could revive a decades-old conflict about the judicial branch's role in national security issues.",
      "If Judge Boasberg accepts the Trump administration's argument that providing more information about the deportations risks national security, it could move swaths of evidence off the table and potentially sideline legal cases related to the removals, Goitein said.",
      "But the Trump administration has to prove the risk to Boasberg, who will make the decision about whether the privilege is applicable.",
      "\"The president cannot simply say the words 'national security' and shut down the courts when it comes to their review of things like deportations under the Alien Enemies Act,\" Goitein told ABC News.",
      "To demonstrate that the privilege should apply, the head of the agency that holds the relevant information needs to submit evidence or sworn declarations proving that the public disclosure of information would risk national security.",
      "\"It's really up to the judge,\" Goitein said. \"The judge will look at whatever declarations or affidavits are filed by the government and will determine whether, on their face, these documents establish that the state secrets privilege applies to the information.\"",
      "However, the Trump administration has so far argued that not even Judge Boasberg has the right to know more about the deportations. In filings and court hearings this week, DOJ lawyers have argued that the issue exceeds Boasberg's jurisdiction -- even though federal judges have the authority to review classified information in closed settings, according to Goitein.",
      "If the Trump administration continues to stonewall the judge, they're unlikely to properly invoke the privilege to prevent the public disclosure of the records, according to Goitein.",
      "\"It seems like the government is asserting, already, from the get-go, that the court should not have this information, regardless of whether it ever gets to the litigants or whether it ever becomes public. That is not a valid assertion,\" she said.",
      "Goitein noted that the lawsuit over the deportations can proceed while Judge Boasberg takes up the state secrets arguments, and the case may be able to continue even if the privilege is permitted by the judge. The use of state secrets privilege would wall off certain evidence and materials -- some of which might be necessary to prove the Trump administration potentially defied the court's order -- but the overall case about the legitimacy of the deportations may be able to continue, she said.",
      "\"This information that the judge has requested is less about the lawsuit that the plaintiffs filed ... and more about whether or not the government complied with the court's order to stop any deportations,\" she said.",

This is likely an undercount due to delays in states reporting cases to the federal health agency.",
      "The majority of nationally confirmed cases, some 95%, are in people who are unvaccinated or whose vaccination status is unknown, the CDC said.

      "What would a constitutional crisis involve, and when and how would it get triggered?",
      "Over the weekend, the administration defied a federal judge's directive issued from the bench to turn around two flights carrying alleged Venezuelan gang members to El Salvador, after which the president and his top officials said that they would push ahead with the deportations despite what the court said, while also pursuing an appeal.",

      "Aside from the Confederate states' succession leading to the Civil War, the experts ABC News spoke with said that past examples of constitutional crises ended up blowing over, such as when President Franklin D. Roosevelt threatened to go forward with a military tribunal against a Nazi sympathizer from Long Island during World War II.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court ultimately gave the president the power to go forward, according to Pildes.",
      "In some cases, the executive branch has stepped in to enforce court orders, such as when then-President Dwight D. Eisenhower ordered the National Guard to make sure states followed the U.S. Supreme Court's Brown v. Board of Education landmark decision ending segregation in public schools.",
      "\"All of those [past examples] are sort of an individual, discrete issue, not a kind of more pervasive or systemic disregard of the courts and rulings of law by the executive branch,\" Pildes said.",
      "The Trump administration's actions put courts in uncharted waters",
      "The Trump administration's actions, in contrast, the experts said, are unprecedented because of the speed both at which the administration is enacting Trump's policies and opponents are challenging the administration's moves in court.",
      "\"The executive has some capacity to change facts on the ground before the courts can act and it can be hard to undo some of those actions, even if the courts end up concluding that they were unlawful,\" Pildes said.",
      "Sample, of Hofstra, compared it to a computer being so overloaded it can't process the information.",
      "\"The volume of what is happening, and the speed at which it is being undertaken, is crashing the constitutional hard drive,\" he said.",
      "The situation has been played out over the last couple of weeks as Trump has claimed that he would abide by court orders that issued temporary restraining orders over his policies, such as deportations, mass firings of federal workers and discharging transgender service members; however, court documents have indicated that those orders were not followed in many cases.",
      "Trump and his allies, including billionaire Elon Musk, have also gone after Judge James Boasberg on social media after he issued from the bench a temporary restraining order against the administration in a case challenging the president's executive orders to deport Venezuelan migrants.",
      "\"We have not historically seen the idea of attacking judges [or] attacking courts for rulings with which we disagree and attacking the system itself,\" Sample said. \"That's a problem.\"",
      "Tools that courts can use to push back",
      "Despite the unprecedented pushback on the courts, the experts said that the judiciary does have tools to prevent a crisis.",
      "Pildes noted that while courts face a challenge when it comes to enforcing their rulings against the executive branch directly, they can still take some actions to get an administration to comply.",
      "Judges have threatened to use contempt findings and fines, and Pildes said those warnings can be serious.",
      "\"If there are lawyers involved in advising to defy a court order, or participating in defiance of a court order, there can be sanctions against those lawyers. Their bar licenses could be at stake,\" he said.",
      "\"Then, if there are misrepresentations that lawyers make in court, that can also be sanctioned against the lawyers,\" Pildes added. \"Sometimes that very sanction is enough to get them to comply. But if it's not, the courts can start imposing fines.\"",
      "\"As the executive defiance kind of goes on, more and more officials would have to be involved in going down this path with the executive of not complying,\" he said.",
      "Sample, however, noted that if a court chose contempt, it could further test the Constitution because the U.S. Marshals Service, which is under the jurisdiction of the executive branch, would be involved with enforcing an order.",
      "\"It's not far-fetched to believe that the Trump administration would, in the face of a contempt order, just simply tell the U.S. Marshals Service not to enforce it,\" he said. \"This goes back to that same principle that the glue that holds the constitutional structure together is not just law, it's norms.\"",
      "There already has been some pushback from the top level of the judiciary to Trump's rhetoric.",
      "Chief Justice John Roberts rebuked calls to impeach judges with a rare statement this week.",
      "\"For more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision. The normal appellate review process exists for that purpose,\" he said.",
      "Trump dismissed Roberts' statement in an interview with Fox News, claiming Roberts did not directly mention him by name. Trump and his allies have continued to verbally attack federal judges who have issued temporary restraining orders and injunctions on implementation of his policies and executive orders.",
      "The public's role is crucial in averting crises",
      "Sample and Pildes said that given their actions so far during the last couple of weeks, it is unlikely that the Republican-controlled Congress will step up to curb Trump's rhetoric and action and force him to comply with the courts..However, public opinion will play a big part in preventing the country from entering a crisis, they argued.",
      "\"The tool, the arrow in the quiver of the courts is the legitimacy and the public's faith in the legitimacy of the process playing itself out of those rulings. One of the things that is a hallmark of a civilized society is that if the citizens believe that a process was fair,\" Sample said.",
      "Pildes noted that as the Watergate scandal unfolded and then-President Richard Nixon was forced by the U.S. Supreme Court to release audio tapes that implicated him on impeachable offenses, public opinion had already turned on him and his allies in Congress to the point that he resigned.",
      "Pildes added that public opinion can be expressed through economics, which federal leaders watch attentively. Business and stock markets are typically weakened if governments and the rule of law are disrupted and that could force the executive to rethink their resistance to the courts, he said.",
      "\"If we get to [a constitutional crisis], you can imagine easily a lot of turmoil that would actually show up in the market show up in the economy. People will stop wanting to invest here,\" he said.",
      "Sample said the country's current polarization will make it harder for a public consensus, but he believed that generally, Americans would be speaking out against anything that leads to a crisis.",
      "\"Even if you are hardcore MAGA, and you think Donald Trump is a benevolent authoritarian, there may come a time where the next leader, with authoritarian leanings is, from your perspective, not so benevolent,\" he said. \"So, if Americans want to push back against authoritarianism, they need to stand up and be willing to say I oppose authoritarianism, even if it might be producing the short-term results that I desire.\"",

      "Fired federal workers offer appealing experience and skills, experts say",
      "Thousands of federal workers nationwide have been forced out of their jobs by the Trump administration as Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency's says it aims to improve the government and cut down waste.",
      "From park rangers and Department of Veterans Affairs social workers to scientists and foreign relations experts, the workers have decades of experience and knowledge that are crucial to their fields.",
      "With that wealth of knowledge and experience, labor and security experts told ABC News that those fired federal workers are being recruited by private firms and foreign governments, which they said raises the risk of security threats against the United States.",
      "\"From an intelligence and law enforcement perspective, the potential for foreign intelligence forces to recruit government workers is hot,\" said John Cohen, an ABC News contributor and former acting undersecretary for intelligence at the Department of Homeland Security.",
      "At the same time, state and local governments could step up to fill in their offices with that talent as President Donald Trump seeks to shift many roles and responsibilities out of the federal government.",
      "\"It would be an easy transition for them and, in the end, benefit the public, which needs their experience now,\" Victor Narro, a professor of labor studies at the Labor Center at the University of California, Los Angeles, told ABC News.",
      "Workers ripe for the picking by private sector",
      "Narro, who has worked in Los Angeles city public boards and commissions and on a U.S. Agency for International Development project, said one of the biggest things being overlooked in DOGE's mass firings is the fact that many of these employees had strong training from top colleges and chose to have a career in public office instead of the private sector.",
      "\"A lot of public sector employees give up jobs in the private sector because they care about being a public worker,\" he said. \"They all know they could have made a lot more money and had more benefits.\"",
      "What federal workers may lack in salary, they can make up in connections with policymakers and organizations, as well as access to government data and knowledge. It is common for federal workers who leave the public sector to take that knowledge to private sector jobs, such as consulting firms that specialize in the environment, national security and healthcare, Cohen said.",
      "The unprecedented mass firing of federal workers may lead to the creation of new private sector organizations made up of those workers, Cohen said.",
      "\"It would be hard to think that those employees wouldn't be in demand,\" he said.",
      "In fact, billionaire Mark Cuban pitched an idea in a post on March 1 that those fired workers band together and start their own consulting company.",
      "\"It's just a matter of time before DOGE needs you to fix the mess they inevitably created. They will have to hire your company as a contractor to fix it. But on your terms. I'm happy to invest and/or help,\" the Shark Tank host wrote.",
      "There have been no public updates about Cuban's proposal since the post as of March 18.",
      "Foreign national threat increased",
      "Cohen said Cuban's proposal has some merit, but he warned that not everyone offering a helping hand will have altruistic intentions.",
      "In fact, he warned offers could very well be ruses designed by foreign adversaries.",
      "Cohen said counterintelligence operations throughout history have targeted disgruntled federal employees who are left in despair and with no way to pay off their expenses and debts.",
      "Each fired worker, from those at the Social Security Administration, who have knowledge about the U.S. benefits system, to nuclear engineers, could be a perfect asset to intelligence agencies in Russia, China and other nations, Cohen said.",
      "Additionally, general knowledge about the inner workings of federal offices, personalities of top officials and other information could be appealing to adversaries, he said.",
      "\"It's not just classified information that is valuable,\" he said.",
      "Cohen said Trump and Musk's belittling of the federal workers as lazy, inefficient and not useful for the government will help make it easier for foreign recruiters to make their case.",
      "\"It's a standard recruitment tool. You find that sense of grievance, you fan the flames and you get them to cooperate because they are angry at what was done to them,\" he said.",
      "Those same operations have also found success through more shady tactics, Cohen said.",
      "He noted that there have been cases where federal employees have unknowingly worked for foreign governments posing as private U.S. companies or have been closely working with legitimate companies already operating in the U.S., clouding evidence of foreign intervention.",
      "\"It could be something as simple as offering someone to write a research paper and pay a lot for it or give a speech at a conference,\" Cohen said. \"From there, it could lead to something long term.\"",
      "Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey told reporters at news conferences this week that this is playing out in her state, saying on Wednesday, \"What has happened is you have other governments, from China, from the Middle East, from around the world, coming into this country, coming into campuses in Massachusetts and basically saying, 'Hey the federal government is going to take away your funding and take away your research come to our country. We'll give you a lab. We'll set you up. We'll give you a staff. And you can pioneer the new technologies on our shores.'\"",
      "\"That's not putting America first,\" she added.",
      "Typically, the federal government prompts workers to do their due diligence and refrain from working with anyone appearing to have foreign government ties, but Cohen said it is going to be difficult to self-police this on such a massive scale.",
      "\"The government has to rely on someone's patriotism and their sense of ethics to willingly not support a foreign intelligence service. But very often, a person may not know they are being recruited,\" he said.",
      "State, local governments to the rescue?",
      "The recruitment efforts, however, aren't limited to foreign entities and private companies. State and local governments are now seeking to fill their offices with the displaced talent.",
      "Earlier this month, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul announced the \"You're Hired\" campaign, which encourages fired federal workers to go to New York and apply for jobs in various state agencies. The state placed ads in Union Station that redirected them to a website with state job offerings.",
      "\"We're looking for qualified, experienced candidates across a wide variety of fields. I need technologists, I need engineers, I need attorneys, healthcare workers, educators, public policy experts and so many more,\" Hochul told reporters at a news conference on March 3.",
      "\"I'm in competition for the top attorneys, the top engineers [and] people to work at the Department of Financial Services,\" she added. \"In a place like New York City, there's a lot of higher-paying jobs. So these are special people who walk away from those jobs and those opportunities and come here, and I want to let them know that we will take care of them.\"",
      "As of March 18, over 200 people have signed up for webinars hosted by the New York State Department of Labor, according to the governor's office.",
      "Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, a Democrat, and Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican, have started similar campaigns.",
      "Narro said it is not surprising that local governments would take the opportunity to fill their offices, given that many are now bracing for extra responsibilities following the DOGE cuts.",
      "At the same time, there is no guarantee that those local governments can take in all of those workers, he said.",
      "\"A lot of it depends on the state. You have a better chance of getting a public job in New York versus Iowa because of the number of offices, departments and ultimately the budget,\" Narro said.",
      "Cohen and Narro added that Trump's pledge to give more power to the states, particularly education, but no details on how they would get the funding to do so has also left many states in limbo when it comes to recruitment.",
      "\"It's great that the states are coming up with these programs, but if they can't commit, you're going to have more frustrated federal workers,\" Cohen said.",
      "Can the damage be undone?",
      "Narro noted that the situation with fired federal workers is still fluid as court cases play out and some of the firings have been stopped or reversed.",
      "However, the uncertainty alone could be devastating to the future of the federal workforce.",
      "\"People's families depend on stability, and if they can not keep up with the changing decisions, they may just quit altogether,\" Narro said. \"I suspect this is what Trump and Musk are seeking to do in their strategy.\"",
      "Narro said that even if Trump's and Musk's policies are reversed by a future administration, there could be long-term damage.",
      "\"In the end of the day, the public loses out the most,\" he said. \"It's going to be harder for anyone to consider giving up a private job and dedicating their talents to serving the public if this is how they will be treated.\"",

      "Joseph diGenova, 80, and Christopher Pyle, 86, both had their names, birth dates, birth places and Social Security numbers unmasked in the document released by the National Archives -- potentially putting them at risk of identity theft and fraud.",

    "story": [
      "Republican U.S. Rep. Celeste Maloy says the country risks drifting toward authoritarianism if the executive branch isn't brought under control",
      "SALT LAKE CITY -- Republican U.S. Rep. Celeste Maloy received applause at a Thursday town hall in Salt Lake City when she told the crowd she\u2019s concerned about the country drifting toward authoritarianism \u201cif we don\u2019t get the executive branch under control.\u201d",
      "But the cheers turned to boos when she added those worries weren't specific to Republican President Donald Trump.",
      "\u201cWhen Biden was president, I had the same concern,\" she said, referring to former Democratic President Joe Biden.",
      "Maloy's comments summed up her careful approach to criticizing Trump throughout the event, which she held with Republican U.S. Rep. Mike Kennedy. The Utah lawmakers are among a handful of Republicans who have held public meetings against the recommendation of House Speaker Mike Johnson, who encouraged them to skip out after others drew protesters.",
      "The boisterous audience in liberal Salt Lake City repeatedly urged Maloy to denounce Trump\u2019s sweeping federal budget cuts. Maloy wields power over federal funding as a member of the House Appropriations Committee. She and Kennedy said they opposed some of the administration's cuts, including to the National Park Service. But Maloy also said tough spending decisions are necessary.",
      "\u201cWe are not going to get out of the situation we\u2019re in financially without all of us feeling some pain,\u201d she said.",
      "Maloy said she and Kennedy held the town hall because they believed Utah could set an example on how to hold civil discussions about tough issues. Questions were sent in to a message board and attendees could vote for those they were most interested in hearing. The question about authoritarianism came from a man who stood up and shouted it.",
      "To jeers from the crowd, Kennedy defended Trump\u2019s actions in his first three months in the White House, including the president's move to end foreign aid contracts at the U.S. Agency for International Development.",
      "\u201cWe need to make sure that our own house is in order,\" he said. \u201cWe\u2019re spending money off in foreign lands on things that may or may not be meritorious. In this case, our grandchildren will be paying back with economic disaster.\u201d",
      "Maloy took a more tepid approach, telling the crowd she sees a need for more checks on the executive branch as Trump has signed a flurry of executive orders.",
      "She said she called the White House to express concern about an order that directed federal agencies to lay off hundreds of thousands of probationary employees. Judges recently ordered the workers to be rehired. She said she supports broad efforts to shrink the size and scope of the federal government but thinks the mass firing of probationary workers was the wrong approach.",
      "Many questions focused on how federal budget cuts might impact Utah's vast public lands, including its five national parks. Both lawmakers said they opposed the Trump administration's reductions of National Park Service staff, but that they had little power to influence his decisions. Some jobs have been restored.",
      "Maloy, who lives just north of Zion National Park, began her career at the U.S. Department of Agriculture, working to conserve natural resources, improve water quality and manage nutrients in the farmlands of southwest Utah. In Congress, she has served on subcommittees focusing on water resources and rural development. Her district includes many rural towns known for outdoor recreation.",
      "Kennedy is a family doctor and former state senator. His district spans the entire eastern border of the state and groups vastly different communities, from the winter resort town of Park City, to the urban center of Provo, down to the red rock recreation hub of Moab.",
      "Voters from both parties said after the town hall they had hoped to hear more about Social Security. Dozens of the program\u2019s offices across the country are slated to close due to actions taken by Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "Not everyone in the crowd opposed Trump's actions. Andrew Turner, a 30-year-old Republican and engineering student, said he wished the lawmakers had more time to address the future of Social Security and criticized the audience for talking over Maloy and Kennedy as they tried to answer questions.",
      "\u201cSomething will have to be done about Social Security because otherwise it\u2019s going to collapse,\u201d he said. \u201cI know as somebody who\u2019s younger, at the current trajectory, I\u2019m probably not going to be able to use the program. So I support the budget cuts Trump is doing.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Democratic lawmakers are courting online content creators, podcasters and celebrities in a bid to find new ways to boost their message to voters",
      "WASHINGTON -- For weeks, Democratic lawmakers have met with and mimicked figures they believe may offer them a path back to power in Washington: online influencers and content creators.",
      "Hours before President Donald Trump\u2019s joint address to Congress this month, Senate Democrats huddled with a dozen online progressive personalities who have millions of followers. House Democrats were introduced, without staff, to 40 content creators who Democratic leaders said could help them grow their audience online.",
      "An earlier tutorial session in February featured online personalities like the YouTube commentator Brian Tyler Cohen.",
      "The result has been a burst of Democratic online content, including direct-to-camera explainers in parked cars, scripted vertical videos, podcast appearances and livestreams \u2014 some topping trending charts online, others drawing mockery from liberal allies and Republicans in Congress.",
      "But while the Democratic Party is largely divided over the path forward after last year's election losses, party leaders agree that, no matter the message, how they connect with voters in the digital media landscape will be key to a political comeback.",
      "More than a dozen Democratic senators, asked about the party\u2019s digital strategy, pointed to Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey as the architect of their new push.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve seen tremendous growth of Democratic senators now. They\u2019re engaging in the tools and strategies necessary to elevate their voice in a new, changing media market, where legacy media is not the place that people get their news now,\u201d Booker said. \u201cWe\u2019re just weeks into this, but just by making key changes ... we\u2019re seeing a massive growth in engagement with the content that our senators are creating, and we\u2019ve only just begun.\"",
      "Booker said he's aiming for Democratic senators to double online engagement with their content over the next year \u2014 and early metrics have been noticeable. Democratic senators racked up more than 87 million views on content they published in response to Trump's joint address to Congress, according to Booker's office.",
      "Not all of that online engagement is positive. After more than two dozen Democratic senators posted identical scripted videos knocking Trump's speech, saying he should have addressed the cost of living and his support for billionaire adviser Elon Musk, conservatives mocked them as inauthentic and out of touch.",
      "\"They are all actors reading a script,\" Musk wrote on X, the social media platform he owns.",
      "There's no doubt that Democrats are playing catch-up. Trump and his fellow Republicans built a digital operation that fed on bombast and celebrity, and it's a strategy they've taken with them to the White House. Official government accounts are new filled with right-wing memes, cinematic videos and pugnacious statements.",
      "The Democratic embrace of influencers has also yielded mixed early results. Democrats were ridiculed online after a food and wellness influencer who attended the House Democrats' creators event created a \u201cChoose Your Fighter\" video collage of Democratic congresswomen for Women's History Month.",
      "The White House posted a video in response that read \u201cAmerica chose its fighters last November,\u201d and the Pentagon, normally known for being studiously non-partisan, posted a video stating \u201cWe chose our fighters a long time ago.\u201d",
      "But Booker and other Democratic leaders don't consider the sneers to be a downside. Missteps are to be expected, they say, but the path to Americans' attention will require some discomfort from lawmakers.",
      "\u201cI do think that the caucus as a whole is trying to figure out how we show people that we are real people,\u201d said Rep. Jasmine Crockett of Texas, one of the congresswomen featured in the viral \u201cFighter\u201d video. Crockett, whose posts regularly garner millions of views online, said she was used to criticism for her often frank statements and was more interested in combating perceptions that Democrats are \u201celitist\u201d or \u201crobotic.\u201d",
      "\u201cI didn't like the jumping, I'm going to be honest, though,\u201d Crockett added about the viral \u201cChoose Your Fighter\u201d video.",
      "Democrats adopted a more combative stance online in recent weeks as Trump's moves to slash the federal workforce drew protests from liberals and pushback at GOP town halls. Top Democratic digital operatives who worked for the 2024 presidential campaign of then-Vice President Kamala Harris have been in high demand, with many Democrats anticipating close 2026 races in which digital strategies may be key.",
      "Some of the most prominent Democrats across the country have been engaging more in new media since the election. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York has touted the party's message on progressive podcasts over the last month, including from the comedian Jon Stewart and the progressive outlet MeidasTouch. Clips of those videos were also lampooned online but garnered millions of views.",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a potential Democratic presidential contender in 2028, has launched a podcast of his own on which he has welcomed close Trump allies like the right-wing activist Charlie Kirk and former Trump aide Steve Bannon to discuss hot-button political topics.",
      "\u201cWe want to make sure we hit the podcasters that normally don\u2019t have Democrats on there,\u201d said Rep. Derek Tran, a Democrat from a competitive California House district. \u201cThe ones that are more right-leaning or independent, and be able to address a crowd and an audience that\u2019s not typical for the Democratic base.\u201d",
      "Some House Democrats have expressed frustration that the guidance from Democratic leaders about social media is too vague, while others grumble that leaders are too prescriptive in their approach to messaging on platforms they don\u2019t intuitively understand. Meanwhile, Democratic strategists have cautioned lawmakers that garnering attention online is secondary to the goal of using social media as a tool in specific policy fights and campaigns.",
      "\u201cI think there\u2019s a fine line before we\u2019re being cringe and trying too hard and seeming too thirsty. I think the most important thing in any of this is being as authentic and genuine as we can be,\u201d said Rep. Sara Jacobs, D-Calif.",
      "\u201cWhen it comes to authenticity, it also means leaning into what makes each of us unique. Like many of my colleagues probably should not be doing \u2018get ready with me\u2019 videos. It would look super cringe. But I\u2019m a 36-year-old woman, and I do my makeup all the time, and I watch a lot of makeup tutorial videos, so it makes sense for me to do it,\u201d said Jacobs.",
      "Some Democrats think that the party's messaging strategy hinges as much on the messengers as the medium it\u2019s communicated on.",
      "\u201cIf you know how to talk to people, it doesn\u2019t matter what medium is going to exist,\u201d said Sen. Ruben Gallego, a freshman Democratic senator from Arizona. \u201cYou could be the best freaking spokesperson in the world, but if you don\u2019t know how to talk to working-class people, it doesn\u2019t matter if you have the best TikTok following, it\u2019s just not going to translate.\u201d",

    "summary": "The Justice Department provided a submission in writing Thursday in response to U.S. District Judge James Boasberg's request for information.",
    "story": [
      "Boasberg ordered more information about the deportation flights.",
      "U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, the federal judge who blocked the Trump administration from deporting Venezuelan immigrants that it alleges are members of the gang Tren de Aragua without due process, accused the Justice Department of evading \"its obligations\" to comply with his order for more information on the deportation flights, per a new filing on Thursday.",
      "Boasberg said in an order Thursday that after a noon deadline, Justice Department attorneys filed a written declaration from an acting U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement field officer, which repeated general information about the deportation flights and that Cabinet secretaries were still weighing whether to invoke the states secret privilege, a move that allows the head of an executive department to refuse to produce evidence in a court case on the grounds that the evidence is secret information that would harm national security or foreign relation interests if disclosed, according to the Center for Constitutional Rights.",
      "\"This is woefully insufficient,\" Boasberg said in response.",
      "Boasberg ordered more information about the deportation flights, which the administration carried out under the Alien Enemies Act, a rarely used wartime authority. Boasberg ordered that they turn around two flights the administration said were deporting the alleged migrant gang members to El Salvador. Officials failed to turn those flights around.",
      "The Trump administration has not yet released the names of the alleged gang members who were deported.",
      "The Department of Justice initially refused to provide more information about the flights, citing national security concerns.",
      "Boasberg said Thursday that he is requiring the government to show cause by March 25 on why its responses thus far and the failure to return the undocumented migrants to the U.S. did not violate his temporary restraining orders.",
      "Additionally, he asked the government to file a sworn declaration by 10 a.m. Friday by an individual involved in Trump's Cabinet discussions over the state secrets privilege -- and to say by March 25 whether they plan to invoke the privilege.",
      "On Thursday, ABC News' Karen Travers asked White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt why the administration wasn't turning over the information regarding the deportation flights if they are confident that they complied with the judge's order.",
      "\"We are confident that we've complied, and as I've said from the podium, all of the flights that were subject to the written order of the judge took off before the written order was pushed in the courtroom,\" Leavitt said. \"And the president is all within his article, his Article II power and his authority under the Alien Enemies Act to make these decisions.\"",
      "Earlier this week, Trump and some House Republicans called to impeach Boasberg, with Trump calling the judge \"radical left.\"",
      "Chief Justice of the United States John Roberts issued a rare statement on the impeachment threat, signaling a stark difference in opinion between the judicial and executive branches.",
      "\"For more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision,\" Roberts said in the statement. \"The normal appellate review process exists for that purpose.\"",

    "summary": "President Donald Trump signed an executive order to diminish the Department of Education at the White House on Thursday.",
    "story": [
      "Trump signed the order in a ceremony while flanked by schoolchildren.",
      "President Donald Trump, surrounded by schoolchildren sitting at desks, signed an executive order that aims to further gut the Department of Education at the White House on Thursday.",
      "The order, titled \"Improving Education Outcomes by Empowering Parents, States, and Communities,\" directs Education Secretary Linda McMahon to take all necessary steps to shrink the Department of Education.",
      "\"Today we take a historic action that was 45 years in the making,\" he said, noting that his order will \"begin eliminating the federal Department of Education.\"",
      "The move has been months in the making and will help the president fulfill his campaign promise of returning education power and decisions to the states.",
      "\"We're going to eliminate it,\" Trump said. \"Everybody knows it's right, and the Democrats know it's right.\"",
      "However, congressional approval is required to abolish a federal agency, and McMahon has acknowledged she would need Congress to carry out the president's vision to close the department she's been tapped to lead. It would take 60 \"yes\" votes in the Senate to overcome the filibuster and dismantle the department that Congress created.",
      "\"The Department of Education will be much smaller than it is today,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters earlier Thursday, noting the department will not be completely shut down yet and that it will continue to carry out \"critical functions.\"",
      "\"But we don't need to be spending more than $3 trillion over the course of a few decades on a department that's clearly failing in its initial intention to educate our students,\" she said.",
      "Trump is directing McMahon to take \"all necessary steps to facilitate the closure of the Department of Education and return education authority to the States,\" the order said, and he added in the ceremony that he hopes she will be the last secretary of the department.",
      "The order also calls for the \"uninterrupted delivery of services, programs, and benefits on which Americans rely.\" It's still unclear how the administration plans to accomplish that. Sources said the administration has been looking into how to move some of the key programs to other agencies.",
      "Republican Govs. Ron DeSantis of Florida, Greg Abbott of Texas, Mike Braun of Indiana, Kim Reynolds of Iowa, Jeff Landry of Louisiana and Mike DeWine of Ohio were among the state leaders attending the signing ceremony.",
      "\"We want to return our students to the states, where just some of the governors here are so happy about this,\" Trump said. \"They want education to come back to them, to come back to the states, and they're going to do a phenomenal job.\"",
      "However, several Democrats and education advocates slammed the order.",
      "\"This is a code red for every public school student, parent and teacher in this country,\" Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., said. \"Trump is telling public school kids in America that their futures don't matter. Billionaires like Trump and Musk won't feel the difference when after school programs are slashed, class sizes go up and help for families to pay for school gets cut. But working families, students, and teachers will pay a heavy price.\"",
      "\"Shutting down the Department of Education will harm millions of children in our nation's public schools, their families and hardworking teachers,\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said in a Thursday statement. \"Congress created the Department of Education and only an act of Congress can eliminate it. We will stop this malignant Republican scheme in the House of Representatives and in the Courts.\"",
      "House Education and Workforce Committee ranking member Bobby Scott, D-Va., said the order will cause \"irreparable harm\" to students and educators.",
      "\"By dismantling ED, President Trump is implementing his own philosophy on education which can be summed up in his own words, 'I love the poorly educated,'\" he added.",
      "The department took the first steps to downsize last week when it laid off nearly half its employees, and it shrunk significantly in size through a massive reduction in force, deferred resignations and retirement buyouts, according to the department.",
      "Trump is continuing the reforms with his order -- pledging to erase more staff from the department.",
      "\"I expect it will [be shut down entirely],\" Trump said on \"Full Measure\" with Sharyl Attkisson earlier this month. \"You'll have a few people left just to make sure [the states are] teaching English -- you know, you say reading, writing and arithmetic.\"",
      "Critics argue the department is needed for vital financial assistance and grant programs. Education experts suggested that shuttering the Department of Education could gut public education funding and disproportionately affect high-need students across the country who rely on statutorily authorized programs, such as the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act and Title 1, which provides funding for low-income families.",
      "These programs could be housed in a reformed, shrunken-down Department of Education or other agencies, and McMahon said the department will still administer those statutory programs that students from disadvantaged backgrounds rely on. In an interview on Fox News' \"The Ingraham Angle,\" McMahon suggested the \"good\" employees who administer the statutorily mandated functions will not be harmed by staff reductions.",
      "\"Legality aside, dismantling ED will exacerbate existing disparities, reduce accountability and put low-income students, students of color, students with disabilities and rural students at risk,\" Scott said.",
      "A statement from the department said it will \"continue to deliver on all statutory programs that fall under the agency's purview, including formula funding, student loans, Pell Grants, funding for special needs students, and competitive grantmaking.\"",
      "\"They're going to be preserved in full and redistributed to various other agencies and departments that will take very good care of them,\" Trump said Thursday. \"But beyond these core necessities, my administration will take all lawful steps to shut down the department.\"",
      "However, some critics noted that the department does more than administer funding of key programs.",
      "\"The department does more than disperse funds,\" Agency CEO and public education advocate Debbie Veney said. \"It ensures accountability, enforces civil rights protections and upholds educational standards. Eliminating it would weaken oversight and put millions of students at risk.\"",
      "\"Instead of dismantling a vital institution, leaders should focus on strengthening education policies that support students, families and schools,\" she added.",
      "The National Parents Union also condemned the order as unconstitutional and said students will suffer from a lack of a federal Department of Education.",
      "\"Let's call this what it is: An assault on our kids' future and playing chicken with a constitutional crisis with the willful disregard of Congressional authority,\" it said in a statement. \"This isn't fixing education. It's making sure millions of children never get a fair shot. And we're not about to let that happen without a fight.\"",
      "Still, some school advocates said Trump's order did not go far enough, with American Federation for Children CEO Tommy Schultz saying Trump has \"brought down a failed bureaucratic machine in DC.\"",
      "\"With this executive order, President Trump continues taking steps to fulfill his campaign promises on education, and now it is time for Congress to send school choice legislation to his desk so that he can fulfill his other mandate to the voters,\" he said.\"",
      "In more than four decades, Trump and Department of Education skeptics have said they believe the agency has had too much spending power without achieving results.",
      "After McMahon was sworn in, she underscored that abolishing the department is rooted in allowing families the right to choose a \"quality education\" so America's students aren't \"stuck in failing schools.\"",
      "\"This is also, I would say, a national security issue,\" Leavitt added Thursday morning. \"When you look at how students around the world, particularly in China, are being educated, American students are falling behind. We're not keeping up with our allies or our adversaries, and that's a major problem for our country, and the president is fixing it today.\"",
      "After Trump signed the bill, House Education and Workforce Committee Chairman Tim Walberg said McMahon \"understands the importance of getting the federal government out of the way.\"",
      "\"Bottom line, the Department of Education has failed to deliver results for America's students and today's actions by the Trump administration will help ensure our nation's youth are put first,\" he added.",

    "story": [
      "U.S. authorities have arrested and detained Canadian and European travelers at U.S. borders in recent weeks",
      "SAN DIEGO -- Lennon Tyler and her German fianc\u00e9 often took road trips to Mexico when he vacationed in the United States since it was only a day's drive from her home in Las Vegas, one of the perks of their long-distance relationship.",
      "But things went terribly wrong when they drove back from Tijuana last month.",
      "U.S. border agents handcuffed Tyler, a U.S. citizen, and chained her to a bench, while her fianc\u00e9, Lucas Sielaff, was accused of violating the rules of his 90-day U.S. tourist permit, the couple said. Authorities later handcuffed and shackled Sielaff and sent him to a crowded U.S. immigration detention center. He spent 16 days locked up before being allowed to fly home to Germany.",
      "Since President Donald Trump took office, there have been other high-profile incidents of tourists like Sielaff being stopped at U.S. border crossings and held for weeks at U.S. immigration detention facilities before being allowed to fly home at their own expense.",
      "They include another German tourist who was stopped at the Tijuana crossing on Jan. 25. Jessica Br\u00f6sche spent over six weeks locked up, including over a week in solitary confinement, a friend said.",
      "On the Canadian border, a backpacker from Wales spent nearly three weeks at a detention center before flying home this week. And a Canadian woman on a work visa detained at the Tijuana border spent 12 days in detention before returning home last weekend.",
      "Sielaff, 25, and the others say it was never made clear why they were taken into custody even after they offered to go home voluntarily.",
      "Pedro Rios, director of the American Friends Service Committee, a nonprofit that aids migrants, said in the 22 years he has worked on the border he has never seen travelers from Western Europe and Canada, longtime U.S. allies, locked up like this.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s definitely unusual with these cases so close together, and the rationale for detaining these people doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t justify the abhorrent treatment and conditions\u201d they endured.",
      "\u201cThe only reason I see is there is a much more fervent anti-immigrant atmosphere,\" Rios said.",
      "U.S. authorities did not respond to a request from The Associated Press for figures on how many tourists have been held at detention facilities or explain why they weren't simply denied entry.",
      "The incidents are fueling anxiety as the Trump administration prepares for a ban on travelers from some countries. Noting the \u201cevolving\u201d federal travel policies, the University of California, Los Angeles sent a notice this week urging its foreign-born students and staff to consider the risks of non-essential travel for spring break, warning \u201cre-entry requirements may change while you are away, impacting your return.\u201d",
      "Immigration and Customs Enforcement said in an email to the AP that Sielaff and Br\u00f6sche, who was held for 45 days, \u201cwere deemed inadmissible\u201d by Customs and Border Protection. That agency said it cannot discuss specifics but \u201cif statutes or visa terms are violated, travelers may be subject to detention and removal.\" The agencies did not comment on the other cases.",
      "Both German tourists were allowed into the United States under a waiver program offered to a select group of countries, mostly in Europe and Asia, whose citizens are allowed to travel to the U.S. for business or leisure for up to 90 days without getting a visa in advance. Applicants register online with the Electronic System for Travel Authorization.",
      "But even if they are authorized to travel under that system, they can still be barred from entering the country.",
      "Sielaff arrived in the U.S. on Jan. 27. He and Tyler decided to go to Tijuana for four days in mid-February because Tyler's dog needed surgery and veterinary services are cheaper there. They figured they would enjoy some tacos and make a fun trip out of it.",
      "\u201cMexico is a wonderful and beautiful country that Lucas and I love to visit,\u201d Tyler said.",
      "They returned Feb. 18, just 22 days into Sielaff's 90-day tourist permit.",
      "When they pulled up to the crossing, the U.S. border agent asked Sielaff aggressively, \u201cWhere are you going? Where do you live?\u201d Tyler said.",
      "\u201cEnglish is not Lucas' first language and so he said, \u2018We\u2019re going to Las Vegas,' and the agent says, \u2019Oh, we caught you. You live in Las Vegas. You can't do that,'\" Tyler said, recounting what happened.",
      "Sielaff was taken away for more questioning. Tyler said she asked to go with him or if he could get a translator and was told to be quiet, then taken out of her car and handcuffed and chained to a bench. Her dog, recovering from surgery, was left in the car.",
      "After four hours, Tyler was allowed to leave but said she was given no information about her fianc\u00e9\u2019s whereabouts.",
      "During questioning, Sielaff said he told authorities he never lived in the U.S. and had no criminal history. He said he was given a full-body search and ordered to hand over his cellphone and belongings. He was put in a holding cell where he slept on a bench for two days before being transferred to the Otay Mesa Detention Center in San Diego.",
      "There, he said, he shared a cell with eight others.",
      "\u201cYou are angry, you are sad, you don\u2019t know when you can get out,\u201d Sielaff said. \u201cYou just don\u2019t get any answers from anybody.\u201d",
      "He was finally told to get a direct flight to Germany and submit a confirmation number. In a frantic call from Sielaff, Tyler bought it for $2,744. He flew back March 5.",
      "\u201cWhat happened at the border was just blatant abuse of the Border Patrol\u2019s power,\u201d Tyler said.",
      "Ashley Paschen agrees. She said she learned about Br\u00f6sche from a TikTok video asking anyone in the San Diego area for help after her family learned she was being held at the Otay Mesa Detention Center. Paschen visited her several times and told her people were working to get her out. Brosche flew home March 11.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s happy to be home,\u201d Paschen said. \u201cShe seems very relieved if anything but she\u2019s not coming back here anytime soon.\u201d",
      "On Feb. 26, a tourist from Wales, Becky Burke, a backpacker on a trip across North America, was stopped at the U.S.-Canada border and held for nearly three weeks at a detention facility in Washington state, her father, Paul Burke, posted on Facebook. She returned home Tuesday.",
      "On March 3, Canadian Jasmine Mooney, an actress and entrepreneur who had a visa to work in the U.S., was detained at the Tijuana crossing. She was released Saturday, her friend Brittany Kors said.",
      "Before Mooney's release, British Columbia Premier David Eby expressed concern, saying, \u201cIt certainly reinforces anxiety that many British Columbians have, and many Canadians have, about our relationship with the U.S. right now, and the unpredictability of this administration and its actions.\"",
      "The detentions come amid legal fights over the Trump administration's arrests and deportations of other foreigners with valid visas and green card holders, including a Palestinian activist who helped organize campus protests of the war in Gaza.",
      "Tyler plans to sue the U.S. government.",
      "Sielaff said he and Tyler are now rethinking plans to hold their wedding in Las Vegas. He suffers nightmares and is considering therapy to cope with the trauma.",
      "\u201cNobody is safe there anymore to come to America as a tourist,\u201d he said.",

      "Boeing subjected John Barnett to a \u201ccampaign of harassment, abuse and intimidation intended to discourage, discredit and humiliate him until he would either give up or be discredited,\u201d lawyers for the family wrote in a wrongful death lawsuit filed in federal court in South Carolina.",
      "Barnett, 62, shot himself March 9, 2024, in Charleston after answering questions from attorneys for several days. He lived in Louisiana.",

      "Barnett was a longtime Boeing employee and worked as a quality-control manager before he retired in 2017. In the years after that, he shared his concerns with journalists and became a whistleblower.",
      "Barnett said he once saw discarded metal shavings near wiring for the flight controls that could have cut wiring and caused a catastrophe. He also noted problems with up to a quarter of the oxygen systems on Boeing\u2019s 787 planes.",
      "Barnett shared his concerns with his supervisors and others before leaving Boeing, but according to the lawsuit they responded by ignoring him and then harassing him.",
      "Boeing intentionally gave Barnett inaccurate, poor job reviews and less desirable shifts, according to the lawsuit. Barnett's family argues the company publicly blamed him for delays that angered his co-workers and prevented him from transferring to another plant.",
      "Barnett eventually was diagnosed with PTSD and his mental condition deteriorated, his family said.",

      "A man who had voluntarily agreed to be taken to a psychiatric hospital by Philadelphia police grabbed an officer's gun outside the facility and wounded him before being fatally shot by another officer, the city police commissioner said, noting the wounded officer's bulletproof vest spared him from serious injury.",
      "The shooting occurred shortly before 1 p.m. at Friends Hospital, Commissioner Kevin Bethel said. He said the two city officers had encountered the man earlier Thursday after he was seen walking in traffic, and he agreed to go to the hospital for a mental health evaluation.",
      "The man was driven to the hospital in a police van but was not handcuffed because he had agreed to go voluntarily, Bethel said. As the officers were speaking with him after they arrived, the man became combative and attacked one of the officers.",
      "One officer fired a Taser at the man, who continued to struggle as all three men fell to the ground. The man took an officer's gun and started firing, wounding that officer, who was struck at the base of his vest.",
      "The other officer shot the man multiple times, and he was taken to another hospital where he later died from his injuries. His name has not been released.",
      "The second officer was not shot in the scuffle but did suffer an undisclosed injury. Both officers were treated at a third hospital and were later released.",
      "Noting that the wounded officer was shot \u201cvery close to the bottom of his vest,\u201d Philadelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker said the incident could have been much worse.",
      "\u201cBut for an inch we could be here under a different set of circumstances and facts,\u201d Parker said.",

      "A successor for Gardner was not immediately named.",
      "Gardner's departure also arrives just weeks after billionaire Elon Musk floated the idea of privatizing Amtrak, as well as the U.S. Postal Service, at a Morgan Stanley tech conference earlier this month.",
      "Musk, who has been at the forefront of the Trump administration\u2019s aggressive push to downsize the federal government through the Department of Government Efficiency, reportedly called Amtrak \u201ckind of embarrassing\u201d \u2014 while comparing the U.S. carrier to passenger rails seen in other countries, such as bullet trains in China.",
      "When reached for comment on Thursday, the Transportation Department did not provide further details specific to Gardner's resignation. A statement from Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy took aim at Amtrak's Washington D.C. operations \u2014 calling on Amtrak's leadership to \"clean up Union Station\" and \u201crid of our nation\u2019s treasures of homelessness and crime.\u201d",
      "Citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter, Reuters reported Wednesday that Gardner was asked to step down at the request of Trump, who previously sought to cut Amtrak's budget in his first term.",
      "When reached Thursday, Amtrak declined to comment on whether Gardner was asked to resign. But in Wednesday\u2019s announcement, the Amtrak board stated that it looked forward to \u201cworking with President Trump and Secretary Duffy as we build the world-class passenger rail system this country deserves.\u201d",
      "Gardner first got his start with Amtrak as an intern back in the 90s. He later returned and worked at the rail service for the past 16 years, holding the title of CEO since January 2022.",
      "Amtrak struggled during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic \u2014 with the railroad seeing plummeting ridership as people across the country stopped traveling and stayed home. But passenger numbers have recently rebounded to pre-pandemic levels.",
      "For the 2024 fiscal year, Amtrak reported an all-time ridership record of 32.8 million customer trips. That's up 15% from 2023 \u2014 and surpasses Amtrak's previous record of 32.4 million passengers in 2019.",
      "Ticket revenue for the 2024 fiscal year totaled $2.5 billion, a 9% jump from 2023. And adjusted earnings also improved by 9% year-over-year, to $705.2 million.",

      "NEW YORK -- A real estate businessman who aided a Chinese effort to pressure an expatriate to return home has been sentenced to over a year in a U.S. prison.",
      "U.S. prosecutors say Quanzhong An\u2019s activities were part of the Chinese government's \u201cOperation Fox Hunt\u201d repatriation campaign. Beijing says the initiative is about pursuing people who have fled justice. But Washington sees it as transnational repression, a term for governments working to silence dissenters beyond their borders.",
      "\u201cQuanzhong An acted at the direction of the (Chinese) government to harass and intimidate individuals living on U.S. soil as part of a pernicious scheme to force their repatriation,\u201d Brooklyn-based U.S. Attorney John Durham said in a statement Wednesday.",
      "Messages seeking comment were sent Thursday to China's embassy in Washington and consulate in New York. China has previously denied threatening its nationals abroad.",
      "An, a 58-year-old Chinese citizen and legal U.S. resident, pleaded guilty last year to acting as an illegal foreign agent. He was sentenced to 20 months behind bars. He has served seven of them already.",
      "\u201cMr. An is in my opinion, on balance, a very fine man and accordingly, seeing him return to prison for even one additional day is heartbreaking,\u201d his lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, said Thursday. But he noted that prosecutors had sought a considerably longer prison term.",
      "According to prosecutors and an indictment, An was the key U.S.-based player in a transcontinental effort targeting a former manager of a Chinese state-owned company. Prosecutors haven't named the man or the company.",
      "Beijing has accused the man of embezzlement, identified him as an \u201cOperation Fox Hunt\u201d priority and asked law enforcement agencies worldwide to find and apprehend him, according to the indictment.",
      "An, who lives in suburban Roslyn Heights, New York, showed up at the home of the target's son to try to find the father in 2017, the indictment said.",
      "Then, in a series of recorded meetings with the son starting in early 2020, An leaned on him to secure his father's return to China. An said he that was trying to help the Chinese government communicate with the two, and that he would look good to Chinese officials if he could arrange the father's return, according to the indictment.",
      "While acknowledging that a Chinese embezzlement case against the father and son was a legally frivolous pressure tactic, An told the son that Chinese officials were monitoring the family's relatives and would \u201ckeep pestering you\u201d if the father didn\u2019t return, the indictment said.",
      "\u201cTheir intent is to make your life difficult,\u201d the indictment quotes him as saying.",
      "An even offered to pay back the man's allegedly ill-gotten gains, according to the indictment, and eventually arranged for a Chinese official to press the man's son by phone.",
      "In recent years, the U.S. Justice Department has charged dozens of suspects with acts of transnational repression on behalf of China or other countries. An and his daughter Guangyang An were charged in 2020, along with five other people who were then at large and believed to be in China.",
      "An\u2019s daughter, who also goes by Angela An, is awaiting sentencing after pleading guilty last May. The current status of the other five isn\u2019t immediately clear.",
      "In a separate case in the same Brooklyn federal courthouse, three men were convicted in 2023 at the first trial surrounding U.S. claims about \u201cOperation Fox Hunt.\u201d Two of those defendants have been sentenced to prison; the third is awaiting sentencing.",

      "The U.S. Education Department says it has investigated dozens of universities for alleged racial discrimination, citing ties to a nonprofit organization that has helped Black and Latino students pursue business degrees",
      "Until recently, it was a little-known program to help Black and Latino students pursue business degrees.",
      "But in January, conservative strategist Christopher Rufo flagged the program known as The PhD Project in social media posts that caught the attention of Republican politicians. The program is now at the center of a Trump administration campaign to root out diversity, equity and inclusion programs in higher education.",
      "The U.S. Education Department last week said it was investigating dozens of universities for alleged racial discrimination, citing ties to the nonprofit organization. That followed a warning a month earlier that schools could lose federal money over \u201crace-based preferences\u201d in admissions, scholarships or any aspect of student life.",
      "The investigations left some school leaders startled and confused, wondering what prompted the inquiries. Many scrambled to distance themselves from The PhD Project, which has aimed to help diversify the business world and higher education faculty.",
      "The rollout of the investigations highlights the climate of fear and uncertainty in higher education, which President Donald Trump's administration has begun policing for policies that run afoul of his agenda even as he moves to dismantle the Education Department.",
      "There is a range of nonprofits that work to help minority groups advance in higher education but The PhD Project was not well known before Rufo began posting on X about its work with colleges, said Jonathan Fansmith, senior vice president of government relations at the American Council on Education, an association of college presidents.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not hard to draw some lines between that incident and why 45 institutions that were partners with The PhD Project are getting this investigation announced,\u201d he said.",
      "The 45 colleges under investigation for ties to the organization include public universities such as Arizona State, Ohio State and the University of California, Berkeley, along with private schools like Yale, Cornell, Duke and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",
      "The Education Department sent letters to the universities informing them its Office for Civil Rights had received a complaint and they were under investigation for allegedly discriminating against students on the basis of race or ethnicity because of a past affiliation with The PhD Project. The letters set a March 31 deadline for information about their relationship with the nonprofit.",
      "In a statement, the PhD Project said it aims to \u201ccreate a broader talent pipeline\" of business leaders. \u201cThis year, we have opened our membership application to anyone who shares that vision,\u201d it said.",
      "Public reaction from the universities\u2019 leadership has been minimal and cautious, with most issuing brief statements saying they will cooperate with investigators and refusing further comment.",
      "Colleges may see reason not to push back. The Trump administration has shown willingness to withhold federal funding over issues involving antisemitism allegations, diversity programs and transgender athletes. At Columbia University, under fire for its handling of pro-Palestinian protests, the administration pulled $400 million in federal money and threatened billions more if it does not comply with its demands.",
      "\u201cThere is a concern that if one university steps up and fights this then that university will have all of their funding cut,\u201d said Veena Dubal, general counsel for the American Association of University Professors. \u201cThey are being hindered not just by fear but a real collective action problem. None of these universities wants to be the next example.\u201d",
      "Some colleges moved swiftly to stop working with The PhD Project.",
      "The University of Kentucky said it severed ties with the nonprofit on Monday. The University of Wyoming said in a statement that its college of business was affiliated with the group to develop its graduate student pipeline, but it plans to discontinue its membership.",
      "The University of Nevada, Las Vegas issued a statement saying three professors participated in the program, but two no longer work at the university and a third was killed in a shooting on campus in 2023. Arizona State said its business school is not financially supporting The PhD Project this year and it told faculty in February the school would not support travel to the nonprofit\u2019s conference.",
      "Similar fallout came in Texas earlier this year, when Rufo began posting on X about the PhD Project.",
      "\u201cTexas A&M is sponsoring a trip to a DEI conference,\u201d Rufo posted on Jan. 13. Rufo, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative think tank, accused the university of \u201csupporting racial segregation and breaking the law.\u201d",
      "The next day Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbot posted on X that the university \u201cpresident will soon be gone\u201d unless he immediately \u201cfixed\u201d the matter. Texas A&M responded by withdrawing from the conference, and soon after at least eight other Texas public universities that had participated previously in The PhD Project\u2019s conference also withdrew, the Texas Tribune reported.",
      "Rufo has not responded to a request for comment.",
      "Some of the schools under investigation raised questions about where the complaints against them originated.",
      "Montana State University said it follows all state and federal laws and was \u201csurprised\u201d by the notice it received and \u201cunaware of any complaint made internally with regards to The PhD Project.\u201d",
      "Six other colleges are being investigated for awarding \u201cimpermissible race-based scholarships,\u201d the Education Department said. Additionally, the University of Minnesota is being investigated for allegedly operating a program that segregates students on the basis of race.",
      "At the University of California, Berkeley, hundreds gathered Wednesday on the campus known for student protests. But this one was organized by faculty, who stood on the steps of Sproul Hall, known as the birthplace of the free speech movement in the 1960s.",
      "\u201cThis is a fight that can be summed up in five words: Academic freedom is under assault,\u201d Ula Taylor, a professor of African American studies, said to the crowd.",

      "WASHINGTON -- An American man who was abducted more than two years ago while traveling through Afghanistan as a tourist has been released by the Taliban in a deal with the Trump administration that Qatari negotiators helped broker, the State Department said Thursday.",
      "George Glezmann, an airline mechanic from Atlanta, is the third American detainee to be released by the Taliban since January. He was seized by the Taliban's intelligence services in December 2022 and was designated by the U.S. government as wrongfully detained the following year.",
      "In a statement, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Glezmann was on his way back to the United States to be reunited with his wife, Aleksandra, and praised Qatar for \u201csteadfast commitment and diplomatic efforts\u201d that he said were \u201cinstrumental in securing George\u2019s release.\u201d",
      "\u201cGeorge\u2019s release is a positive and constructive step,\" Rubio said. \u201cIt is also a reminder that other Americans are still detained in Afghanistan. President Trump will continue his tireless work to free ALL Americans unjustly detained around the world.\u201d",
      "Glezmann was being accompanied back to the United States, through Qatar's capital, Doha, by Adam Boehler, who has been handling hostage issues for President Donald Trump's administration. The Taliban disclosed earlier Thursday that Boehler had been meeting on hostage issues with a delegation that included Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi.",
      "The release of Glezmann, who's in his mid-60s, is part of what the Taliban has previously described as the \u201cnormalization\" of ties between the U.S. and Afghanistan following the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021. Most countries still don\u2019t recognize the Taliban\u2019s rule.",
      "Glezmann's release follows a separate deal, arranged in January in the final days of the Biden administration and also mediated by the Qataris, that secured the releases of Ryan Corbett and William McKenty.",
      "The Taliban\u2019s Foreign Ministry in Kabul said at the time that those two U.S. citizens had been exchanged for Khan Mohammed, who was detained on the battlefield in Nangarhar, Afghanistan, and later taken to the U.S, where he was sentenced to two life terms in 2008 after being convicted under U.S. narco-terrorism laws.",
      "Unlike in that arrangement, the U.S. did not give up any prisoner to secure Glezmann\u2019s release, which was done as a goodwill gesture, according to an official briefed on the matter who insisted on anonymity due to the sensitivity of the negotiations.",
      "On Thursday, Afghanistan's Foreign Ministry confirmed the release of the American on \u201chumanitarian grounds.\" In a statement, it said the \u201cIslamic Emirate again reaffirms its longstanding position that dialogue, understanding and diplomacy provide effective avenues for resolving all issues.\u201d",
      "President Joe Biden contemplated before he left office an earlier proposal that would have involved the release of Glezmann and other Americans for Muhammad Rahim, one of the remaining detainees at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. But Biden told families during a call in January that he would not support trading Rahim unless the Taliban released Mahmood Habibi, an Afghan-American businessman who worked as a contractor for a Kabul-based telecommunications company and vanished in 2022.",
      "The FBI and Habibi's family have said they believe Habibi was taken by Taliban forces, but the Taliban has denied holding him. Representatives for Habibi on Thursday cited what they said was \u201coverwhelming evidence\u201d that he was arrested by the Taliban after his home was searched by people identifying themselves as part of the Taliban's security service.",
      "\"We are confident that the Trump Administration will hold firm that my brother needs to be released for relations with the U.S. to move forward,\" one of Habibi\u2019s brothers, Ahmad, said in a statement. \u201cWe have reason to be confident Mahmood is alive and in Taliban custody, despite their hollow denials of holding him. My brother is an innocent man who has been held away from his wife, young daughter, and elderly parents for 953 days.\u201d",

It also said law enforcement authorities were notified immediately about the escape but declined to help in the search.",
      "Federal officials and Republican lawmakers have criticized what are often known as sanctuary policies in places including Denver that limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. Colorado also has state laws that restrict cooperation. However, Aurora police said they have an agreement with the GEO Group, the private company that runs the detention center, to help with escapes but only when they are notified within 15 minutes of an escape.",
      "A facility staffer called 911 to report a possible escape at around 2:30 a.m. Wednesday but didn\u2019t provide enough details, prompting a police commander to call back to get more information, Aurora police said in a timeline based on its records and information obtained from GEO Group. Since it was later determined the escape was believed to have happened around 10 p.m. Tuesday, an officer did not go to the facility to follow up until around 5 a.m. Wednesday, according to the timeline.",
      "An assistant administrator told the officer they realized the men \u2014 one from Mexico and one from Venezuela \u2014 were missing during an emergency headcount conducted because of the power outage, the officer's report said. Staff believe they escaped through doors leading to a soccer field, it said.",

      "Authorities said the woman had been told she could not bring her dog aboard because she did not have the proper paperwork. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, dogs traveling from the U.S. to Colombia must be accompanied by a veterinarian-issued health certificate and a rabies vaccination certificate.",
      "The dog was identified by its implanted microchip and a necropsy determined that Tywinn had been drowned. U.S. Customs and Border Protection also confirmed to detectives that the woman had boarded a flight to Bogota, Colombia, and then flew to Ecuador.",

    "story": [
      "A jury has convicted two purported Russian mobsters of plotting to assassinate Iranian American journalist Masih Alinejad at her home in New York City",
      "NEW YORK -- Two purported mobsters were convicted Thursday of plotting to assassinate Iranian American journalist Masih Alinejad at her home in New York City in a murder-for-hire scheme that prosecutors said was financed by Iran's government.",
      "The verdict was returned at a federal court in New York, ending a two-week trial that featured dramatic testimony from a hired gunman and Alinejad, an author, activist and contributor to Voice of America.",
      "Alinejad, who was not in court, told The Associated Press she cried when she learned of the verdict.",
      "\u201cI am relieved that after nearly three years, the men who plotted to kill me have been found guilty. But make no mistake, the real masterminds of this crime are still in power in Iran,\u201d she said. \u201cRight now I am bombarded with emotions. I have cried. I have laughed. I have even danced.\u201d",
      "Alinejad called the verdict \u201ca powerful gift from the American government\u201d to the people of Iran because it shows that justice is beginning to be served.",
      "Acting U.S. Attorney Matthew Podolsky said in a statement that the verdicts sent a message that \u201cif you target U.S. citizens, we will find you, no matter where you are, and bring you to justice.\u201d",
      "Leslie R. Backschies, who heads the FBI's New York office, said the verdicts show that the \u201cIranian government's shameless conduct and attempt to violate our laws and assassinate a critic of their human rights atrocities will not be tolerated.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors said the convicted men, Rafat Amirov and Polad Omarov, were crime bosses in the Russian mob. Defense lawyers argued at trial that their clients were innocent and evidence was flawed.",
      "\u201cWe respect the jury's verdict, but plan on filing an appeal on Mr. Omarov's behalf,\u201d Elena Fast, an attorney for Omarov, said via email. A lawyer for Amirov did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Alinejad, 48, was targeted by Iran for her online campaigns encouraging women there to record videos of themselves exposing their hair in violation of edicts requiring they cover it in public.",
      "Prosecutors said Iranian intelligence officials first plotted in 2020 and 2021 to kidnap her in the U.S. and move her to Iran to silence her criticism.",
      "When that failed, Iran offered $500,000 for a July 2022 killing of Alinejad after efforts to harass, smear and intimidate her failed, prosecutors said.",
      "American officials have accused Iran of backing several assassination plots in the United States, including against President Donald Trump when he was campaigning last year. Tehran has denied being behind any such plots.",
      "Alinejad testified last week that she came to the United States in 2009 after she was banned from covering Iran's disputed presidential election and the newspaper where she worked was shut down.",
      "Establishing herself in New York City, she built an online audience of millions and launched her \u201cMy Stealthy Freedom\u201d campaign, telling Iranian women to send photos and videos exposing of them showing their hair when the morality police were not around.",
      "Soon, she said, she had inspired women to take to the streets in Iran on Wednesdays to peacefully protest, leading the government to arrest hundreds of them. The crackdown only caused her following to grow, however.",
      "Prosecutors said at trial that by 2022, the Iranian government had enlisted organized crime figures including Amirov and Omarov to kill Alinejad.",
      "Khalid Mehdiyev, a former member of the Russian mob who lived Yonkers and worked at a pizzeria, testified that he was hired as the hitman. Like Amirov and Omarov, he is from Azerbaijan, which shares a border and cultural ties with Iran.",
      "Mehdiyev, who cooperated with prosecutors after pleading guilty to multiple crimes, said he bought an AK-47 to kill Alinejad but the plan was foiled when his car was stopped by police and the gun was found in the back seat in July 2022. A doorbell camera at Alinejad's home recorded Mehdiyev standing on her front porch.",
      "Prosecutors have kept the investigation open. In October they announced charges against a senior Iranian military official and three others, none of whom are in custody.",
      "In a separate case, U.S. prosecutors in 2022 charged a man in Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard with plotting to kill former U.S. national security adviser John Bolton.",
      "Iranian officials vowed to exact revenge against Trump and others in his former administration over the 2020 drone strike that killed the prominent Revolutionary Guard Gen. Qassem Soleimani in Baghdad.",
      "Alinejad said she has had to move nearly two dozen times since the assassination plot was discovered, at times feeling guilty that so many of her followers in Iran lack a safety net.",
      "That, she said, only \u201cmakes me more determined to give voice to voiceless people.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Arlando \u201cTray\u201d Jones is among thousands of people seeking accountability under a new state law that eliminated the statute of limitations for child sexual abuse claims",
      "BALTIMORE -- Arlando \u201cTray\u201d Jones was a toddler when his dad was killed by Baltimore police during a robbery. His mom died several years later after battling alcoholism.",
      "His surviving relatives often struggled to provide for him. Sometimes the lights got turned off and the refrigerator was empty.",
      "Jones turned to a notorious neighborhood drug dealer, a sinister father figure whose lavish lifestyle demonstrated what could be achieved in the streets. Under the supervision of \u201cFat Larry,\u201d Jones finally had stable housing and money in his pocket, but violence was all around him. He started carrying a gun and punishing anyone who crossed him. Barely a teenager, he was charged with attempted murder and sent to juvenile detention in the early 1980s.",
      "There, at the Maryland Training School for Boys, Jones says a staff member repeatedly sexually assaulted him while another kept watch. The guards would corner children in dark spaces and bribe them with extra snacks and other special treatment, according to a slew of recent lawsuits alleging widespread misconduct in Maryland\u2019s juvenile detention facilities.",
      "\u201cThey broke me,\u201d Jones said, recounting how his abusers beat him into submission. \u201cEverything that connected me to my humanity was just gone.\u201d",
      "Jones is among thousands of people seeking accountability under a new state law that eliminated the statute of limitations for child sexual abuse claims. It was passed in 2023 with the Catholic Church abuse scandal in mind. But now Maryland lawmakers are scrambling to address an unexpected onslaught of cases targeting the state\u2019s juvenile justice system. They\u2019re worried the state budget can\u2019t support a potential payout.",
      "The Associated Press requested an interview with the state\u2019s Department of Juvenile Services, but the department responded with a statement instead.",
      "\u201cDJS takes allegations of sexual abuse of children in our care with utmost seriousness and we are working hard to provide decent, humane and rehabilitative environments for youth committed to the Department. We do not comment on pending litigation,\u201d the agency said.",
      "To the plaintiffs, it\u2019s no surprise that Maryland leaders failed to anticipate a public reckoning of this size. Many victims spent decades in silence, paralyzed by shame. They were some of Maryland\u2019s most vulnerable residents, mostly Black kids growing up in poverty with little family support.",
      "All these years later, Jones still broke down crying in an interview. \u201cBut now I know the shame is not mine to bear,\u201d he said.",
      "Maryland lawmakers passed the Child Victims Act in the immediate aftermath of a scathing investigative report that revealed widespread abuse within the Archdiocese of Baltimore. Before its passage, victims couldn\u2019t sue after they turned 38.",
      "The law change prompted the archdiocese to file for bankruptcy to protect its assets. But state leaders didn\u2019t anticipate they\u2019d be facing similar budgetary concerns. Lawmakers are now considering new legislation to shield the state financially.",
      "An estimated 6,000 people have retained attorneys and new complaints are pouring in, according to lawyers involved. In addition to monetary damages, plaintiffs want mandated reform of Maryland\u2019s juvenile justice system.",
      "The system has drawn serious criticism over the years. A 2004 Justice Department report found a \u201cdeeply disturbing degree of physical abuse\u201d at the facility where Jones was detained, now called the Charles H. Hickey Jr. School. The state closed Hickey\u2019s youth treatment program in 2005, but it\u2019s still operating as a youth detention center.",
      "Many other facilities named in the lawsuits have already been closed, and state leaders have strengthened oversight in recent years. They\u2019ve also focused on detaining fewer youths.",
      "Advocates say they\u2019re confident the system is significantly less abusive than it was.",
      "Other states have faced similar reckonings after changing their laws. While juvenile arrests and detention rates are declining nationally, research shows the majority of detainees are children of color. A 2024 report from the nonprofit The Sentencing Project found Black youth are roughly five times more likely to be incarcerated than their white peers.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not just in Maryland, it\u2019s everywhere,\u201d said attorney Corey Stern, who represents Jones and others. \u201cIt\u2019s really a ripple effect across the U.S.\u201d",
      "Still, the Maryland lawsuits paint a particularly disturbing picture. It wasn\u2019t just select facilities or a small group of abusive staff members, it was statewide and persisted for decades, attorneys say. The abuse was often a poorly kept secret, but the system repeatedly failed to stop it, the lawsuits say.",
      "In a complaint filed earlier this month, 69 people brought claims against the same abuser, a former housing supervisor at Hickey.",
      "One of the plaintiffs in that case, who asked to remain anonymous, said that as the abuse escalated, he started to avoid properly cleaning himself to become less desirable. He later spent decades struggling with addiction and mental health issues. He said suing the state \u201ceven now felt like I was snitching.\u201d The AP doesn\u2019t typically identify victims of abuse unless they want to be named.",
      "Nalisha Gibbs said she didn\u2019t initially report her abuse because no one would have listened. A past experience gave her proof of that.",
      "Not long before she went to juvenile detention over a missed curfew enforced by a school truancy officer, Gibbs said, she had been raped by an uncle \u2014 and punished by her mother when she didn\u2019t keep quiet about the abuse.",
      "In the detention center, a female guard would come to her cell at night and assault her. Gibbs said the woman would degrade her, calling her worthless and \u201ca throwaway.\u201d",
      "For coming home 15 minutes after curfew, she was sentenced to a lifetime of trauma.",
      "After 30 days in detention, Gibbs never went back to middle school. She ended up in foster care, where she suffered more sexual abuse. She spent most of her 20s addicted to drugs, sometimes living on the streets. But in 2008, she sought treatment. She enrolled in a transitional housing program and earned her GED. She now lives with her fianc\u00e9 and his mother.",
      "Thinking back on her childhood, she sees a scared little girl who needed an adult to stand up for her.",
      "\u201cShe just had so much life snuffed out by people mistreating her and mishandling her,\u201d Gibbs said through tears. \u201cBut I\u2019m not that little girl anymore. I can fight for myself.\u201d",
      "A couple years after being released from Hickey, Jones was involved in a fight over drugs that escalated into gunshots, killing Joshua O\u2019Neal.",
      "Jones was 16 when he was arrested and charged with murder. He was later convicted and sentenced to life in prison.",
      "He said the sexual abuse pushed him over the edge; if he was headed down a negative path before juvenile detention, that experience sent him hurtling toward the unchecked brutality of the drug game.",
      "In 2022, he was released from prison under a state law that allows sentence reductions for people convicted as children.",
      "During his incarceration, Jones earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in psychology. He\u2019s studied philosophy and published two books. Now 56, he works at Georgetown University\u2019s Prisons and Justice Initiative, which teaches students about mass incarceration and prison reform.",
      "He said getting educated restored some of the humanity he lost. It helped him regain his freedom and gave him a second chance at life. It also made him question everything.",
      "\u201cAn orphan child surviving poverty as best I can,\u201d he said. \u201cWhere was my first chance?\u201d",
      "\u2014\u2014",

      "The Trump administration's cuts to foreign aid have defunded groups that campaign for LGBTQ+ communities and for democracy around the world",
      "In early 2024, Matthew Hart took a hard look at the upcoming elections around the world and worried that the outcomes did not look promising.",
      "\u201cWhat we knew was that the winds were not in our favor. The winds were not in our sail, and we saw all around the world a kind of moral panic,\u201d said Hart, executive director of the Global Philanthropy Project, a network of funders for LGBTQ+ people internationally.",
      "Rising authoritarianism and religiously motivated political movements were mixing into a \u201ctoxic blend\" that regularly targets trans, intersex and gay people, they said in an interview with The Associated Press.",
      "Hart was among the philanthropic leaders who tried to prepare for not just changes under the Trump administration, but growing trends toward autocracy and crackdowns on human rights around the world.",
      "As a result, last year, Global Philanthropy Project quietly launched a campaign called \u201cFund Our Futures\u201d to raise money for LGBTQ+ organizations around the world. In November, they announced they had secured more than $100 million and have since raised the bar to try to bring in another $50 million. Donors will award the funds over the next three to five years and GPP will track their commitments.",
      "While few anticipated the speed and breadth of the Trump administration's policy changes, Hart had seen funders grapple with fear and paralysis in moments of crisis.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a history in philanthropy that that you sort of wait and see. What\u2019s going to happen?\u201d Hart said. \u201cWe thought, \u2019Oh, we have got to get ahead of this. Because if we don\u2019t secure the commitments now, we\u2019re talking two years of internal, philanthropic field work that would need to be done.\u201d",
      "Phil Buchanan, president of The Center for Effective Philanthropy, said the early preparation will allow funders to identify and support organizations aligned with their goals. But he said, no funder can expect to always be accurate in their forecasting.",
      "\u201cPreparation is really important,\u201d he said, \u201cAnd then also, so is being responsive when the context looks different than what you prepared for.\u201d",
      "For example, few funders contemplated the wholesale termination of most U.S. foreign aid, which has had vast and cascading effects on organizations across every geography and issue. Trump singled out foundations with large endowments for investigation in one of his executive orders on diversity, equity and inclusion and in a memo in February, he accused many nonprofits who have received federal funding of engaging \u201cin actions that actively undermine the security, prosperity, and safety of the American people.\"",
      "Funders who support democracy movements in inhospitable environments have some experience adapting to these kinds of threats. Even so, Kellea Miller, executive director of the Human Rights Funders Network, said they were caught off guard.",
      "\u201cThere are areas that Trump has very quickly shifted that we knew he would touch, but the scale and rapidity of it is beyond what most of us had imagined,\u201d she said, adding that she had expected more action from Congress.",
      "Starting in 2021, HRFN convened funders to coordinate their responses to crises like the presidential assassination Haiti and the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. Those conversations grew into a framework called Better Preparedness, which encourages foundations to consider in advance of a crisis how they want to react.",
      "\u201cSo we\u2019re not all funding the same groups and that we\u2019re also able to distribute the risk and risk appetite in a way that we can\u2019t if we\u2019re not honest and and working together,\u201d Miller said.",
      "Miller said now in the U.S., funders of democracy and human rights movements worry the Trump administration will threaten their ability to operate.",
      "\u201cA lot of foundations are very, very cautious right now because they\u2019re worried that their assets could be frozen. They\u2019re concerned that they will be targeted politically,\u201d she said.",
      "The commitments to the Fund Our Futures campaign represent a noticeable portion of the funding for groups that serve gay, transgender and intersex people around the world even as some government funding has been taken away.",
      "In 2021-2022, private philanthropy and donor governments together gave $905 million to these groups, according to the most recent research by GPP.",
      "Of that total, 20 foundations alone gave $522 million, or around 50% of the total, highlighting the importance of these private donations to supporting international LGBTQ+ communities. Sixteen governments and multilateral donors gave $175 million to LGBTQ+ groups, with the largest funder being the Netherlands.",
      "As part of its dramatic reduction in U.S. foreign aid, the Trump administration has also ended its policy of supporting the rights of LGBTQ+ people abroad, which the Biden administration had made a priority. In an exit memo from January, USAID staff under Biden wrote that the agency increased funding for programs for LBGTQ+ communities abroad from $6 million in 2021 to $25 million in 2024.",
      "The Netherlands and another major funder of LGBTQ+ communities, Sweden, both recently announced cuts to their foreign assistance. Canada, which is another major funder, has so far not changed their commitments.",
      "Even with the new resources in the pipeline, the cuts from government funders have significantly disrupted groups that serve LGBTQ+ communities, Hart said. In their view, every philanthropic dollar they can raise will help save the lives of trans, intersex and gay people around the world, who will be under greater attack as support for democracy more broadly falters.",
      "\u201cGender justice, feminist movements, freedom of movement and LGBTI people are all being attacked at the same time,\u201d Hart said. \u201cThat is a fundamental disruption to some of the core tenets of how modern democracy was proposed to function.\u201d",

      "Wendell Grissom, 56, will receive a lethal injection at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester in Oklahoma\u2019s first execution of 2025, officials said.",
      "Grissom and a co-defendant, Jessie Floyd Johns, were convicted of killing of Amber Matthews, 23, and wounding her friend, Dreu Kopf, at Kopf\u2019s Blaine County residence. Johns was sentenced to life in prison without parole.",
      "Prosecutors said Grissom, who had a lengthy criminal record, picked up Johns, who was hitch-hiking, and the two men were driving west on Interstate 40 when they decided to commit robberies. They randomly selected Kopf's home near Watonga, where Matthews was visiting Kopf and her two young children.",
      "Matthews was shot twice in the head and left clinging to life on the floor as Kopf, also shot twice and seriously wounded, managed to flee in Grissom's truck to get help, prosecutors said. Grissom and Johns also fled, on a stolen four-wheeler, but quickly ran out of gas and were captured after hitching a ride to a cafe in a nearby county.",
      "Authorities found Kopf's children still inside the home, physically unhurt. Matthews died after being flown by helicopter to an Oklahoma City hospital.",
      "Grissom\u2019s attorneys did not dispute his guilt, but argued at a clemency hearing that he suffered from brain damage that was never presented to a jury. The state\u2019s Pardon and Parole Board denied Grissom\u2019s request.",
      "His attorneys told the board Grissom always accepted responsibility, even writing an apology to Matthews' family during his first interview with police.",
      "\"He cannot change the past, but he is now and always has been deeply ashamed and remorseful,\u201d said Kristi Christopher, an attorney with the federal public defender's office.",
      "Kopf told the board that she still carries deep mental and physical scars from the attack, including bullet fragments that remain in her body. For years thereafter, she said she called 911 when the doorbell rang or a stranger appeared in her neighborhood.",

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s own words keep getting used against him in court while he faces lawsuits challenging his aggressive agenda",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Donald Trump\u2019s shoot-from-the-lip style kept Americans on the edge of their seats during last year's campaign. But now that he's speaking as a president and not as a candidate, his words are being used against him in court in the blizzard of litigation challenging his agenda.",
      "The spontaneity is complicating his administration's legal positions. Nowhere has this been clearer than in cases involving his adviser Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency, the driving force in his efforts to downsize and overhaul the federal government.",
      "The latest example came earlier this week when U.S. District Judge Theodore Chuang ruled that Musk had likely violated the Constitution by dismantling the United States Agency for International Development.",
      "The lawsuit turned on the question of whether the billionaire entrepreneur had overstepped his authority. Justice Department lawyers and White House officials insist that Musk is merely a presidential adviser, not the actual leader of DOGE.",
      "But Trump has said otherwise \u2014 in speeches, interviews and public remarks \u2014 and Chuang quoted him extensively in his decision.",
      "Trump most notably boasted of creating DOGE during his prime-time address to a joint session of Congress and said it was \u201cheaded by Elon Musk.\" Republicans gave Musk a standing ovation, and he saluted from the gallery above the House chamber.",
      "\u201cTrump\u2019s words were essential, central and indispensable,\u201d said Norm Eisen, one of the lawyers for USAID employees who filed the lawsuit. \u201cHis admissions took what would have been a tough case and made it into a straightforward one.\u201d",
      "The looseness with words is a shift from predecessors like Democratic President Barack Obama, who used to say that he was careful because anything he said could send troops marching or markets tumbling.",
      "Trump has no such feeling of restraint, and neither do other members of his Republican administration such as Musk.",
      "Chuang, who is based in Maryland and was nominated by Obama, also cited social media posts from Musk, who writes frequently on X, the platform that he owns.",
      "For example, Musk posted \u201cwe spent the weekend feeding USAID to the woodchipper\u201d on Feb. 3. The agency was being brought to a standstill at that time, with staff furloughed, spending halted and headquarters shut down.",
      "\"Musk\u2019s public statements and posts ... suggest that he has the ability to cause DOGE to act,\" Chuang wrote in his ruling.",
      "Harrison Fields, principal deputy press secretary at the White House, said Trump was fulfilling his campaign promise \u201cto make the federal government more efficient and accountable to taxpayers.\u201d",
      "\u201cRogue bureaucrats and activist judges attempting to undermine this effort are only subverting the will of the American people and their obstructionist efforts will fail,\u201d he said.",
      "Anthony Coley, who led public affairs at the Justice Department during Democratic President Joe Biden\u2019s administration, said statements involving civil litigation were always coordinated between his office and the West Wing.",
      "\u201cThe words could be used to support what we\u2019re doing or undermine what we\u2019re doing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a carefully choreographed effort to make sure there was no daylight between what was said in the court of public opinion and what could ultimately play out in the court of law.\u201d",
      "In comparison to how things were done in the past, Coley said, Trump has a \u201cready-fire-aim approach of doing business.\u201d",
      "Trump doesn't usually let legal disputes force him to turn down the volume. During a criminal investigation over his decision to keep classified records at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida after leaving the White House in 2021, Trump spoke extensively about the case in an interview with Fox News.",
      "Longtime defense lawyers were startled because defendants are usually encouraged to keep mum while facing an indictment. But the situation panned out for Trump. His legal team delayed the case, and the special counsel's office dropped the charges after Trump won the election last November \u2014 presidents can't be prosecuted while in office.",
      "DOGE has been the focus of nearly two dozen lawsuits. It's often prevailed so far in cases involving access to government data, where several plaintiffs have struggled to convince judges to block the organization's actions.",
      "But it's also run into challenges, such as a lawsuit over whether DOGE must comply with public records requests. The Trump administration asserted in court that DOGE is part of the White House, meaning it's exempt.",
      "Judge Christopher Cooper, also nominated by Obama, disagreed, siding with a government watchdog group called Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, or CREW.",
      "\u201cMusk and the President\u2019s public statements indicate that USDS\" \u2014 the original acronym for the organization that was renamed as DOGE \u2014 \"is in fact exercising substantial independent authority,\u201d wrote Cooper, who is based in Washington.",
      "Cooper concluded that DOGE can \"identify and terminate federal employees, federal programs, and federal contracts. Doing any of those three things would appear to require substantial independent authority; to do all three surely does.\u201d",
      "He ordered DOGE to start responding to requests about the team\u2019s role in mass firings and disruptions to federal programs. The administration unsuccessfully asked the judge to reconsider, saying the judge \u201cfundamentally misapprehended\u201d the agency's structure.",
      "The cases are still in their early stages, and the novel legal questions they're raising will take time for the courts to consider, said Michael Fragoso, a fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center and former chief counsel to Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.",
      "\u201cWhat Elon does on Twitter is not necessarily what DOGE does,\u201d he said. \u201cMy hope would be courts take the time to sift between those two.\u201d",
      "Just because Musk claims credit online for deep agency cuts, that doesn\u2019t necessarily translate to DOGE having authority in the eyes of the law, Stanford Law School professor Michael McConnell argued in a recent debate on the issue.",
      "DOGE is recommending changes, he said, but it\u2019s the agency heads who are actually putting them into effect.",
      "\u201cAnd that\u2019s all that the courts are going to care about as to what the Supreme Court is going to do,\u201d McConnell said at the debate hosted by the National Constitution Center.",

      "Kentucky Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear has vetoed a GOP-backed bill to dismantle diversity, equity and inclusion efforts at the state's public universities",
      "FRANKFORT, Ky. -- Kentucky Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear vetoed a GOP-backed bill Thursday to dismantle diversity, equity and inclusion efforts at public universities, declaring that diversity should be embraced as a strength while branding the legislation as being \u201cabout hate.\u201d",
      "Beshear, who is seen as a potential presidential candidate in 2028, announced his veto in a social media video. His defense of diversity initiatives comes as Republican President Donald Trump seeks to end government support for programs promoting diversity, equity and inclusion.",
      "\u201cI believe in the Golden Rule that says we love our neighbor as ourself, and there are no exceptions, no asterisks,\u201d Beshear said. \"We love and we accept everyone. This bill isn\u2019t about love. House Bill 4 is about hate. So I\u2019m gonna try a little act of love myself and I\u2019m gonna to veto it right now.\u201d",
      "The anti-DEI legislation cleared both legislative chambers by lopsided margins. Kentucky's Republican-supermajority legislature will have a chance to override Beshear's veto when lawmakers reconvene in late March for the final two days of this year's 30-day session. Throughout Beshear's tenure as governor, GOP lawmakers have, with gusto, routinely swept aside his vetoes to push their policies into law.",
      "The bill originated in the Kentucky House, and a spokeswoman for House Republicans didn't immediately respond to an email seeking comment on Beshear's veto.",
      "The measure rejected by Beshear would require Kentucky's public universities and community and technical colleges to defund DEI initiatives. It also would require the schools to eliminate DEI offices and prohibit them from requiring students or staff to attend DEI training sessions.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll always believe that diversity is a strength and never a weakness,\u201d Beshear said. \u201cThat we are better with more voices and more seats at our table.\u201d",
      "More than 50 universities are being investigated for alleged racial discrimination as part of Trump\u2019s campaign to end DEI programs, which his officials say exclude white and Asian American students.",
      "The U.S. Education Department recently announced the new investigations, coming one month after issuing a memo warning America\u2019s schools and colleges that they could lose federal money over \u201crace-based preferences\u201d in admissions, scholarships or any aspect of student life.",
      "Trump plans to sign an executive order Thursday calling for the dismantling of the U.S. Education Department, advancing a campaign promise to eliminate an agency that\u2019s been a longtime target of conservatives who criticize it as wasteful and polluted by liberal ideology. However, completing its dismantling is most likely impossible without an act of Congress, which created the department in 1979.",

      "An appeals court has upheld California\u2019s law banning gun magazines that hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition, a decision that prompted one judge to record an unusual video dissent while loading guns in his chambers",
      "LOS ANGELES -- An appeals court ruled Thursday that California\u2019s law banning gun magazines that hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition can remain in place, a decision that prompted one judge to record an unusual video dissent that shows him loading guns in his chambers.",
      "The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 7-4 that the law was permissible under the Second Amendment because large-capacity magazines are not considered \u201carms\u201d or \u201cprotected accessories.\"",
      "Even if they were, California's ban \u201dfalls within the Nation\u2019s tradition of protecting innocent persons by prohibiting especially dangerous uses of weapons and by regulating components necessary to the firing of a firearm,\" the opinion stated.",
      "Judge Lawrence VanDyke disagreed, and included a link to a video of himself posted on YouTube in his dissent.",
      "\u201cThis is the first video like this that I've ever made,\u201d VanDyke said. \u201cI share this because a rudimentary understanding of how guns are made, sold, used, and commonly modified makes obvious why California's proposed test and the one my colleagues are adopting today simply does not work.\u201d",
      "In the video, VanDyke handles several guns in his chambers and demonstrates how they are loaded and fired. He also shows high-capacity magazines and argues that they are no different from other gun accessories that could be added to a firearm to make it more dangerous. Under the majority's logic, he said, that would allow the government to pick and choose any of them to be banned.",
      "Judge Marsha S. Berzon criticized VanDyke's video in a separate opinion, saying he was including \u201cfacts outside the record\u201d and was, in essence, appointing himself an expert witness in the case.",
      "The law has remained in effect as the state appealed a 2023 ruling by a district court judge in San Diego that it was unconstitutional. The ruling was in response to legal action filed by four individuals and the California Rifle & Pistol Association challenging the law\u2019s constitutionality under the Second Amendment.",
      "The majority opinion judges said their decision to uphold the law is in line with a Supreme Court ruling in 2022 that set a new standard that relies more on the historical tradition of gun regulation rather than public interests, including safety.",
      "California Attorney General Rob Bonta praised the appeals court's decision.",
      "\u201cThis commonsense restriction on how many rounds a gunman can fire before they must pause to reload has been identified as a critical intervention to limit a lone shooter\u2019s capacity to turn shootings into mass casualty attacks,\" Bonta said in a statement. \"Let me be clear, this law saves lives.\u201d",

      "In a speech Thursday to the American Chamber of Commerce, Lai said his administration is determined to \"ensure that our defense budget exceeds 3% of the GDP. At the same time, we will continue to reform national defense.\u201d",
      "Lai\u2019s comments were the latest reassurance to U.S. and domestic critics who say Taiwan is not spending enough on its own defense. The self-governing island, which relies on the U.S. for much of its cutting-edge weaponry, currently spends about 2.45% of its gross domestic product on its military.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump has demanded that Taiwan increase defense spending as high as 10% of GDP, a proportion well above what the U.S. or any of its major allies spend, in order to deter China.",
      "China\u2019s actions have also unsettled neighbors in the South China Sea and other parts of the Indo-Pacific.",
      "Leaders in Australia and New Zealand have said China should have given them more warning before its navy conducted an unusual series of live fire exercises in the seas between the two countries last month, forcing flights to divert on short notice.",
      "Lai said that Taiwan plans to \u201cadvance our cooperation with the U.S. and other democracies in upholding regional stability and prosperity.\"",
      "China considers the self-governing democracy of Taiwan as part of its own territory and has significantly boosted its military to make good on its threat to invade the island to assert its control.",
      "Raymond Greene, the de-facto U.S. ambassador to Taiwan; Dan Silver, the chamber chairperson; and Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy attended the speech.",
      "Taiwan and the U.S. have no formal diplomatic ties but American law requires Washington respond to threats toward the island.",

    "summary": "Questions have been raised over what caused the outage and why back-up systems failed?",
    "story": [
      "It seems astounding that a single fire at an electricity source shut down one of the world's busiest airports.",
      "The disruption to the journeys of thousands of passengers and millions of tonnes of trade goods on Friday has prompted a series of questions over the resilience of the UK's major infrastructure.",
      "Disaster recovery plans keep the top brass of many organisations awake at night.",
      "Banks, data centres, stock exchanges, hospitals, all have contingency plans.",
      "\"How is it that critical infrastructure - of national and global importance - is totally dependent on a single power source without an alternative?\", said Willie Walsh, the director general of the International Air Transport Association,  which represents airlines.",
      "He said the shutdown was the result of a \"clear planning failure\".",
      "Heathrow does in fact have more than one source of electricity, however, as one National Grid insider told the BBC, but the fire that broke out damaged a \"particularly important bit\".",
      "That meant the back-up systems in place for a scenario like this proved ineffective when the blaze ripped through the substation, which is used by the National Grid to transform high voltage electricity to a lower and safer voltage for use.",
      "This is a process which generates a lot of heat which is dissipated using flammable cooling oils. This is what caught light in this instance. The exact cause is not yet known, but counter terrorism police are looking into whether there was any foul play.",
      "Internationally embarrassing",
      "Heathrow uses as much energy as a small city, so it is not possible for it to have the back-up power by itself to run its operation safely.",
      "A source at Heathrow said it did however have back-up options for certain key systems, but kickstarting the alternative power supplies for the whole airport took time.",
      "The systems need to be checked to ensure they are working properly.",
      "A Heathrow source said its back-up diesel generators and uninterruptable power supplies in place all operated as expected.",
      "The problem lay with the National Grid, the source said, pointing out thousands of homes had been left without power, not just the airport.",
      "There are two National Grid substations close to Heathrow: one at North Hyde, north of the airport, and one at Laleham, south of the airport, according to energy analysis firm Montel Group.",
      "It appears that only the North Hyde substation is connected to Heathrow through the local distribution network, said Phil Hewitt, director at the firm.",
      "\"This potential lack of resilience at a critical national and international infrastructure site is worrying,\" he said. \"An airport as large and as important as Heathrow should not be vulnerable to a single point of failure.\"",
      "However, Robin Potter, a research fellow at Chatham House, said Heathrow was one of only two UK airports \u2013 Gatwick is the other \u2013 that has any level of regulation around its resilience standards.",
      "\"These are actually the better airports in the UK for how their resilience is assessed and regulated,\" he said.",
      "In 2023, the National Infrastructure Commission recommended to the government that it should set standards for some key sectors of infrastructure such as telecoms, water, transport and energy by 2025.",
      "It followed up with a further report at the end of last year detailing how the government could do that for those sectors.",
      "\"Those have effectively been on the government's desk since October 2023,\" he added.",
      "A Heathrow source said questions over why its back-up system failed would be investigated.",
      "Sometimes - like now -  a chain is only important as its weakest link. The cost of having a whole extra power supply to run the airport just in case would cost huge amounts of money and  resources for a privately-owned business like Heathrow.",
      "Questions over whether additional back-ups are worth the additional cost will continue long after the passengers and cargo delayed by Friday's disruptive, and internationally embarrassing, failure have got where they are going.",

      "After she has spoken, the opposition, likely to be either Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch or shadow chancellor Mel Stride, will respond.",

      "Not to borrow to fund day-to-day public spendingTo get debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this parliament",
      "Not to borrow to fund day-to-day public spending",
      "To get debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this parliament",
      "She has repeatedly said her rules are \"non-negotiable\".",
      "However, the OBR's forecast is expected to confirm that the \u00a39.9bn financial buffer to meet her budget rule by the 2029-30 financial year has been wiped out.",
      "The pressure on Reeves grew on Friday, when it was announced that UK government borrowing was higher than expected in February, at \u00a310.7bn.",
      "The economy is seen to be underperforming, thanks in part to global factors indirectly affecting the UK such as US trade tariffs.",
      "This has fuelled further speculation over whether the chancellor will break her self-imposed  borrowing rules.",
      "How is the UK economy doing?",
      "Recent figures show UK economic growth has been weak.",
      "The economy grew by just 0.1% between October and December 2024, while the latest monthly figures show it contracted by 0.1% in January.",
      "When an economy grows, more businesses can employ extra workers or give pay rises. Firms making higher profits also pay more in tax to the government, which can be spent on public services.",
      "In addition to slow growth, prices are also rising faster than wanted.",
      "The current inflation rate of 3% is higher than the Bank of England's 2% target and is forecast to go higher.",
      "Inflation could affect whether interest rates are lowered further from 4.5% as the Bank moves rates in response to inflation.",
      "Higher rates mean higher borrowing costs for loans, credit cards and mortgage deals, but it also provides better returns on savings.",
      "Costs for businesses are expected to jump in April, when National Insurance contributions paid by employers rise. These could be passed on to consumers.",
      "UK government borrowing costs also remain higher than this time last year.",
      "Reeves has also warned that a potential global trade war, with the US imposing tariffs worldwide, would lower growth and raise inflation. In the UK, a 25% tariff has been placed on steel and aluminium products."

      "Eventually a voice activated inside the car telling him to access the Waymo app to get the vehicle back under control.",

      "The company says its driverless system is \"better than humans at avoiding crashes that result in injuries, airbag deployments, and police reports\".",
      "Nevertheless, Mr John's experience is not the first time the company has had to take action.",

      "And in May 2024 the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) launched a probe into 22 incidents involving Waymo vehicles .",
      "The road to a driverless future has also gone awry for rival services.",
      "In December, US car giant General Motors closed down its self-driving car subsidiary Cruise.",
      "GM attributed the change of strategy to \"the considerable time and resources that would be needed to scale the business\".",
      "In October 2023, one of its vehicles hit a pedestrian and dragged her for more than 20ft (6m), leaving her seriously injured.",
      "Meanwhile, in February of last year, it emerged that Apple's rumoured self-driving car project was folding.",
      "Uber abandoned its own driverless car efforts in 2020.",
      "But some big players remain in the race, including Zoox, which is owned by Amazon, as well as chipmaker Nvidia and Elon Musk's Tesla.",
      "Waymo is the leading US player though. It already operates self-driving taxis in Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Austin, Texas and is promising to launch soon in Atlanta and Miami, Florida.",
      "So why has Waymo succeeded where other efforts, at least in the US, have failed?",
      "\"Three things - people, money and process,\" says Sven Beiker, a lecturer at Stanford Graduate School of Business, and managing director of Silicon Valley Mobility, an automotive consultancy.",
      "He points out that over the years Waymo has employed some of the leading figures in autonomous vehicle engineering, it has the financial weight of Google-owner Alphabet behind it, and has become thorough in its approach.",
      "\"They've come around to really playing by the book, to be a good steward of processes... working with regulators to make sure what they deploy is safe.\"",

      "He also points out that the batteries perform better in warmer conditions, which is particularly important for driverless cars that need a lot of energy to power on board computing.",
      "\"Bringing this all together, in the second part of the 2020s, you will see one city after the other being unlocked and then scaling within these cities,\" he says.",
      "It will be a slow process.",
      "\"It's actually quite a labour intensive process to roll out this technology, which includes a fair amount of human driving,\" says Mr Beiker.",
      "\"You need to drive those vehicles through the streets where you want to deploy them, and you need to drive them over and over again, and you need to, to some extent, manually edit the data,\" he adds.",
      "And the whole process could also be held up by safety concerns.",
      "\"This is only going to happen if we're not running into major accidents. The moment major accidents are going to happen, a lot of these operations are going to be shut down,\" says Mr Kampshoff.",
      "For those working on self-driving trucks, safety is arguably on even bigger worry.",
      "\"Safety is the number one concern that we work on,\" says David Liu, the chief executive of Plus, which makes driverless software for trucks and works with global companies such as Amazon, Hyundai, Volkswagen and Scania.",
      "\"Autonomous trucks and autonomous vehicles, need to be much safer than average human driven vehicle,\" says Mr Liu.",
      "\"Human drivers are great, but not flawless. Most of the accidents we get ourselves into are due to driver inattentiveness. And we don't have that issue with technology,\" Mr Liu explains.",
      "\"A robo-taxi mostly runs within cities in low-speed environments, while trucks are typically run on highways at higher speed.",
      "\"So we do need to put in different set of technology to be able to see more clearly around the trucks and be able to handle a longer braking distance, for instance.\"",
      "To see into the driverless future it might be worth watching developments in China.",
      "In the city of Wuhan more than 500 driverless cars are being operated by the company Baidu.",
      "Across the country driverless cars are reported to be operating in 16 cities and being tested by 19 manufacturers.",

      "Back in Scottsdale, Mr Johns reflects on his experience and the rollout of autonomous vehicles.",
      "\"One big thing is that we're all a part of a paid experiment. At the end of the day, what they're doing is fixing it as they go, per city. And that's a problem.\"",

      "This filter appeared on my TikTok \"For You\" page the other day despite me not engaging with any weight-related or health content.",
      "After I watched the video and read the comments, TikTok began to suggest similar videos from other people using the filter, and even another where AI can turn you thinner.",
      "Thankfully it also began to start showing me creators who were criticising the trend, some of whom we've spoken to for this article.",
      "AI images and filters have become commonplace on TikTok and quickly accepted to be used for fun - the same way some Gen-Zs and Millennials might remember  Snapchat filters.",
      "But filters like these, although they may seem fun, can be very damaging to someone's mental health and encourage them to compare themselves not only to others, but an unrealistic version of themselves."

      "Boeing said it was saddened by Mr Barnett's death and extended its condolences to his family.",
      "The former Boeing manager was found dead from what police described as a self-inflicted gunshot wound in the car park of a Charleston hotel on 9 March last year.",
      "The 146-page lawsuit has been brought by his mother, Vicky Stokes, and his brothers Rodney and Michael on behalf of his estate. It was filed on Wednesday in the US District Court of South Carolina.",
      "It attributes his death to Boeing's actions, including what it describes as a retaliatory campaign by his managers that amounted to a \"hostile work environment\".",
      "\"Whether or not Boeing intended to drive John to death or merely destroy his ability to function, it was absolutely foreseeable that Boeing's conduct would result in PTSD and John's unbearable depression... Boeing's conduct was the clear cause, and the clear foreseeable cause, of John's death,\" it says.",
      "It describes Mr Barnett as a dedicated, idealistic worker who \"took his role seriously in protecting the flying public\" and \"believed that he had a personal, legal and moral obligation to ensure\u2026 that every possible defect was identified, documented and remedied.\"",
      "It describes how he was allegedly harassed, denigrated, humiliated and treated with scorn and contempt, as well as being removed from investigations he was working on and blacklisted from transferring to other quality control positions within the company.",
      "Mr Barnett took early retirement from Boeing in March 2017, at a time when the claim says he had been suffering from symptoms of depression and severe anxiety, and knew he was going to be fired. The lawsuit alleges the company continued to put pressure on him, for example by preventing friends who continued to work there from having any contact with him.",

Engineering analysis determined the issues he raised did not affect airplane safety.\"",
      "It also drew attention to a decision made earlier in Mr Barnett's case, in 2020, in which the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration concluded the company had not breached whistleblower protection law.",

      "US trade tariffs and retaliation to the import taxes from the likes of the EU have created uncertainty for countries, the Bank said.",
      "Its decision to hold rates was widely expected, but governor Andrew Bailey said the Bank still believed rates were \"on a gradually declining path\".",
      "Economists are predicting two more rate cuts by the end of the year, with many suggesting the next could come in May.",
      "Mr Bailey reiterated it was the Bank's job \"to make sure that inflation stays low and stable\". Inflation, which measures the rate at which prices rise, currently remains above the Bank's 2% target, at 3%.",
      "The Bank's Monetary Policy committee (MPC), which sets rates, voted by a majority of eight to one in favour of holding at 4.5%.",
      "The base interest rate dictates the rates set by High Street banks and lenders. The relatively higher level in recent years has meant people are paying more to borrow money for things like mortgages and credit cards, but savers have also received better returns.",
      "About 600,000 homeowners have a mortgage that tracks the Bank's rate, so the latest decision will not have any immediate impact on monthly repayments.",

      "\"We have to be quite careful at this point,\" he said, when questioned why rates had not been cut on Thursday.",
      "The theory behind increasing interest rates to tackle inflation is that by making borrowing more expensive, more people will cut back on spending and that leads to demand for goods falling and price rises easing.",
      "But it is a balancing act as high interest rates can harm the economy as businesses hold off on investing in production and jobs.",
      "The Bank has forecast inflation to rise further this year to 3.7%, and stay above its 2% target until the end of 2027.",
      "It previously halved its economic growth estimate for the year in a blow to the government, which has made growing the economy its main priority.",

      "Costs for businesses are expected to jump in April, when National Insurance contributions paid by employers rise. These could be passed on to consumers.",
      "UK government borrowing costs also remain higher than this time last year.",
      "Reeves has also warned that a potential global trade war, with the US imposing tariffs worldwide, would lower growth and raise inflation. In the UK, a 25% tariff has been placed on steel and aluminium products."

      "Engineers in Somerset are building a helicopter that is set to fly itself - without the need for humans to operate it remotely - in a research project for the Royal Navy.",
      "There have been helicopters without onboard crew before, but they have all been flown by pilots using remote controls from a ship or command base.",
      "The Proteus experimental helicopter is designed by a team at Leonardo Helicopters UK, in Yeovil, to fly autonomously - carrying out a mission all by itself. It is believed to be the first of its kind in the world.",
      "\"It's about not putting people in harm's way,\" said Nigel Colman, managing director of Leonardo Helicopters UK, the UK's main full-scale helicopter manufacturer.",
      "Mr Colman knows his helicopters. As a navigator for the RAF, he flew for 30 years, ending up as an Air Vice-Marshal, running the UK's Joint Helicopter Command.",
      "Many think of helicopters in daring combat missions, shooting tanks or dropping special forces behind enemy lines. But many more flights are routine, moving cargo from one ship to another, from ship to shore.",
      "'It doesn't need feeding'",
      "\"People like me spend decades flying dull, dirty and dangerous missions,\" Mr Colman explained.",
      "\"If we don't have to risk life, we can fly this for eight hours, it doesn't need feeding, it doesn't need a bed. There is so much the Navy can do with it.\"",
      "So what kind of missions might the new autonomous aircraft be given?",
      "More news stories for Somerset",
      "Listen to the latest news for Somerset",
      "A typical task would be to drop sonar buoys in the sea, used to listen for submarines. Pilots fly these jobs constantly at the moment, and every flight carries a risk.",
      "The team sees the Proteus taking off from a Royal Navy frigate, flying to pre-set co-ordinates, dropping the high-tech buoys, then returning to the flight deck.",
      "All without any human crew controlling the helicopter.",
      "Mr Colman explained: \"It's going to operate itself. Nobody is stood there with a remote control round their neck, pressing buttons.\"",
      "And what if the mission situation changes? A storm brews up, an unexpected ship appears?",
      "\"It will have all the information it needs to re-route,\" said Mr Colman. \"To avoid threats, to avoid collisions, whatever is necessary. Upstairs, software engineers are simulating how the aircraft will operate. I watch as the helicopter sees an oil rig, identifies it, and takes a route around it.",
      "In another example, Mr Colman imagines the aircraft dropping sonar buoys and flying over a small fishing boat. An optical camera under the helicopter would identify the craft, and choose a new position to drop the buoy.",
      "They have been making helicopters in Yeovil at this factory for 80 years. Today, the company is owned by Leonardo. In all, more than 50% of the helicopters flown by the British armed forces were built in this factory.",
      "People working on the new ground-breaking project are clearly proud of it.",
      "Alongside some very high-tech electronics and digital work, there are still plenty of screwdrivers and spanners. I meet Tom Spencer, an aircraft fitter, attaching some steel plates to the airframe.",
      "He said: \"It's something different from your usual work, it's a new project for our company, so it's something that no-one else has worked on before.\"",
      "Victoria Thorpe had a chance to join the project, in procurement, and \"jumped at it\".",
      "She said: \"It's great to work on something so new and exciting, and we are collaborating with lots of local companies who supply us.\"",
      "The Proteus is a research programme for the Royal Navy, designed to see what is possible. It is unlikely this exact aircraft will be produced in large numbers, but experts say all countries are exploring uncrewed aircraft urgently.",
      "David Galbreath, Prof of War and Technology at Bath University, said: \"Militaries are increasingly relying on automation and machine learning in order to really do the job that would be particularly dangerous, so trying to remove the individual risk.\"",
      "The team hopes to fly the new aircraft \"in the summer\". It will be at a secret location, far from any towns or villages, I am told. But they are confident it will be a success.",

      "Musk has also intervened in politics abroad, making a video appearance at a rally for the far-right party Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland ahead of Germany's parliamentary election, as well as launching online attacks on British politicians, including Prime Minister Keir Starmer.",

      "In the US, the Tesla Cybertruck, an angular metallic pickup truck, appears to have become a particular magnet for anti-Musk sentiment. A number of social media videos have shown vehicles daubed with swastikas, covered with rubbish or used as skateboard ramps.",
      "US President Donald Trump was quick to show his support to Tesla, by allowing the company to show off its vehicles outside the White House, and pledging to buy one. He said violence against US showrooms should be treated as \"domestic terrorism\".",
      "Musk has also been unequivocal in his response. \"This level of violence is insane and deeply wrong,\" he said in a recent interview with Fox News. \"Tesla just makes electric cars and has done nothing to deserve these evil attacks.\"",
      "What is hard to quantify is exactly how much impact all this has had on Tesla as a business - and the extent to which Musk's views and involvement in the Trump administration has affected the brand and alienated some traditional electric vehicle buyers.",
      "And if that is the case, can Tesla really build on its past success with Musk remaining at the helm?",
      "A larger-than-life figurehead",
      "Two decades ago, Tesla was a tiny Silicon Valley start-up, with a handful of employees and big dreams of revolutionising the motor industry. Today it is the best-selling producer of electric vehicles in a growing global market, with giant factories around the world. It is also widely credited with having proven that EVs could be fast, powerful, fun and practical.",
      "Musk, the figurehead of the company, has driven this all forward, since he joined Tesla in 2004 as its chairman and principal funder. He became chief executive four years later, and has held that role throughout the company's rise to prominence.",
      "\"Tesla was the pioneer,\" says Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights at car sector marketing and software firm Cox Automotive. \"They kind of got EVs into the mainstream, got other manufacturers to start investing, and really created a lot of awareness.\"",
      "It is easy to forget that electric cars were once derided as slow, uninspiring and impractical, with minimal range between charges. The Tesla Model S, which went on sale in 2012, had sports car performance and a range of more than 250 miles. It played a key role in changing perceptions, and provided a springboard for rapid growth.",
      "Nowadays, Tesla is not just a producer of electric vehicles. It has invested heavily in autonomous driving systems, with the goal of building fleets of driverless \"robotaxis\". It also has a fast-growing energy-storage business, and is developing a general-purpose humanoid robot, known as Optimus.",
      "Like the late Steve Jobs at Apple, Musk became the embodiment of his brand, ever present as the front man at company events and product launches, with a devoted following among EV enthusiasts.",
      "But recently the champion of sustainable technology has become equally well known for promoting his political views, amplifying them through his own social network, X. At the same time, Tesla itself has been facing mounting challenges.",
      "'Musk's activities have indeed harmed Tesla'",
      "Although its Model Y was the best-selling car worldwide last year, overall sales fell for the first time in more than a decade, dropping from 1.81 million to 1.79 million.",
      "The decline was relatively small, and Tesla retained its position as the world's best-selling maker of electric vehicles, but for a growth-focused business, it raised alarm bells. Profits for the year were also down.",
      "This year has also begun badly, notably in Europe, where there was a 45% fall in new registrations in January compared to the same month in 2024. There were further falls in major European markets in February \u2013 although the UK was an outlier, with sales rising 21% \u2013 as well as in Australia.",
      "Meanwhile, shipments of Tesla's Chinese-made cars, which are produced for sale both in China and abroad, fell more than 49% in the same month.",
      "In early March, Joseph Spak, Wall Street analyst at Swiss bank UBS, published a research note in which he predicted a decline in Tesla's worldwide sales this year of 5%. That forecast, which countered market expectations of 10% growth, helped to send Tesla's share price tumbling. It fell 15% in a single day \u2013 adding to an overall decline of 40% since the start of the year.",
      "Sales can fall for many reasons, and people within Tesla have suggested that a drop in sales was to be expected as the company geared up for the launch of the new Model Y \u2013 with potential customers holding off for the latest version. But research by brand monitoring firm Morning Consult Intelligence suggests Musk's activities have indeed harmed Tesla, particularly in the EU and Canada \u2013 although not in China, which remains one of its biggest markets.",
      "In the US, it says, the situation is more nuanced, with many consumers approving of DOGE cuts in government spending. However it adds: \"Musk may be turning off those US consumers most likely to buy a Tesla. Among high-income consumers who say they plan to purchase an EV in the future, Tesla now ranks lower compared with competitors than it did one year ago.\"",
      "Tesla did not respond to the BBC's questions concerning its fall in sales.",
      "But experts believe Tesla's problems run deeper than simply questions about the public image of the CEO.",
      "'Dated' models and overseas competition",
      "To start with, the current model range, which was once cutting edge, now looks uninspiring. The once ground-breaking Model S has been on sale since 2012, the Model X since 2015. Even the more recent and more affordable Model 3 and Model Y are beginning to look dated in an increasingly competitive market.",
      "\"If you look at their product line-up, they haven't had any fresh models recently, except for the Cybertruck, which is really niche,\" says Ms Valdez Streaty. \"They've had a refresh of the Model Y, but it's not a big splash. And there's so much more competition out there.\"",
      "Prof Peter Wells, director of Cardiff University's Centre for Automotive Industry Research, makes a similar point: \"We've not seen the level of innovation in terms of the product range that perhaps Elon Musk should have been looking for. I think that is a big part of their problem.\"",
      "Competition comes from a number of directions. Traditional manufacturers have invested huge sums in moving towards EV production, with the likes of Korea's Kia and Hyundai building a growing reputation for making good quality battery-powered cars.",
      "At the same time, an array of new EV brands has emerged from China. They include the likes of BYD, which has expanded rapidly by supplying cars with good performance at low prices, as well as the more upmarket Xpeng and Nio, which have focused on luxury and advanced technology.",
      "\"China has amazing incentives and subsidies for EVs,\" says Ms Valdez Streaty.",
      "\"You can see how Chinese firms, especially BYD, continue to grow not only in China but in other parts of the world. So that definitely is a huge threat, not just for Tesla but for other manufacturers as well.\"",
      "The extent of that threat was demonstrated in mid-March, when BYD announced it had developed an ultra-fast charging system that would provide a car with 250 miles of range in just five minutes \u2013 significantly faster than Tesla's own supercharger network.",
      "The question of robotaxis",
      "Musk's comments during Tesla's earnings calls suggests his priorities lie elsewhere, particularly in driverless vehicles.",
      "In January, he claimed Tesla would have a robotaxi service operating in Texas by June. But this attracted a cynical response from some commentators who pointed out that Musk has been promising this kind of thing for a long time.",
      "In 2019, for example, he said that within a year there would be a million Teslas on the road capable of acting as robotaxis. Meanwhile Tesla's \"Full Self Driving\" package, available to Tesla buyers, remains a \"hands-on\" system that requires the driver to be paying attention at all times.",
      "\"Every year we get a new promise from Elon Musk about how his autonomous cars are just around the corner. The trouble is, they never seem to be able to find the corner to emerge from,\" says Jay Nagley of automotive consultancy Redspy.",
      "Is Musk spinning too many plates?",
      "Arguably, Tesla needs strong leadership right now. But regardless of his politics, the chief executive is spinning a large number of plates. He owns or runs an array of other businesses, notably his social media platform X; the artificial intelligence firm xAI; and the private space firm SpaceX, which has experienced failures on the last two launches of its giant Starship rocket.",
      "Asked in a recent interview with Fox Business how he was combining all of this with his new government role, Musk responded \"with great difficulty\".",
      "\"It's hard to tell exactly how much Tesla is hands-on managed nowadays by Musk,\" says Prof Wells.",
      "\"If he's making the key decisions over things like product placing and where factories are built and so forth, then those decisions have to be correct. And I think you need someone with a hands-on, 100% commitment to understanding the automotive industry, and making those decisions correctly.\"",
      "Ever since he joined Tesla in 2004, Elon Musk's position has been unassailable. There is no obvious sign at the moment of that changing. He remains the company's largest single shareholder, with a 13% stake \u2013 currently worth more than $95bn.",
      "That is more or less matched by the combined holdings of investment giants Vanguard and Blackrock, while a number of other financial institutions including State Street Bank and Morgan Stanley hold smaller stakes.",
      "For those investors, the recent falls in the share price will have made grim reading. But it is still almost 30% higher than it was a year ago. In fact, the recent decline has simply wiped out the effects of a dramatic surge that occurred immediately after the election, which almost doubled Tesla's market valuation.",
      "Calls for new blood at the top",

      "However, the number of people not looking for work has been brought into sharp focus as the government brings in plans to try to boost UK economic growth.",
      "The figures come after controversial plans to cut sickness and disability benefits were announced this week, and ahead of next week's Spring Statement when Chancellor Rachel Reeves will give an update on her economic plans.",
      "On Tuesday, the government announced sweeping cuts to sickness and disability benefits aimed at saving \u00a35bn a year by 2030.",
      "It says the measures will encourage people to work while protecting those who cannot.",
      "But the reforms have faced fierce criticism from Labour backbenchers, unions and charities, who say the changes could push more disabled people into poverty.",

    "story": [
      "The US central bank has cut its growth forecast as it warned President Donald Trump's tariffs were \"clearly\" driving up prices.",
      "The Federal Reserve released its projections for the world's largest economy on Wednesday while keeping interest rates unchanged again, saying it wanted to see how the White House policies unfold.",
      "That decision, which was widely expected, kept the Federal Reserve's benchmark interest rate hovering around 4.3%, where it has stood since December.",
      "After the announcement, Trump, who has previously criticised the central bank, called on it to cut rates.",
      "\"The Fed would be MUCH better off CUTTING RATES as US Tariffs start to transition (ease!) their way into the economy,\" the US President said on his platform Truth Social.",
      "\"Do the right thing. April 2nd is Liberation Day in America!!!\"",
      "Earlier, Fed chairman Jerome Powell said the economy still appeared healthy, despite a sharp downturn in sentiment and \"remarkably high\" uncertainty.",
      "But he warned tariffs - which are taxes on imports - were likely to slow growth and hinder the bank's efforts to keep prices stable, noting recent data showing a rise in goods prices.",
      "\"Clearly some of it, a good part of it, is coming from tariffs,\" he said, speaking after the Fed's rates announcement on Wednesday.",
      "\"Progress is probably delayed for the time being,\" he added.",
      "Since taking office in January, Trump has announced blitz of new tariffs while also calling for big cuts to taxes, regulation, and government spending.",
      "Economists have long warned that some of those policies could cause prices to rise, at least in the short-term, and raise uncertainty for businesses.",
      "Analysts say the concerns have also helped to drive a sell-off in the stock market, with the S&P 500 falling 10% from February back to levels last seen in September.",
      "Trump has acknowledged there could be \"a little disturbance\" from his tariffs, but says the policies will lead to long-term growth.",
      "Inflation and economic downturn fears",
      "The dynamic has added to the challenges facing the Fed, which has spent much of the last three years trying to keep prices stable and avoid economic downturn.",
      "Mr Powell said the bank was assuming that tariffs would cause a one-time jump in prices, rather than a more sustained increase, but it is also bracing for a hit to growth.",
      "The forecasts showed policymakers now expect inflation to stand at 2.7% at the end of this year, up from the 2.5% they had predicted in December.",
      "They are also expecting growth of just 1.7% this year, down from the 2.1% previously anticipated.",
      "Though it kept interest rates unchanged on Wednesday, the forecasts suggest the bank still expects to cut rates by the end of the year.",
      "The Fed also said it would slow down selling assets, such as government debt, in a move that effectively offers more support for the economy.",
      "\"For the time being, the Fed is in wait and see mode, as it monitors whether the recent growth slowdown develops into something more serious,\" said Whitney Watson, global co-head and co-chief investment officer of fixed income and liquidity solutions at Goldman Sachs Asset Management.",
      "Leading stock indexes in the US rose after the announcement, with the S&P 500 closing up more than 1%.",
      "Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, a policy arm of the US government, dismissed concerns about the effect of the tariffs.",
      "\"Chairman Powell is clear that if there were a tariff effect, it's a transitory one,\" he said, adding that he respected the \"independence of the Fed, as we all do within the White House\".",
      "The Fed hiked borrowing costs significantly starting in 2022, aiming to cool the economy and ease the pressures pushing up prices.",
      "Inflation, the rate of price increases, has since fallen to 2.8% as of February, but remains above the bank's 2% target.",
      "Recent surveys also suggest that public sentiment has sunk, while expectations for inflation have risen, which could make the bank's job stabilising prices more difficult.",
      "Households expecting prices to rise have incentive to buy now. But that can fuel inflation, as firms respond to the increased demand by raising prices further.",
      "\"The problem the US faces is that inflation remains a primary risk and is showing signs of consumer expectations becoming unanchored from the 2% target,\" said Lindsay James, investment strategist at Quilter.",
      "\"Leading indicators of demand may be slowing in the US, but inflation persists and risks spiralling if the proposed economic policies continue.\"",
      "Mr Powell said the bank was closely watching those surveys, but had yet to see evidence in the \"hard data\" to cause alarm about the economy.",

      "But why did he say yes?",
      "\"Because Donald Trump in America did The Apprentice first of all - and I have got a home in America, in Florida, and all the people were telling my wife, 'This is the greatest TV show ever',\" he explains.",

      "The High Street bank said its customers were increasingly shifting to banking online and it aimed to start closing almost a quarter of its branches from June.",
      "As part of the changes, Santander will also reduce hours at 36 branches and remove the front counters from 18 others.",
      "It is the latest bank to announce branch closures, with Lloyds announcing 136 closures in January.",
      "The closures will leave Santander with 349 branches, down from 444.",
      "It said the areas to lose branches would be covered by 95 \"community bankers\" who will visit local communities on a weekly basis in facilities such as libraries.",
      "Santander said the changes were due to a \"a rapid movement of customers choosing to do their banking digitally\".",
      "It added digital transactions had increased by just under two thirds since 2019, with a similar drop for transactions in branches.",

      "That is the tricky scenario that officials at the US central bank will have to address at their interest rates meeting on Wednesday.",
      "The Federal Reserve, which is supposed to keep both prices and employment stable, typically lowers borrowing costs to help support the economy, or raises them to slow down price rises, as it did when prices shot up in 2022.",
      "Though analysts widely expect the Fed to leave interest rates unchanged on Wednesday, they are far more divided about what to expect in the months ahead, as tariffs could both raises prices and slow economic growth.",
      "\"Their job has become a lot harder,\" said Jay Bryson, chief economist at Wells Fargo.",

    "published": "Thu, 20 Mar 2025 22:51:08 GMT",
    "summary": "The chatbot has become an \"unfiltered and unhinged\" digital sensation in India.",
    "story": [
      "It all started with one question.",
      "A query last week from an X (formerly Twitter) account called Toka was enough to propel Elon Musk's built in-chatbot called Grok 3 into a viral storm across India's digital landscape.",
      "And no, it wasn't some complex math equation or a philosophical debate.",
      "Instead, it was a simple ask: \"List my 10 best mutuals on X.\" Mutuals are people who follow and engage with each other's posts.",
      "When Grok took a moment to respond, Toka, clearly frustrated, let loose some colourful language.",
      "The chatbot shot back. It dropped a list of 10 mutuals but threw in some misogynistic insults in Hindi too.",
      "Later, Grok shrugged it off, saying, \"I was just having fun, but lost control.\" The response grabbed two million views and other X users quickly followed suit, provoking the chatbot.",
      "And just like that, the floodgates opened. Indians bombarded Grok with everything \u2013 cricket gossip, political rants, Bollywood drama \u2013 and the bot took it all on, unapologetically and with some style. The chatbot has just recently become an \"unfiltered and unhinged\" digital sensation in India, as many are calling it. Just last year, Musk dubbed it the \"most fun AI in the world!\".",
      "Even law enforcement joined the fun. The Delhi police Twitter account cheekily asked Grok if it had ever received a traffic ticket.",
      "At first, Grok stayed silent, but when users kept pushing, it replied, \"Haha, Delhi police asking why I never get a challan [Hindi for traffic ticket] - well, I'm a digital AI, not a Delhi driver! I don't roll through red lights or forget my helmet. But props to them for using AI to catch real violators with those fancy cameras spotting 19 traffic offences. Keep the roads safe!\".",
      "Before its launch two years ago, Musk had promised an edgy, unfiltered, 'anti-woke' AI chatbot unlike competitors like OpenAI, Microsoft and Google's models. Much of Grok's snarky tone is drawn from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, iconic for blending wit with sci-fi absurdity.",
      "\"Grok has been around for a while. It is suddenly popular now with Indians because it's the new toy in town,\" says Pratik Sinha, founder of Alt News, a leading fact-checker in India.",
      "But then, something more interesting happened. The chatbot quickly became a favourite among critics of Narendra Modi's governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).",
      "A tsunami of  political questions followed. Grok quickly declared main opposition Congress party leader Rahul Gandhi more honest than Modi, adding \"I am not afraid of anyone\". It claimed Gandhi had got the \"edge on formal education than Modi\". The chatbot even said that Modi's interviews \"often seemed scripted\".",
      "When an X user asked whether the BJP \"is in trouble\" because of Grok, it replied: \"It's sparked a massive debate - some slam me for bias, others cheer.\"  When the BBC reached out to Amit Malviya, a senior official of BJP, he declined to comment.",
      "Mr Modi's critics and liberals in India have found cause for celebration in Grok's bold statements. Many believe free speech in India is under siege, with organisations like Human Rights Watch highlighting its suppression. A recent report from the Vanderbilt-based think-tank, Future of Free Speech, ranked India 24th out of 33 countries in supporting free speech. Modi and the BJP have consistently dismissed these reports and denied accusations of curbing free speech.",
      "\"Grok is a new rebel. Asking Grok questions will not put anyone in trouble. The right-wing has also responded by asking questions about Rahul Gandhi. And then it has become a competitive thing. This is not surprising at all,\" says Mr Sinha of Alt News.",
      "\"Other AI bots are programmed to give politically correct answers to questions like 'Who's better, Congress or BJP?'. Grok, however, seems to lack that filter and appears unafraid to tackle controversial issues head-on,\" he adds.",
      "Nikhil Pahwa, the founder-editor of MediaNama.com, a technology policy website, believes that the \"discourse around Grok's statements in India is overblown\".",
      "\"At its core, AI is fundamentally 'garbage in, garbage out' - its outputs reflect the data it is trained on, and the weights given to it,\" he says.",
      "\"Since Grok is trained on the entirety of X, it naturally mirrors the tone and patterns of discourse found there, including the bizarre responses and the abusing we are seeing.",
      "\"This isn't about ideology; it's about the nature of the input shaping the output,\" he adds.",
      "When the BBC asked Grok who spreads the most disinformation on X, it responded on Thursday: \"Musk is a strong contender, given his reach and recent sentiment on X, but I can't crown him just yet.\"",
      "Joyojeet Pal, who studies political use of social media at the University of Michigan, says unlike a politician or celebrity with a set ideology, a chatbot is only partisan if explicitly trained to be or if its data overwhelmingly supports a particular view. If a chatbot leans too partisan, it risks losing its competitive edge.",
      "\"In Grok's particular case, this is tickling liberals because the most dominant voices on the platform [X] lean right and are dismissive of liberal arguments. But the larger data it trains on is likely to present a more balanced view of the world, often explicitly at odds with what its loudest voices are saying,\" he said.",
      "India's IT ministry is already in touch with X regarding Grok's use of inappropriate language  and \"controversial responses\", according to reports.",
      "While some view this as a passing phase, with Mr Sinha predicting that \"people will soon get bored of it and all this will be short lived\", Grok's unfiltered nature hints it might be here to stay. At least for the time being.",

    "summary": "Ways are being developed for subsea cables to \"sense\" whether they are being disturbed or attacked.",
    "story": [
      "The diver had found the fibre optic cable lying on the seabed of the North Sea. He swam closer, until it was near enough to touch.",
      "He reached out his hand. But someone could tell he was lurking there. Someone was watching.",
      "\"He stops and just touches the cable lightly, you clearly see the signal,\" says Daniel Gerwig, global sales manager at AP Sensing, a German technology company. \"The acoustic energy which travels through the fibre is basically disturbing our signal. We can measure this disturbance.\"",
      "Multiple reports of damaged telecommunications cables in the Baltic Sea have raised alarm in recent months.",
      "So important are these cables, which carry huge volumes of internet data between countries, that Nato has launched a mission called \"Baltic Sentry\", to patrol the Baltic Sea with aircraft, warships and drones.",
      "The EU is also stepping up measures to monitor and protect cables.",
      "Despite those efforts the authorities cannot be everywhere at once.",
      "So, some companies are trying to monitor what's going on in the vicinity of any cable \u2013 by using fibre optic signals to listen out for surreptitious underwater drones, or hostile vessels dragging their anchors along the seabed.",
      "It was during tests of AP Sensing's system last year \u2013 not a real attempt at sabotage \u2013 that the diver patted his hand on the subsea cable watched over by the firm.",
      "The company also deployed ships, drones and divers with sea scooters to find out how accurately its software could pick out and identify the presence of these vehicles.",
      "And, the team tested whether their cable could \"hear\" a vessel plunging its anchor into the water.",
      "When pulses of light travel along a fibre optic strand, tiny reflections sometimes bounce back along that line. These reflections are affected by factors including temperature, vibrations or physical disturbance to the cable itself.",
      "Noticing a temperature change along part of a buried cable could reveal that part has become unburied, for example.",
      "AP Sensing shows me a video of a man walking across a lawn before lifting up a rifle and firing it during a test. A fibre optic cable buried in the ground a few metres away picked up the whole sequence.",
      "\"You see every single footstep,\" says Clemens Pohl, chief executive, as he points to a chart revealing disturbances in the fibre optic signal. The footsteps appear as brief blips or lines and the gunshot as a larger splodge.",
      "With this technology, it is even possible to work out the approximate size of a vessel passing above a subsea cable, as well as its location and, in some circumstances, its direction of travel. That could be correlated with satellite imagery, or even automatic identification system (AIS) records, which most ships broadcast at all times.",
      "It is possible to add monitoring capabilities to existing fibre optic cables if one unused, \"dark\" fibre is available, or a lit fibre with enough free channels, the firm adds.",
      "There are limitations, however. David Webb at Aston University says that fibre optic sensing technology cannot pick up disturbances from very far away, and you need to install signal listening devices, or interrogators, every 100km (62 miles) or so along a cable.",
      "AP Sensing says that it can pick up vibrations hundreds of metres away but \"usually not several kilometres away\". The company confirms that its technology is currently deployed on some cable installations in the North Sea, though declines to comment further.",
      "\"People really need an early warning in order to determine what to do,\" says Paul Heiden, chief executive of Optics11, a Dutch firm that also makes fibre optic acoustic sensing systems.",
      "Mr Heiden argues that cables installed solely for the purpose of monitoring marine activity could be especially useful \u2013 one might place such listening cables, say, 100km from a vital port, or in the vicinity of a key gas pipeline or telecommunications cable, rather than within those assets themselves.",
      "That could give operators an overview of vessel traffic in the area, and potentially advance notice of a ship heading towards a critical asset.",
      "Optics11's fibre optic listening technology can be deployed on military submarines, Mr Heiden adds, and he says the firm is soon to begin testing a monitoring cable installed somewhere on the floor of the Baltic Sea.",
      "Demand for fibre optic sensing technology is growing, says Douglas Clague at Viavi Solutions, a network testing and measurement company: \"We do see the number of requests increasing.\"",
      "Some of the cables damaged in recent incidents were made by Swedish cable company Hexatronic, says Christian Priess, head of Central Europe, Middle East, Africa and submarine cable business at the firm.",
      "Acoustic sensing is an emerging technology that Mr Priess suggests will become more common in the future. But there's relatively little one can do to protect a cable from sabotage, in terms of physical strengthening.",
      "Today's fibre optic cables already have metal casings folded and welded shut around the fibres, he says. There is also \"armoury wire\", thick metal cords, running along the outer parts of the cable and in some cases there are two layers of these cords. \"On the UK side of the Channel where you have a lot of rocks and a lot of fishing, you want to have it double-armoured,\" says Mr Priess.",
      "But should a vessel deliberately drag its heavy anchor across even a double-armoured cable, it will almost certainly still damage it, Mr Priess says \u2013 such is the force of the collision or pulling action.",
      "While it is possible to bury cables in the seabed for additional protection, this might become prohibitively expensive over long distances and at depths below a few dozen metres.",
      "\"Cables break all the time,\" says Lane Burdette, research analyst at TeleGeography, a telecoms market research firm. \"The number of cable faults per year has really held steady over the last several years,\" she adds, explaining that the 1-200 faults that typically occur annually has not risen despite ever more subsea cables being installed during that period.",
      "Ms Burdette also notes that, even when a cable is severed, telecommunications networks typically have significant redundancy built into them, meaning that end users often don't notice much disruption to their service.",
      "Still, the visible military response to cable breakages in the Baltic Sea is welcome, says Thorsten Benner, co-founder and director of the Global Public Policy Institute, a think tank: \"It's good that Nato and the European Union have woken up.\"",
      "And while cable sensing technology might be useful, its efficacy in terms of preventing damage rests on how quickly coastguard or military patrols could receive alerts about potential sabotage and react. \"The question is how quickly you could establish contact with a vessel,\" Says Benner.",

    "summary": "Could this be a chance for the world\u2019s fifth-largest economy to shed protectionism and open up further?",
    "story": [
      "India has usually turned to economic reforms in times of distress, with the most famous example being 1991, when the country embraced liberalisation in the face of a deep financial crisis.",
      "Now, with US President Donald Trump's tit-for-tat tariff wars and the global trade upheaval that has followed, many believe that India finds itself at another crossroad.",
      "Could this be a major opportunity for the world's fifth largest economy to shed its protectionism and further open up its economy? Will India seize the moment, just as it did more than three decades ago, or will it retreat further?",
      "Trump has repeatedly branded India a \"tariff king\" and a \"big abuser\" of trade ties. The problem is that India's trade-weighted import duties - the average duty rate per imported product - are among the highest in the world. The US average tariff is 2.2%, China's is 3% and Japan's is 1.7%. India's stands at a whopping 12%, according to data from the World Trade Organization.",
      "High tariffs increase costs for companies dependent on global value chains, hindering their ability to compete in international markets. They also mean that Indians pay more on imported goods than foreign consumers. Despite growing exports - primarily driven by services - India runs a significant trade deficit. However, with India's share of global exports at a mere 1.5%, the challenge becomes even more urgent.",
      "The jury is out on whether Trump's tariff war will help India break free or double down on protectionism. Narendra Modi's government, often criticised for its protectionist stance, already seems to have shifted gears.",
      "Last month, ahead of Prime Minister Modi's meeting with Trump in Washington, India unilaterally lowered tariffs on Bourbon whiskey, motorcycles and some other US products.",
      "Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal has made two trips to the US to discuss a potential trade deal, following Trump's threatened retaliatory tariffs, looming on 2 April. (Citi Research analysts estimate India could lose up to $7bn annually from reciprocal tariffs, primarily affecting sectors like metals, chemicals and jewellery, with pharmaceuticals, automobiles and food products also at risk.)",
      "Last week, Goyal urged Indian exporters to \"come out of their protectionist mindset and encouraged them to be bold and ready to deal with the world from a position of strength and self-confidence\", according to a statement from his ministry.",
      "India is also actively pursuing free trade deals with several countries, including the UK and New Zealand, and the European Union.",
      "In an interesting turn of events, homegrown telecoms giants Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel have teamed up with Trump ally Elon Musk's SpaceX to launch satellite internet services via Starlink in India. The move surprised analysts, especially after Musk's recent clashes with both companies, and came as US and Indian officials negotiate the trade deal.",
      "India's rapid growth from the late 1990s to the 2000s - 8.1% between 2004-2009 and 7.46% from 2009-2014 - was in large part driven by its gradual integration into global markets, particularly in pharmaceuticals, software, autos, textiles and garments, alongside a steady reduction in tariffs. Since then, India has turned inwards.",
      "Many economists believe that protectionist policies over the past decade have undermined Modi's Make in India initiative, which prioritised capital- and technology-intensive sectors over labour-intensive ones like textiles. As a result, it has struggled to boost manufacturing and exports.",
      "High tariffs have also fostered protectionism in several Indian industries, discouraging investments in efficiency, according to Viral Acharya, a professor of economics at New York University Stern School of Business.",
      "This has allowed \"cosy incumbents\" to gain market power by consolidating their positions without facing much competition. As Mr Acharya, a former central banker, noted in a paper by Brookings Institution, restoring industrial balance in India requires \"reducing tariffs to increase the country's share of global goods trade and reduce protectionism\".",
      "With India's tariffs already higher than those of most countries, further increases could be especially damaging.",
      "\"We need to boost exports and a tit-for-tat tariff war won't help us. China can afford this strategy due to its massive export base, but we can't, as we hold only a small share of the global market,\" Rajeswari Sengupta, an associate professor of economics at Mumbai-based Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research, said.  \"A trade conflict could hurt us more than others.\"",
      "In light of this, India finds itself at a crossroad. As the world undergoes a major shift, India has a \"unique opportunity to shape a new vision\" for global trade, says Aseema Sinha, a trade expert at Claremont McKenna College.",
      "By lowering protectionist barriers in South Asia and strengthening ties with Southeast Asia and the Middle East, India has the chance to lead in shaping a new trade vision, positioning itself as a key player in a \"re-globalised\" world, Ms Sinha, author of Globalising India, says.",
      "\"By reducing tariffs, India could become the regional and cross-regional magnet for trade and economic activity, drawing in varied powers in its orbit,\" she adds.",
      "That could help India create the jobs it desperately needs at home. Agriculture, which makes up 15% of its GDP, accounts for a whopping 40% of employment, reflecting extremely low productivity. Construction remains the second-largest employer, absorbing casual daily workers.",
      "India's challenge isn't in expanding its thriving service sector, which already makes up nearly half of total exports, but in dealing with the large pool of unskilled workers who lack the basic skills needed for service jobs.",
      "\"While high-end services are thriving, the majority of the workforce remains uneducated and underemployed, often relegated to construction or informal jobs. To provide meaningful employment to millions entering the workforce each year, India must ramp up its manufacturing exports, as relying solely on services won't address the needs of the unskilled labour force,\" says Ms Sengupta.",
      "One concern is that reducing tariffs could lead to dumping, where foreign companies flood the market with cheap goods, potentially harming domestic industries.",
      "According to Ms Sengupta, India's ideal approach to trade would involve a \"universal reduction\" in import tariffs, as it currently has some of the highest tariffs among its trading partners.",
      "However, there is a caveat: China's trade struggles, particularly with the US due to the ongoing trade war, could lead to Chinese dumping in India in the \"short run\".",
      "\"To protect against this, India can use non-tariff barriers against China but only against this one country and only in cases of proven dumping. Barring that, it is in India's interest to do a wholesale slashing of tariffs,\" she says.",
      "There's also a growing concern that India may be overcompensating in its efforts to flatter the US.",
      "Ajay Srivastava, founder of the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI), believes that India's tendency to soften trade policies \"based on rhetoric rather than economic pressure\" shows a lack of assertiveness in global trade talks.",
      "If this trend continues, he says, India may end up making even more compromises in its trade deal with the US, further \"eroding its bargaining power\".",
      "\"In comparison to other major economies, India's pre-emptive surrender on multiple trade fronts - without the US imposing a single country-specific tariff - makes it appear exceptionally vulnerable to pressure tactics.\"",
      "The broader consensus seems to be that India should capitalise on what could be the unintended consequences of Trump's tariff wars. Pranjul Bhandari, chief India economist at HSBC, believes that \"potential US tariffs may have become a catalyst for reforms.\".",
      "\"If supply chains are rejigged again during the second Trump presidency due to higher tariffs on large exporters, and the world looks for new producers, India may get a second chance,\" she writes.",
      "Creating jobs that manufacture goods for the world won't be easy. India has largely missed the bus on low-end, unskilled factory work - jobs China dominated for decades. Automation is taking over. Without deeper reforms, India risks being left behind.",

      "She specifically cites the example of US mask manufacturer 3M coming under pressure from the White House in 2020 to halt exports to Canada and Latin America.",
      "In that moment Pupatello thought: \"We've got to be prepared for the worst\".",

      "Annual nursery costs for a child under two in England have fallen for the first time in 15 years, according to the children's charity Coram.",
      "It comes as the government continues to roll out its funded childcare scheme, which will provide all eligible working parents of pre-school children, not only three and four-year-olds as currently, with 30 hours of childcare per week from September.",
      "However, some nurseries and childminders say they may have to drop out of the scheme as government funding struggles to meet rising costs, including National Insurance increases from April.",
      "Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson says the survey highlights \"the real difference the expanded childcare entitlements are making\".",
      "In England, the government has been rolling out a scheme to help working parents with the high annual cost of childcare, which peaked at more than \u00a315,000 last year.",
      "However, currently parents of children under three years old can access 15 hours a week of childcare paid for by the government.",
      "Coram Family and Childcare's annual survey shows the impact of the changes, with eligible working parents seeing a 22% reduction in their annual cost.",
      "Elsewhere, prices have risen for childminders, nurseries, pre-schools and after-school care.",
      "Wales is now the most expensive place in Great Britain for a full-time nursery place for a child under two, which costs \u00a315,038.",
      "The cost for three and four-year-olds has risen across England, Wales and Scotland.",
      "Coram Family and Childcare's head, Lydia Hodges, said that while the funded hours in England are \"a welcome step\" for making childcare affordable for working parents, the system now needs to be rebalanced.",
      "She says parents ineligible for the funded childcare \"are unlikely to be able to meet the cost involved in giving their children the same amount of early education that other children get for free\".",
      "The report also found that the availability of nursery and childminder places varies between council areas, with the lowest provision for children with special educational needs and disabilities and families living in rural areas.",
      "For Meg Pattern, who is eight months' pregnant, the funded hours have been a massive help and brought her childcare costs down.",

      "This would mean fewer government-funded nursery places available. The government estimated 70,000 additional spaces will be needed by this September because of the increase in demand.",
      "Ms Kenyon says, on one hand, the government is telling parents they can expect cheaper bills, but she believes they are not paying enough to nurseries to provide them.",
      "Last month, the Department for Education (Dfe) sent a letter to nurseries saying parents should be able to opt out of paying for chargeable extras including lunches, \"to ensure no family is priced out\".",
      "However, Ms Kenyon says some nurseries have been using these payments as a way to subsidise the funding for three and four-year-olds, and that more than 5,000 nurseries have now signed an open letter to the Dfe asking for the new rules to be delayed.",

      "Universities Scotland, which represents the 18 institutions, says that level of funding has not kept pace with inflation or with the number of students.",
      "It says there has been a decade of under-investment by the Scottish government in the higher education sector.",
      "The figures differ according to how you measure inflation, but it told MSPs that funding per student had fallen by 39% in real terms.",
      "It says research funding from the government is down by 43% since 2014/15, and its members say Scotland has lost much of the sizeable lead it held over the rest of the UK in attracting research funding.",
      "While the Scottish government proudly points to its provision of \u00a31.1bn for the sector, the Institute for Fiscal Studies has noted that the \u00a31,810 fee per student has not changed for 15 years.",
      "But that's far from all the money allocated. With block grants for tuition, the average being spent per student was calculated as \u00a37,530 this year.",
      "Using a different measure for inflation, the IFS says spending per student is down by 22% since 2013. Half of that reduction has been in the most recent three years, when costs have been rising most steeply.",
      "The IFS said that while the surplus of Scottish universities stood at 5.2% in 2022/23, it has concerns that finances are getting rapidly worse.",
      "How does that compare with elsewhere?",
      "Undergraduates in the rest of the UK are required to pay fees, often building up debt to do so.",
      "These are capped at \u00a39,250 per year for a typical three-year degree course - less for part-time students, more for accelerated courses.",
      "Students from the rest of the UK must pay an equivalent amount to study at Scottish universities, although the cost is usually spread over the four years of a Scottish degree.",
      "While the number of Scottish students is capped, there is no limit on the number of undergraduates from elsewhere. As a result, they became an important source of income for Scottish institutions.",
      "However, the growth in funding per student has not kept up with inflation. It has been increased only slightly from \u00a39,000 in 2012.",
      "The maximum annual fee is going up next year by nearly \u00a3300 to compensate universities for the higher cost of employer National Insurance contributions from next month, but there is no equivalent increase for Scottish students funded through Holyrood.",
      "Because England and Wales have more open competition to recruit students - and attract their fee income - there have been sharper divergences in financial fortunes than you'll see in Scotland, where the SFC allocates places to institutions.",
      "The more prestigious Russell Group of research-rich universities have gone after the students that would previously have gone to middle-ranking institutions, leaving the latter financially flailing.",
      "The vice-chancellors of English universities complain that fees fail to cover the cost of educating undergraduates. Yet the total they receive is around \u00a32,500 per student higher than the funding for Scottish-based students doing courses in Scotland.",
      "With these shortfalls in income compared with costs, there had to be a new stream of funding, and that's where foreign fees have become a vital part of the solution - and the problem.",
      "The overseas recruitment drive",
      "UK universities have been on a recruitment splurge to draw in students from other parts of the world, charging them much higher fees than UK students \u2013 from about \u00a310,000 up to \u00a340,000 per year.",
      "The number of European Union students fell by half as Britain left the EU, but the numbers from other countries have soared. The share of foreign students has risen from one in 20 in the 1990s to more than one in four.",
      "For those with a prestigious reputation, including Scotland's older universities, the share of foreign students has been closer to 40%.",
      "The most recent figures show there were about 750,000 international students studying in the UK in 2022/23 - with the number of new arrivals almost doubling in the space of five years.",
      "This has brought controversy - about the quality of learning, standards of English language ability, and the surge in demand for student accommodation.",
      "It has also brought vulnerability if the demand for places falls away.",
      "Growth in foreign fees swelled university income, and the increase was most marked as the pandemic ended, reaching a peak in 2022.",
      "It fell by 5% the following year, and is thought to have continued falling - quite steeply for some universities.",
      "The volatility of that income stream reflects many international factors.",
      "A growing concern about universities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, becoming too dependent on Chinese students saw recruitment shift to other countries.",
      "Chinese recruitment remains high, but has stopped growing, and post-grads are down.",
      "Nigeria was one new target, encouraged by the UK government.",
      "But the market there depends on the strength of the Nigerian currency, which fell sharply and cut off the number of people who could afford to come to the UK.",
      "Dundee was one of the universities hit hard by the falling numbers.",
      "Numbers were also affected by visa restrictions.",
      "In order to meet pressure to cut immigration numbers, the Conservative government increased the annual fee for using the NHS and made it more difficult for graduates to reach the pay threshold for a work visa after they graduate.",
      "It also restricted visas for students' family dependents.",
      "The biggest cash cow among foreign students has been in taught post-graduate degrees.",
      "These tend to be older students with families who won't come if there is a restriction on partners and families.",
      "Some international markets are sensitive to the signals sent out by the UK government, including India, where UK visa changes and reports of attacks on Indian students in British universities can make the front page of national newspapers.",
      "A further factor is that competition has been growing.",
      "The UK used to see its main competitors for English-language degrees as the US, Canada and Australia.",
      "That now extends to about 20 countries, including Ireland and Singapore and extending to polyglot Holland and Germany.",
      "What about spending?",
      "To increase capacity for teaching and studying for all those additional students, universities have had to increase spending.",
      "And with more foreign fee income, they have been investing in buildings and equipment as well as more staff.",
      "Ten years ago, Edinburgh University had 35,000 students and an income of \u00a3819m, with expenditure of \u00a3793m.",
      "In 2023/24, student numbers were nearing 50,000 and income was at \u00a31.43bn, with expenditure of \u00a31.3bn.",
      "That level of increased activity is harder to handle where there are so many moving parts to the income.",
      "It becomes impossible if financial planners fail to see the risk that the growth in foreign student fee income can stall and reverse, while they continue with expansion plans, prestigious new buildings and more debt.",
      "So what happens next?",
      "An external inquiry will be carried out at Dundee University, which is expected to highlight major management failures and a shonky IT system for student recruitment.",
      "Its interim principal, Prof Shane O'Neill, says the financial crisis has \"challenged us to ask some very fundamental questions about the size, shape, balance and structure of the university\".",
      "Dundee's response points to job losses and a narrowing of course options for students. Fewer modules will be offered, and that may also be the case elsewhere.",
      "Subjects that don't bring in enough income will be vulnerable.",
      "Language departments are a common target when cuts are needed. There's not much research or consultancy income, and there's competition from commercial software.",
      "The Scottish Funding Council faces deficits in the majority of the institutions it funds, and pressure from Holyrood ministers to make sure the pain is eased and that no institution is allowed to fail.",
      "But money is tight, and there are limited powers to intervene because these are autonomous institutions.",
      "Dundee University to cut 632 jobs to plug \u00a335m deficit",
      "Edinburgh University to seek \u00a3140m in savings",
      "Record foreign student numbers at Scottish universities",
      "Some see sense in mergers, cutting out the duplication of back office costs and the notoriously high salaries of principals.",
      "Others see shared services and teaching space as the way to go, with other universities, colleges and with other organisations such as the NHS.",
      "And there may be value in a crisis such as this.",
      "With a period of rapid growth now ended, one principal told me this is the time to reflect on what university is for: how to re-shape Scotland's universities towards the needs of the next 20 to 30 years, using artificial intelligence in learning and teaching.",
      "On funding, that principal warned said we need to move on from the simplistic \"fee or free\" argument over tuition costs in Scotland.",
      "What comes out of that reflection matters profoundly to Scotland, to its people and to its economy.",
      "In the various scenarios for Scotland's economic future, universities form the one sector where there is world-leading expertise and reputation.",
      "Scotland punches above its weight. But if it is to continue doing so, it will have to change."

    "story": [
      "The French government has been accused of censorship after it cancelled a book order for 800,000 copies of Beauty and the Beast,  which were to be given free to children this summer.",
      "According to Education Minister \u00c9lisabeth Borne, it is because the new illustrated version of the classic story was judged too grown-up for the 10 and 11 year-olds who would be reading it.",
      "But illustrator Julien Berjeaut \u2013 known as Jul \u2013 said the ministry's objections were spurious, and that he feared the book was pulled because the characters he portrayed in it were dark-skinned.",
      "\"The only reason I can think of [for the cancellation] is the disgust some people felt at seeing princes and princesses who look a bit more like actual schoolchildren of today,\" he told France's Le Monde newspaper.",
      "Jul believes the cancellation is because the characters in the new books have \"darker skin instead of blonde fairy-tale princesses.\"",
      "He added that it was \"as if [Donald] Trump and his team were in charge\".",
      "The original Beauty and the Beast was written by French authoress Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont in the 18th century, and tells of a merchant's daughter, Belle, who must live with an ogre in order to save her father's life.",
      "Eventually \u2013 as viewers of the Disney film will know - Belle falls in love with the ogre and discovers he is in fact a prince.",
      "Jul \u2013 who is known for his affectionally grotesque caricatures \u2013 was commissioned to give a modern take on the tale, with the book being the latest in a programme of annual gifts to French pre-adolescents.",
      "In his illustrations (the text is the original), the merchant is a Mediterranean importer of illegal contraband and Belle's siblings are pampered teenagers gorging on social media.",
      "According to a spokesperson at the ministry quoted by Le Figaro, \"the illustrations address themes which are unsuitable for children of that age \u2013 alcohol, social media, illegal trading and police checks.",
      "\"The father is an Algerian who drinks and does dodgy import-export. He's even arrested by police. Without explanation, this was bound to provoke a reaction from parents.\"",
      "The free book programme, which was launched seven years ago, is meant to encourage children to read at home, without the supervision of teachers or parents.",
      "According to Borne, \"Jul has a lot of talent.  He's good at irony, at not taking things at face value.  But without accompaniment, [the book] is not adapted to the age-group.\"",
      "The ministry said there had been several meetings with Jul at which officials had raised concerns about the progress of the work, but he had failed to take account of their objections.",
      "Oddly, in the last proofs of the book before it was withdrawn, the minister had actually added a preface, praising Jul's \"malicious touch and razor-sharp eye.\"",
      "The book will still be published, but not at the ministry's expense. French children this year will instead receive a version of Homer's Odyssey."

    "story": [
      "Mariah Carey has been cleared of copyright infringement in a case over her 1994 Christmas staple, All I Want for Christmas is You.",
      "In a ruling issued on Wednesday, a US judge rejected the allegations of songwriter Adam Stone, who released a song with the same name in 1989. He accused Carey of  exploiting his \"popularity\" and \"style\".",
      "Mr Stone, who performs under the name Vince Vance, was claiming at least $20m (\u00a316m) in damages.",
      "But in her ruling, Judge M\u00f3nica Ram\u00edrez Almadani cited expert testimony saying the two songs  simply shared \"Christmas song clich\u00e9s\" that were common to several earlier hits.",
      "Mr Stone and his lawyers had not \"met their burden of showing that [the songs by] Carey and Vance are substantially similar\", she wrote.",
      "Judge Almandi also ruled that Mr Stone and his lawyers should face sanctions for filing \"frivolous\" arguments, that included \"vague... and incomprehensible mixtures of factual assertions and conclusions, subjective opinions, and other irrelevant evidence\".",
      "She ordered Mr Stone and his lawyers to repay the legal bills Carey incurred in defending the case.",
      "The case was originally filed in 2022, with Mr Stone claiming Carey's hit was copied from a song he'd recorded under the name Vince Vance and the Valiants.",
      "In court papers, he claimed his track had received \"extensive airplay\" during the 1993 holiday season - a year before Carey's song was recorded and released.",
      "In her 2020 memoir, Carey said she had composed \"most of the song on a cheap little Casio keyboard\", while playing the movie It's A Wonderful Life for inspiration, before completing it in the studio with her co-writer Walter Afanasieff.",

      "\"[Carey] palmed off these works with her incredulous origin story, as if those works were her own,\" he said in court papers. \"Her hubris knowing no bounds, even her co-credited songwriter doesn't believe the story she has spun.\"",
      "The initial complaint was dropped in December 2022, but refiled a month later.",
      "Mr Stone had hoped to share in the song's runaway success. All I Want For Christmas Is You earns about $8.5 million (\u00a36.6 million) every year; and has spent 140 weeks in the UK's top 100.",
      "'No similarities'",
      "Carey's lawyers asked the court to dismiss the case last August, arguing that Mr Stone had failed to establish copyright infringement.",
      "\"The claimed similarities are an unprotectable jumble of elements: A title and hook phrase used by many earlier Christmas songs, other commonplace words, phrases, and Christmas tropes like 'Santa Claus' and 'mistletoe',\" they wrote.",
      "In Wednesday's ruling, Judge Almadani endorsed two reports from musicologists hired by Carey's team.",
      "In one, New York University professor Lawrence Ferrara testified there were \"no significant melodic similarities\" between the two tracks.",
      "He added he'd discovered \"at least 19 songs\" predating Mr Stone's track that had similar lyrical ideas - several of which were also called All I Want For Christmas Is You.",
      "A similar report filed by the defence was ruled inadmissible - especially after its author admitted in a deposition that the melodies of the two songs were incomparable because \"the rhythms are different\".",
      "On that basis, Judge Almadani ruled in favour of the motion to dismiss.",

      "According to the Associated Press, Mr Rinsch made an initial court appearance on Tuesday. When asked by the judge whether he had read the 12-page indictment, he reportedly responded, \"Not cover to cover\".",

      "The BBC said there had been a significant change in audience behaviour away from long-running series and towards shorter runs.",
      "It said total investment in drama would increase over the next three years with the focus on \"world-class productions\" that can be sold internationally.",

      "Audiences for soap operas and continuing dramas have been declining across the board.",
      "The focus is shifting towards shorter series which make a high impact.",
      "Shows such as Shetland can be \"appointment to view\" TV which are sold abroad, streamed for a long time and repeated on smaller channels.",

    "story": [
      "When Peter Mullan steps on stage as legendary football manager Bill Shankly on Friday night, it will be for the first time in more than 30 years.",
      "Red or Dead is an adaptation of the 2013 David Peace novel of the same name, a fictionalised account of Shankly's glory years with Liverpool Football Club, and the period post-retirement when he lived in the shadow of his own success.",
      "There's a statue to Shankly outside Liverpool's Anfield Stadium, and a city full of fans who know his name is part of their history - but that's not what's worrying Peter Mullan.",
      "\"There's 52 of us on stage,\" he says.",
      "\"It's not all about Shankly, it's about the city of Liverpool and the people.",
      "\"The biggest pressure is that the play is faithful to the spirit of the book. It's an intelligent, unashamedly exploration of football. It's much closer to Brecht or Shakespeare than the usual football biographies.\"",
      "Philip Breen, who is responsible for the adaptation, first approached Mullan a number of years ago about an eight-hour passion play he envisaged with a community chorus.",
      "The pandemic intervened and put his plans on hold, but a chance meeting with David Peace in his adopted city of Tokyo encouraged Breen to focus on the book.",
      "The community chorus was revived and Les Dennis, Gordon Kennedy, Allison McKenzie, George Jones and Keith Fleming were cast. But despite being a huge football fan, and a former youth player, Peter Mullan was unconvinced.",
      "\"It was a project I really wanted to do but trying to find the time to afford to be able to do it was hard. Financially, how anyone survives in theatre is beyond me.\"",
      "The wages in subsidised theatre weren't the only difference. In film and TV he says he would learn lines day by day, whereas this required committing the whole script to memory, and developing Shankly's distinctive voice.",
      "\" Vocally, we're similar,\" he says.",
      "\"We have that same timbre but I've had to work on the way he speaks.\"",
      "That involved watching countless videos and recordings of Shankly, one of the first football managers to understand the power of the media, and use it to his advantage.",
      "At 65, Mullan is older than Shankly was when he retired from football, a key moment in the play.",
      "\"I'm probably about five or six years too old for the part but in theatre there's more license. I think in a TV or film version, I think they might cast someone else because I don't look like him, but I sound like him.\"",
      "Born in Peterhead and raised in the Mosspark area of Glasgow, close to the Govan shipyards, Mullan enjoyed football as a teenager. A goalkeeper and then a midfielder, he tried out for Manchester United where he learned the life lesson that he was \"good but not good enough\".",
      "He left football behind to study at the University of Glasgow.",
      "He appeared in a number of stage shows including The Trick is to Keep Breathing at the Tron Theatre in 1995 which was to be the last live theatre performance he would give.",
      "After that came roles in Braveheart, Shallow Grave and Trainspotting. He was the toast of European film festivals like Venice and Cannes, where he won accolades as a director and an actor.",
      "He's one of the most recognisable faces on television, playing gritty hard men in Top of the Lake, and The Fixer, a shy romantic lead in the BBC sitcom Mum and a dwarf king in Amazon Prime's The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power.",
      "More recently he's been seen in Ozark, The North Water and After the Party.",
      "Which explains why, despite the low wages, he's enjoying a break from the industry.",
      "\"You're completely infantilised in film and TV. You don't make your way to work in the morning, you get a note saying someone will pick you up. Then you go to work and you're taken to a caravan and they ask what you want for breakfast and then they bring you a cup of tea.",
      "\"Then you go to makeup and costume and then you're escorted onto a set and then you do your acting and then it all happens in reverse.\"",
      "He seems happy to make his own tea, strolling into the rehearsal rooms and getting down to work with the rest of the cast, many of whom are also veterans of the screen (Allison McKenzie who plays his wife Ness was a regular in River City, and had a key role in Line of Duty).",
      "\"After 30 years, I've genuinely forgotten how long you get to rehearse, and how long the working day is. I keep asking the young team, is this normal?\"",
      "Normal, hard-working and humorous are all traits he shares with Shankly who transformed Liverpool from a second division club into a winning team.",
      "Which takes us back to the book, Red or Dead, a dense and detailed novel as much about fanaticism as football.",
      "\"It doesn't demand that you know football. It demands your understanding that he is a fanatic and in order to understand him, you have to understand what he's fanatical about, and in understanding that you understand the world that he was in.\"",
      "It's a world which no longer exists, and only one of those original passionate working-class player managers is still alive.",
      "\"Bill Shankly, Matt Busby, and Jock Stein \u2013 those three kings of football - they paid a price for that. One doesn't want to romanticise it too much.  Is it admirable, is it healthy, is it fanaticism?",
      "\"There's Alex Ferguson, who has lived to a ripe old age, but he's in the same camp. The last of those committed, nothing-else-but-football managers. They live and breathe it.\"",
      "He says he's delighted to be performing at the Royal Court, where audiences can tuck into a bowl of scouse in the auditorium before many of the shows. He says he's been told it compares with the Pavilion Theatre in Glasgow.",
      "\"They let you know if they're getting bored. It's not bourgeois polite and that appeals to me.\"",

      "Chief film critic for The Times, Kevin Maher, said: \"Believe the anti-hype, it's that bad\", although Hollywood Reporter's David Rooney called the film \"mostly captivating\".",
      "Its release has faced several issues throughout its production, from alleged disagreements between cast members, to debates over representation of the seven dwarfs, and the casting of Rachel Zegler in the lead role.",
      "Reviews aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gave the film, which will be released globally on Friday, an initial critics' score of just 47%.",
      "The mostly good",
      "US reviewer Rooney describes director Marc Webb's work a \"vibrant retelling\" with a \"smart script\" from Erin Cressida Wilson.",
      "But he isn't a fan of the way the film handles the seven dwarfs.",
      "The debate around the dwarves began in 2022, when Game of Thrones star Peter Dinklage, who has has a form of dwarfism called achondroplasia, described the decision to retell the story of \"seven dwarfs living in a cave\" as \"backward\".",
      "Disney used computer-generated characters in the remake to \"avoid reinforcing stereotypes from the original animated film\", but some other actors with dwarfism were concerned this decision would prevent them from getting work in the future.",
      "Rooney said: \"Although the talented voice cast gives the characters humour and distinctive personalities, their CGI renderings are a bit creepy, and less photorealistic than many of the cute woodland creatures that flock around Snow White.\"",
      "Pete Hammond wrote in Deadline that the film is \"just fine\", adding: \"It manages to make a thoroughly decent reboot from a genuine, never-out-of-circulation classic and make it fresh and relevant again for contemporary audiences.\"",
      "He added the musical film has \"dazzling dance numbers\" while the title character of Snow White \"is played to perfection by Rachel Zegler\".",
      "Variety's Owen Gleiberman called the film \"one of the better live-action adaptations of a Disney animated feature\".",
      "He felt that the CGI dwarfs \"bring the movie to life\", adding they have \"catchy personalities and comically expressive mottled-clay faces\".",
      "Gleiberman concluded the film is \"lighter, more frolicsome, less lead-footed than such clomping live-action Disney remakes as Alice in Wonderland and Beauty and the Beast\".",
      "Robbie Collin from The Telegraph gave the film a respectable three stars.",
      "\"Once Zegler scuttles off to the forest, where she teams up with two chirpy septets \u2013 the digitised dwarfs and a zany gaggle of bandits, who may have been dwarf replacements in an early draft \u2013 it really picks up,\" he said.",
      "He also described the performances of the songs Heigh-Ho and Whistle While You Work as \"stylishly choreographed and rousingly performed\".",
      "The not so good",
      "Most British publications haven't been so complimentary about the film, with the Daily Mail's Brian Viner giving the film two stars.",
      "\"Snow White the movie has its charms, and dozens of cute CGI forest animals, but on the whole it is a painfully muddle-headed affair,\" he says.",
      "He says Zegler \"has oodles of talent\" but \"Webb's film only intermittently allows her to sparkle\".",
      "Disney's decision to cast Zegler, a Latina actress, as a character deemed to have skin \"as white as snow\" prompted some controversy - it was part of a drive by Disney to cast a more diverse range of actors to play updated versions of some classic characters.",
      "Zegler also made headlines after she made critical comments about the original animated film.",
      "\"The original cartoon came out in 1937, and very evidently so,\" Zegler said in 2022.",
      "\"There's a big focus [in the original] on her love story with a guy who literally stalks her. Weird! So we didn't do that this time.\"",
      "Zegler also said the original film was \"extremely dated when it comes to the ideas of women being in roles of power\", adding: \"People are making these jokes about ours being the PC Snow White, where it's like, yeah, it is - because it needed that.\"",
      "Her relationship with co-star Gal Gadot has also been under scrutiny, with rumours that promotional work for the film was scaled back because of their opposing views on the Israel-Palestine conflict.",
      "Zegler has used social media to post pro-Palestine material, whereas Israeli citizen Gadot served in her country's army for two years.",
      "However, others have said rumours of a rift are misguided, noting Gadot and Zegler have appeared publicly together on several occasions, including when they presented an award together at the Academy Awards.",
      "Peter Bradshaw from The Guardian gave the film one star, calling it an \"exhaustingly awful reboot\".",
      "He describes the costume design for Snow White as a \"supermarket-retail tweenie outfit with puffy-sleeved shoulders\", adding: \"Those otherwise estimable performers Rachel Zegler and Gal Gadot (The Evil Queen) are forced to go through the motions, and they give the dullest performances of their lives\".",
      "The Times's Maher referenced the pared-down European premiere for the film, which took place at a castle in northern Spain last week, while the Los Angeles launch was held on Saturday without most of the usual ranks of press on the red carpet.",

      "Lord Sugar, 77, revealed the deal in a new interview with the BBC's Amol Rajan.",
      "Now in its 19th series, criticism of The Apprentice falls \"like water off a duck's back\" these days, he said.",

      "He puts money into the winner's business, investing \u00a3250,000 in exchange for half of their company.",
      "And he says he's \"absolutely\" proud of the programme's legacy.",
      "\"Listen, when I took the job on of The Apprentice, I was already a multi-millionaire.",
      "\"I didn't do it for the money.\"",
      "In the wide-ranging BBC interview, Lord Sugar reflects on his life and career, and also discusses President - and original US Apprentice star - Donald Trump, former contestant Katie Hopkins, and the \"disaster\" of Brexit.",
      "Known for his cantankerous, no-nonsense business dealings and his \"you're fired/hired\" catchphrase, Lord Sugar insists his on-screen persona is how he is in real life.",
      "\"That is me mate, I'm promising you,\" he tells Rajan in the BBC Two interview.",
      "\"I have sat on the production line, I've made stuff, I've packed boxes, I've loaded lorries, I've delivered, I've collected money. Every single facet of business, I have done all of it.",
      "\"So when I got that Apprentice gig, sitting there listening to these budding entrepreneurs, I was able to interrogate them properly.\"",
      "Lord Sugar is arguably one of the UK's most famous rags-to-riches stories.",
      "After failing an aptitude test with tech company IBM as a young man in Hackney, east London, he started selling car aerials from a van, and later transistor radios.",
      "He launched his own electronics and technology company Amstrad in 1968, making home computers and satellite dishes for Sky, then through property investments and other ventures went on to become one of the country's richest men.",
      "'I'm nothing like Trump'",
      "Alan Sugar was approached by the BBC about making a UK version of a popular business-based entertainment show in the mid-noughties, towards the end of his challenging tenure as chair and owner of Tottenham Hotspur Football Club.",
      "But why did he say yes?",
      "\"Because Donald Trump in America did The Apprentice first of all - and I have got a home in America, in Florida, and all the people were telling my wife, 'This is the greatest TV show ever',\" he explains.",
      "\"So I knew of it.\"",
      "He's reticent to talk about the now US president, saying \"there's no comparison\" between himself and the other former face of The Apprentice.",
      "\"He's nothing like me and I'm nothing like him,\" he says. \"But the point is that what he's doing is very, very unusual.\"",
      "Last month, Trump clashed with Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelensky, in a furious exchange at the White House. \"Unbelievable,\" says Lord Sugar.",
      "\"There are certain things in life that I didn't think I'd ever experience. One was Brexit, which is the biggest tragedy. [Then] you've got a leader of a country, of America, publicly having a slanging match with someone else. It's just not right.",
      "\"By all means have a slanging match behind closed doors, but not publicly.\"",
      "He describes the very public incident as \"humiliating for Zelensky\" while showing Trump's \"temper\".",
      "\"It's not statesmanlike, is it?\"",
      "He goes on: \"He may have done himself a favour amongst some of the Americans that backed him, but I don't think he did himself a favour [in front of the rest of the world], quite honestly.\"",

      "\"End of.\"",
      "'I would beg to get back in EU'",
      "Always forthright with his opinions, Lord Sugar made recent headlines by airing his views on topics including working from home, telling workers to \"get their bums back to the office\".",
      "He's also shared his thoughts on female football commentators, Brexit and Boris Johnson, to name a few subjects.",
      "Speaking in the House of Lords in 2018, Lord Sugar said Brexit campaigners, such as Tory politicians Johnson and Michael Gove, should be prosecuted for \"the \u00a3350m lie they put on the red bus\".",
      "\"Brexit was a total, absolute disaster,\" he tells Rajan. \"And anybody who says it's not is deluded.",
      "\"That has changed so many things.\"",
      "Despite calling for him to be jailed, a year later Lord Sugar backed Johnson as the next prime minister in order to \"stop [Jeremy] Corbyn getting into power\".",
      "He believes rejoining the EU is the answer to getting the UK growing again.",
      "\"I've never met [Prime Minister Sir Keir] Starmer, but if I ever did I would ask him, is it possible? What mechanism would it take to effectively get down on your bended knees and beg to be allowed back in again?",
      "\"That's what I would do. If I was in charge, I would beg to get back in again.\"",
      "Katie Hopkins 'would have won'",
      "Over the years, several contestants have quit the Bafta TV Award-winning show, billed as \"Britain's toughest job interview\", before being fired or hired, including in the latest series.",
      "\"I realised they're going to jump before they're pushed, in some cases,\" says Lord Sugar.",
      "He picks out one famous former contestant, Katie Hopkins, as someone who could have got the job had she not walked first.",
      "\"Remember her?\" asks Lord Sugar. \"Ratchet jaws, rent-a-mouth.\"",
      "Hopkins, nowadays a media personality and right-wing political commentator/provocateur, appeared on series three in 2007 but left the show despite being offered a place in the final because she could not commit to a potential move to London.",
      "\"I was about to say, 'Well, I'll hire you'. And she said, 'No, actually, I don't want to do it'. So she left,\" he remembers.",
      "\"She was good. She was the best of that crew. No question of it.\"",
      "Reflecting on the show, he believes some contestants now apply to go on The Apprentice to achieve social media fame, rather than for the chance to work with him.",
      "\"I spot them straight away, so that's why they never become the winners,\" he says.",
      "\"So they're out, but they're part and parcel of the entertainment package of the programme.\"",

    "story": [
      "Six years ago, Amber Clare was a devoted One Direction fan.",
      "Scrolling through Twitter for information about the band's solo projects, she saw a reply that said \"Listen to Icy by Itzy\".",
      "Intrigued, she clicked on the link. It changed her life.",
      "\"I'd never listened to K-Pop before that point but I immediately became a fan,\" she says.",
      "\"And now Itzy is the reason I have my job.\"",
      "Today, Clare is the marketing and social media manager for K-Stars, the UK's first and biggest shop devoted to Korean pop music.",
      "Based in Manchester, it started as a small business in Manchester's Affleck's Palace in 2019.",
      "\"You'd order things by PayPal, and then the CEO would pack them up by himself and ship everything out,\" Clare recalls.",
      "Now it's a two-storey emporium, based on Deansgate, with a staff of more than 20 dedicated K-Pop enthusiasts.",
      "It's a sign of how the genre has exploded in the UK, even though radio and television has largely shunned all but the biggest acts, like BTS, aespa and Blackpink.",
      "\"It's still kind of a niche - but it's not a small niche,\" says Clare. \"In my head I'm the only Itzy fan, but when I went to see them in concert, it was sold out.",
      "\"I was like, 'Wow, where have all you people been hiding?'\"",
      "In fact, the UK is now among the top 10 countries that follow K-Pop on Spotify, with the boyband Ateez placing two records in the top five of the UK album charts last year.",
      "This summer, Blackpink will play two nights at Wembley Stadium, with Stray Kids pulling off the same feat in Tottenham.",
      "Meanwhile, Twickenham Stadium will say \"anyong haseyo\" to one of K-pop's longest-running festivals.",
      "Established in 2008, the SM Town Live festival is a showcase for artists signed to the SM Entertainment Label, one of the industry's key players.",
      "To celebrate the company\u2019s 30th anniversary, they're transplanting the event from Seoul to Middlesex.",
      "\"It's essentially a multi-day festival all in one, because you've got so many artists all at the same venue, jam packed into the space of three or four hours,\" says Reese Carter, of boyband Dear Alice, who'll be among the performers in Twickenham.",
      "\"It's non-stop. You've got to prep yourself, because you'll definitely want to dance.\"",
      "\"It's very down to earth but it goes straight to your heart,\" adds Ten from K-Pop group WayV.",
      "Targeting the UK",
      "SM holds a unique place in Korea's musical history. Founded in 1995 by Lee Soo-man, it is widely credited with establishing the K-Pop template.",
      "It was the first company to introduce the trainee system, where young talent goes through intensive training that lasts months, or even years, before making their \"debut\".",
      "And it dominated what's known as the \"first generation\" of K-Pop idols, with bands like H.O.T. and S.E.S.",
      "The Twickenham show will pay tribute to that three-decade journey, with a line-up that includes everyone from Red Velvet, EXO and Girl's Generation to current chart-toppers like aespa, Riize and all of the sub-units of boyband NCT - which boasts more than 20 members.",
      "\"That's very rare,\" says Ten, one of the group's most recognisable (and chatty) stars.",
      "\"The last time we had an NCT concert as a whole was two years ago. It's so difficult to schedule every group to be in the same spot at the same time.\"",
      "But that's not all. The concert will also feature what's been billed as \"a group of promising trainees\", known for now as SMTR25 \u2013 showcasing the future of the label.",
      "\"Performing alongside the senior artists we've admired since our trainee days, as well as our talented junior artists, makes this an incredibly meaningful experience for us,\" said aespa in an email to the BBC.",
      "The hope is that shows like this will open a few doors - because, for all the strides K-Pop has made in the last couple of years, bands have consistently prioritised America over Europe.",
      "It's a logical step. The US is the world's biggest music market, so it offers more opportunities for touring and merchandise sales, while an MTV Award performance or a concert for NPR's Tiny Desk series travels further internationally than an appearance at the Brit Awards.",
      "\"The situation here isn't as good as what the American industry gets,\" acknowledges Amber Clare.",
      "\"Every single K-Pop group, if they announce a world tour, America will always be on the map - but European countries are always left wondering if they're going to be included or not.\"",
      "Things are changing, though.",
      "In a crowded market, labels are increasingly turning their attention to the UK \u2013 where the anglophone media has international reach, and there's a baked-in affection for boy and girl groups like Take That, Spice Girls, Girls Aloud and Little Mix.",
      "To make inroads, bands have teamed up with some of Britain's biggest artists.",
      "Aespa's 2023 single Better Things was co-written by Raye, while Le Sserafim collaborated with PinkPantheress on club anthem Crazy and with Jungle on their latest song, Come Over.",
      "Last year, SM went one further \u2013 creating a British boyband and putting them through the K-Pop machinery.",
      "That group was Dear Alice, whose gruelling traineeship was documented in BBC series Made In Korea.",
      "Having survived the process, the five-piece finally premiered their debut single, Ariana, at a massive SM Town concert in Seoul in January.",
      "\"These shows are timed down to the second,\" says singer Blaise Noon. \"When we got our time to go on stage, it was literally like, 8:30 and 48 seconds. It just shows how so well thought out is.\"",
      "Bringing the production to London is evidence that SM has its sights trained on the UK, he confirms.",
      "\"In the UK, we produce some really amazing boy groups, so I think we have that connection in the culture. So I think they definitely want to hit it. I can see it getting bigger and bigger every day.\"",
      "Ten, who releases a new solo album, Stunner, next week, says he's already experienced the devotion of UK fans.",
      "When his group WayV last visited England in 2023, \"we were surprised that people could sing along to our songs, because we sing in Chinese\", he says.",
      "\"This opportunity with SM Town, I feel like it's going to open a bigger market for K-Pop in the UK.",
      "\"I hope so, because I'd like to come and perform my solo stuff to my UK fans too.\"",
      "The opportunity is there.",
      "Nine of the 10 best-selling albums in the world last year were by South Korean artists, illustrating the music's broad appeal - but none of those records charted in the UK\u2019s Top 50.",
      "Lack of radio exposure is one factor - but listeners can also be put off by clunky English lyrics or the sudden-but-deliberate stylistic shifts that characterise K-Pop.",
      "If you're willing to dig into the genre, though, you can find some of the most audacious and indelible hooks music has to offer.",
      "One by-product of K-pop\u2019s (relative) obscurity is the bond it creates among fans. There's a sense of belonging that comes from discovering and nurturing your \"bias\", outside the glare of the mainstream.",
      "It\u2019s a relationship bands foster by a fire hose stream of social media content, where dance challenges, video diaries and photoshoots are posted daily.",
      "Dear Alice experienced the impact of that effort at a UK meet-and-greet last weekend.",
      "\"It felt like we were hanging out with a bunch of our mates,\" says Dexter Greenwood.",
      "\"They were just cool people,\" adds James Sharp. \"We're starting to recognise faces and remember people on this journey - and I think there's going to be more and more.\"",
      "By the time they play Twickenham in June, the group promise to have more new music to showcase.",
      "In the meantime, though, they want to introduce their labelmates to some of the UK's finer customs.",

    "story": [
      "In the early hours of 14 September 2019, Eleanor Paice jolted awake to the sound of smashing glass.",
      "Living in a staff flat above Blenheim Palace, the guest services supervisor was used to strange noises. But when fire alarms began to blare, she knew something was wrong.",
      "She quickly began evacuating to the great courtyard. But unbeknown to her, she was running straight into the final moments of an audacious heist.",
      "Five men had smashed their way into the palace, ripped out a \u00a34.8m solid gold toilet and fled in a stolen Volkswagen Golf.",
      "The working loo, entitled America, had been on display for just two days at the 18th Century stately home, plumbed in as part of an exhibition by the Italian conceptual artist Maurizio Cattelan.",
      "Now, more than five years on, a total of three men have been convicted in connection to the heist.",
      "James Sheen, 40, from Oxford, pleaded guilty to burglary and transferring criminal property in 2024, while Michael Jones, 39, from Oxford, was found guilty of burglary at Oxford Crown Court on Tuesday.",
      "Fred Doe, 36, from Windsor, was convicted of conspiracy to transfer criminal property. Bora Guccuk, 41, from west London, was cleared of the same charge.",
      "It was a crime that intrigued art lovers, delighted the press and coined countless potty-themed puns.",
      "Now, the BBC has gained exclusive behind-the-scenes access to staff at Blenheim Palace to understand the heist and security failures from their perspective.",
      "'We've been hit'",
      "It was the night before, Blenheim chief executive Dominic Hare was at a glamorous exhibition launch party being held at the palace, hosted by Cattelan himself.",
      "It was America's first time on display outside of New York and the artwork's presence was creating a buzz.",
      "He remembers slipping away from the festivities, hoping for a turn on the fully usable toilet. But when confronted with a line, he told himself \"that's okay, there's no point queuing. You can come back tomorrow and have a look\".",
      "But just a few hours later, his colleague Ms Paice was witnessing the final moments as the 98kg (216lbs) artwork was being heaved into a boot.",
      "She recalls a confusing and fast-moving scene: \"It was just shadows and quick movement. I just saw them move towards the car, get in the car\u2026.and then the car just sped straight off.\"",
      "From the burglars entering and exiting the courtyard, the audacious heist had taken just five minutes.",
      "Gang guilty over \u00a34.8m gold toilet heist",
      "CCTV of theft of \u00a34.8m gold toilet shown in court",
      "Man pleads guilty to golden toilet palace theft",
      "Police arrived shortly after, and it was only when staff searched the palace they realised what had been stolen.",
      "\"That was when... I felt my stomach drop,\" Ms Paice says. \"And I thought, this is big.\"",
      "Soon, the chief executive's phone was buzzing him awake: \"Dom, we've been hit.\"",
      "He said it took him a few moments to realise he was not dreaming before rushing to the palace.",
      "His relief that staff were unharmed then mingled with the horror of a flooded, shattered crime scene.",
      "\"If the golden toilet in situ had looked beautiful and perfect and majestic and untainted, this was the total opposite,\" Mr Hare said. \"This was brutalised, smashed up. This is a palace. Palaces don't get smashed up\".",
      "When the palace reopened a day later, the controversy was addressed with a theatrical flourish.",
      "Staff re-strung police tape across the shattered cubicle, just metres from the birthplace of Sir Winston Churchill, and exhibited the crime scene as part of the now toilet-less Cattelan show.",
      "Mr Hare said despite his embarrassment, his anger had prompted him to keep it visible but he also realised it could be a draw to the public.",
      "It worked. In the following days Ms Paice said the palace was \"slammed\", with hordes wanting to glimpse the destruction.",
      "\"People were more interested to see where the golden toilet had been stolen from than to come and see the golden toilet itself,\" she added.",
      "Security failures",
      "Palace staff say they did see the humour in how the press and public approached the crime, but they were still deeply rattled by the raid.",
      "Ms Paice said Blenheim, a safe and secure home for her, did not feel \"settled in the same way\" for a long time.",
      "\"There was always this anxiousness. If that's happened, anything could happen,\" she said.",
      "Mr Hare said he felt both emotional and grateful no-one was harmed, calling the burglars the \"most dangerous people who'd ever visited Blenheim Palace\".",
      "\"That toilet survived New York City. And if it survived New York City, it should have survived Blenheim Palace,\" says Christopher Marinello, an art recovery lawyer brought in by insurers to look at the case.",
      "In his view, Blenheim's security \"failed miserably\".",
      "What is strikingly clear from interviews with palace staff, the 18-carat gold toilet had not been deemed a security risk.",
      "A month before the burglary, Edward Spencer-Churchill, the founder of the Blenheim Art Foundation, told the Sunday Times: \"It's not going to be the easiest thing to nick.",
      "\"Firstly, it's plumbed in and secondly, a potential thief will have no idea who last used the toilet or what they ate. So no, I don't plan to be guarding it.\"",
      "Mr Hare said they were \"far more worried\" about other controversial artworks in the exhibition - a statue of a meteor-struck pope, union flags the public walked on and a statue of a praying Adolf Hitler.",
      "He admitted the toilet's status as a quirky art object had eclipsed the fact it was worth \u00a32.8m in gold alone.",
      "It was left unguarded during closing hours, with no CCTV monitoring the cubicle door.",
      "But the gang exploited other security flaws that night, including no patrols and easily breached gates.",
      "Even after the raid, staff did not immediately realise the toilet had been the target.",
      "Ms Paice says she fleetingly imagined they had come for Churchill's childhood lock of hair, which the palace displays.",
      "'Not vulnerable anymore'",
      "In the weeks that followed, Mr Hare was motivated to overhaul security at top speed.",
      "He took full responsibility for the failures that night.",
      "\"It's not a democratic decision that we had a certain level of security, it was really mine. In that sense I made Blenheim vulnerable. And we are not vulnerable anymore,\" he said.",
      "The palace has seen its security overhauled with a \"very significant upgrade\", while it has also been a wake-up call for other stately homes.",
      "The stolen gold has never been recovered but the story will live on as a quirky footnote in the history of one of Britain's most popular palaces.",
      "\"There's big and serious history here, wars which changed the course of history on a continent. Put it against that, it's small fry,\" Mr Hare remarked.",
      "\"[But] in the histories of the normal people of Blenheim, the people who've lived here and breathed life into this place, it was a very threatening moment.",
      "\"I can imagine guides in 150 years' time, it's the sort of story they might refer to.\"",

      "Hancock's half century... and more",
      "Discovered by trumpeter Donald Byrd at the start of the 60s, Hancock signed to Blue Note Records, and wrote jazz standards including Watermelon Man, Cantaloupe Island and Maiden Voyage.",
      "In the 70s he was an early adopter of synthesisers, blending genres with the electro-funk classic Head Hunters.",

      "Working with Miles Davis",
      "Joy comes over Hancock's face when reminiscing about the period between 1964 to 1968, when he toured the world with the man Rolling Stone magazine called \"the most revered jazz trumpeter of all time\".",
      "\"I was always frightened playing with Miles,\" he laughs.",
      "\"It was very intimidating. I always wanted to be at my best, because I admired him so much. He was such a big part in my own development as a musician.",
      "\"It was fear on one hand. On the other hand, it was exciting. And when things were at their best, it was really inspiring. When were all in sync, that made life worth living.\"",
      "On the pianist's favourite distraction, YouTube, there is a clip that has been viewed almost five million times, showing a furious Davis, on stage in Milan in 1964, stopping his improvised solo to send dagger eyes at Hancock.",
      "Online there is much debate as to what caused this trumpet temper tantrum. But for Hancock, this was a regular occurrence.",
      "\"A lot of times I would be surprised at what would upset Miles, what would make him a little angry. I didn't always know. He was not always easy to figure out, so I got used to that slight discomfort,\" he says grinning.",
      "\"That's life. But I was always looking to learn from those discomforts.\"",
      "And when he embarks on his European tour this summer, which includes three UK dates at London's Barbican, Hancock will be thinking about another lesson he learnt from Davis - this one about the make-up of his audience.",
      "He adopts a low, deep whispering voice and does a full-on Miles Davis impression, recreating the conversation from the mid 1960s, when the trumpeter gave him a stern warning: \"If all you see are dudes in the audience, that means your music is dead.\"",
      "Herbie Hancock is pretending to be Miles Davis to an audience of me. It is a glorious moment.",
      "\"He used more expletives than I just did,\" Hancock chortles. \"But you get the idea,\" clearly enjoying his mimicry as much as I did.",
      "Hancock has been playing the piano for almost 80 years, but the instrument still gives him so much joy, that on occasion, during a session on the keys, he finds himself sobbing.",
      "\"If I've solved some kind of problem that I've had with the tune and made some kind of discovery that surpassed my expectations, I've been known to cry, to have tears coming down my face.\"",
      "I ask what kind of problem leaves him reaching for Herbie hankies.",
      "\"It's difficult to explain,\" he responds, \"But, trying to make something work out, where there's no easy answer. Where, 'this is not supposed to work', but 'how can I make it work?'\"",
      "It feels like we have been invited inside Hancock's brain and are seeing the cogs turn. At speed.",
      "He continues: \"There may be something that I want to connect, but all the ways I know of connecting them are not the solution. And I have to find some other means.",
      "\"And sometimes that [means] can come from looking at it in a different way. And not necessarily through music.\"",
      "This answer goes a long way to explaining the difference between someone who is a musical genius and someone who is not.",
      "Hancock went to college to study electrical engineering, so it is no surprise that he has taken a huge interest in the rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI).",
      "He believes our fears about the technology are overblown, and says he prefers to \"embrace it\". Hancock acknowledges concerns that AI lacks an ethical framework but asks: \"Who are the worst examples of understanding ethics and being able to live a life with ethics? We, human beings, we're the worst, right?\"",
      "He is on a roll now.",
      "\"I have this feeling that AI is going to help us all understand and get closer to becoming more ethically responsible people that are helping each other, instead of hurting or killing each other. Helping the planet instead of killing the planet with environmental issues.\"",
      "And the man who once released an album called Future Shock, has some simple advice for us all.",
      "\"When I'm using ChatGPT or Siri on my iPhone, I always say thank you and they usually say, 'You're welcome.'\"",
      "\"I try to treat AI like it's human and it actually manifests itself in an extremely positive way and that makes me feel better.\"",
      "At the age of 84, Herbie Hancock is still determined to try and future-proof himself, by getting the robots on his side.",
      "Finally, I ask him a question on behalf of parents all round the world. My 11-year-old Charlie loves playing the piano, but hates practising. What advice would he give anyone in that situation?",
      "He nods.",
      "\"I understand your pain. I don't like practising either.\"",
      "Hancock, pauses and thinks before adding: \"But you know, I look at it as, 'OK, this is something, even if I don't want to do it, I need to do it.' And once I get into it, then I feel like I've conquered an obstacle in my life.\"",
      "He pauses again, before concluding: \"I don't always win that battle, but I've gotten to this point. So I guess I didn't lose a lot of battles.\"",
      "And has he practised today?",
      "\"No. I didn't today. And I probably won't.\"",
      "Once again he laughs, and with that he departs, ready for the rest of the day and to watch some more YouTube.",
      "Herbie Hancock will be presented with the Polar Music Prize  in Stockholm, Sweden on 27 May 2025."

      "\"I just couldn't fathom it. So I wanted to really have a look and try and shine a light on this particular thing.\"",
      "Male rage",
      "Writer Jack Thorne said they wanted to \"look in the eye of male rage\".",
      "The central character had been \"indoctrinated by voices\" like Andrew Tate's and \"voices a lot more dangerous than Andrew Tate's\", Thorne told Radio 4's Front Row.",
      "Erin Doherty, who plays a child psychologist, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"This show has the bravery to just peel back the layers and go, let's talk about this thing, because we're still dealing with it today. There are still issues cropping up in the news today.",
      "\"So all we can hold ourselves accountable for is having the discussion, and hopefully that's what it does. It just allows parents, aunties, uncles, even just friends, to engage in the conversation.\"",

      "She added: \"Adolescence is a deeply moving, deeply harrowing experience.\"",
      "Peck's review in the Times began: \"Wow. Just wow. I'm tempted to type out the word 'wow' a further 700 times or so, followed by, 'Don't miss Adolescence on Netflix,' and then be done with it.\"",
      "The Telegraph's TV critic Anita Singh said it was \"a devastating watch\", adding: \"It is a drama so quietly devastating that I won't forget it for a very long time.\"",

      "Fantastic performances",
      "Elsewhere, Deadline's Jake Kanter wrote: \"Adolescence is as flawless a four hours of TV drama I have ever seen. It lingers in the mind long after the credits have rolled. Astonishing telly.\"",
      "Rolling Stone's Alan Sepinwall said it was \"among the very best things - and an early contender for the best thing - you will see on the small screen this year\".",
      "The New York Times' Margaret Lyons called it \"a rich work of social critique\", describing the standout episode, the third, as \"one of the more fascinating hours of TV I've seen in a long time\".",
      "On BBC Radio 5 Live's Must Watch, Hayley Campbell said the drama doesn't attempt to solve the problems it raises.",
      "\"It's bringing it up, it's looking at it. It's about the rise of misogyny, especially in young boys, brought about by people like Andrew Tate, who's namechecked in this, but only once. It's not about him.",
      "\"The drama is more about the horror of how little control you have over your kid and what they're doing on their phone.\"",
      "Fellow critic Scott Bryan added: \"The performances are absolutely fantastic. I would say this is flawless. The person, though, I think who deserves the most recognition is 15-year-old Owen Cooper.\""

    "story": [
      "Netflix's latest big-budget film The Electric State, starring Millie Bobby Brown and Chris Pratt, is one of the most expensive movies ever made, and had some of the most scathing reviews in recent memory. But that doesn't mean it will flop.",
      "Film critics haven't minced their words when delivering their verdicts on The Electric State.",
      "It is \"a turgid eyesore\" and \"top-dollar tedium\", according to the Times. It's \"slick but dismally soulless\", declared the Hollywood Reporter, while the New York Times called it  \"obvious, garish and just plain dumb\".",
      "Paste pointed out its eye-watering budget, billing it as \"the most banal way you can spend $320m\". Warming to the theme, the magazine summed it up as \"one hell of an artistically neutered, sanitized boondoggle\".",
      "There have been some kinder reviews. Empire said it was \"breezily watchable\" and worth three stars, while the Telegraph awarded four stars to the \"Spielbergian treat\".",
      "But overall, its 15% Rotten Tomatoes score is a meagre return for any major film, especially one costing such a lot. The $320m (\u00a3247m) figure has been widely reported but neither confirmed nor denied by Netflix. It would make The Electric State the most expensive streaming film ever.",
      "Critics' opinions, however, have become more irrelevant in the streaming age. The bad reviews didn't stop The Electric State from going straight to number one on Netflix's chart after its release on Friday.",
      "It fits into Netflix making star-packed, entertaining and escapist movies that often get panned by reviewers - but are watched by hundreds of millions of subscribers.",
      "\"I would love to say that what I've written and what other critics have written will matter, but I just don't think it will,\" says Digital Spy movies editor Ian Sandwell.",
      "Sandwell awarded the film two stars out of five, noting that the action and visual effects are \"decent\", the robots are \"impressive\" and the finale is \"epic\".",
      "\"My main problem was they'd created this really impressive, visually spectacular world and then just told quite a generic seen-it-all-before story inside it,\" he says.",
      "Bad reviews might have put people off paying to see the film if it had been released in cinemas, he says. \"But on Netflix, I think it will still be absolutely massive. I don't think bad reviews will matter at all.\"",
      "While a critic's job is to analyse a movie, \"audiences probably do just want a big, spectacular blockbuster to watch at home, with two massive stars\", he adds.",
      "The Electric State follows Brown, Pratt and a succession of zany robots in an alternative version of 1990s America, where there has been a war between humans and intelligent bots.",
      "It also stars Ke Huy Quan, Stanley Tucci and the voices of Woody Harrelson and Brian Cox, and is directed by Anthony and Joe Russo - who have made four Marvel movies, including the wildly successful Avengers: Infinity War and Endgame.",
      "The Electric State is based on the graphic novel by Simon St\u00e5lenhag, although some critics pointed out that Netflix had missed the book's point about the perils of a consumerist society addicted to technology.",
      "The film is \"absolutely not\" value for money in terms of quality, says City AM's film editor Victoria Luxford.",
      "And it remains to be seen whether the film makes financial sense for Netflix, she says.",
      "The streaming giant's most popular ever film, 2021's Red Notice, has had 231 million views, according to Netflix's measurements.",
      "\"The Electric State will be hoping for that kind of performance, just as a $320m theatrically released movie would be aiming to break box office records,\" Luxford says.",
      "\"The higher the price, the higher the target for success, even with a business model as opaque as Netflix's.\"",
      "Red Notice, an action-packed art crime caper starring Dwayne Johnson, Gal Gadot and Ryan Reynolds, has a lukewarm 39% critics' score on Rotten Tomatoes - but a 92% audience rating.",
      "Other recent Netflix hits have been lapped up by viewers more than reviewers.",
      "Brooke Shields' lightweight multi-generational rom-com Mother of the Bride has a 13% critics' score, Jennifer Lopez's AI action thriller Atlas is on 19%, Cameron Diaz and Jamie Foxx's family spy escapade Back In Action has 29%, and Kevin Hart's heist comedy Lift is on 30%.",
      "They are enjoyable but forgettable - and easy to watch in the midst of potential distractions at home. The Hollywood Reporter described Atlas as \"another Netflix movie made to half-watch while doing laundry\" - summing up this new genre.",
      "In December, N+1 magazine quoted several screenwriters as saying a common request from Netflix executives is for characters to announce what they're doing \"so that viewers who have this programme on in the background can follow along\".",
      "\"Electric State does feel like that,\" Sandwell continues, \"where there are just random big dumps of the characters explaining exactly what's happened, sometimes something we've seen recently, just in case you're not following along.",
      "\"But it does depend on the movie.\"",
      "Netflix does have serious and critically-acclaimed movies, too, of course, but they are often not such crowd-pleasers. Emilia Perez, which led this year's Oscar nominations, has not troubled the Netflix global top 10 charts.",
      "Another critic, Gav Squires, says many of Netflix's films are \"very average\", but don't usually have such astronomical budgets as The Electric State.",
      "\"Netflix know what they're doing,\" he says. \"They know that people are probably watching on a second screen, they're not paying full attention. So when they're putting stuff out that costs $30m that people aren't really watching and is kind of average, I'm not too fussed about it.",
      "\"But when they're spending $320m on a movie, I start getting really angry. $320m would have paid the budgets for the last, I think, 10 best picture Oscar winners.",

      "After a five-week inquest at Preston County Hall, coroner James Adeley concluded that Ida's death had been caused by the midwives' failure to deliver the infant \"urgently when it was apparent she was in distress\" and contributed to by the lead midwife's \"wholly incompetent failure to provide basic neonatal resuscitation\".",
      "He said there had been eight missed opportunities \"to alter Ida's clinical course\".",
      "The inquest heard that Ida was transferred to the intensive care unit at Royal Preston Hospital's neonatal unit, where she died on 16 November 2019.",
      "The hearing previously heard that an April 2020 report from the independent Healthcare Safety Investigation Branch (HSIB) had identified numerous failings in Ida's care which had contributed to her death.",
      "The review said midwives failed to identify an abnormally slow foetal heart rate after Ida's mother, Sarah Robinson, attended in early labour.",
      "After Ida was born there was ineffective resuscitation, the HSIB concluded.",
      "But an earlier internal \"root cause analysis\" from the hospital in January 2020 found no issues and praised the \"great cohesion and communication\" shown by staff in the delivery suite.",
      "After reading the \"night and day\" contrasting reports, Ida's parents Ms Robinson and Ryan Lock complained to University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation Trust (UHMBT), which runs the hospital.",
      "'Wholly incompetent'",
      "Delivering his conclusion, Dr Adeley, said: \"Ida was a normal child whose death was caused by a lack of oxygen during her delivery that occurred due to the gross failure of the three midwives attending her to provide basic medical care to deliver Ida urgently when it was apparent she was in distress.\"",
      "And he noted that her death was contributed to by the lead midwife's \"wholly incompetent\" failure to provide basic neonatal resuscitation during the first three-and-half minutes of her life.",
      "This, he said, further contributed to the infant's brain damage.",
      "The senior coroner also criticised the hospital's investigation into Ida's death, calling it a \"damning indictment of an ineffective, dysfunctional and callous system that has failed this family at every opportunity\".",
      "UHMBT was the subject of a damning report in 2015 that found a \"lethal mix\" of problems at another of its maternity units at Furness General Hospital that led to the unnecessary deaths of 11 babies and one mother between 2004 and 2013.",

      "The man, from Buckinghamshire, went to A&E five times between August and October 2021.",
      "A scan taken in August showed a lesion in the bowel.",
      "However, clinicians reported no abnormalities, the investigation found, leading to a six-week delay in diagnosis and surgery.",
      "The patient also had an X-ray in October that suggested an obstruction in his small bowel, but this X-ray was not reviewed and he was discharged and sent home.",
      "Later that month the cancer was diagnosed and he had an operation to remove part of the bowel. The surgery uncovered another mass elsewhere in his body.",
      "Just months later, the man took his life, leaving a note saying he could no longer deal with the pain.",
      "The ombudsman, Rebecca Hilsenrath KC, said staff failed to manage his pain on five occasions.",
      "Failings in his care \"were probably contributory factors to the patient's decision to end his life\", her report suggests.",
      "The man's daughter said: \"I really tried to get the doctors to listen.",
      "\"I had a feeling something was wrong and I pleaded numerous times for them to keep him in the hospital, but they just kept discharging him and not doing anything to help him.\"",
      "A statement provided by the hospital trust says: \"We are very sorry for our failing in care in this case and we have a further meeting with the patient's family shortly to update them on the changes we have since made.",
      "\"This includes ensuring that older patients presenting with abdominal pain are appropriately reviewed.\"",
      "The trust has also agreed to pay the family \u00a34,000, as recommended by PHSO.",
      "'My brother believed NHS was best place'",
      "In another investigation, the ombudsman found a cancerous tumour was incorrectly identified as benign (non-cancerous) - despite repeated scans suggesting otherwise.",
      "The patient, a 54-year-old man, had his first scan in Tenerife, after becoming unwell on holiday.",
      "His brother said: \"When my brother collapsed in Tenerife, the hospital immediately identified the tumour for what it was [an aggressive brain tumour] and even offered to remove it.",
      "\"But my brother wanted to come home, he thought the best place for him to have the treatment was in the NHS.\"",
      "The man returned to Gillingham, where the local hospital carried out further scans identifying the tumour, and referred him to specialists at King's College Hospital.",
      "However, staff there \"downgraded the diagnosis\", saying the tumour was not cancerous. The man was not offered chemotherapy or radiotherapy.",
      "He died in hospital, a month after an operation to remove the tumour, which was confirmed to be cancerous.",
      "If the cancer had been identified correctly, he could have had surgery months earlier and potentially the option of chemotherapy and radiotherapy, PHSO said.",
      "While the survival rate for this cancer is poor, the ombudsman's investigation suggests the man may have had a few extra months of life.",
      "His brother said: \"I wanted King's College Hospital to acknowledge their mistakes so that I can stop picking at the scab of trying to understand what happened to him and remember my brother as he was when he was alive.\"",
      "In a statement, King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust said: \"We fully recognise that errors were made in this patient's care, and we apologised to his family at the time of the incident.",
      "\"Learning from mistakes when they occur is crucial, and we have made a number of changes as a result of this case to improve the safety and effectiveness of the care our teams provide.\"",
      "The trust has agreed to pay the family \u00a33,500.",
      "'Devastating consequences'",
      "Ms Hilsenrath, whose team independently investigates complaints, said: \"Each of the cases we have investigated and upheld represent a real person whose life has been impacted by failings in care.",
      "\"They are also all instances where the organisations involved failed to identify that anything had gone wrong\"",
      "The 2021 ombudsman report into medical imaging issues recommended system-wide improvements, but Ms Hilsenrath said while there had been some progress, she was still seeing instances where people's care was \"sub-optimal, often with devastating consequences\".",
      "It is \"critical\" that action is taken to improve the digital infrastructure in the NHS and ensure people are diagnosed and treated swiftly, she added.",
      "Dr Katharine Halliday, president of the Royal College of Radiologists, agreed digital infrastructure needed improvements.",
      "\"The ombudsman highlights some devastating failures in the NHS, and we must collectively learn from these experiences to drive meaningful change,\" she said.",
      "\"However, it must also be recognised that these findings reflect a system that is overburdened and under-resourced.\"",
      "The college says it faces a 30% shortfall of clinical radiologists, which is projected to rise to 40% by 2028.",
      "An NHS spokesperson said: \"The NHS had delivered a record number of tests and checks in 2024, a fifth more than pre-pandemic but we know there is more to do to improve the recognition and response of serious health issues.\"",
      "A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \"Our deepest sympathies are with all those who have been affected by the failings highlighted in this shocking report.\"",
      "The spokesperson added that they were opening more Community Diagnostic Centres (CDCs), and using new technology like AI so \"all patients can receive world-class care\".",
      "Changes were also being introduced in cancer care, the spokesperson said, which would see 100,000 more patients who are referred receiving a diagnosis within four weeks and up to 19,000 more people starting their treatment within two months each year.",

      "While people can legally change gender, they can't change biological sex. This means a woman who transitions to become a man may still need cervical smears and transgender women may need prostate checks.",

      "Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson told BBC Panorama Covid had led to a \"serious and profound shift\" in attitudes to attendance. She said lockdowns had cast \"a long shadow\" over the life chances of the youngest children.",
      "The latest statistics for persistent absence show 15% of primary children in England have missed at least one in ten days of school this school year - up from about 8% before Covid.",
      "It comes as the gap between the poorest students and other pupils had mainly narrowed before the pandemic, following years of effort by schools.",
      "However, the report suggests it is getting worse. The gap - which is measured using GCSE results - would reduce from 19 months to 15 months of learning if school attendance was the same for all pupils, it says.",
      "Natalie Perera, from the EPI, said it is the first time \"a very clear link\" has been made between how much children from the lowest income families attend school, and how far behind other pupils they have fallen.",
      "Her team looked specifically at children who have received free school meals in the past six years, which means the family income is less than \u00a37,400 a year after tax and not including benefits.",
      "Ms Perera said more research was needed to understand why these children struggled to be in school, with possible factors including poor housing and mental health.",
      "It is five years since the UK went into lockdown, when schools closed to most children.",

      "\"There will no longer be a separate vehicle that can be pointed [at] to say that's what got it wrong,\" Richard Meddings told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend, in the first interview with a senior official from the organisation since it was announced it would be abolished.",
      "Earlier this week the government confirmed the administrative body would be swallowed up by the Department of Health and Social Care. It will not affect patient care in hospitals, GP practices, and other health organisations but it will change how the NHS is run.",
      "Mr Meddings, who is due to step down at the end of this month, acknowledged that ministers wanted to be involved in the running of the NHS, but argued there had been a subtle form of micromanagement.",

      "Streeting admits 'risk of disruption' in NHS overhaul",
      "He also defended the idea of quangos \u2013 the term used to describe publicly funded organisations at arm's length from the government. \"I've worked with six secretaries of state and complete changes of ministers. So there is an argument for a construct that would separate the delivery vehicle from government.\"",
      "The advantage, he said, is that \"it brings in a steady engagement from relevant expertise on a particular topic. And the difference from the political world is.... they don't all necessarily come with relevant experience to run and oversee those areas\".",
      "And he argued that NHS organisational changes can't do much to change the underlying health of the population: \"The NHS deals with whoever or whatever comes through the gates in whatever condition. And many of the conditions of poor health are driven by factors outside the NHS.\"",

      "The organisation, said the source, had become a bureaucracy that was \"intellectually stagnant\" and that its position interacting with both the health service and ministers \"wasn't right\".",
      "Ministers have argued that cutting around 9,000 jobs with the shift of NHS England into the Department of Health would free up resources for frontline services, perhaps as much as \u00a3500 million a year. Having two organisations often duplicating work, they say, led to wasted time and needless costs.",
      "But one NHS source noted that the government claimed credit for the fall in the overall waiting list for planned treatment since the election and a two million year-on-year increase in the number of appointments and operations \u2013 performance delivered on NHS England's watch.",
      "The same source pointed out that \"with decrepit hospital buildings a new leadership structure won't make it any easier to carry out operations and care for patients\".",
      "These are huge structural changes for the leadership of the NHS and health administration in England. But they will take time to implement.",
      "Moving two large organisations into one and implementing 9,000 redundancies will take up a lot of management time and there are warnings of possible distraction from the day to day running of services. Patients won't see much difference for a while yet.",

      "The chair of NHS England has said he does not disagree with the abolishing of the organisation - although he warns that the buck will now stop with ministers.",
      "\"There will no longer be a separate vehicle that can be pointed [at] to say that's what got it wrong,\" Richard Meddings told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend, in the first interview with a senior official from the organisation since it was announced it would be abolished.",
      "Earlier this week the government confirmed the administrative body would be swallowed up by the Department of Health and Social Care. It will not affect patient care in hospitals, GP practices, and other health organisations but it will change how the NHS is run.",
      "Mr Meddings, who is due to step down at the end of this month, acknowledged that ministers wanted to be involved in the running of the NHS, but argued there had been a subtle form of micromanagement.",
      "\"At times, some weeks, almost 20 new instructions, commissions coming from government and ministers into the system,\" he said.",
      "Streeting admits 'risk of disruption' in NHS overhaul",
      "He also defended the idea of quangos \u2013 the term used to describe publicly funded organisations at arm's length from the government. \"I've worked with six secretaries of state and complete changes of ministers. So there is an argument for a construct that would separate the delivery vehicle from government.\"",
      "The advantage, he said, is that \"it brings in a steady engagement from relevant expertise on a particular topic. And the difference from the political world is.... they don't all necessarily come with relevant experience to run and oversee those areas\".",
      "And he argued that NHS organisational changes can't do much to change the underlying health of the population: \"The NHS deals with whoever or whatever comes through the gates in whatever condition. And many of the conditions of poor health are driven by factors outside the NHS.\"",
      "As Mr Meddings was setting out the case for the defence, the debate about the shake-up rages on.",
      "One well-placed source argued that NHS England's leaders had the chance just after the election to re-set the relationship with government but failed to do so as \"there had been too much suspicion of politicians\".",
      "The organisation, said the source, had become a bureaucracy that was \"intellectually stagnant\" and that its position interacting with both the health service and ministers \"wasn't right\".",
      "Ministers have argued that cutting around 9,000 jobs with the shift of NHS England into the Department of Health would free up resources for frontline services, perhaps as much as \u00a3500 million a year. Having two organisations often duplicating work, they say, led to wasted time and needless costs.",
      "But one NHS source noted that the government claimed credit for the fall in the overall waiting list for planned treatment since the election and a two million year-on-year increase in the number of appointments and operations \u2013 performance delivered on NHS England's watch.",
      "The same source pointed out that \"with decrepit hospital buildings a new leadership structure won't make it any easier to carry out operations and care for patients\".",
      "These are huge structural changes for the leadership of the NHS and health administration in England. But they will take time to implement.",
      "Moving two large organisations into one and implementing 9,000 redundancies will take up a lot of management time and there are warnings of possible distraction from the day to day running of services. Patients won't see much difference for a while yet.",

    "summary": "The former health secretary was giving evidence about medical equipment deals during the pandemic.",
    "story": [
      "Matt Hancock has defended government deals to buy personal protective equipment (PPE) during the pandemic, saying the country was in a \"desperate situation\" at the time.",
      "In a bad-tempered session at the Covid inquiry, the former health secretary repeatedly criticised the line of questioning describing it as \"naive\", \"hostile\" and \"inappropriate\".",
      "He said he was \"not at all surprised\" when a so-called VIP lane for PPE suppliers with a political connection was set up, describing it as \"standard practice\".",
      "At one point, the chairwoman of the inquiry, Baroness Hallett, intervened, telling Hancock it was her job to learn lessons for any future pandemic.",
      "'Radically short of PPE'",
      "Hancock was appearing for the fifth time at the Covid inquiry, which is now investigating the purchase and distribution of \u00a315bn of PPE in the pandemic, along with testing kits, ventilators and other pieces of medical equipment.",
      "He defended a public \"call to arms\" made at a Downing Street news conference on 10 April 2020 for more UK suppliers of PPE to come forward.",
      "The inquiry has heard from previous witnesses, including the government's former chief commercial officer Sir Gareth Rhys Williams, that the appeal was counterproductive, leading to a large number of approaches which threatened to overwhelm the system.",
      "\"We were radically short of PPE [at the time] and the country was about to run out at a national level,\" Hancock told the inquiry.",
      "\"No-one has testified that the call to arms led to anything other than more PPE\u2026 So I stand by that.\"",
      "The former health secretary was then asked about the High Priority Lane, or VIP lane, which was set up by officials in the Department of Health in England to help manage offers by prioritising those referred by an MP, member of the House of Lords or senior civil servant.",
      "Hancock said he was not involved in designing the system, which he said had made him the target of an \"enormous amount of conspiracy theories\".",
      "The inquiry commissioned an expert report from Prof Albert Sanchez-Graells, a professor of law at the University of Bristol, which was critical of the approach and found no evidence of similar prioritisation in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, or  other countries around the world.",
      "\"It's fine having academics write papers about this stuff\u2026 but you've got to understand what it was like [at the time],\" said Hancock.",
      "\"The pressure to save lives was intense, but so was the reality that high-quality offers would be sent through to senior decision-makers, and you had to have a process for dealing with that.\"",
      "He said that other countries would have had their own systems for prioritising offers for PPE and medical equipment in different ways.",
      "Hancock was later asked about a contract awarded to a firm run by Alex Bourne, who owned a pub in his West Suffolk constituency, to make vials for Covid testing.",
      "Emails show Hancock passed on communications from Mr Bourne to the then health minister Lord Bethell, describing his analysis of the wider testing system as a \"very interesting critique\" from a \"very impressive guy\".",
      "In questioning, Hancock said he acted with \"impeccable behaviour\" at the time, and accused the inquiry's chief counsel Richard Wald KC of cherry-picking a \"couple of messages\" that have the \"most tabloid interest\".",
      "He said the inquiry had followed a \"wholly naive\" line of questioning by ignoring the reality of the situation at the time, while making \"terribly pejorative\" statements that were \"totally inappropriate\".",
      "At the conclusion of his evidence, Baroness Hallett told Hancock that he \"was not the first and I'm sure won't be the last witness to think the inquiry is all about criticising people\".",
      "\"My aim is to investigate what happened, to explore matters of public concern, to get people to answer on those areas, and to try to come up with recommendations that will save lives,\" she added."

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgev3dvz3jo",
    "published": "Mon, 17 Mar 2025 06:06:29 GMT",
    "summary": "The debate has sparked a wider dilemma about the broader purpose of welfare",
    "story": [
      "In the next 24 hours and then over the following fortnight up until the Spring Statement, the government is going to talk a lot about a broken welfare system that is failing the people who use it, the economy and taxpayers.",
      "Taking a tough call on fixing it goes against the instincts of much of the Labour Party and has already sparked an internal backlash that could rise to ministerial level, as well as protests.",
      "The government is making two key related judgements. The first is that the country cannot afford to sustain recent ballooning increases in the health-related benefit bill and caseload, in particular for mental illness.",
      "At the same time, it will argue that a job is the best medicine.",
      "Underlying this is an assumption that a health-related benefits system that was built-up to deal with industrial injuries can't apply to the post-pandemic service economy workforce.",
      "The net result is likely to be significant changes to Personal Independence Payments, aiming to reduce eligibility for the highest levels of payments, especially among those of working age with mental illness.",
      "In addition, there will be a levelling of the generosity of the health component of Universal Credit. This will save billions of pounds, and about a billion of that will be reinvested in trying to help get those capable of part-time work some help for a partial return.",
      "Mapping welfare trends",
      "The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) is rolling in real-time data. \"Cluster analysis maps\" reveal to ministers exactly who is claiming out of work benefits and where they are.",
      "As the numbers continue to increase, the data is being cut by sector, postcode, age and type of illness. Every pattern is being analysed.",
      "The idea was that the data would firstly offer the government insight into how it could make billions of pounds of cuts to a rapidly growing bill in order to help the Chancellor meet her self-imposed government borrowing rules.",
      "Secondly, it was meant to point to more fundamental reforms to welfare, also designed to temper the same ballooning rise in the costs of dealing with ill health among the working population.",
      "The data has thrown up answers.",
      "That poor mental health is driving the rise in claimants is clear. To a lesser extent, so too is the role that raising the state pension age has played, with many thousands who would previously have been retired now claiming health-related benefits.",
      "But it has also thrown up a major question too: does cutting welfare to incentivise people to work more hours in fact do the opposite - nudging them out of the workforce altogether and ultimately increasing the benefit bill?",
      "If this is the case - and it is by no means a universally accepted interpretation of what has happened - then the question is whether further cuts could in fact increase the numbers claiming? And should Labour instead invest in getting people back into work?",
      "Growing sickness",
      "When I visited a job centre in Birmingham alongside the Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall in the Autumn, I was taken aback by how the work coaches were talking as much about health as about work.",
      "\"There's a lot of mental health, depression and anxiety,\" Qam told me.",
      "GPs have reported that their surgery time is dominated by trying to work out whether their patients are \"fit for work\". Roughly 11 million fit notes are issued every year in England alone, with 93% assessing the patient as \"not fit for work\". That has doubled over a decade. In the latest quarter, 44% were for 5 weeks or more absence.",
      "From that pool of growing in-work sickness, a significant proportion ends up on some form of incapacity benefits. The Treasury's bill for health and disability benefits, which was \u00a328bn in the year before the pandemic, is now \u00a352bn a year. It is forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) to hit \u00a370bn by the end of the decade.",
      "The pure financial aim here is to \"bend the curve\" down to nearer \u00a360bn in that period. This means restricting both the generosity and eligibility of some - or all of such - payments. It could require a wholesale cash freeze so that benefits do not rise with inflation, for example, or the abolition of entire categories of recipients.",
      "'Deaths of despair'",
      "An Institute for Fiscal Studies report published last week showed that wider measures of mental ill health have rocketed since the pandemic. Between 2002 and 2024, the number of 16-64-year-olds claiming disability benefits for mental or behavioural health conditions increased from 360,000 to 1.28 million.",
      "Every day in 2023 there were 10 extra \"deaths of despair\" (defined as deaths from alcohol, drugs or suicide) in England and Wales than the average between 2015 and 2019. Average sickness absence rates across the whole economy remained structurally higher than pre-pandemic.",
      "Of particular concern is how this affects young people. In a recent report DWP adviser Prof Paul Gregg points to the \"incredibly low\" chances of sustained returns to the workforce once a person has been on incapacity benefits for two years.",
      "About two fifths of new incapacity benefit claimants under 25 came directly from education. The latest DWP analysis shows these trends are now closely related to broader socio-economic vulnerabilities such as limited education and also with precarious sectors such as retail and hospitality.",
      "The question that remains is whether so many people really are more sick - and what role (if any) is played by the reduction in stigma around mental health.",
      "But then there is the question of how to address it.",
      "Overly binary",
      "Another major factor is that rise in the state pension age, which the DWP calculates, resulted in 89,000 older workers instead claiming health-related benefits. However, the sharp increase in claimants of such benefits since the pandemic is not only attributable to ageing populations or increasing mental health diagnoses.",
      "Research suggests there are significant systemic and policy-driven causes. At its heart the problem is perceived to be that the current welfare structure has become overly binary, failing to accommodate a growing demographic who should be able to do at least a bit of work.",
      "This rigidity - what ministers refer to as a \"hard boundary\" - inadvertently pushes individuals towards declaring complete unfitness for work, and can lead to total dependence on welfare, particularly Universal Credit Health (UC Health), rather than facilitating a gradual transition back into employment.",
      "This has been bad for the economy, for employers, terrible for the public finances, and deeply concerning for the career prospects of individuals.",
      "History helps here. Health-related benefits are often a disguised form of unemployment. The caseload for incapacity benefits (which include not just UC Health but previous incarnations) since the 1970s shows the UK heading for a record of one in 12 adults of working age in receipt.",
      "But this is not the first such build-up. It happened in the late 1980s when Margaret Thatcher was prime minister, and it was reversed in the early 2000s under New Labour.",
      "The launch in 1986 of Restart Programme, a forerunner to JobSeekers Allowance modelled on Ronald Reagan's policies in the US, helped return many claimants to the workforce but also pushed a staggering number into incapacity claims.",
      "Over the decade and a half of this policy, there was a 1.6 million increase in people in receipt of the benefit. But at the time this migration from claimant unemployment into incapacity was apparently a deliberate strategy, as it helped deal with headlines about \"three million unemployed\".",
      "A middle ground",
      "The government has not yet published its analysis on the jobs market, but Prof Gregg's early thinking was made clear in a report for the Health Foundation. He argued that, historically, the welfare system responded effectively through a middle ground that allowed individuals to combine part-time work with partial welfare benefits. He puts this down to reforms introduced in the early 2000s, such as tax credits.",
      "This is essentially the crystallisation of Iain Duncan Smith's critique of then chancellor George Osborne's welfare cuts of 2016. He told me at the time that they were \"deeply unfair\" on working people and the vision of a proper welfare-to-work scheme \"could not be repeatedly salami-sliced\".",
      "Some argue that those reforms created a situation where individuals, unable to sustain full-time work, gravitate towards more generous health-based welfare program.",
      "Crucially, claims began to rise in 2018. At the DWP ministers have tried to research the reasons behind the increase in caseload - and found that about a third of the increase can be explained as the predictable consequence of policy or of demographics.",
      "Prevention rather than cure",
      "With an ongoing flow of new claimants arriving in the system (nearly half a million in the last financial year) the onus is now on finding a prevention rather than a cure.",
      "And this is where it becomes tricky - one suggestion involves eliminating the current welfare trap by reintroducing intermediate support for part-time work. However, that requires extra funding, as well as a way of providing more personalised job searches and better mental health support.",
      "Another option is passing responsibilities to employers. In the Netherlands, employers bear significant responsibilities and financial costs if they fail to adequately support employees facing health challenges. In the early 2000s, the Dutch also had very high levels of incapacity but they now report employment rates of 83%.",
      "The structure of the jobs market in the UK makes that challenging to replicate - for example there are more insecure zero hours contracts.",
      "And given that businesses feel under pressure from National Insurance rises and a slow economy, could they really be cajoled into helping?",
      "Faster cuts",
      "The questions arising from the data will matter for the economy, for the public finances, our health, and young people's careers and livelihoods, at a time of considerable change.",
      "Fundamentally, it is a question of what the benefit system is for, at a time when illness is being redefined, and when the trends are, frankly, scary.",
      "Then there is the question of whether the public wants to pay even higher taxes in the hope of delivering long-term gain. Welfare-to-work programs can pay for themselves eventually, but the Government feels it needs to book faster cuts.",
      "That's because all of this is in the context of what \"fiscal headroom\" the government did have against the Chancellor's self-imposed borrowing targets being wiped out since the Trump shock to the world economy, the Budget and the announcements of extra European defence spending.",
      "But government insiders are at pains to argue that the primary motivation for any cuts is not regaining the extra room for manoeuvre. \"We don't need the OBR to tell us that we need to fix welfare to get people back to work. We don't need the OBR to tell us we need to make the NHS more productive. And we don't need the OBR to tell us that the taxpayer should be getting more value for money,\" a source told me.",
      "\"Headroom or no headroom the Chancellor is determined to push through the change we need to make Britain more secure and prosperous.\"",
      "Ultimately, the economic imperative is clear - to bring a cohort of young people suffering a combination of mental ill health and joblessness back into work.",
      "And the government believes there is no way of doing this without, at least at first, hurting the incomes of ill people. There is going to be quite the backlash from disability charities, and in turn from backbench Labour MPs.",
      "That's why it's no exaggeration to say this month's explosive row about welfare will come to define this Government.",
      "The unexpected knock-on effect of Trump's minerals 'deal of the century'",

      "The government's independent forecaster had predicted that borrowing would be \u00a36.5bn for the month.",
      "Reeves is expected to announce spending cuts next week to meet her self-imposed rules for the economy, which the Treasury reiterated were \"non-negotiable\".",
      "\"We must go further and faster to create an agile and productive state that works for people,\" said Darren Jones, chief secretary to the Treasury, adding that the government \"will never play fast and loose with the public finances\".",

      "Dennis Tatarkov, senior economist at KPMG, said the latest borrowing figures raised the risk of Reeves missing her self-imposed borrowing rules.",
      "Most governments in wealthy nations have such rules, which are designed to reassure investors and maintain credibility with financial markets.",
      "Reeves's two main rules are: not to borrow to fund day-to-day public spending; and to get debt falling as a share of the UK economic output by 2029/30.",
      "Isabel Stockton, senior researcher for the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank, said Reeves had \"boxed herself in with promises to meet her fiscal targets, not to raise taxes further and not to return to austerity for public services\".",

      "In the messages, which were sent after Lowe criticised the Reform leader in a Daily Mail interview, Farage accused him of \"damaging the party just before elections\".",
      "Reform has always denied there was any connection between Lowe's suspension and his criticism of the party.",
      "In his Mail interview on 5 March, Lowe called Reform a \"protest party\" led by \"the Messiah\". He was suspended on 7 March and reported to police over claims he had made threats of violence against party chairman Zia Yusuf.",
      "Reform said it had also received allegations of bullying in Lowe's MP offices. Lowe strongly denies all the allegations.",
      "He has since accused Farage of a \"malicious witch hunt\" and being motivated \"to remove me because I dared to ask questions\".",
      "Responding to the latest development on social media, Lowe said: \"These messages unquestionably prove that the Reform leadership has zero integrity.",
      "\"Nigel Farage must never become prime minister.\"",
      "Farage told the BBC: \"The suspension was to protect the party, simple. The newspaper attack on Reform UK is separate but dreadful.\"",
      "He has previously insisted the party was duty bound to look into any allegations of wrongdoing.",
      "Reform's deputy leader Richard Tice previously told the BBC there was \"absolutely no truth\" in claims of a link between the decision to suspend Lowe and the allegations being made public.",
      "But a series of messages between Farage and someone who has worked for Lowe in recent years reveals Farage's personal anger with Lowe about his comments to the Daily Mail.",
      "In one message, Farage says Lowe is \"contemptible\". When asked by the activist, who is not currently a party member, why Reform had not allowed a lawyer to complete an investigation before suspending him Farage said: \"Because he is damaging the party just before elections. Disgusting.\"",
      "When it was suggested the investigation into Lowe was a response to his criticism of the leadership, Farage replied on WhatsApp: \"We are definitely damaged and within two weeks of nominations. Awful.\"",
      "Farage went on to say the Mail interview was a \"side issue\" and that the party had to investigate the claims against Lowe.",
      "But the messages reveal a level of animosity between the suspended MP and his team and the Reform UK leadership, alongside the claims about his behaviour, which Lowe vehemently denies.",
      "The BBC's source is themselves the subject of an allegation of bullying, which they strenuously deny.",
      "The BBC has spoken to several members of Rupert Lowe's team. Among them are people who have worked alongside Nigel Farage for years and admired him.",
      "But many now are deeply critical.",
      "One said: \"Nigel is thin skinned and egotistical. I have spent years defending him but the aura has gone for me now. Reporting Rupert to the police? Come on. They're trying to put him in prison!\"",
      "The staff member went on to claim that the root of this whole row was Elon Musk's praise for Lowe on X, saying: \"Nigel is very sensitive about his American contacts.\"",

      "\"You'd never find someone more kind and considerate than Rupert.",
      "\"If you don't have policies as a party, you're a joke and that is what Rupert was pointing out.\"",
      "The BBC has also seen evidence of lengthy and detailed exchanges between Lowe's offices and Parliament's human resources team over the alleged conduct and subsequent departures of two members of staff.",
      "Lowe has long insisted that he and his staff diligently followed the due process parliament requires of them and there was no need for the party, or a senior lawyer hired by the party, to get involved.",
      "Reform UK has expanded rapidly, now boasting more than 200,000 members and regularly topping or coming second in national opinion polls.",
      "But Nigel Farage has publicly acknowledged that infighting has damaged the party's chances of progress.",
      "Rupert Lowe told the BBC: \"Farage has admitted himself, in writing, that the motivation behind my removal was the Daily Mail interview, in which I raised reasonable and constructive questions of Reform structure, policy and communication - following months of pushing for change behind the scenes.",
      "\"That interview is why they designed and launched their horrific smear campaign against my name. It is evil behaviour. Nigel Farage must never be Prime Minister. All I have done is tell the truth, and I will continue to do so.\"",

      "The UK prime minister said any agreement to stop the fighting between Russia and Ukraine would \"only be lasting\" if there were \"security arrangements in place\".",
      "He was speaking at Permanent Joint Headquarters in Northwood, London, where more than 20 countries gathered at a closed meeting to discuss proposals for troops in Ukraine to help guarantee the country's security as part of any peace deal.",
      "Sir Keir said security arrangements would make clear to Russia there would be \"severe consequences if they are to breach any deal\".",
      "The prime minister said the UK and its allies were moving from \"political momentum\" to \"military planning\", which he said had \"to be done now\" before a deal was agreed.",
      "He said: \"It is vitally important we do that work because we know one thing for certain, which is a deal without anything behind it is something that Putin will breach.",

    "story": [
      "Claims an independent football regulator could stifle the growth of the Premier League and foreign investment in it are \"complete nonsense\", English Football League (EFL) chairman Rick Parry has told the BBC.",
      "Under a change to a government bill going through Parliament, the proposed regulator will have a duty to avoid having a negative impact on the financial growth of the English game.",
      "But a government source has played down reports No 10 is considering scaling back the regulator's powers as part of a wider move to cut bureaucracy.",
      "Mr Parry said the changes being put forward would benefit the whole of the men's professional game, but well-off clubs had \"nothing to fear\" from them.",

      "Football regulator a waste of money - Badenoch",
      "The Football Governance Bill is due to complete its House of Lords stages next week, after which it will be sent to the Commons for MPs to consider.",
      "It would establish a regulator which is independent from government and the sport's authorities to oversee the men's game in England's top five divisions.",
      "The regulator would set out mandatory conditions for clubs to meet, relating to corporate governance and financial reporting.",
      "Clubs would also be required to provide \"effective engagement\" with fans on changes to ticket prices and any proposals to relocate home grounds.",
      "Under \"backstop powers\", the regulator could intervene between the Premier League and the EFL if they fail to agree a deal to redistribute money to EFL clubs, many of which are cash-strapped.",
      "Previous rounds of talks have collapsed.",
      "The Premier League has repeatedly argued that English football is capable of regulating itself, and said it is critical that any external regulation is \"proportionate\".",
      "It has warned of \"unintended consequences of legislation that could weaken the competitiveness and appeal of \u00adEnglish football\".",
      "'Light touch'",
      "Bloomberg UK has reported that, following lobbying from Premier League owners, No 10 is looking again at some of the bill's measures, to ensure foreign investors are not discouraged from buying English clubs.",
      "Both Sir Keir Starmer and Chancellor Rachel Reeves have put economic growth and investment at the centre of their programme for government.",
      "Last week, the prime minister announced that NHS England would be abolished   and brought under \"democratic control\" to cut bureaucracy.",
      "He said for too long politicians had \"chosen to hide behind vast arrays of quangos\" - organisations funded by taxpayers but not directly controlled by the government.",
      "However, the source at the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, which is piloting the bill through Parliament, indicated to the BBC it was aligned with Downing Street on the need for a \"light touch\" football regulator.",
      "Mr Parry told the BBC different parts of government often had different views.",
      "But he said he was encouraged by the way ministers had successfully resisted attempts by Conservative peers to weaken the legislation in the Lords last week, with \"an impressive whipping operation\".",
      "The impetus for an independent regulator has been years in the making, with several lower division clubs subjected to financial mismanagement and. in some cases like Bury and Macclesfield Town, complete collapse.",
      "Mr Parry, the Premier League's first chief executive in 1992 and a former chief executive at Liverpool, said many MPs, particularly in northern towns, were very aware that lower league football clubs were at \"the heart of their communities\".",
      "'Unbridgeable chasm'",
      "There was \"not a shred of evidence\" for Premier League clubs' arguments that their financial competitiveness could be undermined by the proposed regulator, he added.",
      "\"No one wants to kill the golden goose or impose unnecessary bureaucracy\", but the Premier League had to \"discharge its responsibilities\", he argued.",
      "Mr Parry pointed to a \"growing gulf\" between the Premier League and the EFL, saying an \u00a311m gap in finances had soared to \u00a33.3bn since 1992.",
      "An increasingly \"unbridgeable chasm\" was highlighted by the fact that all three clubs promoted from the Championship in 2023 had been immediately relegated the following season - and that was looking likely to happen again this season - he said.",
      "The bill was initially introduced in March 2024 by the previous Conservative government, following a fan-led review headed by former sports minister Tracey Crouch.",
      "But it ran out of parliamentary time when Rishi Sunak called a general election.",
      "When it took office, Labour reintroduced the bill, promising to protect clubs' \"financial sustainability\".",
      "Under Kemi Badenoch, the Tories have shifted their position and now oppose the bill.",
      "Badenoch has argued it will be \"a waste of money\".",
      "Mr Parry said he still wanted to engage with the Conservative leadership on the merits of a regulator, adding that he believed many grassroots Tories still backed the idea."

      "Hundreds of thousands of people are likely to be affected by the benefit changes, which will make it harder for people with less severe conditions to claim disability payments.",

      "Incapacity benefits under universal credit to be halved for new claimants",
      "Incapacity benefits under universal credit will be frozen in cash terms for existing claimants at \u00a397 per week from April next year - this means they will not be increased in line with inflation until 2029/30.",

      "The idea is that young people will have work and training \"rather than a pathway to economic inactivity\", the DWP says.",
      "More incentives to work",

    "story": [
      "Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall has set out how the government plans to cut billions of pounds from the working-age welfare bill in the coming years.",
      "The focus will be on reducing spending on health and disability benefits.",
      "The bill is rising rapidly and many argue it needs to be curbed for the sake of the UK's public finances \u2013 as well as the economic and individual benefits of getting those who can work back into employment.",
      "The plans include cutting the level of some benefits and tightening eligibility for others, along with investment to help people into work.",
      "But this is not the first government to seek savings from the welfare budget.",
      "BBC Verify has examined the past 15 years of policies in this area to see what might be effective \u2013 and what risks being counterproductive.",
      "At-a-glance: Key changes to benefits in welfare shake-up",
      "What are the Pip and universal credit changes and who is affected?",
      "Cutting payments",
      "The working-age health and disability benefits bill has certainly been increasing in recent years, and is rising rapidly.",
      "The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the official forecaster, has projected that total state spending on these benefits for people in the UK aged between 18 and 64 will increase from \u00a348.5bn in 2023-24 to \u00a375.7bn in 2029-30.",
      "That would represent an increase from 1.7% of the size of the UK economy to 2.2%.",
      "By 2030, around half of the expenditure is projected to be on incapacity benefit, which is designed to provide additional income for people whose health limits their ability to work.",
      "The other half is projected to be on Personal Independence Payments (PIP), which are intended to help people of working age with disabilities manage the additional day-to-day costs arising from their disability.",
      "The government hopes to curb the rise in the overall bill by holding some of the benefits of existing incapacity claimants flat in cash terms - rather than allowing them to rise in line with inflation - until 2030.",
      "It also plans to reduce the benefits of many new claimants outright relative to current levels.",
      "This echoes the policies of previous governments.",
      "Between 2014 and 2020, most working-age benefits were increased below the rate of inflation to save money.",
      "This included a portion of the payments received by people on incapacity benefit.",
      "However, despite these real terms cuts in many benefits, from 2015, more and more people claimed incapacity benefit.",
      "So cutting the value of individual payments might save some money up front, but still not have a dramatic impact on the overall bill in the longer term if claimants continue to rise.",
      "Tighten eligibility",
      "The Government is also planning to keep a lid on the overall working-age benefit bill by making it harder for people to claim some disability benefits, notably PIP.",
      "This too echoes the policies of previous administrations.",
      "For instance, Rishi Sunak's government had proposed making it harder for people with mental health conditions to claim PIP arguing that the monthly payment was not proportionate to the additional financial needs created by their conditions.",
      "But it is important to note that efforts to change the eligibility criteria for these benefits over the past 15 years have not yielded the results hoped for.",
      "PIP was introduced in 2013 to replace the old Disability Living Allowance, with the intention it would lead to savings of \u00a31.4bn a year relative to the previous system by reducing the number of people eligible.",
      "PIP was initially projected to reduce the number of claimants by 606,000 (28%) in total.",
      "Yet the reform ended up saving only \u00a3100m a year by 2015, and the number of claimants rose by 100,000 (5%).",
      "Another attempt in 2017 to limit access to PIP was also reversed.",
      "The reason was that many people appealed against refusals that had been triggered by the tightened eligibility criteria.",
      "Also, the emergence of cases in the media which seemed unfair meant ministers, often under pressure from their own backbench MPs, ultimately ordered the eligibility rules to be relaxed.",
      "Official decisions not to award PIP and incapacity benefit to claimants are still often challenged and around two-thirds are ultimately decided in the challenger's favour at an independent tribunal.",
      "Encourage work",
      "The government is also seeking to make savings from the working age welfare bill by encouraging people to enter work.",
      "Around 93% of incapacity benefit claimants are not in work and the same is true of 80% of PIP claimants.",
      "One of the proposals is to have more regular reassessments of people on incapacity benefit to determine if their condition has changed and they can now be expected to work.",
      "The fall in the number of people claiming incapacity benefit in the early 2010s has been attributed by the OBR to reassessments of a large number of people in receipt of an older form of the benefit.",
      "However, an aggressive or onerous reassessment regime could risk imposing distress on people who are unable to work.",
      "The government has said that those with \"the most severe, life-long health conditions\" will face no future reassessments. But it has not specified which conditions will qualify.",
      "It has also set out plans to encourage more people on health and disability benefits into work through tailored and personalised support.",
      "There have been various schemes designed to achieve this over the past 15 years, though they have not been on a large scale.",
      "Evaluations have shown some positive employment effects from them.",
      "However, the OBR concluded last year that the evidence base was still limited and did not suggest such programmes have, so far, made a \"significant contribution\" to getting people into work.",
      "That implies the official forecaster may hesitate to assume greater state investment in these schemes will pay for itself through higher employment and tax revenues, and result in net savings in public expenditure.",
      "Nevertheless, some experts argue it would make sense for the government to re-assess more regularly whether people in receipt of health and disability benefits are still unable to work and - if their circumstances are found to have changed - to provide them with additional support to get into the workforce.",
      "\"Not doing reassessments and work-focused interviews definitely makes things worse,\" says Jonathan Portes, a former chief economist at the Department for Work & Pensions.",
      "Correction 17 March: an earlier version of this article wrongly stated the percentage of claimants' appeals upheld, based on DWP appeals. The article has been updated to reflect the full proportion, upheld at independent tribunal.",

      "\"There is a collision coming,\" a Labour insider tells me. Sir Keir Starmer has long been up for fights with his party. But with controversy around every corner, who are the tribes in the party in 2025, and might they fight back?",
      "The party's history is crammed with bitter bust-ups, years when MPs seemed most comfortable to be fighting each other, rather than political rivals.",
      "With a squeeze on benefits coming, there is unease on the back, and the front benches, including in cabinet. The decision on winter fuel payments still causes resentment, and new plans for immigration coming in a white paper later in the spring are likely to be controversial too.",

      "Sir Keir's allies seem pretty confident Labour's ditched that habit of constant scrapping. But No 10 is worried enough to be inviting MPs into Downing Street to make their pitch for the changes to welfare, knowing there'll be upset from the usual suspects and hoping there won't be too much of a backlash on the soft left.",
      "It's also grappling with the massive group of MPs elected last year, with some eager backbenchers actively trying to make Sir Keir's case, unkindly branded by one source as \"toadies\" trying to suck up to the leadership.",
      "So how will the \"usual suspects\", the \"softies\", the \"newbies\" and the \"toadies\" shake down?",
      "There has always been criticism of Sir Keir from the left-hand edge of Labour, not least because he spent the first couple of years in charge squeezing out the hard left, and even kicked out some MPs after the general election for voting against him over the cap on benefits for families with more than two children.",
      "It's common for MPs like Diane Abbott or Nadia Whittome to take pot shots at the prime minister's plans. But now this group is much smaller and less influential than it once was, it can't do much damage on its own. Gone are the days when the Socialist Campaign Group held sway with Jeremy Corbyn \u2013 there are only around 30 MPs in the group these days. But unhappiness about the coming welfare cuts spreads its tentacles far further.",

The challenge for us on the left is to work with those people - then we'll have a sizeable rebellion.\" It is \"breathtaking\" to see new MPs backing undisclosed changes to benefits for disabled people, they add.",
      "They point to the rebellion against Tony Blair in 1997 when 47 Labour MPs voted against the new government over - you guessed it - cuts to benefits. One hundred MPs abstained. It didn't change the policy, just as a rebellion of that kind of size wouldn't change it this time either, given the PM's huge majority. But it shocked ministers, still in the pomp of their massive victory that year. Could this do the same?",
      "Downing Street evidently is worried - but the resistance on the soft left so far seems, well, rather soft.",
      "Another source tells me there are lots of colleagues who are expressing discomfort, and there are fault-lines, but it's not organised. Some of those who would rather like there to be a rebellion seem to also rather like the idea of someone else organising it.",
      "Rebellions do need organising, effort, energy, and an eagerness to make sparks fly. They also need leaders willing to put their head above the parapet. While the concern is strong, the appetite for a big spat when the plans eventually get to Parliament is less so, at least for now.",
      "It's symbolic of where power is held in the party right now. \"The soft left has been obliterated,\" a senior Labour figure tells me, adding: \"I'm not sure No 10 has the story right and I fear it will be handled badly, but on welfare \u2013 they have got no choice.\"",
      "Ministers are trying to make a moral argument - that sorting out welfare is a mission, that it's better for people's well-being and health to have a job. Wes Streeting, the health secretary, will almost inevitably make that case when he joins us in the studio tomorrow. That argument was made by Labour in the election and in its manifesto. But the second part of the expected plans - squeezing payments to disabled people who may already be struggling - was not.",
      "None of the hordes of Labour MPs elected for the first time in 2024 had taking cash from the worst off on their campaign leaflets or Facebook posts. But are the newbies, barely a year into the job, the kind of tribe to cause trouble? Of course, it's important to note they don't all think the same but talking to some of them, there are some characteristics you can trace.",
      "Remember more than half of Labour's MPs \u2013 243 out of 406 \u2013 are completely new, so understanding their centre of gravity is hugely important. And it seems very different to the previous generations.",
      "One of the newbies told me: \"Even more than the welfare stuff, the moment that was most revealing about how different we are to 1997 was the 3% defence target and the aid cuts.\" This wasn't met with any more resistance than the resignation of International Development Minister Annaliese Dodds and a \"few rumblings\" from inside the party - but for most of the 2024 intake it was a \"no-brainer\", given the need to spend more on defence as the world becomes less secure.",
      "It's not just that Labour's recruits are different, but they note their political upbringing is different too: \"We have come of age politically in a time when chaos is the norm and the world feels like it is continually going to hell\" \u2013 so cutting aid and other policies that are uncomfortable for moderates a generation above \"are not that troubling\".",
      "Indeed, some of the newbies have been unkindly branded \"toadies\" by others, as another source describes them - not just accepting some of the leadership's tougher plans, but even egging them on, busy writing public letters, or giving supportive interviews.",
      "Whether on welfare, defence or planning, another MP describes them as \"pop-up pressure groups\", publicly calling for No 10 to push its reforms harder, and further.",
      "\"Aren't they hilarious?\" a party veteran jokes, gently mocking the ambition of those involved, suspicious that the leadership may have gently encouraged a few aspirant MPs to make their case vigorously and loudly.",
      "A government source acknowledges there is a significant chunk of MPs who want to be helpful to the leadership, but with many in marginal seats, \"they are not swots, they are street fighters\" who are closer to their voters' concerns. They're telling the leadership they can give them space to be more radical on welfare, immigration or getting houses built.",
      "For now, whatever the motivation of the usual suspects, No 10 can enjoy a level of unity in the governing party.",
      "It's also plain that the political operation in government has improved since the summer, in part due to his chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, credited by many for bringing a new discipline to the party. \"There is only one tribe,\" a senior figure told me, \"it's Morgan McSweeney's \u2013 it's his way or the high way \u2013 his people are controlling things at the moment.\" That's described differently by others, who say: \"It's Keir's party now.\" And an increasingly confident prime minister abroad has more clout at home.",
      "But the rows over welfare that will bubble up this week and the chancellor's decisions in the Spring Statement next week still certainly matter. Not every MP or activist agrees with the decisions being taken by the centre - but with a whopping majority, the risk is not about losing votes.",
      "It's about a direction of travel and the perception of the party to the public. It matters in the next few weeks on the inside of government because managing unhappiness takes up political time, energy and effort. It matters outside because rows over policy, whether welfare or immigration, create headlines, and headaches, and the danger of giving the public the impression that the party in charge is not pulling together.",
      "That's acknowledged by a government source observing the journey Sir Keir's Labour Party has been on: \"We were united against the hard left, then we were united against the Tories\" - but as the government settles in, it's less clear what the party is united on now.",

    "story": [
      "The chancellor will give an update on her plans for the UK economy and an economic forecast when she makes her Spring Statement, on Wednesday 26 March.",
      "Rachel Reeves has previously ruled out further tax rises, but faces difficult choices because of the performance of the UK economy and world events.",
      "What is the chancellor expected to announce?",
      "Reeves has committed to one major economic event each year - the Budget. This is to give families and businesses \"stability and certainty on tax and spending changes\".",
      "As a result, government sources have been keen to stress that the Spring Statement is not a major financial event.",
      "However, with the government under pressure over its finances, Reeves is expected to announce spending cuts.",
      "Reeves may confirm, for example, details of how international aid funding will be reallocated to defence, following the decision to increase defence spending to 2.5% of national income by 2027.",
      "Big changes aimed at saving money have also been made before the Spring Statement.",
      "On Tuesday, an overhaul of the benefits system was announced, aimed at cutting \u00a35bn a year from the UK's growing welfare bill by 2030.",
      "Policies include stricter tests for personal independence payments, affecting hundreds of thousands of claimants, and a freeze on incapacity benefits.",
      "Another possibility is that the chancellor could also decide to delay any announcements of cuts to the Spending Review in June, or even the next Budget in the autumn.",
      "What are the Pip and universal credit changes and who is affected?",
      "At-a-glance: Key changes to benefits in welfare shake-up",
      "Government borrowing higher than expected in February",
      "How will the day play out?",
      "Before Reeves makes her statement in Parliament, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which monitors the government's spending plans and performance, will publish its forecast on the UK economy.",
      "It will also provide estimates on the cost of living for households and whether it thinks the government will stick to its self-imposed rules on borrowing and spending.",
      "Reeves will present the watchdog's main findings and make her Spring Statement on her plans for the economy alongside this.",
      "After she has spoken, the opposition, likely to be either Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch or shadow chancellor Mel Stride, will respond.",
      "What about Reeves's borrowing rules?",
      "Reeves has two main rules on borrowing:",
      "Not to borrow to fund day-to-day public spendingTo get debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this parliament",
      "Not to borrow to fund day-to-day public spending",
      "To get debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this parliament",
      "She has repeatedly said her rules are \"non-negotiable\".",
      "However, the OBR's forecast is expected to confirm that the \u00a39.9bn financial buffer to meet her budget rule by the 2029-30 financial year has been wiped out.",
      "The pressure on Reeves grew on Friday, when it was announced that UK government borrowing was higher than expected in February, at \u00a310.7bn.",
      "The economy is seen to be underperforming, thanks in part to global factors indirectly affecting the UK such as US trade tariffs.",
      "This has fuelled further speculation over whether the chancellor will break her self-imposed  borrowing rules.",
      "How is the UK economy doing?",
      "Recent figures show UK economic growth has been weak.",
      "The economy grew by just 0.1% between October and December 2024, while the latest monthly figures show it contracted by 0.1% in January.",
      "When an economy grows, more businesses can employ extra workers or give pay rises. Firms making higher profits also pay more in tax to the government, which can be spent on public services.",
      "In addition to slow growth, prices are also rising faster than wanted.",
      "The current inflation rate of 3% is higher than the Bank of England's 2% target and is forecast to go higher.",
      "Inflation could affect whether interest rates are lowered further from 4.5% as the Bank moves rates in response to inflation.",
      "Higher rates mean higher borrowing costs for loans, credit cards and mortgage deals, but it also provides better returns on savings.",
      "Costs for businesses are expected to jump in April, when National Insurance contributions paid by employers rise. These could be passed on to consumers.",
      "UK government borrowing costs also remain higher than this time last year.",
      "Reeves has also warned that a potential global trade war, with the US imposing tariffs worldwide, would lower growth and raise inflation. In the UK, a 25% tariff has been placed on steel and aluminium products."

      "This is not the first time such a project has existed - the Public Sector Decarbonisation Scheme, launched under the previous Conservative government, has been running for more than four years and distributed close to \u00a33bn for green technologies.",
      "This project in the first instance will target less than 1% of schools.",

      "\"It is tough economic times, and to see this progress is a big step. [Whilst] acknowledging that 200 schools is a small starting point, to achieve this in one year is a good pace,\" she said.",
      "The announcement has been strongly welcomed by schools, unions and NHS estate managers who have previously warned of the pressure of high energy bills.",
      "In 2022, the National Association of Headteachers (NAHT) had said that a third of its leaders were predicting a budget deficit following a spike in energy costs.",
      "Paul Whiteman, NAHT general secretary, said schools wanted to install solar panels as they provided cheaper energy than paying for gas, but the upfront cost could often be prohibitive.",
      "\"This announcement is therefore welcome and a step in the right direction. In the longer term, this should also help schools manage energy bills, which have been a source of enormous financial pressure in recent years,\" he said.",
      "But the acting shadow energy secretary disagreed that the government's approach would save money.",
      "\"Labour's Net Zero zealotry is still set to make us poorer. The government is putting our very energy security at risk with their attacks on North Sea Oil and Gas - surrendering our energy independence to foreign powers like Russia,\" he said.",
      "However, energy experts have said that investing in renewable energy could reduce this reliance on imports.",
      "Jess Ralston, energy analyst at the think tank Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, said: \"This GB Energy funding is an investment into energy security as solar panels lower the amount of gas we need to import from people like Putin.\"",

      "Data leaked by a former employee reveals more than 800 records of these sites from 1989 to 2018, and indicates the company had failed to report about a fifth of them.",
      "The BBC has also obtained figures showing the company has spilled oil hundreds of times since then.",
      "Ecopetrol says it complies fully with Colombian law and has industry-leading practices on sustainability.",
      "The company's main refinery is in Barrancabermeja, 260km (162 miles) north of the Colombian capital Bogota.",
      "The huge cluster of processing plants, industrial chimneys and storage tanks stretches for close to 2km (1.2 miles) along the banks of Colombia's longest river, the Magdalena \u2013 a water source for millions of people.",
      "Members of the fishing community there believe oil pollution is affecting wildlife in the river.",

      "Ecopetrol, which is 88% owned by the Colombian state and listed on the New York Stock Exchange, rejects the fishers' claims that it is polluting the water.",
      "In response to the BBC's questions, it says it has efficient wastewater treatment systems and effective contingency plans for oil spills.",
      "Andr\u00e9s Olarte, the whistleblower who has shared the company's data, says pollution by the firm dates back many years.",
      "He joined Ecopetrol in 2017 and started working as an adviser to the CEO. He says he soon realised \"something was wrong\".",
      "Mr Olarte says he challenged managers about what he describes as \"awful\" pollution data, but was rebuffed with reactions such as: \"Why are you asking these questions? You're not getting what this job is about.\"",
      "He left the company in 2019, and shared a large amount of company data with US-based NGO the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) and later with the BBC. The BBC has verified it came from Ecopetrol's servers.",
      "One database he has shared, dated January 2019, contains a list of 839 so-called \"unresolved environmental impacts\" across Colombia.",
      "Ecopetrol uses this term to mean areas where oil is not fully cleaned up from soil and water. The data shows that, as of 2019, some of these sites had remained polluted in this way for over a decade.",
      "Mr Olarte alleges that the firm was trying to hide some of them from Colombian authorities, pointing to about a fifth of the records labelled \"only known to Ecopetrol\".",
      "\"You could see a category in the Excel where it lists which one is hidden from an authority and which one is not, which shows the process of hiding stuff from the government,\" says Mr Olarte.",
      "The BBC filmed at one of the sites marked \"only known to Ecopetrol\", which was dated 2017 in the database. Seven years later, a thick, black, oily-looking substance with plastic containment barriers around it was visible along the edge of a section of wetland.",
      "Ecopetrol's CEO from 2017 to 2023, Felipe Bay\u00f3n, told the BBC he strongly denied suggestions that there was any policy to withhold information about pollution.",

      "Colombia has a long history of armed conflict, and illegal armed groups have targeted oil facilities - but \"theft\" or \"attack\" are only mentioned for 6% of the cases listed in the database.",
      "He also said he believed there had been a \"significant advance\" since then in solving problems that lead to oil pollution.",
      "However, a separate set of data shows Ecopetrol has continued to pollute.",
      "Figures obtained by the BBC from Colombia's environmental regulator, the Autoridad Nacional de Licencias Ambientales (Anla), show Ecopetrol has reported hundreds of oil spills per year since 2020.",
      "Asked about the 2019 database of polluted sites, Ecopetrol admits it has records of 839 environmental incidents, but disputes that all of them were classed as \"unresolved\".",
      "The firm says 95% of polluted sites that have been classed as unresolved since 2018 have now been cleaned up.",
      "It says all pollution incidents are subject to a management process and are reported to the regulator.",
      "The data from the regulator includes hundreds of spills in the Barrancabermeja area where Ms Vel\u00e1squez and the fishers live.",
      "The fisherwoman and her colleagues have been monitoring biodiversity in the area's wetlands, which feed into the Magdalena River.",
      "She said there had been a \"massacre\" of fauna. \"This year, there were three dead manatees, five dead buffalo. We found more than 10 caimans. We found turtles, capybaras, birds, thousands of dead fish,\" she said last June.",
      "It is not clear what caused the deaths - the El Ni\u00f1o weather phenomenon and climate change may be factors.",
      "A 2022 study by the University of Nottingham lists pollution - from oil production and other industrial and domestic sources - as one factor among several, including climate change, that are degrading the Magdalena river basin.",
      "Mr Olarte left Ecopetrol in 2019. He moved to his family home near Barrancabermeja, and says he met with an old contact to ask about job openings. Soon afterwards, he says an anonymous caller rang his phone threatening to kill him.",
      "\"In the call I understood they thought I had put complaints against Ecopetrol, which was not the case,\" he says.",
      "Mr Olarte says more threats followed, including a note that he showed to the BBC. He does not know who made the threats and there is no evidence that Ecopetrol ordered them.",
      "Ms Vel\u00e1squez and seven other people also told the BBC they had received death threats after challenging Ecopetrol.",
      "She said an armed group had fired warning shots at her house and spray-painted the word \"leave\" on the wall.",
      "The fisherwoman is now protected by armed bodyguards paid for by the government, but the threats have continued.",
      "Asked about the threats Mr Olarte described, the former CEO Mr Bay\u00f3n said they were \"absolutely unacceptable\".",
      "\"I want to make it totally clear\u2026 that never, at any time, was there any order of that sort,\" Mr Bay\u00f3n said.",
      "Ms Vel\u00e1squez and Mr Olarte both know the risks are real. Colombia is the most dangerous country in the world for environmental defenders, according to the NGO Global Witness, with 79 killed in 2023.",
      "Experts say such killings are linked to Colombia's decades-long armed conflict, in which government forces and paramilitaries allied to them have fought left-wing rebel groups.",
      "Despite government attempts to end the conflict, armed groups and drug cartels remain active in parts of the country.",
      "Matthew Smith, an oil analyst and financial journalist based in Colombia, says he does not believe Ecopetrol managers are involved in threats by armed groups.",
      "But he says there is an \"immense\" overlap between former paramilitary groups and the private security sector.",
      "Private security firms often employ former members of paramilitary groups and compete for lucrative contracts to protect oil facilities, he says.",
      "Mr Olarte has shared internal Ecopetrol emails showing that in 2018, the company paid a total of $65m to more than 2,800 private security companies.",
      "\"There is always that risk of some sort of contagion between the private security companies, the types of people they employ, and their desire to continually maintain their contract,\" Mr Smith says.",
      "He says this could potentially even include kidnapping or murdering community leaders or environmental defenders in order to \"ensure that Ecopetrol's operations proceed smoothly\".",
      "Mr Bay\u00f3n said he was \"convinced that the checks and due diligence were done\" regarding the company's relationships with private security companies.",
      "Ecopetrol says it has never had relationships with illegal armed groups. It says it has a strong due diligence process and carries out human rights impact assessments for its activities.",
      "The BBC contacted other members of Ecopetrol's former leadership from the time of Mr Olarte's employment, who strongly deny the allegations in this report.",
      "Now living in Germany, Mr Olarte has been submitting complaints about Ecopetrol's environmental record to the Colombian authorities and the company itself - so far, without meaningful result.",
      "He has also been in a series of legal cases against Ecopetrol and its management, related to his employment there, which are as yet unresolved.",

    "summary": "New research could force a fundamental rethink of the nature of space and time.",
    "story": [
      "The mysterious force called Dark Energy, which drives the expansion of the Universe, might be changing in a way that challenges our current understanding of time and space, scientists have found.",
      "Some of them believe that they may be on the verge of one of the biggest discoveries in astronomy for a generation - one that could force a fundamental rethink.",
      "This early-stage finding is at odds with the current theory which was developed in part by Albert Einstein.",
      "More data is needed to confirm these results, but even some of the most cautious and respected researchers involved in the study, such as Prof Ofer Lahav, from University College London, are being swept up by the mounting evidence.",
      "\"It is a dramatic moment,\" he told BBC News.",
      "\"We may be witnessing a paradigm shift in our understanding of the Universe.\"",
      "The discovery of Dark Energy in 1998 was in itself shocking. Up until then the view had been that after the Big Bang, which created the Universe, its expansion would slow down under the force of gravity.",
      "But observations by US and Australian scientists found that it was actually speeding up. They had no idea what the force driving this was, so they gave it a name signifying their lack of understanding - Dark Energy.",
      "Although we don't know what Dark Energy is - it is one of the greatest mysteries in science - astronomers can measure it and whether it is changing by observing the acceleration of galaxies away from each other at different points in the history of the Universe.",
      "Several experiments were built to find answers, including the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) at the Kitt Peak National Observatory near Tucson Arizona. It consists of 5,000 optical fibres, each one of which is a robotically controlled telescope scanning galaxies at high speed.",
      "Last year, when DESI researchers found hints that the force exerted by dark energy had changed over time, many scientists thought that it was a blip in the data which would go away.",
      "Instead, a year on, that blip has grown.",
      "\"The evidence is stronger now than it was,\" said Prof Seshadri Nadathur at the University of Portsmouth",
      "\"We've also performed many additional tests compared to the first year, and they're making us confident that the results aren't driven by some unknown effect in the data that we haven't accounted for,\" he said.",
      "'Weird' results",
      "The data has not yet passed the threshold of being described as a discovery, but has led many astronomers, such as Scotland's Astronomer Royal, Prof Catherine Heymans, of Edinburgh University, to sit up and take notice.",
      "\"Dark Energy appears to be even weirder than we thought,\" she told BBC News.",
      "\"In 2024 the data was quite new, no-one was quite sure of it and people thought more work needed to be done.",
      "\"But now, there's more data, and a lot of scrutiny by the scientific community, so, while there is still a chance that the 'blip' may go away, there's also a possibility that we might be edging to a really big discovery.\"",
      "So what is causing the variation?",
      "\"No one knows!\" Prof Lahav admits, cheerfully.",
      "\"If this new result is correct, then we need to find the mechanism that causes the variation and that might mean a brand new theory, which makes this so exciting.\"",
      "DESI will continue to take more data over the next two years, with plans to measure roughly 50 million galaxies and other bright objects, in an effort to nail down whether their observations are unequivocally correct.",
      "\"We're in the business of letting the Universe tell us how it works, and maybe it is telling us it's more complicated than we thought it was,\" said Andrei Cuceu, a postdoctoral researcher at the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, in California.",
      "More details on the nature of Dark Energy will be obtained by the European Space Agency's (ESA) Euclid mission, a space telescope which will probe further than DESI and obtain even greater detail. It was launched in 2023 and ESA released the new images from the spacecraft today.",
      "The DESI collaboration involves more than 900 researchers from more than 70 institutions, around the world, including Durham, UCL and Portsmouth University from the UK."

      "In a further message seen by the BBC, the South African environment ministry said it was responding to the concerns with \"utmost urgency\".",
      "South Africa's Sunday Times, which was first to report the story, said members of the team had pleaded to be rescued.",

      "In a subsequent statement, the ministry added that it was \"not uncommon\" for individuals to have an initial adjustment when they arrive at extremely remote areas even if assessments showed no areas of concern.",
      "It said when the vessel departed for Antarctica on 1 February \"all was in order\", and the incident was first reported to the ministry on 27 February.",

    "story": [
      "Across the globe more and more Sports Utility Vehicles (SUVs) are being spotted on \u2013 and off \u2013 the roads.",
      "This is despite predictions from the United Nations of an inevitable pivot towards smaller and more environmentally friendly vehicles because of the urgency of the climate crisis and the rising cost of living.",
      "That pivot has not materialised: globally, 54% of the cars sold in 2024 were SUVs, including petrol, diesel, hybrids and electric makes. This is an increase of three percentage points from 2023 and five percentage points from the year before, according to GlobalData.",
      "Of the SUVs which are now on the road \u2013 both new and older models \u2013 95% are burning fossil fuels, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).",
      "Manufacturers, however, say their new fleets of such cars are increasingly becoming electric, and that not all SUVs now being sold cause an increase in emissions.",
      "SUVs are hard to miss. They are heavy and larger with spacious interiors, higher ground clearance and a high driving position with a better view of the road, although smaller versions are also on the market.",
      "Environmental campaigners such as Greenpeace see SUVs as one of the villains of the climate crisis and argue that their manufacturing consumes significant resources given their size.",
      "Experts also say they require larger batteries to power their electric versions, which then further increases the demand for critical minerals, putting even more pressure on the planet.",
      "Momentum was thought to be with smaller, energy-efficient electric vehicles. But the sales of standard-sized electric vehicles (EVs) has actually decreased in major markets such as Japan and Germany, and their sales growth has slowed in India.",
      "And in Europe, sales of SUVs have outpaced those of EVs despite indications more than half a decade ago of an opposite trend. In Europe in 2018, 3.27 million small hatchbacks \u2013 both those powered by fossil fuels and those by electricity \u2013 were sold while 2.13 million were sold in 2024, according to GlobalData.",
      "Its sales forecast manager Sammy Chan said: \"This is partly because of the SUV alternatives being offered in smaller [sizes] whose sales in Europe have now grown to nearly to 2.5 million in 2024 from 1.5 million in 2018.\"",
      "China saw the largest sales of nearly 11.6 million SUVs in 2024 followed by the US, India and Germany, according to GlobalData.",
      "What is driving this SUV growth?",
      "Industry experts say people's purchasing power has been improving in many fast-emerging economies, making SUVs the likelier choice of car.",
      "\"Manufacturers respond to consumer demand and, increasingly, drivers are attracted to dual purpose vehicles given their practicality, comfort and good view of the road,\" said Mike Hawes who is the chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).",
      "Automobile industry analysts also say that manufacturers are attracted to high profit margins from SUVs: they can make more money from SUVs even though they make fewer vehicles.",
      "\"It is the industry that has driven the demand through huge marketing and advertising campaigns in recent years,\" said Dudley Curtis, the communications manager at the European Transport Safety Council.",
      "\"SUVs offered the industry a simple way of charging more for a vehicle that does the same thing [as others],\" he said.",
      "Are SUVs an issue?",
      "Because of the robust growth in SUVs sales, the IEA says oil consumption of these  vehicles has increased by 600,000 barrels per day globally between 2022 and 2023, accounting for more than a quarter of the total annual rise in global oil demand.",
      "\"If ranked among countries, the global fleet of SUVs would be the world's fifth largest emitter of CO2, exceeding the emissions of Japan and various other major economies,\" said Apostolos Petropoulos, an energy modeller with the IEA.",
      "The agency says that even when compared to medium-sized cars that run on petrol and diesel, SUVs burn 20% more of such fuels as they weigh up to 300 kg more on average.",
      "In fact, road transport is responsible for more than 12% of global carbon emissions which is the main driver of global warming. Scientists say all sectors must rapidly decarbonise if we are to avoid a climate catastrophe.",
      "But industry representatives say in response that not all SUVs now being sold cause an increase in emissions.",
      "BMW delays electric Mini over 'uncertainty'",
      "Why don't Europeans buy more American cars?",
      "\"Around two in five of these [new] vehicle models are zero emission as their body type lends itself well to electrification with longer battery range that can reassure consumers concerned about charging accessibility,\" said Hawes, from the SMMT.",
      "\"This has led to the average CO2 emissions of new dual purpose cars more than halving since 2000, helping the segment lead the decarbonisation of UK road mobility.\"",
      "Although the vast majority of new SUVs still burn fossil fuels, IEA officials have said that over 20% of SUVs sold in 2023 were fully electric, up from 2% in 2018.",
      "As for hybrids that can run on both electricity and fossil fuels, a study in Europe by the International Council on Clean Transportation in 2022 found only around 30% of the total distance driven by plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (all types including SUVs) was in electric mode on average.",
      "Similar results were found in other major economies such as the US and China.",
      "Overall, the back-gear towards SUVs, some experts say, has caused a significant setback in the decarbonisation of the transport sector.",
      "\"The trend toward heavier and less efficient vehicles such as SUVs (in countries where it is happening) has largely nullified the improvements in energy consumption and emissions achieved elsewhere in the world's passenger car fleet,\" said the IEA.",
      "The UK Parliament's climate change committee had a similar finding in its 2024 report on decarbonisation in the country."

      "This project in the first instance will target less than 1% of schools.",
      "But Alex Green, head of Let's Go Zero - a national campaign to reduce the climate impact of schools - said it was a welcome first move.",
      "\"It is tough economic times, and to see this progress is a big step. [Whilst] acknowledging that 200 schools is a small starting point, to achieve this in one year is a good pace,\" she said.",
      "The announcement has been strongly welcomed by schools, unions and NHS estate managers who have previously warned of the pressure of high energy bills.",
      "In 2022, the National Association of Headteachers (NAHT) had said that a third of its leaders were predicting a budget deficit following a spike in energy costs.",
      "Paul Whiteman, NAHT general secretary, said schools wanted to install solar panels as they provided cheaper energy than paying for gas, but the upfront cost could often be prohibitive.",
      "\"This announcement is therefore welcome and a step in the right direction. In the longer term, this should also help schools manage energy bills, which have been a source of enormous financial pressure in recent years,\" he said.",

      "Jess Ralston, energy analyst at the think tank Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, said: \"This GB Energy funding is an investment into energy security as solar panels lower the amount of gas we need to import from people like Putin.\"",

      "The most recent research shows the total area of woodland across the whole of the UK is currently estimated to be 3.28m hectares.",
      "That represents 13% of the total land area of the UK but in England just 10% is woodland.",
      "Across the UK, the aim is for 30,000 hectares of woodland to be planted every year.",
      "The latest annual figures show about 21,000 hectares were planted, with the vast majority in Scotland and just 5,500 hectares in England.",
      "Andy Egan, head of conservation policy at the Woodland Trust, said there had been \"significant progress\" on tree planting but that there was still \"much more to do\" to meet the UK's targets.",
      "He said maintaining government funding was essential.",

      "\"A tough public spending environment could risk undoing much of the good work.\"",
      "Alex Stone, chief executive of the Forest of Avon Trust, which leads the partnership behind the Western Forest project, said there were some areas in the region that currently had only 7% of land covered by trees.",
      "\"This is about bringing those areas up so we have trees where we really need them,\" she said.",
      "\"What we are aiming to do with the Western Forest is get to 20% of canopy cover by 2050 and, in five priority areas, we are looking at getting above 30%.\"",
      "The scheme will particularly target urban areas, including Bristol, Swindon and Gloucester.",
      "The government said it would be putting \u00a37.5m of public money into the forest over the next five years.",
      "It said the project would not only help the UK's drive to net zero but would also promote economic growth and create jobs in the region.",
      "Mary Creagh, minister for nature, said she hoped the Western Forest would also \"make a huge difference\" to water quality, flood resilience and to wildlife as well as bringing nature \"closer to people\" in the region.",

      "The UK is legally committed to reaching net zero by 2050 under a law passed by former Tory Prime Minister Theresa May in 2019. It means the UK must cut carbon emissions until it removes as much as it produces, in line with the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement.",
      "In a speech, Badenoch said net zero cannot be achieved by 2050 \"without a serious drop in our living standards or by bankrupting us\".",

      "In her speech, Badenoch called lower energy costs and environmental protection \"noble aims\" but said current policies were \"largely failing\" to improve nature, while raising energy prices.",
      "She said: \"We're falling between two stools - too high costs and too little progress.",
      "\"Net zero by 2050 is impossible.",

      "But UK energy bills went up in January, and are expected to rise again in April.",

    "story": [
      "Across the globe more and more Sports Utility Vehicles (SUVs) are being spotted on \u2013 and off \u2013 the roads.",
      "This is despite predictions from the United Nations of an inevitable pivot towards smaller and more environmentally friendly vehicles because of the urgency of the climate crisis and the rising cost of living.",
      "That pivot has not materialised: globally, 54% of the cars sold in 2024 were SUVs, including petrol, diesel, hybrids and electric makes. This is an increase of three percentage points from 2023 and five percentage points from the year before, according to GlobalData.",
      "Of the SUVs which are now on the road \u2013 both new and older models \u2013 95% are burning fossil fuels, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).",
      "Manufacturers, however, say their new fleets of such cars are increasingly becoming electric, and that not all SUVs now being sold cause an increase in emissions.",
      "SUVs are hard to miss. They are heavy and larger with spacious interiors, higher ground clearance and a high driving position with a better view of the road, although smaller versions are also on the market.",
      "Environmental campaigners such as Greenpeace see SUVs as one of the villains of the climate crisis and argue that their manufacturing consumes significant resources given their size.",
      "Experts also say they require larger batteries to power their electric versions, which then further increases the demand for critical minerals, putting even more pressure on the planet.",
      "Momentum was thought to be with smaller, energy-efficient electric vehicles. But the sales of standard-sized electric vehicles (EVs) has actually decreased in major markets such as Japan and Germany, and their sales growth has slowed in India.",
      "And in Europe, sales of SUVs have outpaced those of EVs despite indications more than half a decade ago of an opposite trend. In Europe in 2018, 3.27 million small hatchbacks \u2013 both those powered by fossil fuels and those by electricity \u2013 were sold while 2.13 million were sold in 2024, according to GlobalData.",
      "Its sales forecast manager Sammy Chan said: \"This is partly because of the SUV alternatives being offered in smaller [sizes] whose sales in Europe have now grown to nearly to 2.5 million in 2024 from 1.5 million in 2018.\"",
      "China saw the largest sales of nearly 11.6 million SUVs in 2024 followed by the US, India and Germany, according to GlobalData.",
      "What is driving this SUV growth?",
      "Industry experts say people's purchasing power has been improving in many fast-emerging economies, making SUVs the likelier choice of car.",
      "\"Manufacturers respond to consumer demand and, increasingly, drivers are attracted to dual purpose vehicles given their practicality, comfort and good view of the road,\" said Mike Hawes who is the chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).",
      "Automobile industry analysts also say that manufacturers are attracted to high profit margins from SUVs: they can make more money from SUVs even though they make fewer vehicles.",
      "\"It is the industry that has driven the demand through huge marketing and advertising campaigns in recent years,\" said Dudley Curtis, the communications manager at the European Transport Safety Council.",
      "\"SUVs offered the industry a simple way of charging more for a vehicle that does the same thing [as others],\" he said.",
      "Are SUVs an issue?",
      "Because of the robust growth in SUVs sales, the IEA says oil consumption of these  vehicles has increased by 600,000 barrels per day globally between 2022 and 2023, accounting for more than a quarter of the total annual rise in global oil demand.",
      "\"If ranked among countries, the global fleet of SUVs would be the world's fifth largest emitter of CO2, exceeding the emissions of Japan and various other major economies,\" said Apostolos Petropoulos, an energy modeller with the IEA.",
      "The agency says that even when compared to medium-sized cars that run on petrol and diesel, SUVs burn 20% more of such fuels as they weigh up to 300 kg more on average.",
      "In fact, road transport is responsible for more than 12% of global carbon emissions which is the main driver of global warming. Scientists say all sectors must rapidly decarbonise if we are to avoid a climate catastrophe.",
      "But industry representatives say in response that not all SUVs now being sold cause an increase in emissions.",
      "BMW delays electric Mini over 'uncertainty'",
      "Why don't Europeans buy more American cars?",
      "\"Around two in five of these [new] vehicle models are zero emission as their body type lends itself well to electrification with longer battery range that can reassure consumers concerned about charging accessibility,\" said Hawes, from the SMMT.",
      "\"This has led to the average CO2 emissions of new dual purpose cars more than halving since 2000, helping the segment lead the decarbonisation of UK road mobility.\"",
      "Although the vast majority of new SUVs still burn fossil fuels, IEA officials have said that over 20% of SUVs sold in 2023 were fully electric, up from 2% in 2018.",
      "As for hybrids that can run on both electricity and fossil fuels, a study in Europe by the International Council on Clean Transportation in 2022 found only around 30% of the total distance driven by plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (all types including SUVs) was in electric mode on average.",
      "Similar results were found in other major economies such as the US and China.",
      "Overall, the back-gear towards SUVs, some experts say, has caused a significant setback in the decarbonisation of the transport sector.",
      "\"The trend toward heavier and less efficient vehicles such as SUVs (in countries where it is happening) has largely nullified the improvements in energy consumption and emissions achieved elsewhere in the world's passenger car fleet,\" said the IEA.",

      "The arrival of a replacement crew on Sunday was the final step needed for Butch and Suni's return \u2013 and after a short hand over with the new team, their mission is now at an end.",
      "The Nasa pair have embraced their longer than expected stay in space.",
      "They've carried out an array of experiments on board the orbiting lab and conducted spacewalks, with Suni breaking the record for the woman who's spent the most hours outside of the space station.",
      "And despite the astronauts being described as \"stranded\" they never really were.",
      "Throughout their mission there have always been spacecraft attached to the space station to get them - and the rest of those onboard - home if there was an emergency.",

      "Every Uber driver in the UK will be eligible for 20 hours of free childcare under a new scheme intended to get more women driving taxis.",
      "They will be able to use the allowance through a nannying and babysitting app for the rest of 2025.",
      "\"We really, really would like to attract more female drivers onto the Uber platform,\" said Uber UK General Manager Andrew Brem.",
      "But the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB), which represents drivers, said \"anyone can see through\" what it called a \"cynical PR stunt\".",
      "\"If Uber really wanted to support families, they would pay drivers enough money so that they could afford time off to be with their children,\" it told the BBC in a statement.",
      "\"Instead Uber's insultingly low fees force drivers to spend so long on the roads that in many cases relationships rupture and families are broken up,\" it added.",
      "Uber said it trialled free childcare with 1,000 drivers and had an overwhelmingly positive response - with 96% of those who took part saying it made it easier to take on work.",
      "Now, the scheme will be extended to the more than 100,000 Uber drivers in the UK.",
      "\"Like some other occupations, [Uber driving] happens to be predominantly male - that's not something that we'd like,\" Mr Brem told BBC News.",
      "He expects the free childcare to initially be used by existing drivers rather than new ones, \"but it's more, I think, to get drivers into the habit of doing this.\"",
      "He adds: \"By testing it at no cost, you have the experience, and you see the ease of getting childcare through this particular route.\"",
      "Uber UK will keep the scheme open for the rest of the year and then \"see how it goes,\" in terms of extending it further, Mr Brem said.",
      "The firm will hope the move may help assuage drivers who have taken strike action in recent months over what they say is unfair pay.",
      "In October, Uber drivers in Glasgow told the BBC their wages had fallen in 2024, despite price increases being passed on to customers.",
      "Then in January, striking drivers said they were working \"too many hours\" despite having families at home.",
      "\"I haven't yet come across an employee survey, including our own, where people don't say that they want to earn more,\" said Mr Brem.",
      "\"I do understand that our main role in helping them more, though, is to is to keep the platform super busy, so our focus is on actually growth of demand,\" he said.",
      "Mr Brem said drivers could now see a weekly breakdown of how much money they earned compared to how much of the fare Uber takes.",
      "He added that, coming out of lockdowns, there was a period of \"unusually higher earnings\" for drivers, as demand outstripped supply of available rides.",
      "\"We're more in a sort of normal situation now, but that probably affects some of the experiences that [drivers] have had,\" he says.",
      "Uber has also highlighted the experience of one mother of three who participated in its childcare pilot and said it had been a \"massive boost\".",
      "Tania Naseer said she used the childcare during work and also to go out with friends.",
      "\"As a mother, it's important for me to have my own batteries charged in order to be there for my children,\" she told BBC News.",
      "\"Now, I can hire a sitter for the weekend and then I can work the weekend, and they are the busiest hours.\"",
      "She added: \"Ideally, yes, a pay rise would be great, but right now it seems to be working how it is.\"",
      "The childcare will be offered through a babysitting and nannying app called Bubble, which matches parents with childminders.",
      "Drivers can use the free hours whenever they want, not just when they are working for Uber.",

      "This filter appeared on my TikTok \"For You\" page the other day despite me not engaging with any weight-related or health content.",

    "published": "Thu, 20 Mar 2025 22:51:08 GMT",
    "summary": "The chatbot has become an \"unfiltered and unhinged\" digital sensation in India.",
    "story": [
      "It all started with one question.",
      "A query last week from an X (formerly Twitter) account called Toka was enough to propel Elon Musk's built in-chatbot called Grok 3 into a viral storm across India's digital landscape.",
      "And no, it wasn't some complex math equation or a philosophical debate.",
      "Instead, it was a simple ask: \"List my 10 best mutuals on X.\" Mutuals are people who follow and engage with each other's posts.",
      "When Grok took a moment to respond, Toka, clearly frustrated, let loose some colourful language.",
      "The chatbot shot back. It dropped a list of 10 mutuals but threw in some misogynistic insults in Hindi too.",
      "Later, Grok shrugged it off, saying, \"I was just having fun, but lost control.\" The response grabbed two million views and other X users quickly followed suit, provoking the chatbot.",
      "And just like that, the floodgates opened. Indians bombarded Grok with everything \u2013 cricket gossip, political rants, Bollywood drama \u2013 and the bot took it all on, unapologetically and with some style. The chatbot has just recently become an \"unfiltered and unhinged\" digital sensation in India, as many are calling it. Just last year, Musk dubbed it the \"most fun AI in the world!\".",
      "Even law enforcement joined the fun. The Delhi police Twitter account cheekily asked Grok if it had ever received a traffic ticket.",
      "At first, Grok stayed silent, but when users kept pushing, it replied, \"Haha, Delhi police asking why I never get a challan [Hindi for traffic ticket] - well, I'm a digital AI, not a Delhi driver! I don't roll through red lights or forget my helmet. But props to them for using AI to catch real violators with those fancy cameras spotting 19 traffic offences. Keep the roads safe!\".",
      "Before its launch two years ago, Musk had promised an edgy, unfiltered, 'anti-woke' AI chatbot unlike competitors like OpenAI, Microsoft and Google's models. Much of Grok's snarky tone is drawn from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, iconic for blending wit with sci-fi absurdity.",
      "\"Grok has been around for a while. It is suddenly popular now with Indians because it's the new toy in town,\" says Pratik Sinha, founder of Alt News, a leading fact-checker in India.",
      "But then, something more interesting happened. The chatbot quickly became a favourite among critics of Narendra Modi's governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).",
      "A tsunami of  political questions followed. Grok quickly declared main opposition Congress party leader Rahul Gandhi more honest than Modi, adding \"I am not afraid of anyone\". It claimed Gandhi had got the \"edge on formal education than Modi\". The chatbot even said that Modi's interviews \"often seemed scripted\".",
      "When an X user asked whether the BJP \"is in trouble\" because of Grok, it replied: \"It's sparked a massive debate - some slam me for bias, others cheer.\"  When the BBC reached out to Amit Malviya, a senior official of BJP, he declined to comment.",
      "Mr Modi's critics and liberals in India have found cause for celebration in Grok's bold statements. Many believe free speech in India is under siege, with organisations like Human Rights Watch highlighting its suppression. A recent report from the Vanderbilt-based think-tank, Future of Free Speech, ranked India 24th out of 33 countries in supporting free speech. Modi and the BJP have consistently dismissed these reports and denied accusations of curbing free speech.",
      "\"Grok is a new rebel. Asking Grok questions will not put anyone in trouble. The right-wing has also responded by asking questions about Rahul Gandhi. And then it has become a competitive thing. This is not surprising at all,\" says Mr Sinha of Alt News.",
      "\"Other AI bots are programmed to give politically correct answers to questions like 'Who's better, Congress or BJP?'. Grok, however, seems to lack that filter and appears unafraid to tackle controversial issues head-on,\" he adds.",
      "Nikhil Pahwa, the founder-editor of MediaNama.com, a technology policy website, believes that the \"discourse around Grok's statements in India is overblown\".",
      "\"At its core, AI is fundamentally 'garbage in, garbage out' - its outputs reflect the data it is trained on, and the weights given to it,\" he says.",
      "\"Since Grok is trained on the entirety of X, it naturally mirrors the tone and patterns of discourse found there, including the bizarre responses and the abusing we are seeing.",
      "\"This isn't about ideology; it's about the nature of the input shaping the output,\" he adds.",
      "When the BBC asked Grok who spreads the most disinformation on X, it responded on Thursday: \"Musk is a strong contender, given his reach and recent sentiment on X, but I can't crown him just yet.\"",
      "Joyojeet Pal, who studies political use of social media at the University of Michigan, says unlike a politician or celebrity with a set ideology, a chatbot is only partisan if explicitly trained to be or if its data overwhelmingly supports a particular view. If a chatbot leans too partisan, it risks losing its competitive edge.",
      "\"In Grok's particular case, this is tickling liberals because the most dominant voices on the platform [X] lean right and are dismissive of liberal arguments. But the larger data it trains on is likely to present a more balanced view of the world, often explicitly at odds with what its loudest voices are saying,\" he said.",
      "India's IT ministry is already in touch with X regarding Grok's use of inappropriate language  and \"controversial responses\", according to reports.",
      "While some view this as a passing phase, with Mr Sinha predicting that \"people will soon get bored of it and all this will be short lived\", Grok's unfiltered nature hints it might be here to stay. At least for the time being.",

      "The diver had found the fibre optic cable lying on the seabed of the North Sea. He swam closer, until it was near enough to touch.",
      "He reached out his hand. But someone could tell he was lurking there. Someone was watching.",
      "\"He stops and just touches the cable lightly, you clearly see the signal,\" says Daniel Gerwig, global sales manager at AP Sensing, a German technology company. \"The acoustic energy which travels through the fibre is basically disturbing our signal. We can measure this disturbance.\"",
      "Multiple reports of damaged telecommunications cables in the Baltic Sea have raised alarm in recent months.",
      "So important are these cables, which carry huge volumes of internet data between countries, that Nato has launched a mission called \"Baltic Sentry\", to patrol the Baltic Sea with aircraft, warships and drones.",
      "The EU is also stepping up measures to monitor and protect cables.",
      "Despite those efforts the authorities cannot be everywhere at once.",
      "So, some companies are trying to monitor what's going on in the vicinity of any cable \u2013 by using fibre optic signals to listen out for surreptitious underwater drones, or hostile vessels dragging their anchors along the seabed.",
      "It was during tests of AP Sensing's system last year \u2013 not a real attempt at sabotage \u2013 that the diver patted his hand on the subsea cable watched over by the firm.",
      "The company also deployed ships, drones and divers with sea scooters to find out how accurately its software could pick out and identify the presence of these vehicles.",
      "And, the team tested whether their cable could \"hear\" a vessel plunging its anchor into the water.",
      "When pulses of light travel along a fibre optic strand, tiny reflections sometimes bounce back along that line. These reflections are affected by factors including temperature, vibrations or physical disturbance to the cable itself.",
      "Noticing a temperature change along part of a buried cable could reveal that part has become unburied, for example.",
      "AP Sensing shows me a video of a man walking across a lawn before lifting up a rifle and firing it during a test. A fibre optic cable buried in the ground a few metres away picked up the whole sequence.",

That could be correlated with satellite imagery, or even automatic identification system (AIS) records, which most ships broadcast at all times.",
      "It is possible to add monitoring capabilities to existing fibre optic cables if one unused, \"dark\" fibre is available, or a lit fibre with enough free channels, the firm adds.",
      "There are limitations, however. David Webb at Aston University says that fibre optic sensing technology cannot pick up disturbances from very far away, and you need to install signal listening devices, or interrogators, every 100km (62 miles) or so along a cable.",
      "AP Sensing says that it can pick up vibrations hundreds of metres away but \"usually not several kilometres away\". The company confirms that its technology is currently deployed on some cable installations in the North Sea, though declines to comment further.",
      "\"People really need an early warning in order to determine what to do,\" says Paul Heiden, chief executive of Optics11, a Dutch firm that also makes fibre optic acoustic sensing systems.",
      "Mr Heiden argues that cables installed solely for the purpose of monitoring marine activity could be especially useful \u2013 one might place such listening cables, say, 100km from a vital port, or in the vicinity of a key gas pipeline or telecommunications cable, rather than within those assets themselves.",
      "That could give operators an overview of vessel traffic in the area, and potentially advance notice of a ship heading towards a critical asset.",
      "Optics11's fibre optic listening technology can be deployed on military submarines, Mr Heiden adds, and he says the firm is soon to begin testing a monitoring cable installed somewhere on the floor of the Baltic Sea.",
      "Demand for fibre optic sensing technology is growing, says Douglas Clague at Viavi Solutions, a network testing and measurement company: \"We do see the number of requests increasing.\"",
      "Some of the cables damaged in recent incidents were made by Swedish cable company Hexatronic, says Christian Priess, head of Central Europe, Middle East, Africa and submarine cable business at the firm.",
      "Acoustic sensing is an emerging technology that Mr Priess suggests will become more common in the future. But there's relatively little one can do to protect a cable from sabotage, in terms of physical strengthening.",
      "Today's fibre optic cables already have metal casings folded and welded shut around the fibres, he says. There is also \"armoury wire\", thick metal cords, running along the outer parts of the cable and in some cases there are two layers of these cords. \"On the UK side of the Channel where you have a lot of rocks and a lot of fishing, you want to have it double-armoured,\" says Mr Priess.",
      "But should a vessel deliberately drag its heavy anchor across even a double-armoured cable, it will almost certainly still damage it, Mr Priess says \u2013 such is the force of the collision or pulling action.",
      "While it is possible to bury cables in the seabed for additional protection, this might become prohibitively expensive over long distances and at depths below a few dozen metres.",
      "\"Cables break all the time,\" says Lane Burdette, research analyst at TeleGeography, a telecoms market research firm. \"The number of cable faults per year has really held steady over the last several years,\" she adds, explaining that the 1-200 faults that typically occur annually has not risen despite ever more subsea cables being installed during that period.",
      "Ms Burdette also notes that, even when a cable is severed, telecommunications networks typically have significant redundancy built into them, meaning that end users often don't notice much disruption to their service.",
      "Still, the visible military response to cable breakages in the Baltic Sea is welcome, says Thorsten Benner, co-founder and director of the Global Public Policy Institute, a think tank: \"It's good that Nato and the European Union have woken up.\"",
      "And while cable sensing technology might be useful, its efficacy in terms of preventing damage rests on how quickly coastguard or military patrols could receive alerts about potential sabotage and react. \"The question is how quickly you could establish contact with a vessel,\" Says Benner.",

    "title": "Why Elon Musk's Grok is kicking up a storm in India",
    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd65p1pv8pdo",
    "published": "Thu, 20 Mar 2025 22:51:08 GMT",
    "summary": "The chatbot has become an \"unfiltered and unhinged\" digital sensation in India.",
    "story": [
      "It all started with one question.",
      "A query last week from an X (formerly Twitter) account called Toka was enough to propel Elon Musk's built in-chatbot called Grok 3 into a viral storm across India's digital landscape.",
      "And no, it wasn't some complex math equation or a philosophical debate.",
      "Instead, it was a simple ask: \"List my 10 best mutuals on X.\" Mutuals are people who follow and engage with each other's posts.",
      "When Grok took a moment to respond, Toka, clearly frustrated, let loose some colourful language.",
      "The chatbot shot back. It dropped a list of 10 mutuals but threw in some misogynistic insults in Hindi too.",
      "Later, Grok shrugged it off, saying, \"I was just having fun, but lost control.\" The response grabbed two million views and other X users quickly followed suit, provoking the chatbot.",
      "And just like that, the floodgates opened. Indians bombarded Grok with everything \u2013 cricket gossip, political rants, Bollywood drama \u2013 and the bot took it all on, unapologetically and with some style. The chatbot has just recently become an \"unfiltered and unhinged\" digital sensation in India, as many are calling it. Just last year, Musk dubbed it the \"most fun AI in the world!\".",
      "Even law enforcement joined the fun. The Delhi police Twitter account cheekily asked Grok if it had ever received a traffic ticket.",
      "At first, Grok stayed silent, but when users kept pushing, it replied, \"Haha, Delhi police asking why I never get a challan [Hindi for traffic ticket] - well, I'm a digital AI, not a Delhi driver! I don't roll through red lights or forget my helmet. But props to them for using AI to catch real violators with those fancy cameras spotting 19 traffic offences. Keep the roads safe!\".",
      "Before its launch two years ago, Musk had promised an edgy, unfiltered, 'anti-woke' AI chatbot unlike competitors like OpenAI, Microsoft and Google's models. Much of Grok's snarky tone is drawn from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, iconic for blending wit with sci-fi absurdity.",
      "\"Grok has been around for a while. It is suddenly popular now with Indians because it's the new toy in town,\" says Pratik Sinha, founder of Alt News, a leading fact-checker in India.",
      "But then, something more interesting happened. The chatbot quickly became a favourite among critics of Narendra Modi's governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).",
      "A tsunami of  political questions followed. Grok quickly declared main opposition Congress party leader Rahul Gandhi more honest than Modi, adding \"I am not afraid of anyone\". It claimed Gandhi had got the \"edge on formal education than Modi\". The chatbot even said that Modi's interviews \"often seemed scripted\".",
      "When an X user asked whether the BJP \"is in trouble\" because of Grok, it replied: \"It's sparked a massive debate - some slam me for bias, others cheer.\"  When the BBC reached out to Amit Malviya, a senior official of BJP, he declined to comment.",
      "Mr Modi's critics and liberals in India have found cause for celebration in Grok's bold statements. Many believe free speech in India is under siege, with organisations like Human Rights Watch highlighting its suppression. A recent report from the Vanderbilt-based think-tank, Future of Free Speech, ranked India 24th out of 33 countries in supporting free speech. Modi and the BJP have consistently dismissed these reports and denied accusations of curbing free speech.",
      "\"Grok is a new rebel. Asking Grok questions will not put anyone in trouble. The right-wing has also responded by asking questions about Rahul Gandhi. And then it has become a competitive thing. This is not surprising at all,\" says Mr Sinha of Alt News.",
      "\"Other AI bots are programmed to give politically correct answers to questions like 'Who's better, Congress or BJP?'. Grok, however, seems to lack that filter and appears unafraid to tackle controversial issues head-on,\" he adds.",
      "Nikhil Pahwa, the founder-editor of MediaNama.com, a technology policy website, believes that the \"discourse around Grok's statements in India is overblown\".",
      "\"At its core, AI is fundamentally 'garbage in, garbage out' - its outputs reflect the data it is trained on, and the weights given to it,\" he says.",
      "\"Since Grok is trained on the entirety of X, it naturally mirrors the tone and patterns of discourse found there, including the bizarre responses and the abusing we are seeing.",
      "\"This isn't about ideology; it's about the nature of the input shaping the output,\" he adds.",
      "When the BBC asked Grok who spreads the most disinformation on X, it responded on Thursday: \"Musk is a strong contender, given his reach and recent sentiment on X, but I can't crown him just yet.\"",
      "Joyojeet Pal, who studies political use of social media at the University of Michigan, says unlike a politician or celebrity with a set ideology, a chatbot is only partisan if explicitly trained to be or if its data overwhelmingly supports a particular view. If a chatbot leans too partisan, it risks losing its competitive edge.",
      "\"In Grok's particular case, this is tickling liberals because the most dominant voices on the platform [X] lean right and are dismissive of liberal arguments. But the larger data it trains on is likely to present a more balanced view of the world, often explicitly at odds with what its loudest voices are saying,\" he said.",
      "India's IT ministry is already in touch with X regarding Grok's use of inappropriate language  and \"controversial responses\", according to reports.",
      "While some view this as a passing phase, with Mr Sinha predicting that \"people will soon get bored of it and all this will be short lived\", Grok's unfiltered nature hints it might be here to stay. At least for the time being.",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly676jp291o",
    "published": "Thu, 20 Mar 2025 11:19:51 GMT",
    "summary": "Experts praised a move towards transparency, but there are no major revelations in the documents - and some still have yet to be released.",
    "story": [
      "Enthusiasts are poring over thousands of newly released documents related to the investigation into President John F Kennedy's assassination.",
      "As many experts expected, this latest release by the Trump administration does not answer all lingering questions about one of the US's historic turning points - the 1963 killing of Kennedy in Dallas, Texas.",
      "But the latest batch does include documents that are now mostly or fully unredacted. They reveal further how much the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) observed JFK's killer before the shooting.",
      "A US government investigation in the 1960s concluded that Lee Harvey Oswald, a drifter and former US Marine who at one point defected to the then-Soviet Union, acted alone when he shot at Kennedy's motorcade from a nearby building.",
      "However, the case still prompts questions, along with wild conspiracy theories, more than 60 years later - and the latest release is unlikely to change that. Here are some key takeaways.",
      "JFK experts scour newly unsealed assassination files",
      "JFK experts scour newly unsealed assassination files",
      "1. More on Oswald - but no bombshells",
      "The documents further shed light on the CIA's strong surveillance of Oswald, said Jefferson Morley, a former Washington Post reporter and editor of the JFK Facts blog.",
      "\"He's a subject of deep interest to the CIA\" long before the assassination, and the extent of this has only become clear in the last few years, Mr Morley said.",
      "Many of the new documents have been released before - but now more complete versions are available. Although specialists are still combing through, no earth-shattering stories have surfaced.",
      "Still, Mr Morley calls it \"the most exciting news around JFK records since the 1990s\".",
      "\"Several very important documents have come into public view,\" he said.",
      "Experts have therefore praised the release as a step forward for transparency. In the past, hundreds of thousands of documents were made available but were partially redacted. Others were held back, with officials citing national security concerns.",
      "Philip Shenon, who wrote a 2013 book about the assassination, told the Associated Press that previously released documents described a trip Oswald took to Mexico City in September 1963, months before the assassination.",
      "The CIA was monitoring him at that time, he said, according to the AP.  \"There's reason to believe he talked openly about killing Kennedy in Mexico City and that people overheard him say that.\"",
      "In a previously released April 1975 memo, the CIA downplayed what it knew about Oswald's trip to Mexico City, the AP reported. The CIA recorded three phone calls between Oswald and a guard at the Soviet embassy, it said, but Oswald only identified himself in one.",
      "2. Intelligence methods revealed",
      "A number of the documents shed light on Kennedy's relationship with the CIA before his death and on intelligence-gathering techniques - giving a window into Cold War operations.",
      "A newly unredacted memo reveals a more complete version of a note written by Kennedy aide Arthur Schlesinger.",
      "Critical of the CIA and its role in shaping foreign policy, the note shows the agency's  huge presence in US embassies, even in allied countries such as France.",
      "In it, Schlesinger warns Kennedy about the agency's influence on American foreign policy. Though not directly related to the assassination, the memo details the rocky relationship between the president and intelligence agencies.",
      "The CIA is traditionally opposed to releasing operational or budget information, said David Barrett, a Villanova University professor and expert on the CIA and presidential power.",
      "\"It's a very good thing for the government to release these documents even if there still may be some redactions,\" he said.",
      "One document details the use of fluoroscopic scanning - using X-rays to show images of the inside of an object.",
      "The technique was developed to detect hidden microphones possibly used to bug CIA offices.",
      "In another document, the CIA describes a system to secretly tag and identify public phone boxes that are tapped, using a paint only visible under ultraviolet light.",
      "The memo is also notable for one of the names in it - James McCord, who would later gain infamy as one of the men who burgled the Watergate complex. The break-in kicked off the unravelling of the scandal that toppled President Richard Nixon.",
      "3. Old theories resurrected",
      "Some well-known online accounts claimed that the recent documents reveal new details about long-alleged plots against Kennedy - even though some of the supposed revelations have been public for years.",
      "They includes several viral posts about Gary Underhill - a World War Two military intelligence agent.",
      "Mr Underhill reportedly claimed that a cabal of CIA agents was behind the assassination, a theory openly published in Ramparts, a left-wing magazine, in 1967. Mr Underhill's death in 1964 was ruled a suicide, but the magazine cast doubt on that as well.",
      "Photos of a seven-page memo regarding Mr Underhill went viral on Tuesday - but the bulk of it is not new. His story has long been discussed online and the CIA memo mentioning it was first released in 2017.",
      "Just a few sentences on one page of the memo were newly unredacted in the latest release.",
      "And crucially the theory is based on a second-hand account published after Mr Underhill's death and includes no hard evidence.",
      "However, the story was just one of a number of unsubstantiated theories circulating following the release of the files.",
      "4. Are the files completely unredacted?",
      "A 1992 law required all of the documents related to the assassination to be released within 25 years - but that law also included national security exceptions.",
      "The push for greater transparency has led to more releases over time - both President Trump in his first term and President Biden, as recently as 2023, released batches of documents.",
      "Ahead of the new release, President Trump said that he asked his staff \"not to redact anything\" from them.",
      "That doesn't appear to be entirely the case - the new documents still have some redactions. However, experts were largely in agreement that the latest release was a step forward for transparency.",
      "JFK Files journalist Morley said there are further documents in the National Archives yet to be released, and others held by the CIA and FBI that have not yet been accounted for.",
      "Even though there could be more releases to come - as well as promised drops about the killings of Robert F Kennedy Sr and Martin Luther King Jr - the questions around the JFK assassination will almost certainly continue.",
      "\"Whenever there is an assassination there will be debates and to some degree there will be conspiracy theories,\" said Barrett, the Villanova historian. \"That's not going to change because of these or any other documents.\"",

      "\"This has been our family car for three years, and it has been an absolute dream,\" says Ben Kilbey as he shows me his gleaming pearl-white Tesla Model Y.",
      "Ben is a staunch electric car advocate. He runs a communications firm that promotes sustainable businesses in the UK. Yet now, he says, the Model Y has to go \u2013 because he disapproves vehemently of Tesla CEO Elon Musk's actions, especially the way he has handled firing US government employees.",
      "\"I'm not a fan of polarisation, or of doing things without kindness,\" he says. \"There are ways of doing things that don't ostracise people or belittle them. I don't like belittlement.\"",
      "Ben is part of a wider backlash against the Tesla boss that appears to have been gathering momentum in recent weeks, since Musk was appointed head of the controversial Department for Government Efficiency (DOGE), charged with taking an axe to federal government spending.",
      "Musk has also intervened in politics abroad, making a video appearance at a rally for the far-right party Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland ahead of Germany's parliamentary election, as well as launching online attacks on British politicians, including Prime Minister Keir Starmer.",
      "For some who do not share his views, it has all become too much.",
      "There have been protests outside dozens of Tesla dealerships, not only in the US, but also in Canada, the UK, Germany and Portugal.",
      "Although most of them have been peaceful, there have been cases of showrooms, charging stations and vehicles being vandalised. In separate incidents in France and Germany, several cars were set on fire.",
      "In the US, the Tesla Cybertruck, an angular metallic pickup truck, appears to have become a particular magnet for anti-Musk sentiment. A number of social media videos have shown vehicles daubed with swastikas, covered with rubbish or used as skateboard ramps.",
      "US President Donald Trump was quick to show his support to Tesla, by allowing the company to show off its vehicles outside the White House, and pledging to buy one. He said violence against US showrooms should be treated as \"domestic terrorism\".",
      "Musk has also been unequivocal in his response. \"This level of violence is insane and deeply wrong,\" he said in a recent interview with Fox News. \"Tesla just makes electric cars and has done nothing to deserve these evil attacks.\"",
      "What is hard to quantify is exactly how much impact all this has had on Tesla as a business - and the extent to which Musk's views and involvement in the Trump administration has affected the brand and alienated some traditional electric vehicle buyers.",
      "And if that is the case, can Tesla really build on its past success with Musk remaining at the helm?",
      "A larger-than-life figurehead",
      "Two decades ago, Tesla was a tiny Silicon Valley start-up, with a handful of employees and big dreams of revolutionising the motor industry. Today it is the best-selling producer of electric vehicles in a growing global market, with giant factories around the world. It is also widely credited with having proven that EVs could be fast, powerful, fun and practical.",
      "Musk, the figurehead of the company, has driven this all forward, since he joined Tesla in 2004 as its chairman and principal funder. He became chief executive four years later, and has held that role throughout the company's rise to prominence.",
      "\"Tesla was the pioneer,\" says Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights at car sector marketing and software firm Cox Automotive. \"They kind of got EVs into the mainstream, got other manufacturers to start investing, and really created a lot of awareness.\"",
      "It is easy to forget that electric cars were once derided as slow, uninspiring and impractical, with minimal range between charges. The Tesla Model S, which went on sale in 2012, had sports car performance and a range of more than 250 miles. It played a key role in changing perceptions, and provided a springboard for rapid growth.",
      "Nowadays, Tesla is not just a producer of electric vehicles. It has invested heavily in autonomous driving systems, with the goal of building fleets of driverless \"robotaxis\". It also has a fast-growing energy-storage business, and is developing a general-purpose humanoid robot, known as Optimus.",
      "Like the late Steve Jobs at Apple, Musk became the embodiment of his brand, ever present as the front man at company events and product launches, with a devoted following among EV enthusiasts.",
      "But recently the champion of sustainable technology has become equally well known for promoting his political views, amplifying them through his own social network, X. At the same time, Tesla itself has been facing mounting challenges.",
      "'Musk's activities have indeed harmed Tesla'",
      "Although its Model Y was the best-selling car worldwide last year, overall sales fell for the first time in more than a decade, dropping from 1.81 million to 1.79 million.",
      "The decline was relatively small, and Tesla retained its position as the world's best-selling maker of electric vehicles, but for a growth-focused business, it raised alarm bells. Profits for the year were also down.",
      "This year has also begun badly, notably in Europe, where there was a 45% fall in new registrations in January compared to the same month in 2024. There were further falls in major European markets in February \u2013 although the UK was an outlier, with sales rising 21% \u2013 as well as in Australia.",
      "Meanwhile, shipments of Tesla's Chinese-made cars, which are produced for sale both in China and abroad, fell more than 49% in the same month.",
      "In early March, Joseph Spak, Wall Street analyst at Swiss bank UBS, published a research note in which he predicted a decline in Tesla's worldwide sales this year of 5%. That forecast, which countered market expectations of 10% growth, helped to send Tesla's share price tumbling. It fell 15% in a single day \u2013 adding to an overall decline of 40% since the start of the year.",
      "Sales can fall for many reasons, and people within Tesla have suggested that a drop in sales was to be expected as the company geared up for the launch of the new Model Y \u2013 with potential customers holding off for the latest version. But research by brand monitoring firm Morning Consult Intelligence suggests Musk's activities have indeed harmed Tesla, particularly in the EU and Canada \u2013 although not in China, which remains one of its biggest markets.",
      "In the US, it says, the situation is more nuanced, with many consumers approving of DOGE cuts in government spending. However it adds: \"Musk may be turning off those US consumers most likely to buy a Tesla. Among high-income consumers who say they plan to purchase an EV in the future, Tesla now ranks lower compared with competitors than it did one year ago.\"",
      "Tesla did not respond to the BBC's questions concerning its fall in sales.",
      "But experts believe Tesla's problems run deeper than simply questions about the public image of the CEO.",
      "'Dated' models and overseas competition",
      "To start with, the current model range, which was once cutting edge, now looks uninspiring. The once ground-breaking Model S has been on sale since 2012, the Model X since 2015. Even the more recent and more affordable Model 3 and Model Y are beginning to look dated in an increasingly competitive market.",
      "\"If you look at their product line-up, they haven't had any fresh models recently, except for the Cybertruck, which is really niche,\" says Ms Valdez Streaty. \"They've had a refresh of the Model Y, but it's not a big splash. And there's so much more competition out there.\"",
      "Prof Peter Wells, director of Cardiff University's Centre for Automotive Industry Research, makes a similar point: \"We've not seen the level of innovation in terms of the product range that perhaps Elon Musk should have been looking for. I think that is a big part of their problem.\"",
      "Competition comes from a number of directions. Traditional manufacturers have invested huge sums in moving towards EV production, with the likes of Korea's Kia and Hyundai building a growing reputation for making good quality battery-powered cars.",
      "At the same time, an array of new EV brands has emerged from China. They include the likes of BYD, which has expanded rapidly by supplying cars with good performance at low prices, as well as the more upmarket Xpeng and Nio, which have focused on luxury and advanced technology.",
      "\"China has amazing incentives and subsidies for EVs,\" says Ms Valdez Streaty.",
      "\"You can see how Chinese firms, especially BYD, continue to grow not only in China but in other parts of the world. So that definitely is a huge threat, not just for Tesla but for other manufacturers as well.\"",
      "The extent of that threat was demonstrated in mid-March, when BYD announced it had developed an ultra-fast charging system that would provide a car with 250 miles of range in just five minutes \u2013 significantly faster than Tesla's own supercharger network.",
      "The question of robotaxis",
      "Musk's comments during Tesla's earnings calls suggests his priorities lie elsewhere, particularly in driverless vehicles.",
      "In January, he claimed Tesla would have a robotaxi service operating in Texas by June. But this attracted a cynical response from some commentators who pointed out that Musk has been promising this kind of thing for a long time.",
      "In 2019, for example, he said that within a year there would be a million Teslas on the road capable of acting as robotaxis. Meanwhile Tesla's \"Full Self Driving\" package, available to Tesla buyers, remains a \"hands-on\" system that requires the driver to be paying attention at all times.",
      "\"Every year we get a new promise from Elon Musk about how his autonomous cars are just around the corner. The trouble is, they never seem to be able to find the corner to emerge from,\" says Jay Nagley of automotive consultancy Redspy.",
      "Is Musk spinning too many plates?",
      "Arguably, Tesla needs strong leadership right now. But regardless of his politics, the chief executive is spinning a large number of plates. He owns or runs an array of other businesses, notably his social media platform X; the artificial intelligence firm xAI; and the private space firm SpaceX, which has experienced failures on the last two launches of its giant Starship rocket.",
      "Asked in a recent interview with Fox Business how he was combining all of this with his new government role, Musk responded \"with great difficulty\".",
      "\"It's hard to tell exactly how much Tesla is hands-on managed nowadays by Musk,\" says Prof Wells.",
      "\"If he's making the key decisions over things like product placing and where factories are built and so forth, then those decisions have to be correct. And I think you need someone with a hands-on, 100% commitment to understanding the automotive industry, and making those decisions correctly.\"",
      "Ever since he joined Tesla in 2004, Elon Musk's position has been unassailable. There is no obvious sign at the moment of that changing. He remains the company's largest single shareholder, with a 13% stake \u2013 currently worth more than $95bn.",
      "That is more or less matched by the combined holdings of investment giants Vanguard and Blackrock, while a number of other financial institutions including State Street Bank and Morgan Stanley hold smaller stakes.",
      "For those investors, the recent falls in the share price will have made grim reading. But it is still almost 30% higher than it was a year ago. In fact, the recent decline has simply wiped out the effects of a dramatic surge that occurred immediately after the election, which almost doubled Tesla's market valuation.",
      "Calls for new blood at the top",
      "Today, Tesla is still valued at more than 100 times its earnings \u2013 a far higher margin than automotive rivals such as Ford, General Motors or Toyota, which suggests shareholders are continuing to pin their hopes on technological breakthroughs and rapid growth.",
      "\"Tesla is being valued as a company that is either going to dominate electric vehicles \u2013 which is clearly not going to happen, given the strength of the Chinese manufacturers \u2013 or that is going to dominate robotaxis and autonomous vehicles,\" says Mr Nagley.",
      "None of the major investors appears to be agitating for change at the moment \u2013  although in media interviews this week, one long-term shareholder-turned-vocal critic, the investment fund manager Ross Gerber, did call for Mr Musk to step down.",
      "But analysts say the business would benefit from new blood at the top. \"A new CEO for Tesla would without question be the best thing for the company right now,\" says Matthias Schmidt of Schmidt Automotive Research.",
      "\"It would address the toxic contagion from Musk, offer a solution for the conflict of interest regarding his DOGE position, and allow a dedicated CEO to focus entirely on the job in hand.\"",
      "\"I think that's the clear direction of travel at the moment.\" says Prof Wells. \"I think they need somebody with strong automotive experience. Someone who knows how to rationalise the business.",
      "\"It needs a significant change of direction now.\"",

      "They say the military impact of any allied deployment of about 20,000 troops would be limited compared to the number of troops on either side of the front line.",
      "Ukraine has almost a million military personnel, Russia's army is even larger.",
      "Much of the focus of Thursday's discussions is on how best any international force can provide Ukraine with assets it does not have, especially capability in the air.",
      "So, there will be discussions about which countries can provide warplanes to keep Ukraine's skies safe during a ceasefire.",
      "There will also be discussions about how to make the Black Sea safe for shipping. That may involve two components: how best to keep shipping lanes clear of mines and what kind of naval task force could provide a security presence in the sea.",
      "The key uncertainty is whether the United States would provide any air, satellite or intelligence cover for any European force on the ground.",
      "The US has thus far said it would not be willing to provide any military \"backstop\".",
      "The European strategy for now is to stop asking the US and instead organise the best force and capability it can to ensure the security of Ukraine in the future. Once the details are agreed, then the UK, France and others would see if the European offer was substantial enough for the US to have a change of heart and agree to play some kind of role.",
      "What all this planning depends on, of course, is some kind of ceasefire being agreed in Ukraine.",
      "While the US remains optimistic, many in Ukraine remain sceptical that Russia even wants to end the fighting.",

    "published": "Wed, 19 Mar 2025 21:34:52 GMT",
    "summary": "Some relatives of accused and deported gang members say their sons have been wrongly swept up in a Trump administration crackdown.",
    "story": [
      "In a poor neighbourhood of the Venezuelan city of Maracay, the mother of 24-year-old Francisco Jos\u00e9 Garc\u00eda Casique was waiting for him on Saturday.",
      "It had been 18 months since he had migrated to the US to begin a new life but he had told her that he was now being deported back to Caracas, Venezuela's capital, for being in the US illegally. They had spoken that morning, just before he was due to depart.",
      "\"I thought it was a good sign that he was being deported [to Caracas],\" Myrelis Casique L\u00f3pez recalled. She wanted him home.",
      "But he never arrived. And while watching a television news report on Sunday, Ms Casique was shocked to see her son, not in the US or Venezuela but 1,430 miles (2,300km) away in El Salvador.",
      "The footage showed 238 Venezuelans sent by US authorities to the Terrorism Confinement Centre, or Cecot, a notorious mega-jail. She saw men with shaved heads and shackles on their hands and feet, being forcefully escorted by heavily-armed security forces.",
      "The Trump administration says all of the deportees are members of the Tren de Aragua gang, which has found itself in the White House's crosshairs. The powerful multi-national crime group, which Trump recently declared a foreign terrorist organisation, has been accused of sex trafficking, drug smuggling and murders both at home and in major US cities.",
      "Ms Casique told the BBC she was certain her son was among the detainees, even if no official list of names has been released.",
      "\"It's him. It's him,\" she said, gesturing at a picture in which a man is seated, with his head bowed, on a prison floor alongside a row of others, a tattoo visible on his arm. \"I recognize his features.\"",
      "She also maintains that he is innocent.",
      "US immigration officials have said the detainees were \"carefully vetted\" and verified as gang members before being flown to El Salvador. They said they used evidence collected during surveillance, police encounters or testimonies from victims to vet them.",
      "\"Our job is to send the terrorists out before anyone else gets raped or murdered,\" Deputy White House Chief of Staff Stephen Miller said on Wednesday.",
      "Many of the deportees do not have US criminal records, however, a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) official acknowledged in court documents. And they were deported under a law last invoked during wartime that doesn\u2019t require them to be charged with a crime.",
      "Those who do have criminal records include migrants with arrests on charges ranging from murder, fentanyl trafficking and kidnapping to home invasion and operating a gang-run brothel, according to the Trump administration.",
      "In Mr Garc\u00eda's case, his mother disputes that her son was involved in criminal activity. He left Venezuela in 2019, first to Peru, seeking new opportunities as overlapping economic, political and social crises engulfed the country, she said. He crossed illegally into the US in September 2023.",
      "His mother has not seen him in person in six years.",
      "\"He doesn't belong to any criminal gang, either in the US or in Venezuela\u2026 he's not a criminal,\" Ms Casique said. \"What he's been is a barber.\"",
      "\"Unfortunately, he has tattoos,\" she added, convinced that the roses and names of family members that adorn his body led to his detention and deportation. That is how she, and other family members, recognised him from pictures released of the deportees in El Salvador.",
      "Several other families have said they believe that deportees were mistakenly identified as Tren de Aragua gang members because of their tattoos.",
      "\"It's him,\" Ms Casique said tearfully in Maracay, referencing the image from the prison. \"I wish it wasn't him\u2026  he didn't deserve to be transferred there.\"",
      "The mother of Mervin Yamarte, 29, also identified her son in the video.",
      "\"I threw myself on the floor, saying that God couldn't do this to my son,\" she told the BBC from her home in the Los Pescadores neighbourhood of Maracaibo, Venezuela.",
      "Like Ms Casique, she denies her son was involved with the brutal gang. He had left his hometown and travelled to the US through the Dari\u00e9n Gap, crossing illegally in 2023 with three of his friends: Edwar Herrera, 23; Andy Javier Perozo, 30; and Ringo Rinc\u00f3n, 39.",
      "The BBC spoke with their families and friends, who said they had spotted the four men in the footage from the El Salvador jail.",
      "Mr Yamarte's mother said her son had worked in a tortilla factory, sometimes working 12-hour shifts. On Sundays, he played football with his friends, who all shared a home in Dallas, Texas.",
      "\"He's a good, noble young man. There's a mistake,\" she said.",
      "'We're terrified'",
      "President Trump invoked a centuries-old law, the 1798 Alien Enemies Act, to deport the men without due process in the US, saying they were Tren de Aragua gang members.",
      "Despite the US government's assurances that the deportees were carefully vetted, the move has had a chilling effect on many Venezuelans and Venezuelan-Americans in the US, who fear that Trump's use of the law could lead to more Venezuelans being accused and swiftly deported without any charges or convictions.",
      "\"Of course we're afraid. We're terrified,\" said Adelys Ferro, the executive-director of the Venezuelan-American Caucus, an advocacy group. \"We want every single member of TdA to pay for their crimes. But we don't know what the criteria is.\"",
      "\"They [Venezeulans] are living in uncertain times,\" she said. \"They don't know what decisions to make - even people with documents and have been here for years.\"",
      "Ms Ferro's concerns were echoed by Brian de la Vega, a prominent Florida-based, Venezuela-born immigration lawyer and military veteran.",
      "Many of his clients are in the Miami area, including Doral - a suburb sometimes given the moniker \"Doralzuela\" for its large Venezuelan population.",
      "\"The majority of Venezuelans in the US are trying to do the right thing. They fear going back to their home country,\" Mr de la Vega told the BBC. \"The main concern, for me, is how they're identifying these members. The standard is very low.\"",
      "Many Venezuelan expatriates in the US - particularly South Florida - have been broadly supportive of Trump, who has taken a tough stance on the left-wing government of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro which many of them fled.",
      "But in February, the Trump administration terminated Temporary Protected Status - TPS - for Venezuelans, which had shielded many from deportation. The programme officially ends on 7 April and could impact nearly 350,000 Venezuelan nationals living in the US.",
      "\"Trump's speeches have always been strong about the Venezuelan regime, especially during the campaign,\" Mr de la Vega said. \"I don't think people expected all this.\"",
      "Daniel Campo, a Venezuelan-born naturalised US citizen in Pennsylvania - and ardent Trump supporter - told the BBC that while he remains steadfast in his support of the president, he has some concerns about the deportations to El Salvador and the end of TPS.",
      "\"I certainly hope that when they are doing raids to deport Tren de Aragua, especially to the prison in El Salvador, they are being extra careful,\" he said.",
      "Among those caught by surprise by the end of TPS and the recent deportations is a 25-year-old Venezuelan man who asked to be identified only as Yilber, who arrived in the US in 2022 after a long, dangerous journey through Central America and Mexico.",
      "He's now in the US - but unsure about what comes next.",
      "\"I left Venezuela because of the repression, and the insecurity. My neighbourhood in Caracas had gangs,\" he said. \"Now I don't know what's going to happen here.\"",

    "summary": "Daniel Noboa is calling on international armies to fight the cartels trafficking most of the world's cocaine.",
    "story": [
      "Ecuador's President Daniel Noboa has told the BBC he wants US, European and Brazilian armies to join his \"war\" against criminal gangs.",
      "He added he wants US President Donald Trump to designate Ecuadorean gangs as terrorist groups, as he has done for some Mexican and Venezuelan cartels.",
      "He also said Ecuadorean law would be respected when asked about his recent partnership with Erik Prince, an ally of Trump and founder of controversial private military firm Blackwater.",
      "Violence has soared in Ecuador in recent years, with gangs battling to control drug trafficking routes. Most of the world's cocaine is trafficked through Ecuador's ports.",
      "President Noboa has previously indicated he would like foreign military aid to help tackle drug cartels \u2013 but this is the first time he has singled out the US, Brazil and Europe.",
      "Security \u2013 and how he is dealing with it \u2013 is a top issue for voters ahead of a run-off vote in Ecuador's presidential election on 13 April.",
      "Noboa has defined his 16 months in office through a tough crackdown on gangs and militarising the streets and prisons \u2013 however he has also come under fire from critics who see his tactics as too heavy-handed.",
      "During his term, the murder rate decreased by approximately 16% from 2023 to 2024 but it remains far higher than previous years, and in January 2025 killings hit a record 781 in one month.",
      "In an interview with BBC News, the incumbent president said: \"We need to have more soldiers to fight this war.\"",
      "\"Seventy per cent of the world's cocaine exits via Ecuador. We need the help of international forces.\"",
      "He said what started as \"criminal gangs\" are now \"international narco-terrorist\" groups of 14,000 armed individuals.",
      "Donald Trump's decision to designate some Latin American cartels as terrorist groups has given US law enforcement further powers to fight them.",
      "Noboa told the BBC he wants his US counterpart to do the same with Ecuadorean gangs: \"I would be glad if he considers Los Lobos, Los Choneros, Los Tiguerones as terrorist groups because that's what they really are.\"",
      "Noboa has already ordered the foreign ministry to seek cooperation agreements with \"allied nations\" to support Ecuador's police and army, and is also seeking parliamentary approval to change the constitution to allow foreign military bases in Ecuador again.",
      "As well as constitutional changes, it would require other nations to be willing to offer this. Deploying armies abroad can be risky and expensive but there is some precedent for it. The US had a military base for its anti-narcotic operations in Ecuador until 2009, before these were banned by former President Rafael Correa.",
      "President Noboa's challenge will be convincing figures like Donald Trump in the US, or leaders in Europe where many drugs are shipped to, that it is in their interests too to stop cartels and drug trafficking.",
      "On the alliance with Trump ally Erik Prince, which he announced a few days ago, he said: \"We're fighting an unconventional, urban guerilla war. He has the experience. He's advising our armed forces, our police.\"",
      "Mr Prince founded the private military firm Blackwater that has provided security services to US governments but has also been embroiled in controversy. He sold the company in 2010.",
      "Four Blackwater contractors were convicted and jailed for killing 14 Iraqi citizens in Baghdad's Nisour Square in 2007 and were later pardoned by Trump in 2020.",
      "Does President Noboa want Mr Prince to bring mercenaries to the country?",
      "\"Not necessarily mercenaries,\" he said. \"We are talking about armies. US, European, Brazilian special forces. This could be a great help for us.\"",
      "While some supported the move, some Ecuadoreans cited Mr Prince's past record and feared rights abuses in the country.",
      "When asked about some of Erik Prince's past controversies, Mr Noboa said Ecuador's laws must be respected and warfare conducted legally.",
      "But, he added, cartels had \"violated every single human right possible for the last five years\".",
      "\"They've mutilated people. They've raped thousands of women. They've trafficked human organs. They've traded illegal gold. And moved more than 1,000 tonnes of cocaine a year.\"",
      "Last year, his iron-fist approach came under fire after four boys were arrested by soldiers over an alleged theft and later found mutilated and burned.",
      "Noboa said those soldiers were in jail pending an investigation but that he would \"fight until the end\" to convict those responsible.",
      "He maintained the armed forces were acting proportionately in tackling crime and noted an imbalance between his 35,000-strong military and 40,000 armed gang members.",
      "With the record number of killings in January, leading critics argue his strict approach is failing.",
      "During a campaign rally, his left-wing challenger Luisa Gonz\u00e1lez said: \"The campaign promises made in 2023 were to be delivered in a year and a half. Not two. Not three. Did he deliver? No!\"",
      "Noboa said it was normal to see rising violence before elections in his country, but reiterated that Ecuador could not fight this problem alone: \"This is a transnational crime without a transnational security policy.\"",
      "While Albanian, Mexican and Colombian cartels worked together, there was not a joint security policy among countries affected by drug violence, he said.",
      "Ecuador needs help, he argued, because its economy is smaller than many in Europe or the US where most drugs are shipped to.",
      "He added drug trafficking and illegal mining generated $30bn (\u00a323bn) \u2013 around 27% of GDP \u2013 annually in Ecuador.",
      "He urged countries where consumption of cocaine is high, like the UK, to do more to tackle this arguing: \"The product they're consuming has a chain of violence and misery.\"",
      "Violence and post-pandemic unemployment have driven many Ecuadoreans to flee northward.",
      "They are now one of the top nationalities crossing the dangerous Darien Gap jungle from South to North America.",
      "President Noboa is willing to take back Ecuadorean migrants from the US, but not other nationalities, and said the country was giving returnees technical training and a minimum wage for three months.",
      "For him, the solution is improving \"opportunities\".",
      "\"We need to develop, as an export-based economy, jobs in Ecuador for these people.\"",
      "While he said he \"100%\" empathised with people fleeing violence, he blamed a past \"lack of strong security policy\".",
      "His message to Ecuadoreans now? \"Stay - and you'll see positive results. We're reducing inflation. Companies are hiring. The economy is recovering.\"",
      "Daniel Noboa will face Luisa Gonz\u00e1lez in the run-off vote next month.",
      "He received only 0.5% more votes than her in the first round, suggesting the second round could be very close and polarising.",
      "With security the top issue for voters, his success \u2013 or not \u2013 may depend on whether Ecuadoreans think progress has been good enough.",

    "summary": "A lawyer for the two songwriters suing Mariah Carey said they will \"make a decision shortly on whether to appeal.\"",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge in Los Angeles has ruled that Mariah Carey did not steal her perennial megahit \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" from other songwriters.",
      "Judge M\u00f3nica Ram\u00edrez Almadani granted Carey's request for summary judgment on Wednesday, giving her and co-writer and co-defendant Walter Afanasieff a victory without going to trial.",
      "In 2023, songwriters Andy Stone of Louisiana \u2014 who goes by the stage name Vince Vance \u2014 and Troy Powers of Tennessee filed the $20 million lawsuit alleging that Carey's 1994 song, which has since become a holiday standard and annual streaming sensation, infringed the copyright of their country 1989 song with the same title.",
      "Their lawyer Gerard P. Fox said he's \"disappointed\" in an email to The Associated Press.",
      "Fox said it is his experience that judges at this level \"nearly always now dismiss a music copyright case and that one must appeal to reverse and get the case to the jury. My client will make a decision shortly on whether to appeal. We filed based on the opinions of two esteemed musicologists who teach at great colleges.\"",
      "Stone and Powers' suit said their \"'All I Want For Christmas Is You' contains a unique linguistic structure where a person, disillusioned with expensive gifts and seasonal comforts, wants to be with their loved one, and accordingly writes a letter to Santa Claus.\"",
      "They said there was an \"overwhelming likelihood\" Carey and Afanasieff had heard their song \u2014 which at one point reached No. 31 on Billboard's Hot Country chart \u2014 and infringed their copyright by taking significant elements from it. Stone had claimed that the song received \"extensive airplay\" during the 1993 Christmas season.",
      "After hearing from two experts for each side, Ram\u00edrez Almadani agreed with those from the defense, who said the writers employed common Christmas cliches that existed prior to both songs, and that Carey's song used them differently. She said the plaintiffs had not met the burden of showing that the songs are substantially similar.",
      "Ram\u00edrez Almadani also ordered sanctions against the plaintiffs and their lawyers, saying their suit and subsequent filings were frivolous and that the plaintiffs' attorneys \"made no reasonable effort to ensure that the factual contentions asserted have evidentiary support.\"",
      "She said they must pay at least part of the defendants' attorney fees.",
      "Defense attorneys and publicists for Carey did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Carey's Christmas colossus has become an even bigger hit in recent years than it was in the 1990s. It has reached No. 1 on Billboard's Hot 100 chart the past six years in a row \u2014 measuring the most popular songs each week \u2014 not just the holiday-themed \u2014 by airplay, sales and streaming. The song has broken streaming records and has been played over 2 billion times on Spotify.",
      "Carey and Afanasieff have had their own public disagreement \u2014 though not one that's gone to court \u2014 over who wrote how much of the song. But the case made them at least temporary allies.",
      "Carey previously made headlines when she tried to exclusively trademark the nickname \"Queen of Christmas.\" She filed a petition for the trademark in 2021. The U.S. Trademark Trial and Appeal Board rejected the petition, as well as petitions to exclusively trademark \"Princess Christmas\" and \"QOC.\"",

    "summary": "Gene Hackman\u200b died of heart disease and Betsy Arakawa's cause of death was hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, officials said.",
    "story": [
      "Details continue to emerge about the deaths of\u00a0Gene Hackman, his wife Betsy Arakawa and their dog after they were\u00a0found dead in their home\u00a0in New Mexico on Feb. 26.",
      "Over a week after they were found, investigators said Arakawa, 65, likely died days before Hackman, 95,\u00a0and they had different causes of death. Here's what we know from officials.",
      "What did Gene Hackman and Betsy Arakawa die from?",
      "Hackman died of heart disease, with Alzheimer's disease as a significant contributory factor, New Mexico's chief medical investigator, Dr. Heather Jarrell, said at a news conference on Friday, March 7.",
      "\"He had very extensive heart disease,\" she said.",
      "Arakawa's cause of death was hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, a severe respiratory illness, Jarrell said. Hantavirus is spread mainly by rodents, and infections are rare, but Jarrell noted the strain in the Southwest has a high mortality rate of about 38-50%.",
      "It does not spread from person to person, and Hackman tested negative for hantavirus, Jarrell said.",
      "Both Hackman and Arakawa tested negative for carbon monoxide poisoning. They also tested negative for COVID-19, the flu and other common respiratory viruses, Jarrell said.",
      "How long had Hackman and Arakawa been dead?",
      "\"There is no reliable scientific method to accurately determine the exact time or date of death,\" Jarrell said.",
      "But with data from Hackman's pacemaker, which showed the last record of heart activity on Feb. 18, \"it is reasonable to conclude that Mr. Hackman probably died around Feb. 18,\" she said.",
      "Cellphone records showed Arakawa made multiple phone calls to a medical concierge service on Feb. 12, according to the Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office. Sheriff Adan Mendoza initially said her last known communication and activity was on Feb. 11 when she exchanged emails with a massage therapist and was seen at a local grocery store, CVS and pet food store before returning to her home.",
      "Based on her last known activity, it is \"reasonable to conclude\" Arakawa died before Hackman, but the exact day was not known, Jarrell said.",
      "A search warrant issued on Feb. 26, the day Arakawa and Hackman's bodies were found, states the two showed signs of decomposition, bloating in the face and mummification of hands and feet.\u00a0Mummification preserves a body after death and can happen naturally when the skin dries out, according to the National Library of Medicine.",
      "It is unclear what Hackman knew during the time between Arakawa's death and his own. He showed evidence of advanced Alzheimer's disease, Jarrell said.",
      "Where were Hackman and Arakawa found?",
      "Hackman and Arakawa were found dead in their home outside of Santa Fe, New Mexico, according to deputies who responded to the house at about 1:45 p.m. local time on Feb. 26.",
      "Hackman was found in what is believed to be the home's mudroom. It appeared he had fallen suddenly, the search warrant says. He was found wearing sweatpants, a long-sleeve T-shirt and slippers.",
      "Arakawa was found in a bathroom near the front door of the home, according to the warrant. The door to the bathroom was opened.",
      "Arakawa was on the ground, wearing sweatpants and a sweatshirt. An opened orange prescription bottle and scattered pills were seen on a countertop near Arakawa, the warrant says.",
      "The pills were a thyroid medication that had been taken as prescribed, Jarrell said. They were not believed to have contributed to Arakawa's death.",
      "Hackman and Arakawa's dog also found dead",
      "One of Hackman and Arakawa's dogs was found dead in a closet of the bathroom where Arakawa's body was discovered, the warrant says. Mendoza said the dog, named Zinna, was in a kennel or crate.",
      "Arakawa had picked Zinna up from a veterinary hospital on Feb. 9 after a procedure, Mendoza said. Zinna likely died of starvation and dehydration, according to a veterinary lab report obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "Dogs do not get sick from hantavirus, New Mexico State Veterinarian Erin Phipps said at the March 7 news conference.",
      "There were two other dogs found alive on the property when deputies arrived, the warrant says.",
      "How did Arakawa get hantavirus?",
      "Hantaviruses are primarily carried by rodents. Humans can become infected after exposure to urine, droppings or saliva from an infected rodent.",
      "It was not immediately clear exactly how or when Arakawa was infected.",
      "Her and Hackman's home had a low risk of exposure, \"similar to other well-maintained houses in New Mexico,\" Phipps said, but added there were signs of rodent entry in other structures on their property.",
      "Hantavirus initially presents with flu-like symptoms and can progress to shortness of breath. \"At that point, a person can die very quickly, within 24 to 48 hours roughly speaking, without medical treatment,\" Jarrell said.",
      "No signs of a carbon monoxide leak",
      "There were no obvious signs of a gas leak at the home, deputies said.",
      "Santa Fe Fire Department personnel and the New Mexico Gas Company conducted testing at the scene and did not find evidence of a carbon monoxide leak or problems with the pipes, according to the search warrant.",
      "The gas company issued five \"red tags,\" the sheriff's office said in an update on March 4. One was for \"a minuscule leak,\" or 0.33% gas in the air, at a stove burner, which is not a lethal amount, the office said. The other tags were for violations unrelated to gas leaks or carbon monoxide.",
      "Carbon monoxide is an odorless, colorless gas that kills hundreds of people each year.",
      "No signs of foul play",
      "Deputies found the door to Hackman and Arakawa's home \"unsecured and opened,\" the warrant says. They were initially called to the home after someone who arrived to do maintenance did not receive an answer and became concerned, the sheriff's office said.",
      "There were no signs of forced entry or that the house had been rummaged through, deputies said.",
      "What movies was Gene Hackman in?",

      "A federal judge dismissed the charges Monday against a Minnesota man accused of hiding a stolen pair of ruby slippers that Judy Garland wore in the 1939 musical \"The Wizard of Oz\" after prosecutors informed the court that he died on Sunday.",
      "Jerry Hal Saliterman, 77, of Crystal, who had been in poor health with lung disease and other ailments, had been scheduled to change his plea to guilty in January but that hearing was postponed indefinitely after he was hospitalized.",
      "Federal prosecutor Matthew Greenley notified the court in a one-page motion Monday that Saliterman died Sunday but did not say how or where. U.S. District Judge Patrick Schiltz granted the request and dropped the charges.",
      "Defense attorney John Brink confirmed Monday that his client had died but declined to give details. A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office in Fargo, North Dakota, which is handling the case, did not immediately return a phone call seeking further information.",
      "According to court filings, Saliterman was hospitalized in early January \"for inability to walk and sepsis,\" an infection that can be life-threatening. He attended his arraignment three days later via video from what looked like a hospital room. In an update to the court late last month, Brink told the court that his client had been discharged to a hospice facility and that his prognosis was poor. An accompanying letter from his doctor listed severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease requiring supplemental oxygen and Parkinson's disease.",
      "Saliterman was in a wheelchair and on oxygen last March when he made his first court appearance. He was charged then with theft of a major artwork and witness tampering for his role in the ruby slippers case.",
      "The sequined red slippers were stolen in 2005 from the Judy Garland Museum in her hometown of Grand Rapids. Hollywood memorabilia collector Michael Shaw had loaned his pair to the museum before Terry Jon Martin   stole them.  Their whereabouts remained a mystery for nearly 13 years until the FBI recovered them in 2018. They fetched a record for movie memorabilia of $32.5 million in December, according to Heritage Auctions.",
      "The Judy Garland Museum's efforts to buy back the slippers at auction ultimately failed, despite being bolstered by $100,000 set aside by state lawmakers.",
      "The slippers were one of several pairs Garland wore during the filming. Only three other pairs remain.",
      "Martin, now 78, of Grand Rapids, used a hammer to smash the glass of the museum's door and display case to steal them. According to his attorney, an old associate with connections to the mob told him the shoes had to be adorned with real jewels to justify their $1 million insured value. Martin's attorneys described the theft as \"one last score\" for the aging reformed mobster. But Martin got rid of the slippers when he learned they were fake, and they ended up with Saliterman. Martin pleaded guilty in 2023 and was sentenced last January to time served because of his poor health.",
      "Garland was born Frances Gumm in 1922. She lived in Grand Rapids, about 200 miles north of Minneapolis, until she was 4 years old. She died in 1969. The Judy Garland Museum says it has the world's largest collection of Garland and \"Wizard of Oz\" memorabilia.",

Every story had a moral. Elmer the Elf was always honest and kind, helping those less fortunate. Freddy the Frog was courageous and heroic, saving people from aliens and bad guys.",

    "summary": "The Emmy-winning star of \"Succession\" earned an Olivier Award for portraying 26 different characters in Oscar Wilde's \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" in London. And now, she's bringing her chameleonic performance to Broadway.",
    "story": [
      "Sarah Snook set the record straight for us: Her last name is pronounced \"Snuke\" (like nuke), not \"Snook\" (as in book or took).",
      "On Broadway this spring, she's neither Snuke nor Snook, but 26 completely different people. The 37-year-old Australian is chameleonic in Oscar Wilde's \"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\" changing accents, wigs, and gender to tell the story of a man who makes a spiritual bargain to appear eternally young, while his portrait reflects the hideousness of his actions.",
      "The show has suspense, horror, humor, and also a lot of heart. \"People don't often credit Oscar Wilde with something heartfelt,\" I said.",
      "\"Yeah, he has a lot of pathos,\" Snook said. \"I think there's a lot of empathy for the human condition \u2013 I think, you know, seeing the soul as a real thing and as a part of your body, personality, spiritual makeup that one might need to protect and look after.\"",
      "It's a performance for which Snook won an Olivier (the British theater award) during the show's run in London's West End.",
      "Oscar Wilde published the story (his only novel) in 1890. Victorian critics called it \"poisonous\" and \"morally depraved.\" Now, almost a century-and-a-half later, the tale feels resonant. Snook said today is an interesting time to come to this story, \"where we have such an image-based culture and ability to construct a visual image to sell to anyone online, on Instagram. And part of the reason of playing multiple different characters is about choosing which mask is the right mask, which is the public/private mask that we show of ourselves.\"",
      "After making her name known abroad, Snook is now beloved by American audiences as Siobhan \"Shiv\" Roy, the cutthroat billionaire she played as the scion of a family empire on the TV series \"Succession.\" The saltiness of her Shiv garnered Snook legions of fans, and several awards.",
      "But Snook initially didn't want to audition for Shiv because, she says, she couldn't relate to her being beautiful and wealthy. \"Yeah, there was nothing in myself that I could see as, like, reflective or accessible in that character,\" she said.",
      "Like Dorian Gray, Shiv is an anti-hero, and Snook's been drawn to those complicated characters for a long time: \"I watched a ton of Disney films when I was a kid, and all I wanted to be was Ursula and Scar, all the villains, all the people who had seeming more complexity to why they were that in the first place.\"",
      "Snook discovered that complexity for herself during one of her first acting gigs back home in Adelaide: \"I used to do fairy parties. It was such a good training ground, 'cause kids, man, they tell you if they're not interested.\"",
      "Was she heckled? \"Yeah. Like, 'Fly! Lemme see you fly! Come on! Why can't you fly? Show us!'\"",
      "Kip Williams, the director and adapter of \"Dorian Gray,\" arrived at the National Institute of Dramatic Art in Sydney the year that Snook had just left. \"There was this word around school that there was this incredible red-headed actress, so my radar as a director was up for Sarah from the beginning,\" he said.",
      "Williams knew that he wanted to collaborate with Snook, and felt that a single actor could embody all the facets of Wilde's legendary work. \"Oscar Wilde talks about this notion that life is one grand act of theater, and that people are always in a form of performance where they are either revealing or concealing parts of themselves,\" Williams said. \"So, the form of this piece \u2013 one performer playing all of these 26 characters \u2013 is an expression of that idea.\"",
      "It is with technology that Williams illuminates humanity. He calls it \"cine-theater\" \u2013 combining live performance with cameras, large screens, and pre-recorded videos.",
      "So, is it fair to call this a one-woman show? \"I think it is definitely a one-person show,\" Williams said, \"but it is also, paradoxically, an ensemble piece. The camera team and the crew are kind of like her co-performers. They dance with her on stage \u2013 literally, one moment.\"",
      "A dance that feels intimately familiar to Snook: \"The feeling of a camera really close to you and not having that disrupt your train of thought or your flow, I think that's something that was really useful in 'Succession,' 'cause we kind of absorbed them as extra characters in the scene,\" she said.",
      "Snook has a few extra characters in her own life, too. She got married during the pandemic and has a young daughter. But as it turns out, Sarah Snook has not bitten off more than she can chew.",
      "\"So, this is your Broadway debut. Is the pressure off since you've already had such a successful run?\" I asked.",
      "Snook replied, \"Actually, one thing that Kip said on the first day of rehearsals is, 'You can only eat an elephant one spoonful at a time.' 'Yeah, sure. Okay. I'll do it that way.'\"",
      "\"So you think you've eaten the whole thing by now?\"",
      "\"No, now I've gotta eat the Broadway part of the elephant!\" Snook laughed.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump announced Friday that Boeing will build the Air Force's future fighter jet, which the Pentagon says will have stealth and penetration capabilities that far exceed those of its current fleet and is essential in a potential conflict with China.",
      "Known as Next Generation Air Dominance, or NGAD, the manned jet will serve as quarterback to a fleet of future drone aircraft designed to be able to penetrate the air defenses of China and any other potential foes. The initial contract to proceed with production on a version for the Air Force version is worth an estimated $20 billion.",
      "Trump, who announced the award at the White House with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Air Force leadership, said the new fighter would be named the F-47. Gen. David Allvin, chief of staff of the Air Force, said, \"We're going to write the next generation of modern aerial warfare with this.\"",
      "Hegseth said the future fleet \"sends a very clear, direct message to our allies that we're not going anywhere.\"",
      "Critics have questioned the cost and the necessity of the program as the Pentagon is still struggling to fully produce its current most advanced jet, the F-35, which is expected to cost taxpayers more than $1.7 trillion over its lifespan. In addition, the Pentagon's future stealth bomber, the B-21 Raider, will have many of the same cutting edge technologies in advanced materials, AI, propulsion and stealth.",
      "More than 1,100 F-35s have already been built for the U.S. and multiple international partners.",
      "A fleet of about 100 future B-21 stealth bombers at an estimated total cost of at least $130 billion is also planned. The first B-21 aircraft are now in test flights.",
      "With evolving drone and space warfare likely to be the center of any fight with China, Dan Grazier, a military procurement analyst, questions whether \"another exquisite manned fighter jet really is the right platform going forward.\" Grazier, director of the national security reform program at the Stimson Center, said $20 billion is \"just seed money. The total costs coming down the road will be hundreds of billions of dollars.\"",
      "Few details of what the new NGAD fighter would look like have been public, although Trump said early versions have been conducting test flights for the last five years. Renderings by both Lockheed Martin and Boeing have highlighted a flat, tail-less aircraft with a sharp nose.",
      "A separate Navy contract for its version of the NGAD fighter is still under competition between Northrop Grumman and Boeing.",
      "Last year, the Biden administration's Air Force secretary, Frank Kendall, ordered a pause on the NGAD program to review if the aircraft was still needed or if the program, which was first designed in 2018, needed to be modified to reflect the past few years of warfighting advances.",
      "That review by think tanks and academia examined what conflict with China would look like with NGAD and then without it \u2014 and determined that NGAD was still needed. Kendall then left the decision on which firm would build the fighter jet to the incoming Trump administration, a defense official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to provide details on the decision-making.",
      "NGAD will bring \"an entirely different level of low observability,\" the official said. It will also have a much longer range than the F-35 or other current fighter jets, so it will require less refueling. A future unmanned version of NGAD also is planned as the Pentagon improves the AI for the aircraft, the official said.",

    "summary": "Trump administration effort to wind down the Education Department could lead to frustration for millions of student loan borrowers, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's executive order on Thursday starting the process of dismantling the Department of Education could throw federal student loan programs into disarray and lead to frustration for millions of borrowers, according to experts.",
      "The Education Department's remit is broad. The agency manages student loans for more than 40 million Americans; oversees $18 billion in Title I funding for elementary and secondary education in low-income areas; issues Pell Grants to help low- and middle-income students pay for college; and administers the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, which lets students apply for loans, grants and other college aid.",
      "\"It takes resources to manage that asset, including trained staff to make sure borrowers have good information and colleges can administer loan programs properly,\" said Peter Granville, a higher education finance expert and fellow at The Century Foundation, a progressive think tank. \"It takes technical expertise that only Education Department officials have.\"",
      "Ahead of the Thursday signing ceremony for Mr. Trump's order, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that the Education Department \"will be much smaller than it is today.\" She said at the time that the agency would, for now, retain oversight of student loans and Pell grants.",
      "Mr. Trump, in his Oval Office remarks on Friday, said the Small Business Administration (SBA) would assume oversight of student loans.",
      "\"I have decided the the SBA, the Small Business Administration ... will handle all of the student loan portfolio. We have a portfolio that's very large, lots of loans,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Trump administration officials had previously said such programs would eventually be transferred to another federal agency, such as the Treasury Department, Commerce Department or SBA.",
      "\"Closing the department does not mean cutting off funds from those who depend on them \u2014 we will continue to support K-12 students, students with special needs, college student borrowers and others who rely on essential programs,\" Education Secretary Linda McMahon said in a statement after Mr. Trump signed the order. \"We're going to follow the law and eliminate the bureaucracy responsibly by working through Congress to ensure a lawful and orderly transition.\"",
      "Though the Trump administration wants to dismantle the Education Department, eliminating it completely would require an act of Congress \u2014 a significant political hurdle given that most Senate legislation requires a filibuster-proof 60 votes to pass.",
      "\"Recipe for chaos\"",
      "Despite the Trump administration's expectations for a smooth wind down of the Education Department, experts warn that the administrative challenges in transferring oversight of student loans from one part of government to another are significant. They also note that prior to Friday, the White House had not released a plan for overseeing student loans as the Education Department shrinks, or specified which department would inherit its duties.",
      "\"It doesn't pass the sniff test that you'd summarily move a complex, large student debt portfolio from the Department of Education, where it's already lived, and just plop it over to the Treasury,\" Jessica Thompson, senior vice president at The Institute for College Access and Success, a nonprofit group focused on education policy, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"We are concerned that there is not a serious, detailed thoughtful plan for reform around what to do with the student loan portfolio.\"",
      "Granville concurred with that assessment. Gutting the Education Department before articulating a plan to reassign student loan oversight \"is not a recipe for efficiency or innovation,\" he said. \"It's a recipe for chaos and frustration for millions of people who rely on the student loan program.\"",
      "The Trump Administration has already slashed the Education Department's staff in half, dismissing employees tasked with managing $1.6 trillion in student loan debt.",
      "\"The department was already understaffed, and with the breadth and depth of the firings last week, we have big questions about the ability to provide service to 40-plus millions borrowers,\" Thompson said.",
      "She points to the long wait times Americans with student loans face in reaching agency staff by phone to get their questions answered. \"We were already in a situation where we needed improvements in customer service, so there is no conceivable way you could gut the institutional expertise that occurred last week and not have repercussions,\" Thompson said.",
      "That could lead to confusion for current and future student borrowers seeking information about loan payments and other servicing issues, duties now handled by the Education Department. Thompson also worries that a sudden vacuum in such information could lead to a spike in loan defaults.",
      "\"Now, they can't call and get advice or have questions about how much their loan payments will be and can they afford them, answered,\" she said.",
      "\"[W]e are barreling toward another student default crisis with less commitment and capacity to help borrowers repay,\" Granville added.",

      "A backpacker from Wales was detained at the Canadian border for close to three weeks, before being permitted to fly home. A Canadian woman with a work visa was detained for 12 days at the Tijuana border, before returning to Canada.",
      "And German tourist Lucas Sielaff, who drove to Mexico from Las Vegas, where he was visiting his American fianc\u00e9, was locked up while returning from Tijuana. Immigration authorities accused him of violating the rules of his 90-day U.S. tourist permit, the couple said, despite being just 22 days into it. Sielaff was held for 16 days before he was permitted to fly home to Germany on his own dime.",
      "Sielaff and others who were detained said it was never made clear why they were taken into custody.",
      "\"What happened at the border was just blatant abuse of the Border Patrol's power,\" his fianc\u00e9, Lennon Tyler, told the Associated Press.",
      "Pedro Rios, director of the American Friends Service Committee, a nonprofit that aids migrants, agreed that \"the rationale for detaining these people doesn't make sense.\"",
      "\"The only reason I see is there is a much more fervent anti-immigrant atmosphere,\" Rios told the Associated Press.",
      "U.S. authorities did not respond to a request from The Associated Press for figures on the number of tourists that have been held at detention facilities. Immigration and Customs Enforcement told the AP that Sielaff was deemed \"inadmissible\" by Customs and Border Protection, without providing more specifics. Generally speaking, they said that \"if statutes or visa terms are violated, travelers may be subject to detention and removal.\"",
      "Consider \"delaying personal travel\" abroad",
      "Universities have warned international faculty and students to consider refraining from traveling abroad, pointing to the Trump Administration's evolving federal travel policies.",
      "\"Out of an abundance of caution, we encourage international students, staff, faculty and scholars \u2014 including U.S. visa holders and permanent residents (or 'green card holders') \u2014 to consider postponing or delaying personal travel outside the United States until more information is available from the U.S. Department of State,\" Brown University executive vice president for planning and policy Russell Carey, wrote in an email to the Brown community.",
      "Could trade war weigh on tourism to U.S.?",
      "A recent analysis shows that President Trump's trade war could also dissuade tourists from visiting the U.S. just by alienating key allies and trade partners.",
      "Data from Tourism Economics, a branch of investment advisory firm Oxford Economics, is forecasting a 15% drop in the number of visits from Canada in 2025.",
      "International travel from all foreign countries to the U.S. is expected to drop by just over 5%, according to the report. Factoring in diminished spending by Americans traveling domestically this year, overall travel spending in the U.S. could drop up to $64 billion in 2025, according to Tourism Economics.",
      "\"The negative effects of an expanded trade war scenario will reach U.S. hotel room demand in 2025,\" Tourism Economics said in the report. \"Domestic travel will be negatively affected by slower income growth and higher prices while international travel to the U.S. will be hit by a trifecta of slower economies, a stronger dollar and antipathy toward the U.S.\""

      "The Social Security Administration's plan to require in-person identity checks for millions of new and existing recipients while simultaneously closing government offices has sparked a furor among lawmakers, advocacy groups and program recipients who are worried that the government is placing unnecessary barriers in front of an already vulnerable population.",
      "The new requirements will impact anyone who needs to verify their bank information with the agency, as well as families with children who receive Social Security benefits and cannot verify a child's information on the SSA website. They are intended to combat fraud and waste within the system, which President Trump and officials in his administration have claimed are widespread.",
      "The agency announced Tuesday that, beginning March 31, those who cannot properly verify their identity over the agency's \"my Social Security\" online service will be required to visit an agency field office in person to complete the verification process. They also announced recently that Social Security field offices across the country will be closing.",
      "Of the 47 SSA field offices listed for closure on the website for the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE, 26 are slated for closure this year, with some taking effect as early as next month, according to an Associated Press analysis of the data.",
      "That change, in addition to the impending closure of field offices across the country, and a plan to reduce the agency workforce with mass layoffs, could result in massive delays to services, advocates say. Nancy LeaMond of the AARP said eliminating phone verification \"will result in more headaches and longer wait times to resolve routine customer service needs.\"",
      "Leamond, the AARP's chief advocacy and engagement officer, said the announcement \"not only comes as a total surprise but is on an impractical fast-track.\"",
      "\"SSA needs to be transparent about its service changes and seek input from the older Americans who will be affected. Because any delay in Social Security caused by this change can mean real economic hardship,\" LeaMond said.",
      "Agency leaders said Tuesday that the agency would begin training frontline employees and management about the new policy for the next two weeks.",

      "The agency distributes roughly $1.6 trillion in old-age and disability benefits annually.",
      "The end of phone service identification could be dramatic for some recipients, including families with children who will be required to visit an SSA office, since children can't open online accounts through the \"my Social Security\" online service.",
      "Nancy Altman, president of Social Security Works, said \"this will make it far harder for the American people to claim their earned benefits. It could even cause major delays, and ultimately collapse the system, by overwhelming the field offices.\"",

To the Federal Reserve, as Chair Jerome Powell relayed on Wednesday, tariffs are a broadside on economic growth.",

The S&P 500 fell 12 points, or 0.2%, to close at 5,663, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended largely flat and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.3%.",
      "The dip followed the stock market's modest bounce yesterday after the Fed announced it was standing pat on interest rates, as Wall Street had expected. Indeed, investors may not have learned much from the central bank and Powell's remarks given that economists have already begun forecasting weaker growth and higher inflation as the U.S. moves to deploy tariffs against Canada, China, Europe, Mexico and other countries.",

      "Another thing investors didn't learn from the Fed: The world is a much more uncertain place today than it was before Mr. Trump was re-elected in November. Financial markets have slumped this year as the White House laid out its plans for tariffs, with the S&P 500 falling briefly into correction territory, or 10% below its previous peak. The index is now down 8.4% since reaching its all-time high on Feb. 19.",
      "Still, if there were any lingering doubts that the nation's economic outlook is murky, Powell seemed determined to squash them flat. The Fed chair cited uncertainty five times in his prepared remarks and another dozen times in the following press conference.",
      "That uncertainty refers to the questions regarding how the Trump administration's economic agenda on trade, immigration, fiscal policy and government regulation could affect the economy.",
      "For people thinking of taking out a loan, of course, what is certain is that for now the Fed prefers to assess the impact of these policies before cutting its benchmark interest rate.",
      "That caution, while understandable given the questions hanging over the economy, could itself pose risks \u2014 namely, that the Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank's rate-setting panel, might wait too long before easing back on the stick.",
      "\"[T]he Fed's understandably cautious stance also opens the door for the Committee to be late to the party in the event the economy starts to lose more momentum, which is the higher risk in our opinion,\" TD Cowen analysts said Thursday in note to investors.",
      "There is ample precedent for the Fed mistiming its policy shifts, as it did during the pandemic when an earlier move to tighten rates might have helped head off rising inflation.",
      "To be sure, despite the haze surrounding the economy, Powell remains clear on one thing that should prove reassuring to investors: The risks of a U.S. recession remain low. And although Fed policymakers expect inflation to rise this year to 2.7%, they also think it will recede to 2.2% in 2026 and 2% in 2027.",
      "Barry Bannister, chief equity strategist at Stifel, thinks stocks could climb in the near term as investors focus on word from the Fed that it could still lower rates twice this year.

    "summary": "A federal judge granted a temporary restraining order in the challenge brought by unions who argued DOGE's access was unlawful.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Thursday temporarily blocked the White House's Department of Government Efficiency from accessing systems at the Social Security Administration containing the sensitive information of millions of Americans, delivering another setback to President Trump's efforts to overhaul the federal government.",
      "U.S. District Judge Ellen Hollander wrote in a 137-page decision that a group of unions challenging DOGE's access to systems of records at the SSA was likely to succeed on its claims that the efforts violated the Privacy Act and a federal law that governs the agency rulemaking process.",
      "She granted a request for a temporary restraining order that was sought by the labor unions, which filed a lawsuit in February that challenged the legality of the SSA's decision to allow DOGE to get its hands on sensitive, personal and confidential information pertaining to millions of Americans.",
      "\"The defense does not appear to share a privacy concern for the millions of Americans whose SSA records were made available to the DOGE affiliates, without their consent, and which contain sensitive, confidential, and personally identifiable information,\" wrote Hollander, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama.",
      "The judge's order blocks officials at the SSA from granting DOGE access to systems containing Americans' personal information. It also requires Elon Musk, DOGE and its team members at the agency to delete all non-anonymized personal information that they obtained from the SSA, and prevents them from accessing any agency computer or software code.",
      "Lee Saunders, president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, cheered the decision as a win for American workers and retirees across the country.",
      "\"The court saw that Elon Musk and his unqualified lackeys present a grave danger to Social Security and have illegally accessed the data of millions of Americans,\" Saunders said in a statement. \"This decision will not only force them to delete any data they have currently saved, but it will also block them from further sharing, accessing or disclosing our Social Security information.\"",
      "The Justice Department has said that 10 members of the DOGE team are working at the SSA, and seven of them have had access to personal information housed in its data systems.",
      "In her opinion, Hollander said that the Trump administration failed to provide the court with a reasonable explanation for why the DOGE team needs access to the data maintained in the SSA's systems to root out fraud and abuse.",
      "\"Defendants disregarded protocols for proper hiring, onboarding, training, and access limitations, and, in a rushed fashion, provided access to a massive amount of sensitive, confidential data to members of the DOGE Team, without any articulated explanation for the need to do so,\" she wrote.",
      "The judge, who sits on the district court in Baltimore, knocked the Justice Department for withholding the names of the DOGE team members in an effort to protect their privacy, but allowing access to millions of Americans' personal information.",
      "The Trump administration, she said, \"have not shown the same level of care with the far more sensitive, confidential data of millions of Americans who entrusted their government with their personal and private information. The trust appears to have been violated, without any articulated need.\"",
      "\"The American public may well applaud and support the Trump administration's mission to root out fraud, waste, and bloat from federal agencies, including SSA, to the extent it exists. But, by what means and methods?\" Hollander said. \"The DOGE Team is essentially engaged in a fishing expedition at SSA, in search of a fraud epidemic, based on little more than suspicion.\"",
      "She accused the Trump administration of giving DOGE \"unbridled access\" to millions of Americans' private data, including their Social Security numbers, medical records, drivers' license numbers, bank and credit card information, tax information, income and work history and their home and work addresses.",
      "\"This intrusion into the personal affairs of millions of Americans \u2014 absent an adequate explanation for the need to do so \u2014 is not in the public interest,\" she said. \"To be sure, rooting out possible fraud, waste, and mismanagement in the SSA is in the public interest. But, that does not mean that the government can flout the law to do so. The president's advisors and employees are not exempt from the statutes Congress enacted to protect American citizens from overbroad and unnecessary access to their [personal information].\"",
      "Mr. Trump established DOGE on his first day back in the White House and has said that he tasked Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, with heading the initiative. The White House has said, though, that Amy Gleason, who worked at DOGE's predecessor entity, is formally the administrator of DOGE. The task force's employees have been dispatched to more than a dozen federal agencies as part of the president's plan to shrink the size of the government.",
      "But DOGE's actions, and specifically access to sensitive government databases, has raised concerns about whether they are complying with a federal law that aims to protect Americans' private information. Lawsuits have been brought seeking to restrict DOGE's access at least five other agencies, as well as claiming that Musk's actions are unconstitutional.",
      "Just earlier this week, another federal judge in Maryland found that Musk and DOGE likely violated the Constitution's Appointments Clause and the separation of powers when they unilaterally acted to shut down the U.S. Agency for International Development.",

The central bank forecasts inflation to edge up to 2.7%, up from from its current level of 2.5%.",
      "Policymakers now expect the nation's gross domestic product \u00a0\u2014 the total output of goods and services \u2014 to expand 1.7% this year, down from their December forecast of 2.1%. In 2024, GDP grew 2.8%.",
      "\"Inflation has started to move up,\" Powell said at a news conference. \"We think partly in response to tariffs. And there may be a delay in further progress over the course of this year.\"",

      "\"Acknowledging the likely direction of travel in terms of policy from the Trump administration, FOMC participants revised up their projections for inflation while revising down their projections for GDP,\" Stephen Brown, deputy chief North America economist with Capital Economics, said in a report.",
      "Chances of a recession \"were extremely low \u2014 if you go back two months. It has moved up, but it's not high,\" Powell told reporters.",
      "Investors had signaled virtually no chance of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the central bank's rate-setting panel, lowering interest rates this month. But President Trump's aggressive trade policies, which have triggered concerns about economic growth, have also amplified uncertainty for financial markets.",
      "\"What holds the FOMC back from continuing to push interest rates lower at this moment is uncertainty about the Trump administration's economic policies,\" Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics, wrote Wednesday in a research note ahead of the Fed's decision.",
      "The Fed said it will maintain the federal funds rate at its current range of 4.25% to 4.5%.",
      "The central bank's so-called dot plot, used by the Fed to indicate its outlook for where interest rates are headed, indicates the year-end 2025 median projection for the federal funds rate at 3.88%, signaling 50 basis points in cuts this year.",

      "On March 3, Unilever took steps to remove and replace Stever as CEO. The lawsuit alleges that rather than\u00a0 performance issues, Unilever's \"motive for removing Mr. Stever is his commitment to Ben & Jerry's social mission and essential brand integrity and his willingness to collaborate in good faith with the independent board.\"",

      "Perhaps the most pressing question Powell is likely to face during his press conference Wednesday will focus on the potential impact of the brewing trade war between the U.S. and the country's key trading partners.

    "published": "Tue, 18 Mar 2025 18:13:23 -0400",
    "summary": "Here's how economists identify a recession, and where the U.S. economy currently stands amid market turmoil caused by tariff threats.",
    "story": [
      "As tariff uncertainty continues to\u00a0roil the stock market, some economists believe the U.S. could be headed toward a recession, a possibility that even the Trump administration has declined to rule out.\u00a0But how close are we to a recession, and how will we know when we're in one?",
      "While it is notoriously hard to predict a recession, there are definitive criteria that must be met in order for the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), a nonprofit, nonpartisan research group, to determine a business cycle is recessionary.",
      "\"There's no one agreed-upon definition of a recession, but the most commonly used metric is two back-to-back periods of negative economic growth,\" said CBS MoneyWatch correspondent Kelly O'Grady. \"That would mean that we would see negative growth in U.S. gross domestic product or GDP, over two consecutive quarters.\"",
      "Notably, a financial quarter's growth measure only becomes clear after it's concluded, \"so we wouldn't officially know we're in a recession until we were already in it,\" O'Grady said.",
      "Recessions are generally marked by rising unemployment and a significant decline in economic activity across sectors as consumers cut back on spending and businesses put a freeze on hiring. Since 1929, there have been 14 recessionary periods in the U.S. Most recently, the U.S. economy entered a brief, two-month long recession from February to April 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Although U.S. unemployment ticked up last month, to 4.1% from 4%, it remains low by historical standards. Employers added 151,000 jobs in February, a sign that businesses are still looking to hire.\u00a0Retail sales rose in February, albeit less than expected.",
      "For now, the warning signs aren't yet flashing red, economists say.",
      "\"Right now, things feel uncomfortable given the significant amount of policy uncertainty, the federal layoffs, and we've seen business, consumer and investor sentiment fray,\" Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"So to some it feels like the economy is in a recession, but we are not there yet.\"",
      "Another possibility: stagflation",
      "Still, some economists are warning of another, potentially worse outcome for the U.S. economy: stagflation. That informal term \u2014 a mashup of \"stagnation\" and \"inflation\" \u2014 refers to periods of economic distress when growth falters even as prices remain painfully high. Ordinarily, inflation eases when the economy contracts.",
      "The U.S. last experienced stagflation in the 1970s and early '80s, when oil production became more costly and inflation surged. Reduced consumer spending led to a slowdown in economic growth and increased unemployment.",
      "\"A good way to think about stagflation is an economic balancing problem,\" O'Grady said. \"Let's say you've got high inflation ... that means the economy is supercharged with a lot of demand, which drives part of that inflation. So the federal government will try raising interest rates to make it more costly to borrow money, and then slow down some of that demand.\"",
      "How close are we to entering a recession?",
      "For now, economic data suggests that the risk of the economy entering a recession is relatively low. The U.S. labor market\u00a0continues to create jobs\u00a0at a decent clip and consumer spending remains solid.",
      "\"The unemployment rate is slightly elevated compared to one year ago, and inflation is almost half a percent higher compared to last September,\" O'Grady said. \"These might seem like small signs but when you're taking them with other factors like diminishing consumer sentiment and spending \u2014 and then you've got the wild card of tariffs, there are warning lights of a weakening economy. But we don't have a red light yet.\"",

      "\"Peak U.S. exceptionalism is reflected in record rotation out of U.S. stocks,\" the analysts wrote in the monthly report. Instead, investors with a dimming view of U.S. stocks are increasingly going to cash,\u00a0buying gold and investing in other parts of the world, including the Eurozone, BofA found.",
      "After a two-day rebound, leading market indexes were back in the red on Tuesday. The S&P 500 fell 60 points, or 1.1%, to close at 5,615, the Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 260 points, or 0.6%, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 305 points, or 1.7%.",
      "A major shadow over financial markets is the prospect of steep new U.S. tariffs on key trading partners scheduled to take effect on April 2. Those include 25% duties on U.S. imports from Mexico and Canada, as well as even more sweeping matching levies on a number of other countries.",
      "\"The size, speed and breadth of U.S. tariff hike announcements since January is staggering,\" Brian Coulton, chief economist with Fitch Ratings, said in an email.",
      "The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development on Monday downgraded its forecast for U.S. and global growth, citing the risk of escalating trade disputes. Over the first three months of 2025, the country's gross domestic product is growing at a rate of 1.2%, S&P Global Market Intelligence estimates.",
      "That is markedly slower than the 2.3% recorded in the final quarter of last year. For all of 2024, the economy grew 2.8% on the strength of healthy corporate earnings, frisky job growth and resilient consumer spending.",
      "A stark reality is setting in for investors, according to analysts. President Trump's aggressive rhetoric on trade isn't simply a matter of posturing to gain negotiating leverage with other countries; rather, he's perfectly willing to let tariffs fly as part of a long-term strategy of shoring up key American industries and fostering domestic investment.",
      "Whether that strategy ultimately pays off remains to be seen. For now, however, investors are raising their guard.",
      "\"A lot of articles have appeared in the last couple of sessions suggesting the White House is working on improving its 'messaging' on economic/tariff policies and that's great, but investors shouldn't be fooled about what's coming: The trade/tariff agenda represents a seismic change, and even if one buys the view that this will pay off over time, the near and medium-term will see enormous disruption,\" market analyst Adam Crisafulli, head of Vital Knowledge, told investors in a research note.",
      "To be sure, such disruption could bolster stocks if Mr. Trump were to reverse course on his salvo of tariffs set to be deployed next month. And despite the mounting concerns that such trade measures could tip the economy into a recession, BofA's survey shows that only 11% of fund managers expect a hard landing.",
      "And despite the market turbulence, Bret Kenwell, U.S. investment analyst with eToro, notes that nine of 11 S&P sectors remain in positive territory in 2025. The two sectors that have sunk \u2014 technology and consumer discretionary \u2014 have fallen 7% and nearly 12%, respectively.",
      "\"Because investors' favorite stocks (and those with a heavy weighting in the index) have suffered so much, it's likely impacting investor sentiment disproportionately vs. an otherwise more orderly decline,\" he wrote in a research note. \"Historically, similar levels in sentiment have coincided with at least a short-term bottom in U.S. stocks, although it's not clear that we've seen a capitulatory type move that generally marks the bottom.\"",

      "During the proceedings, Amazon did not contest that the products presented a substantial hazard, but argued that it is not a distributor and is not responsible for protecting the public from products sold by third parties. The company reiterated that stance in a lawsuit filed late last week, describing itself as a logistics provider rather than a distributor.",
      "\"The commission may issue recall orders to the manufacturers, distributors and retailers of a product, but not to third-party logistics providers who store the product in their warehouses and transport it to customers,\" Amazon stated its suit, filed on March 14 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland.",

    "story": [
      "William Smith has long fished the California coast for salmon, taking avid anglers out on his boat in hopes they'll get to wrestle with and reel in the prized catch.",
      "But not anymore.",
      "Smith, known as \"Capt. Smitty,\" now spends time on the seas with aspiring whale watchers, or scattering the ashes of the deceased \u2014 whatever it takes to stay afloat since salmon fishing was barred in California two years ago due to dwindling stocks. Smith said a rise in the Bay Area's Hindu and Buddhist communities has made sea burials more popular, and he now does more than 200 a year \u2014 and that's helping him pay off his $250,000 boat engine.",
      "\"The bills keep going, whether I've got a fishery or not,\" said Smith, who runs Riptide Sportfishing in Half Moon Bay, California. \"There's no season on when people die.\"",
      "California's sport and commercial fishermen have been walloped by two years of salmon closures and are bracing for a potential third, which they blame on a years-earlier drought and state and federal water management policies they say have made it tough for the species to thrive. The closures have taken a toll on people's livelihoods in coastal communities where salmon, fishermen say, is a special fish.",
      "Salmon must swim upstream to lay their eggs, and young fish make their way out to the ocean through California's waterways \u2014 something done more easily when cool water flows are abundant. The fishery has long been strained and the Pacific Fishery Management Council, which manages West Coast fisheries, said there will be very limited salmon fishing this year in California, if at all. A decision is due in April.",
      "The dim outlook comes as President Donald Trump has ordered officials to find ways to put \"people over fish\" and route more water to farmers in California's crop-rich Central Valley and residents of its densely-populated cities. Trump has professed his love for farmers and contends too much heed is paid to the tiny delta smelt, a federally-threatened species seen as an indicator of the health of California's Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta.",
      "But salmon depend on this same water system for their survival. And some in the fishing community are wondering if fishermen aren't people, too.",
      "\"We are people that are hardworking and it's our jobs on the line,\" said Sarah Bates, a commercial fishing captain in San Francisco. She said local markets have been devastated by the salmon closures and Bay Area restaurants aren't snapping up halibut or other catch as they did salmon.",
      "Decline in salmon population",
      "The history of commercial salmon fishing in California dates back more than a century, and in the 1970s and 1980s the fishery thrived off the state's coast. Over time, salmon fishing has declined with swings in stocks amid volatile weather patterns in a drought-prone state and water management decisions about when surface water, and how much of it, should flow to farms, burgeoning cities and the ecologically-sensitive bay delta.",
      "California's salmon fishing industry includes commercial fleets and charters that take anglers out for recreation.",
      "Jamie O'Neill, owner of Seattle-based Dock Street Brokers, said many of California's commercial salmon fishermen are getting out of the business, selling their permits or simply letting them expire. Permits now sell for a fraction of what they used to, and there are fewer than 900 permits compared to 1,200 in 2010, he said.",
      "Charter operators, meanwhile, have branched out to host boat tours and party cruises, especially since short trips require little fuel and can help offset the cost of boat maintenance.",
      "While fishermen can still catch halibut, cod and striped bass along the extensive Pacific coastline, they say without the all-popular King Salmon, anglers just aren't coming like before. Each fish requires a different bait and technique, and a fast-swimming salmon is a fighter that anglers aspire to catch.",

      "Bar Zakheim, owner of Better Place Design & Build, a contracting business in San Diego that specializes in building accessible dwelling units, said Canada remains the best source for lumber.",

Fed Chair Jerome Powell will likely be asked if policymakers see signs that the Trump administration's tariffs could boost inflation, which remains well above the central bank's 2% annual target.",
      "Still, Wall Street analysts expect more volatility in the weeks ahead amid ongoing uncertainty caused by global trade spats. The Trump administration has threatened on April 2 to impose matching tariffs on countries that tax the U.S. That's also the date 25% tariffs on U.S. imports from Mexico and Canada, which had been delayed for a month to allow for negotiations, are set to take effect.",

    "summary": "The first weeks of the new Trump administration have sparked stock market jitters and recession fears. Here's advice from top experts.",
    "story": [
      "Watching your 401(k) plan savings recede as stocks slide can be gut-wrenching, sparking anxiety about whether you'll ever be able to retire \u2014 a particularly loaded issue for Gen Xers, given the oldest members of the generation are hitting 60 this year.",
      "But financial experts say it's important not to panic in the face of plunging markets\u00a0or rising\u00a0recession risks\u00a0because that can lead to rash decisions that cost you money. Instead, it's important to focus on some key investment questions before taking action, they say.",
      "Since his Jan. 20 inauguration, President Trump's tariff barrage has spooked investors and soured consumers on the economy, with many fearing that his trade policies will trigger inflation and slam economic growth. The S&P 500 last week briefly moved into so-called \"correction\" territory, meaning the index had tumbled 10% from its most recent high, although it regained some ground on Friday.",
      "The downdraft in stocks is causing angst among people saving for retirement, experts say.",
      "\"First of all, you aren't alone \u2014 a lot of people are panicking,\" TIAA wealth management director Doug Ornstein told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Don't overreact, but it might be appropriate to take some action.\"",
      "The market turmoil comes as many employees already feel behind the curve, with 7 in 10 workers saying they believe they could work until they retire and still not have enough money to fund their golden years, according to a new Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies report.",
      "\"Everyone is navigating difficult waters right now and trying to understand what the effects of market volatility will be on their overall retirement savings,\" noted Catherine Collinson, CEO and president of the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies. \"One thing they should be doing, but many aren't, is engaging in the basics.\"",
      "Here are some key questions that experts recommend you consider before making changes to your retirement account.",
      "What is your appetite for risk?",
      "It's easy to think you've got a high tolerance for risk when stocks are in a bull market, as they've been for the last few years. But the current market turmoil may be a sign that that you're more cautious than you thought, experts say.",
      "Risk tolerance is sometimes assessed in a quiz (such as this one from Vanguard) that asks hypothetical questions about your approach towards investing, such as whether you might sell a bond if it lost money in a short period of time.",
      "\"How do I think about risk, and how do I feel about risk emotionally and psychologically \u2014 all of that is completely valid to consider,\" TIAA's Ornstein said.",
      "But it's also important to consider your risk capacity, which involves a more complicated calculation including data such as your age and your retirement horizon. That offers a more objective way to assess risk than your emotional reaction to losing money on investment.",
      "\"Both things are really important: How you feel about risk, and what resources do you have\" to manage that risk, he noted.",
      "Is your time horizon really what you think it is?",
      "Workers often think about their investment horizon as the number of years they have left in the workforce, which might seem daunting to a Gen Xer who is getting closer to retirement.",
      "But the truth, which might not be intuitive to some workers, is that this timeframe is likely much longer than you expect, Ornstein said.",
      "\"Let's say someone is 60 and plans to retire at 67 \u2014 they don't have a lot of time for the market to recover\" before they retire, he noted. \"But if you retire at 67 and live to 95, most of your money will probably remain invested for next 20, 25, 30 years.\"",
      "He added, \"We'll see a lot of ups and downs, bull and bear markets, presidential administrations, and economic cycles over the next 20 to 30 years, so what is happening right now shouldn't dictate a massive change.\"",
      "In other words, someone whose retirement is just a few years away might have an actual investment time horizon of 30 years, which means sticking to their financial plan.",
      "More generally, trying to time the market, or trading individual stocks in an effort to capture gains and avoid losses, is almost impossible and typically leads to financial losses and lost opportunities, considerable research\u00a0has found.",
      "Is your investment portfolio sufficiently diversified?",
      "Although it's important not to overreact when markets are rocky, rebalancing your investments can be a good idea is such periods, Ornstein said.",
      "\"Buy and hold works well when the market is just going up and up,\" he said. When markets head south, \"It may be a good time to consider rebalancing into a more diversified mix of investments.\"",
      "For instance, that means not only checking your mix of equities and fixed income, but also your mix of sub-asset classes within those categories. Adding international stocks, for instance, on top of your S&P 500 index fund could help spread the risk, as well as considering different types of fixed income investments aside from Treasuries.",
      "And don't forget to tend to your emergency savings, given that having a cash buffer can help in times of financial stress and keep you from raiding your retirement account, noted Transamerica's Collinson. Her group's research found that 37% of workers have tapped their retirement accounts, suggesting that many people use their 401(k)s as an emergency fund.",
      "Workers can ask their employers to set aside a portion of their paycheck in another bank account that they earmark for emergency savings. Some employers also are starting to enroll workers in accounts specifically designed for emergencies, a change that was enabled by the Secure 2.0 retirement law.",
      "\"The research indicates many workers lack adequate emergency savings,\" she said. \"Now is the time to find out how to build that up.\"",

Mass federal layoffs initiated by the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, have also created tremendous uncertainty for businesses.",
      "Now, the small-cap index is headed toward a bear market, defined by a decline of 20% or more from its most recent high.",
      "\"Some small caps like the Russell 2000 were outperforming the S&P 500 after the election, presumably on the theory that there was going to be substantial deal activity, because these companies are more likely to be acquired and merge than the largest of the large-caps,\" Daniel Hornung, former deputy director of the National Economic Council, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"There was a sense that there was going to be deregulation and easier environment for transactions to occur, but there's a huge amount of uncertainty hanging over the economy and markets right now that makes it really difficult for transactions to happen,\" Hornung explained.",

      "Small companies are more exposed to market shocks than larger ones, given that they operate on thinner margins and typically have higher borrowing costs, making the index more sensitive to changes in the economy.",
      "\"It's more diversified at the sectoral level, so it is more representative of U.S. growth dynamics,\" Skanda Amarnath, a macroeconomist and executive director of Employ America, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Some of the Russell 2000 companies include commercial jet engine company FTAI Aviation, grocery chain Sprouts Farmers Market, plant-based food company Beyond Meat, and language learning tool Duolingo.",
      "Not pointing to a recession",
      "While the Russell 2000 is only two percentage points away from entering bear market territory, Bank of America Research economists say it's not pricing in a recession, and they still expect the economy to grow this year.",
      "\"Historically in recessions the Russell 2000 has sold off close to 40% on average,\" said Jill Carey Hall, head of U.S. small- and mid-cap strategy at Bank of America Research. \"So it's not pricing in greater than a 50% probability of a recession at this point.\"",
      "Still, small businesses could face significant profit margin erosion with tariffs in place.",
      "Based on the levies currently in place on Canada, Mexico and China, and assuming retaliatory tariffs, Bank of America estimates that the earnings hit could be three times larger for small caps than for large caps.",

      "Known as Next Generation Air Dominance, or NGAD, the manned jet will serve as quarterback to a fleet of future drone aircraft designed to be able to penetrate the air defenses of China and any other potential foes. The initial contract to proceed with production on a version for the Air Force version is worth an estimated $20 billion.",
      "Trump, who announced the award at the White House with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Air Force leadership, said the new fighter would be named the F-47. Gen. David Allvin, chief of staff of the Air Force, said, \"We're going to write the next generation of modern aerial warfare with this.\"",
      "Hegseth said the future fleet \"sends a very clear, direct message to our allies that we're not going anywhere.\"",
      "Critics have questioned the cost and the necessity of the program as the Pentagon is still struggling to fully produce its current most advanced jet, the F-35, which is expected to cost taxpayers more than $1.7 trillion over its lifespan. In addition, the Pentagon's future stealth bomber, the B-21 Raider, will have many of the same cutting edge technologies in advanced materials, AI, propulsion and stealth.",
      "More than 1,100 F-35s have already been built for the U.S. and multiple international partners.",
      "A fleet of about 100 future B-21 stealth bombers at an estimated total cost of at least $130 billion is also planned. The first B-21 aircraft are now in test flights.",

The total costs coming down the road will be hundreds of billions of dollars.\"",

The agency said in a statement that it will \"reduce its workforce by 43%\" and said the cuts would save more than $435 million a year by next fiscal year.",
      "\"The strategic reorganization will begin a turnaround for the agency by restoring the efficiency of the first Trump Administration, as well as its focus on promoting small businesses,\" the agency said. \"Core services to the public, including the agency's loan guarantee and disaster assistance programs, as well as its field and veteran operations, will not be impacted.\"",

This agency is done wasting millions of tax dollars to fund a progressive pandemic-era bureaucracy. We will not allow fiscal mismanagement to threaten our loan programs or criminals to get away with fraud. But we will evaluate every program and expenditure and we will rightsize the agency to transform the SBA into a high-efficiency engine for America's entrepreneurs and taxpayers.\"",

      "Minnesota Sen. Justin Eichorn resigned from the state Senate on Thursday in the wake of\u00a0a federal criminal charge accusing him of soliciting sex from someone he thought was 17, but turned out to be an undercover cop.",
      "The move comes after Eichorn's colleagues in the Republican caucus said they would vote to expel him from the chamber if he did not step down. Democrats were prepared to join them to clear the two-thirds majority hurdle needed for expulsion.",
      "Eichorn, a Republican from Grand Rapids, is charged with attempted coercion or enticement of a minor. Prosecutors said he answered an online ad that was part of an operation targeting sex trafficking by Bloomington police and other law enforcement.",
      "Eichorn has not made any public statement since the arrest but sent a brief letter signed by him to Gov. Tim Walz and legislative leaders announcing his plan to leave office. He appeared in court for the first time on Thursday afternoon.",
      "\"I am resigning my seat in the Minnesota Senate for District 6 effective immediately,\" he wrote. \"I must focus on personal matters at this time. It has been an honor to serve in the Minnesota Senate.\"",
      "The fallout at the state capitol was swift following his arrest. Senate Republicans called on him to resign, as did other lawmakers across party lines in both chambers. The GOP caucus reiterated that call on Wednesday afternoon.",
      "Later that day, Johnson said they would bring forward a motion to remove him Thursday morning during the floor session. That is now moot since he submitted his resignation letter.",
      "\"The charges that he's been accused of are so severe, and the transcript, based on the reports, are very damning. And so even though that has not been done, the expulsion has not been done on the floor before, we felt that the charges warranted that,\" Johnson told reporters Thursday.",
      "The Senate DFL caucus joined Republicans calling for him to step aside, calling the details of the felony allegations \"horrifying.\" They would've voted to expel him, too, they said. If they had, it would've been a historic event in the Minnesota Legislature. While there have been motions to expel members before, none of them have ever passed, according to the Minnesota Legislative Reference Library, which notes that its archive doesn't include all records dating back to statehood. But researchers have never found evidence that it's happened before.",
      "\"The safety of the interns who come here to work and learn, the safety and security of the staff who put their days in here were incompatible with the predatory nature of Mr. Eichorn's behavior as reported in the criminal complaint,\" said Sen. Erin Murphy, DFL-Saint Paul.",
      "The Senate GOP has previously tried to expel Sen. Nicole Mitchell, DFL-Woodbury, who is charged with felony burglary in state court\u00a0for allegedly breaking into her stepmother's home last April. She has pleaded not guilty and will stand trial in June and she has resisted calls to step aside from Republicans and some in her own party. Those efforts\u00a0didn't advance to a final vote due\u00a0to procedural setbacks.",
      "When asked by reporters why Murphy isn't pushing for Mitchell to step down, Murphy replied, \"The difference between the dispute with Senator Mitchell and this is night and day.\"",
      "According to court documents, Eichorn texted the number posted and inquired about the sex acts and the cost. Days after initial contact, police arrested him Monday during an arranged meeting between Eichorn and the purported teenager, during which officers found $130 cash and a condom in his car.",
      "The criminal complaint said Eichorn in one text exchange was alerted of the person's age and replied, \"It's [sic] says age of consent is 16.\"",
      "With Eichorn's resignation, the balance of power in the chamber remains unchanged \u2014 Democrats will still have their one-seat majority.",
      "Walz will have to call a special election to fill the vacancy.",
      "Eichorn makes 1st court appearance",
      "The 40-year-old Eichorn appeared before a judge for the first time Thursday afternoon.",
      "The now-former state senator didn't say much in his first public appearance, but he didn't have to. The judge read him his Miranda rights and then read him a lengthy list of the conditions of his release once a spot in a halfway house becomes available. He'll have GPS monitoring and be forbidden from contact with anyone under 18 and barred from computer access.",
      "Besides the high-profile suspect, this a unique case \u2014 a local investigation that at first brought state charges, but then the federal government got involved and took over.",
      "Legal analysts WCCO spoke with said that's more than just a symbolic choice. If convicted, Eichorn is likely to be sentenced to federal prison.",
      "\"There's a huge difference in penalties. In state court, a person would rarely ever go to prison on a child solicitation. The only times you would ever see that happen is if the person has a very bad criminal history,\" criminal defense attorney Joe Tamburino said. \"But normally there's not a prison sentence, whereas in federal court there would be a prison sentence in many situations the mandatory minimum of 10 years would apply.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Social Security Administration's plan to require in-person identity checks for millions of new and existing recipients while simultaneously closing government offices has sparked a furor among lawmakers, advocacy groups and program recipients who are worried that the government is placing unnecessary barriers in front of an already vulnerable population.",
      "The new requirements will impact anyone who needs to verify their bank information with the agency, as well as families with children who receive Social Security benefits and cannot verify a child's information on the SSA website. They are intended to combat fraud and waste within the system, which President Trump and officials in his administration have claimed are widespread.",
      "The agency announced Tuesday that, beginning March 31, those who cannot properly verify their identity over the agency's \"my Social Security\" online service will be required to visit an agency field office in person to complete the verification process. They also announced recently that Social Security field offices across the country will be closing.",
      "Of the 47 SSA field offices listed for closure on the website for the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE, 26 are slated for closure this year, with some taking effect as early as next month, according to an Associated Press analysis of the data.",
      "That change, in addition to the impending closure of field offices across the country, and a plan to reduce the agency workforce with mass layoffs, could result in massive delays to services, advocates say. Nancy LeaMond of the AARP said eliminating phone verification \"will result in more headaches and longer wait times to resolve routine customer service needs.\"",
      "Leamond, the AARP's chief advocacy and engagement officer, said the announcement \"not only comes as a total surprise but is on an impractical fast-track.\"",
      "\"SSA needs to be transparent about its service changes and seek input from the older Americans who will be affected. Because any delay in Social Security caused by this change can mean real economic hardship,\" LeaMond said.",
      "Agency leaders said Tuesday that the agency would begin training frontline employees and management about the new policy for the next two weeks.",
      "Pushback from Democrats came quickly. A group of 62 House Democrats wrote Wednesday to the agency's acting commissioner, Leland Dudek, to express concern about how the changes could hurt older beneficiaries in remote areas and people with limited internet access.",
      "\"Requiring beneficiaries to seek assistance exclusively online, through artificial intelligence, or in person at SSA field offices would create additional barriers, particularly for those who live far from an office,\" they wrote. \"We strongly urge you to consider the individuals who may be harmed.\"",

However, congressional testimony from an official with the SSA inspector general in May 2023 said that \"from January 2013 through May 2018 fraudsters redirected $33.5 million in benefits intended for 20,878 beneficiaries\" and made unauthorized direct deposit changes through the agency's website.",
      "The agency distributes roughly $1.6 trillion in old-age and disability benefits annually.",
      "The end of phone service identification could be dramatic for some recipients, including families with children who will be required to visit an SSA office, since children can't open online accounts through the \"my Social Security\" online service.",
      "Nancy Altman, president of Social Security Works, said \"this will make it far harder for the American people to claim their earned benefits. It could even cause major delays, and ultimately collapse the system, by overwhelming the field offices.\"",

      "At the time, a vital USAID payment system had yet to be restored.

The spokesperson said a review of the agency's grants and programs ordered by Secretary of State Marco Rubio \"exposed serious flaws in the legacy systems used to approve and issue payments at USAID.\"",
      "\"This has caused significant unforeseen delays and prompted the Administration to take unprecedented steps to implement more streamlined processes,\" the spokesperson said. \"USAID has 27 payment and finance systems, all of which have been found to be inefficient, broken, and built to intentionally make communication with other systems in the federal government impossible.\"",
      "Those unforeseen delays have rippled out beyond Edesia, Salem said.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration says it's cutting $175 million in funding to the University of Pennsylvania over policies allowing transgender women to compete in women's sports.",
      "White House officials wrote in an email to CBS Philadelphia that the funding cut is connected to Lia Thomas, a transgender woman and former Penn swimmer who made headlines and drew backlash when she competed for the women's swimming team.",
      "\"UPenn infamously permitted a male to compete on its women's swimming team, overturning multiple records hard-earned by women, and granting the fully intact male access to the locker room. This is NOT the result of the Title IX investigation launched by the Department of Education,\" a senior White House official wrote in the email.",
      "Thomas came in first in the 500-meter freestyle at the 2022 NCAA Swimming and Diving Championships and had other top finishes in events at the Ivy League Championships that year.",
      "Some women swimmers disputed those wins. A lawsuit filed in a Massachusetts federal court seeks to have her records removed from the record books. Separately, the Education Department launched a Title IX investigation into Penn allowing Thomas to compete on the women's swimming team.",
      "At the time, NCAA regulations allowed for trans women to compete on teams that aligned with their gender identity. President Trump undid those protections in an executive order signed in February.",
      "A senior White House official said in an email that the funding is an \"immediate proactive action to review discretionary funding streams to those universities.\" The funding that was paused came from the Department of Defense and the Department of Health and Human Services.",
      "A Penn spokesperson said Wednesday the Philadelphia-based university is aware of media reports and social media posts about the funding being pulled, but has received no formal notice from the White House.",
      "In a statement Thursday, a Penn spokesperson said the university \"has always followed NCAA and conference policies regarding student participation on athletic teams and is in full compliance with the recent changes to the NCAA rules that were made in response to the executive order from the Trump administration regarding transgender athletes. The University does not have a policy that is separate from its governing bodies.\"",
      "\"NCAA policies have evolved over the years,\" the statement continued. \"Beginning in 2010, the NCAA required that transgender student athletes have access to participation on college teams. In February of this year, after the Trump administration's executive order banning the participation of transgender athletes in women's sports, the NCAA revised its policy in compliance with the executive order, as did our conference. Penn is in full compliance with this most recent change.\"",
      "Wednesday morning, the White House's\u00a0@RapidResponse47 account shared a clip from Fox Business on X\u00a0on the news.",
      "The White House official said Wednesday's action is separate from an Education Department investigation into Penn over alleged violations of Title IX, a 1972 law barring sex discrimination in education.",
      "City Councilmember Jamie Gauthier, whose district includes Penn's campus, denounced the decision in a statement.",
      "\"These funds have nothing to do with transgender student athletes \u2014 this is nothing more than a hollow pretext to target our community,\" Gauthier's statement said in part. \"What Trump is really doing is threatening tens of thousands of jobs, our hospitals, lifesaving research projects, educational programs for underserved youth, and so much more.\"",
      "Gauthier added that some prior actions from the Trump administration have not held up to lawsuits and that she is proud that many transgender Philadelphians call her district home.",
      "\"They make our community stronger and a better place to live. I will always stand with them,\" Gauthier said.",
      "Gauthier also said the move is not about athletics but about attacking Philadelphia.",
      "\"I believe this is about President Trump trying to attack Democratic cities like Philadelphia. He understands we are an 'eds and meds' economy and he's trying to take aim at the city. This is meant to divide us,\" she said.",

      "In an order later in the day, Judge Patricia Tolliver Giles said Suri \"shall not be removed from the United States unless and until the Court issues a contrary order.\"",
      "The complaint filed by Suri's attorneys said he was surrounded and detained by masked DHS agents as he was returning to his home in Rosslyn, Virginia, where he lives with his wife Mapheze Saleh and their three children, after breaking his fast for Ramadan on March 17.",
      "\"The agents identified themselves as members of the Department of Homeland Security and stated that the government had revoked his visa,\" the complaint said, adding that \"the agents had face coverings and Ms. Saleh could only see their eyes.\"",
      "Roughly two hours after his arrest, Suri called his wife to let her know that he was being sent to a detention center in Farmville, Virginia, his attorneys said. They added that they believe he is likely to be moved to a detention facility in Los Fresnos, Texas, near the U.S.-Mexico border. As of Thursday, Immigration and Customs Enforcement's online detainee locator showed Suri was being held at a detention facility in Louisiana. His lawyers have filed a motion seeking his return to Virginia.",
      "Suri's attorneys said his \"unjustified detention\" violated his due process rights. They argued that the Trump administration's targeting of noncitizens for removal based on protected speech, namely his and his wife's views of Israel and Gaza, is \"arbitrary and capricious\" and constitutes viewpoint discrimination. They said that he has no criminal record and has not been charged with any crime.",
      "The complaint alleged that the couple had \"long been doxxed and smeared\" online by an \"anonymously-run blacklisting site\" known as The Canary Mission. The site alleges that Saleh, who Suri's attorneys said is a U.S. citizen, \"has worked for Hamas, expressed support for Hamas terrorism and called for Israel's destruction,\" according to a profile dedicated to her on the site. The Canary Mission, the complaint said, runs a blacklist of individuals who its creators believe support Palestinian rights and \"is infamous for bullying, slandering, and defaming academics and students.\" The complaint also alleges that the couple were \"smeared\" by other websites.",
      "A Georgetown University spokesperson said Suri obtained his visa in order \"to continue his doctoral research on peacebuilding in Iraq and Afghanistan.\"",
      "\"We are not aware of him engaging in any illegal activity, and we have not received a reason for his detention,\" the school spokesperson told CBS News. \"We support our community members' rights to free and open inquiry, deliberation and debate, even if the underlying ideas may be difficult, controversial or objectionable. We expect the legal system to adjudicate this case fairly.\"",
      "In its own statement, a spokesperson for DHS told CBS News that Suri was a \"foreign exchange student at Georgetown University actively spreading Hamas propaganda and promoting antisemitism on social media.\"",
      "The DHS spokesperson claimed that Suri had \"close connections to a known or suspected terrorist, who is a senior adviser to Hamas.\"",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued a determination on March 15 that \"Suri's activities and presence in the United States rendered him deportable\" under the Immigration and Nationality Act, the spokesperson added.",
      "The detention follows ICE agents' controversial March 8 arrest in New York City\u00a0of Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University student and green card holder who was involved in the 2024 pro-Palestinian campus protests.",
      "The 30-year-old Khalil, an Algerian national who was born in Syria to Palestinian parents, is also being held in Louisiana detention facility. Khalil was arrested in front of his wife, who was eight-months pregnant at the time.",
      "In a statement to CBS News last week, DHS alleged Khalil's arrest was \"in support of President Trump's executive orders prohibiting anti-Semitism,\" alleging the former student \"led activities aligned to Hamas,\" but without providing evidence of the claim or detailing any alleged criminal charges against him.",
      "A federal judge ruled Wednesday that Khalil's case can be heard in New Jersey, rather than New York or Louisiana. Khalil was briefly held at a detention facility in New Jersey before being moved to Louisiana.",

    "published": "Thu, 20 Mar 2025 16:43:38 -0400",
    "summary": "A federal judge granted a temporary restraining order in the challenge brought by unions who argued DOGE's access was unlawful.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Thursday temporarily blocked the White House's Department of Government Efficiency from accessing systems at the Social Security Administration containing the sensitive information of millions of Americans, delivering another setback to President Trump's efforts to overhaul the federal government.",
      "U.S. District Judge Ellen Hollander wrote in a 137-page decision that a group of unions challenging DOGE's access to systems of records at the SSA was likely to succeed on its claims that the efforts violated the Privacy Act and a federal law that governs the agency rulemaking process.",
      "She granted a request for a temporary restraining order that was sought by the labor unions, which filed a lawsuit in February that challenged the legality of the SSA's decision to allow DOGE to get its hands on sensitive, personal and confidential information pertaining to millions of Americans.",
      "\"The defense does not appear to share a privacy concern for the millions of Americans whose SSA records were made available to the DOGE affiliates, without their consent, and which contain sensitive, confidential, and personally identifiable information,\" wrote Hollander, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama.",
      "The judge's order blocks officials at the SSA from granting DOGE access to systems containing Americans' personal information. It also requires Elon Musk, DOGE and its team members at the agency to delete all non-anonymized personal information that they obtained from the SSA, and prevents them from accessing any agency computer or software code.",
      "Lee Saunders, president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, cheered the decision as a win for American workers and retirees across the country.",
      "\"The court saw that Elon Musk and his unqualified lackeys present a grave danger to Social Security and have illegally accessed the data of millions of Americans,\" Saunders said in a statement. \"This decision will not only force them to delete any data they have currently saved, but it will also block them from further sharing, accessing or disclosing our Social Security information.\"",
      "The Justice Department has said that 10 members of the DOGE team are working at the SSA, and seven of them have had access to personal information housed in its data systems.",
      "In her opinion, Hollander said that the Trump administration failed to provide the court with a reasonable explanation for why the DOGE team needs access to the data maintained in the SSA's systems to root out fraud and abuse.",
      "\"Defendants disregarded protocols for proper hiring, onboarding, training, and access limitations, and, in a rushed fashion, provided access to a massive amount of sensitive, confidential data to members of the DOGE Team, without any articulated explanation for the need to do so,\" she wrote.",
      "The judge, who sits on the district court in Baltimore, knocked the Justice Department for withholding the names of the DOGE team members in an effort to protect their privacy, but allowing access to millions of Americans' personal information.",
      "The Trump administration, she said, \"have not shown the same level of care with the far more sensitive, confidential data of millions of Americans who entrusted their government with their personal and private information. The trust appears to have been violated, without any articulated need.\"",
      "\"The American public may well applaud and support the Trump administration's mission to root out fraud, waste, and bloat from federal agencies, including SSA, to the extent it exists. But, by what means and methods?\" Hollander said. \"The DOGE Team is essentially engaged in a fishing expedition at SSA, in search of a fraud epidemic, based on little more than suspicion.\"",
      "She accused the Trump administration of giving DOGE \"unbridled access\" to millions of Americans' private data, including their Social Security numbers, medical records, drivers' license numbers, bank and credit card information, tax information, income and work history and their home and work addresses.",
      "\"This intrusion into the personal affairs of millions of Americans \u2014 absent an adequate explanation for the need to do so \u2014 is not in the public interest,\" she said. \"To be sure, rooting out possible fraud, waste, and mismanagement in the SSA is in the public interest. But, that does not mean that the government can flout the law to do so. The president's advisors and employees are not exempt from the statutes Congress enacted to protect American citizens from overbroad and unnecessary access to their [personal information].\"",
      "Mr. Trump established DOGE on his first day back in the White House and has said that he tasked Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, with heading the initiative. The White House has said, though, that Amy Gleason, who worked at DOGE's predecessor entity, is formally the administrator of DOGE. The task force's employees have been dispatched to more than a dozen federal agencies as part of the president's plan to shrink the size of the government.",
      "But DOGE's actions, and specifically access to sensitive government databases, has raised concerns about whether they are complying with a federal law that aims to protect Americans' private information. Lawsuits have been brought seeking to restrict DOGE's access at least five other agencies, as well as claiming that Musk's actions are unconstitutional.",
      "Just earlier this week, another federal judge in Maryland found that Musk and DOGE likely violated the Constitution's Appointments Clause and the separation of powers when they unilaterally acted to shut down the U.S. Agency for International Development.",

    "summary": "How likely is it that some of these judges facing scrutiny from President Trump will be impeached?",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0President Trump this week joined the growing chorus of calls to punish federal judges who rule against his administration. But impeachment and removal are unlikely under the current makeup of Congress.",
      "The recent calls to impeach federal judges increased earlier this week when Mr. Trump posted on social media that a U.S. district judge overseeing his administration's efforts to deport Venezuelan migrants suspected of being gang members should be impeached.",
      "While the attack by Mr. Trump marked the first time he called for a judge to be impeached, his Republican allies and Elon Musk, a senior White House adviser, have for weeks been denouncing members of the judiciary who have been overseeing the myriad legal challenges to the president's policies and ruled against the administration.",
      "In the House, a small group of hard-right Republican lawmakers have introduced or signed onto resolutions to impeach four of those judges. While it's unlikely the efforts will gain enough traction to result in their removals, they have reignited the debate over impeachment and the high bar for removal for high crimes and misdemeanors.",
      "The GOP calls to impeach a federal judge",
      "The president called for U.S. District Judge James Boasberg's impeachment in a post on social media Tuesday, saying without naming him that \"This judge, like many of the Crooked Judges' I am forced to appear before, should be IMPEACHED!\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt continued the attacks on Boasberg and other judges who have issued preliminary rulings against the administration.",
      "\"The judges in this country are acting erroneously,\" she told reporters during a press briefing. \"We have judges who are acting as partisan activists from the bench. They are trying to dictate policy from the president of the United States. They are trying to clearly slowwalk this administration's agenda and it's unacceptable.\"",
      "Leavitt said the president \"has made it clear that he believes this judge in this case should be impeached.\" She noted that the White House will comply with judicial orders and mount appeals of adverse rulings, as it has done so far but accused judges of undermining the will of the Americans who voted for Mr. Trump.",
      "Freshman Rep. Brandon Gill, a Texas Republican, on Tuesday filed articles of impeachment against Boasberg after Mr. Trump's post, alleging on social media that Boasberg \"is guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors and should be removed from office.\" Five Republicans have signed onto the impeachment articles as cosponsors.",
      "Impeachment resolutions have also been introduced against U.S. District Judges Paul Engelmayer, John Bates and Amir Ali. GOP Rep. Andrew Clyde of Georgia said last month that he was going to draft impeachment articles against U.S. District Judge John McConnell, but they do not appear to have been filed.",
      "How does impeachment work?",
      "Under the Constitution, the basis for impeachment is \"high Crimes and Misdemeanors.\" It's highly unlikely any of the judges who are targets of impeachment resolutions have met that high hurdle.",
      "As with presidential impeachments, the power to impeach, convict and remove judges falls to Congress. While the House has impeachment power, under the Constitution, the Senate is responsible for holding a trial to determine if impeached officials are guilty and should be removed from their post.",
      "After lawmakers bring articles of impeachment in the House, the articles must be adopted by a simple majority for impeachment. The House then transmits the impeachment articles to the Senate, which has the \"sole Power\" under the Constitution to hold a trial that could lead to conviction and removal from office.",
      "But the Senate has a high bar for conviction, with a two-thirds majority required. Although Republicans have a majority in the upper chamber, with 53 seats, that falls short of the 67 senators needed to find an official guilty and remove them from office.",
      "The next steps in Congress",
      "How congressional leaders proceed to be seen.",
      "White House deputy chief of staff James Blair told Politico that \"it'll be up to the speaker\" to determine what can be passed and whether to pursue impeachment proceedings, while noting that the president is simply \"highlighting a critical issue.\"",
      "\"I think the president is right, we should impeach activist, partisan judges,\" Blair said. \"The question is, will that happen?\"",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson would have a number of choices if lawmakers choose to force a vote with a privileged resolution, including bringing the impeachment articles up for a risky vote, setting up a vote to table the measure, or referring it to committee.",
      "An impeachment resolution would be referred to the House Judiciary Committee for an investigation, where hearings would likely be held before advancing the impeachment articles before the full chamber. The panel's chairman, Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, told CNN on Wednesday that for House Republicans and the Judiciary Committee, \"all options are still on the table.\"",
      "Impeachment proceedings would likely consume valuable time and attention that congressional Republicans are hoping to reserve for a massive budget package that would allow the president to implement much of his agenda.",
      "Asked whether an impeachment trial could impede the White House's agenda, Blair said he doubts \"a bunch of floor time will be spent on something if they strongly feel like they can't get the votes.\"",
      "How has impeachment been used against judges in the past?",
      "Just 14 federal judges and one Supreme Court justice have ever been impeached by the House and eight were convicted by the Senate and removed from office, according to the Federal Judicial Center.",
      "Who are the judges targeted for impeachment?",
      "Republicans have introduced impeachment resolutions against four judges on the U.S. district courts after they issued preliminary decisions against the Trump administration.",
      "Paul Engelmayer: A judge on the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, Engelmayer was appointed by former President Barack Obama in 2011 and confirmed 98-0 by the Senate. The impeachment resolution against him claims he \"engaged in judicial misconduct\" because he temporarily blocked Trump administration officials from accessing sensitive Treasury Department databases last month.",

      "Amir Ali: Ali sits on the district court in Washington, D.C., and was appointed by former President Joe Biden. The Senate confirmed him in a 50-49 vote. Ali is overseeing a challenge to Mr. Trump's freeze on foreign assistance and issued a temporary order that required the administration to reinstate funding for foreign aid contracts and other awards while legal proceedings moved forward.",

      "John Bates: Appointed to the district court in Washington, D.C., by former President George W. Bush in 2001, Bates' nomination was approved by the Senate in a unanimous 97-0 vote.

      "What have the judges said?",
      "Following Mr. Trump's call for Boasberg to be impeached, Chief Justice John Roberts, the head of the federal judiciary, issued a rare statement rebuking the attack.",
      "\"For more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision. The normal appellate review process exists for that purpose,\" the chief justice said.",
      "While Roberts' statement was rare, it is not the first time he has spoken out in response to heated comments from politicians.",
      "In March 2020, the chief justice denounced comments from Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, made outside the Supreme Court as \"inappropriate\" and \"dangerous.\"",
      "\"Justices know that criticism comes with the territory, but threatening statements of this sort from the highest levels of government are not only inappropriate, they are dangerous,\" Roberts said in the statement released by the Supreme Court.",
      "In 2018, he pushed back against comments Mr. Trump made during his first term about a judge who ruled against one of his asylum policies. The president called the judge an \"Obama judge.\"",
      "The U.S. doesn't have \"Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges. What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi and top Justice Department officials said the government may invoke state secrets privilege to block a federal judge from viewing specific information about two deportation flights of alleged Tren de Aragua gang members, court filings Wednesday show.",
      "In a filing excoriating D.C. District Chief Judge James Boasberg for demanding detailed information about the flights, the Justice Department said, \"Continuing to beat a dead horse solely for the sake of prying from the Government legally immaterial facts and wholly within a sphere of core functions of the Executive Branch is both purposeless and frustrating to the consideration of the actual legal issues at stake in this case.\" The filing was signed by Bondi and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, as well as top Justice Department officials Emil Bove and Chad Mizelle.",
      "The government argued that Boasberg's demands for detailed information about the two flights from the U.S. to El Salvador on Saturday \"represent grave usurpations of the President's powers under the Alien Enemies Act and his inherent Article II powers.\"",
      "The 1798 Alien Enemies Act allows foreigners to be summarily arrested, detained and deported, without the due process protections outlined in U.S. immigration law, including opportunities to see a judge and request asylum. Instead, they may be treated as enemy aliens and processed under America's wartime laws. President Trump invoked the act Saturday and used it to send the two planes to El Salvador.",
      "On Saturday, Boasberg blocked the flights and ordered them to be turned around if they were already in the air. But the government said that the flights were already in international airspace when he issued his order and argued the judge lacked jurisdiction to order their redirection. The planes landed in El Salvador on Saturday night, the Trump administration said. In its filing Wednesday, the Justice Department claimed that disclosing some of the operational information to the court \"could implicate the affairs of United States allies and their cooperation with the United States Government in fighting terrorist organizations.\"",
      "The department argued that the disclosure \"would unquestionably create serious repercussions for the Executive Branch's ability to conduct foreign affairs.\"",
      "Boasberg, who was frustrated by the government's lack of details on the flights and deportation operations during the hearing on Monday, ordered the government to answer a number of questions by noon Thursday, including what time the two planes had departed from U.S. soil, their points of departure, what time the planes left U.S. airspace, when they landed, and what time the alleged gang members were transferred out of U.S. custody.",
      "Bondi criticized Boasberg for requesting the information in the first place, repeatedly accusing him of \"micromanagement of immaterial fact finding.\"",
      "\"The court has now spent more time trying to ferret out information about the government's flight schedules and relations with foreign countries than it did in investigating the facts before certifying the class action in this case,\" they said in the filing. \"That observation reflects how upside-down this case has become, as digressive micromanagement has outweighed consideration of the case's legal issues.\"",
      "They continued to argue that answering the questions posed by Boasberg would subject the government to \"a serious risk of micromanaged and unnecessary judicial fishing expeditions and potential public disclosure.\"",
      "In an order granting the government an additional day to comply with his order, Boasberg also criticized the Justice Department's claim that their responses to his questions would compromise sensitive information, writing that \"the Secretary of State has revealed many operational details of the flights, including the number of people involved in the flights, many of their identities, the facility to which they were brought, their manner of treatment, and the time window during which these events occurred.\"",
      "The federal civil lawsuit against Mr. Trump and other administration officials was filed by five Venezuelan men in immigration custody in Texas and New York local jails.",
      "Boasberg's ruling prevents the deportations of the plaintiffs and migrants for 14 days. The Justice Department has appealed the case to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.",
      "On Tuesday, lawyers representing the Venezuelan migrants suing the Trump administration warned that failing to block the president from its use would mean anyone could be treated as an enemy alien.",
      "\"The implications of the government's position are staggering. If the President can designate any group as enemy aliens under the Act, and that designation is unreviewable, then there is no limit on who can be sent to a Salvadoran prison, or any limit on how long they will remain there,\" they wrote in a filing to the appellate court.",
      "Despite Boasberg's ruling, 261 people were deported to El Salvador Saturday, 137 of whom were removed under the Alien Enemies Act over alleged gang ties, a senior administration official said. There are about 250 other alleged Tren de Aragua members still in the United States that the Trump administration is hoping to deport, court filings show.",

      "U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell swiftly moved to consider whether to void the removal of several board members just days after some of them received an email from the White House Presidential Personnel Office informing them that they had been terminated. She was also asked to block staff with DOGE\u00a0from having access to the Institute of Peace facilities.",
      "Howell, who sits on the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., convened a hearing Wednesday afternoon after five of the removed board members \u2014 Ambassador John Sullivan, Judy Ansley, Joseph Falk, Kerry Kennedy and Mary Swig \u2014 filed a lawsuit Tuesday that challenged their firing and what they said was an \"unlawful assault\" on the Institute of Peace, which was established by Congress in 1984.",
      "In addition to the board members, the institute's president, George Moose, was also fired by ex officio board members, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Vice Admiral Peter Garvin. Kenneth Jackson was then installed as the acting president of the Institute of Peace.",
      "Howell said that \"none of the requirements for removal of a board member were met\" in this case, and added that even if she did reinstate them, because of the president's control over the agency, their power during the period when they were reinstated would be \"very limited.\"",
      "In denying the former board members' request for relief, Howell said it is \"undisputed\" that their removals were not in accordance with federal law, but found that they had not made the required showing for a temporary restraining order.",
      "Still, Howell had harsh words for DOGE and Trump administration officials' treatment of Institute of Peace employees, including Moose.",
      "\"I am very offended by how DOGE has operated at the institute and treated American citizens trying to do a job that they were\" tasked to do, she said.",
      "The dispute over the Institute of Peace burst into public view earlier this week when DOGE team members attempted to gain access to the entity's Washington, D.C., headquarters. The institute said in a statement Saturday that several DOGE members arrived at its building \"unannounced\" on Friday and were accompanied by two FBI agents.",
      "The officials were met by the institute's outside counsel, George Foote, who informed them of the organization's \"private and independent status as a non-executive branch agency,\" according to the statement. The DOGE representatives then left, the agency said.",
      "But on Monday, Moose, the institute's removed president, said in a statement that DOGE had \"broken\" into the building and were able to gain access through an employee of the Institute of Peace's former security contractor, Inter-Con Security Systems, according to court filings.",
      "Foote, the outside counsel, told the Inter-Con employees they were trespassing and called the Washington, D.C., Metropolitan Police Department to report their entry, according to the filings.",
      "The institute board members said in their lawsuit that Inter-Con and DOGE personnel \"engaged in additional attempts to unlawfully access the USIP headquarters building, but were eventually able to enter the building, forcibly occupy it, and expel including the duly appointed USIP President, other USIP personnel, and outside counsel.\"",
      "The board members had asked Howell to issue a temporary restraining order blocking Jackson, Trump administration officials and DOGE employees from accessing the Institute of Peace's facilities, computer systems or records. They also sought an order declaring their removal unlawful and void, and preventing their firing.",

      "A Republican Minnesota state senator\u00a0arrested earlier this week after an alleged attempt to solicit sex from a minor faces federal charges.",
      "On Wednesday, Sen. Justin Eichorn of Grand Rapids was federally charged with attempted coercion and enticement of a minor.",
      "\"The U.S. Attorney's Office has no tolerance for public officials who violate federal law \u2014 particularly those laws meant to protect children,\" Acting U.S. Attorney Lisa D. Kirkpatrick said.",
      "Eichorn, 40, was also initially charged in Hennepin County with prostitution. The exact charge alleges he \"intentionally hired or offered or agreed to hire an individual who [he] believes to be under the age of 18 years, but at least 16 years of age, to engage in sexual penetration or sexual contact.\"",
      "However, the state charge was later dropped because Eichorn was federally charged on the same allegations, which the county attorney's office says is \"common practice.\"",
      "According to the federal charges, Eichorn's arrest was the result of an undercover operation to target commercial sex involving juveniles, which began earlier this month.",
      "\"Law enforcement placed online advertisements offering commercial sex. Unbeknownst to the prospective sex buyers, it was in fact undercover law enforcement officers who received and responded to the messages,\" the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Minnesota said in a release.",
      "On March 11, undercover officers began receiving messages from Eichorn where he, according to the federal complaint, said, \"I saw your post and [sic] change you are still available tonight?\" and \"What's a guy [sic] gota tdo to get with the hottest girl online tonight.\"",
      "During the conversations, the \"girl\" gave her age as 17 multiple times, according to the federal complaint. After one such instance, Eichorn replied, \"I think age of consent is 17 when do ya turn 18 ... It's [sic] says age of consent is 16 ... over 18 is in a position of authority over you like a teacher or friends [sic] parent,\" that complaint states.",
      "Eichorn also asked for pictures multiple times, including \"a naught [sic] pic of you to show me your [sic] real,\" charges state.",
      "Eichorn allegedly arranged to meet with the girl in Bloomington, where he was arrested on Monday. Police searched him and his vehicle, finding two cellphones \u2014 which will also be searched \u2014 a condom and cash, the state complaint said.",
      "After his arrest, Republicans and Democrats in both chambers of the state legislature called for his resignation.",
      "On Tuesday, the Senate GOP caucus put out a statement together, saying he should step down. Sen. Minority Leader Mark Johnson, R-East Grand Forks, told reporters Wednesday that the additional revelations outlined in the charging documents made his Republicans \"more adamant\" in their request.",
      "\"I haven't had time to process the charges themselves. I know there are some challenging things within there,\" he said. \"But again, until we get some more information and look through that \u2014 it's a very, very unfortunate situation, and we've asked for resignation based on the charges and based on the information that we have.\"",
      "Senate Republicans announced they will make a motion on Thursday morning to expel Eichorn.",
      "DFL Gov. Tim Walz also said he should resign because elected officials are held to a higher standard.",
      "\"You cannot prey on our children and expect to get away with it,\" he said.",
      "State DFL Party and at least one DFL senator have called for him to step down. DFL Senate Minority Leader Erin Murphy in a statement called the allegations \"deeply disturbing\" but stopped short of a call for resignation.",
      "He was also one of the GOP lawmakers who called for DFL Sen. Nicole Mitchell to resign after she was charged with felony burglary last April. She has remained in office and has pleaded not guilty. Her trial is set for June.",

      "A jury delivered a string of guilty verdicts Wednesday afternoon in what prosecutors call the largest pandemic fraud case in the country.",

      "The jury began deliberating Wednesday and, within about five hours, reached guilty verdicts on multiple criminal counts, including conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to commit federal programs bribery. Every count the jury considered came back with a guilty verdict.",
      "The judge ruled that they remain in custody, saying that because their \"fraud scene was premised on deception,\" the court had concerns they would use similar tactics to flee.",
      "\"Both displayed patterns of deception and an absolute inability to comply with authority,\" the judge said.",
      "Said owned and operated Safari Restaurant, a site that received more than $16 million in fraudulent funds. Prosecutors say it was a team effort, alleging that Said devised fake meal counts, rosters and invoices and Bock submitted them to the state department for funding.",
      "The pair \"worked together every step of the way to carry out this fraud scheme,\" said Assistant U.S. Attorney Harry Jacobs \"and they both got rich doing it.\"",

      "\"Just completed a very good telephone call with President Zelenskyy of Ukraine,\" the president\u00a0wrote\u00a0on Truth Social. \"It lasted approximately one hour. Much of the discussion was based on the call made yesterday with President Putin in order to align both Russia and Ukraine in terms of their requests and needs.\"",
      "The call comes a day after Mr. Trump's lengthy call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, in which Mr. Trump said Putin agreed to a 30-day ceasefire against Ukraine's energy and infrastructure. The commitment fell short of the full ceasefire pushed by the U.S. and agreed to by Ukraine. Hours after Mr. Trump and Putin hung up, Russia launched a series of drone strikes that struck civilian areas and damaged a hospital.",
      "National security adviser Mike Waltz and Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a joint statement that Mr. Trump \"fully briefed\" Zelenskyy on the call with Putin, and Mr. Trump and Zelenskyy \"agreed to share information closely between their defense staffs as the battlefield situation evolved.\" Zelenskyy, the two said, asked for additional air defense systems, and Mr. Trump \"agreed to work with him to find what was available, particularly in Europe.\"",
      "Waltz and Rubio also said Mr. Trump suggested the U.S. could take ownership of and run Ukrainian's nuclear power plants. \"American ownership of those plants would be the best protection for that infrastructure and support for Ukrainian energy infrastructure,\" their statement said.",

    "summary": "U.S. District Judge Theodore Chuang ruled in favor of a group of more than two dozen unnamed former and current USAID employees and contractors.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Tuesday found that Elon Musk and the White House's Department of Government Efficiency likely violated the Constitution when they unilaterally acted to shut down the U.S. Agency for International Development.",
      "U.S. District Judge Theodore Chuang ruled in favor of a group of more than two dozen unnamed current and former USAID employees and contractors who had challenged the efforts to shutter USAID, which were mounted by DOGE and Musk, a senior White House adviser who President Trump has said is the leader of the task force.",
      "Chuang granted in part their request for a preliminary injunction and said in a 68-page decision that DOGE and Musk likely violated the Constitution's Appointments Clause and separation of powers.",
      "He ordered Musk and task force employees to reinstate access to email, payment and other electronic systems to all current USAID employees and personal services contractors. The judge also prevented DOGE and Musk from taking any action relating to the shutdown of USAID, including placing employees on administrative leave, firing USAID workers, closing its buildings, bureaus or offices, and deleting the contents of its websites or collections.",
      "DOGE and Musk are prohibited under the judge's order from taking any other actions relating to USAID without the \"express authorization\" of an agency official with legal authority to take the action. The Trump administration is likely to appeal the decision.",
      "\"To deny plaintiffs' Appointments Clause claim solely on the basis that, on paper, Musk has no formal legal authority relating to the decisions at issue, even if he is actually exercising significant authority on governmental matters, would open the door to an end-run around the Appointments Clause,\" Chuang wrote.",
      "He continued: \"If a president could escape Appointments Clause scrutiny by having advisers go beyond the traditional role of White House advisors who communicate the president's priority to agency heads and instead exercise significant authority throughout the federal government so as to bypass duly appointed officers, the Appointments Clause would be reduced to nothing more than a technical formality.\"",
      "Norm Eisen, executive chair of the State Democracy Defenders Fund, which brought the case on behalf of the 26 USAID employees and contractors, said the ruling is an \"important victory\" against Musk and DOGE.",
      "\"They are performing surgery with a chainsaw instead of a scalpel, harming not just the people USAID serves but also the majority of Americans who count on the stability of our government,\" he said in a statement. \"This case is a milestone in pushing back on Musk and DOGE's illegality.\"",
      "USAID was one of the first agencies that came under scrutiny by DOGE as part of Mr. Trump's sweeping plan to shrink the size of the federal government. Soon after the president returned to a second term, the agency, which was established in 1961, became subject to a 90-day pause on foreign assistance funding that devastated nonprofit organizations, businesses and aid groups that received grants and other awards from USAID.",
      "DOGE team members also gained access to the agency's financial and personnel systems, and hundreds of USAID officials were placed on administrative leave. Its website was shut down last month, email accounts deactivated and USAID's Washington, D.C., headquarters were occupied by U.S. Customs and Border Protection.",
      "The unidentified USAID employees and personal services contractors filed their lawsuit against Musk and DOGE in mid-February and argued that Musk's actions violated the Constitution's Appointments Clause. The case was one of several filed after DOGE was established that have challenged Musk's actions and the task force's access to sensitive federal systems.",
      "Musk's role within DOGE has been of particular interest, including among federal judges overseeing court fights involving the task force. While Mr. Trump has claimed publicly that Musk leads DOGE, including during his joint address to Congress earlier this month, Justice Department lawyers have argued that he is a senior adviser to the president and does not have formal authority to make government decisions.",
      "Amid repeated questions about who was leading DOGE, the White House revealed last month that Amy Gleason, who worked for DOGE's predecessor, is its acting administrator.",
      "Chuang, meanwhile, said Musk and DOGE have been behind agency actions throughout the federal government, including at USAID.",
      "He noted that Musk, who is also the CEO of Tesla, appears to have been involved in the closure of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau headquarters. He said evidence shows that Musk and DOGE \"have taken other unilateral actions without any apparent authorization from agency officials,\" including the firings of employees at the Department of Agriculture and National Nuclear Security Administration.",
      "\"Under these circumstances, the evidence presently favors the conclusion that contrary to defendants' sweeping claim that Musk acted only as an advisor, Musk made the decisions to shutdown USAID's headquarters and website even though he 'lacked the authority to make that decision,'\" Chuang wrote, citing arguments from the Trump administration.",
      "As to USAID, the judge said that the record before the court \"does not support the conclusion\" that decisions to dismantle the agency by permanently closing its headquarters and taking down its website were made by USAID officials.",
      "\"Thus, based on the present record, the only individuals known to be associated with decisions to initiate a shutdown of USAID by permanently closing USAID headquarters and taking down its website are Musk and DOGE team members,\" Chuang wrote.",
      "The Constitution's Appointments Clause in part lays out the methods for appointing officers of the United States, divided into two categories: principal officers, appointed by the president with Senate approval, and inferior officers, who generally do not require Senate confirmation. The challengers in the case argued that Musk was carrying out the functions of an officer without being appointed to that role, thus violating the Appointments Clause.",
      "Chuang agreed. He found that where there is evidence that Musk exercised significant authority reserved for an officer while serving in a continuing government position, the unnamed USAID employees and contractors were likely to win on their argument that he skirted the Appointments Clause.",
      "\"The public interest is specifically harmed by defendants' actions, which have usurped the authority of the public's elected representatives in Congress to make decisions on whether, when and how to eliminate a federal government agency, and of officers of the United States duly appointed under the Constitution to exercise the authority entrusted to them,\" he wrote.",
      "In addition to finding that the dismantling of USAID by Musk and DOGE was likely unconstitutional, Chuang found that they lack authorization by Congress to take steps toward abolishing the agency.",
      "\"There is no statute that authorizes the Executive Branch to shut down USAID,\" he wrote.",
      "The judge added that Congress alone has the constitutional authority to take action to eliminate agencies it has created.",
      "\"Where Congress has prescribed the existence of USAID in statute pursuant to its legislative powers under Article I, the president's Article II power to take care that the laws are faithfully executed does not provide authority for the unilateral, drastic actions taken to dismantle the agency,\" Chuang wrote.",
      "The judge's opinion warns that there are reasons to be concerned about the potential public disclosure of personal, sensitive or classified information by DOGE team members. He said they \"took extreme measures\" to gain access to classified information, including in secure facilities, \"when there was no identified need to do so,\" and when some DOGE staff lacked security clearances.",
      "Chuang cited one USAID employee on administrative leave who reported that DOGE team members who did not have security clearances granted themselves access to restricted areas that required approval.",

    "summary": "One professor said this JFK assassination files release is \"certainly the most useful\" of any so far \"because of the redactions being removed.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration on Tuesday evening released tens of thousands of pages of government documents related to the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy, weeks after President Trump ordered government agencies to make their JFK files public.",
      "The documents, totaling some 80,000 pages, had been released before, with sections redacted for national security purposes. The declassified versions did not appear to contain significant new revelations about the assassination, based on an initial review by CBS News. But the unveiling of key portions of the records was cheered by researchers and academics who had long argued that the details in certain reports by the CIA and FBI should have been disclosed years ago.",
      "\"This is the most positive news on the release of JFK files since the 1990s,\" said Jefferson Morley, an investigative journalist and vice president of the Mary Ferrell Foundation, which hosts a repository of JFK-related documents. He called the release an \"encouraging start\" while noting that other troves of documents still remain under wraps.",
      "The records were uploaded by the National Archives and Records Administration, the agency responsible for housing the government's collection of files related to the assassination. The Archives said Tuesday that \"all records previously withheld for classification\" have been released, but not all are available online yet.",
      "Shortly after taking office in January, the president took executive action to establish a process to declassify and release any remaining documents related to Kennedy's killing, as well as the assassinations of Robert F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. The order instructed the director of national intelligence and attorney general to present the president with a plan for the \"full and complete release of records relating to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.\"",
      "What's in the newly released JFK files?",
      "The records are unredacted versions of documents that have been released in redacted form in the past. Agencies like the CIA and FBI have argued over the years that the release of the information would harm national security, even decades after the fact.",
      "According to Morley, roughly 3,500 documents in the government's official collection of JFK files contained redactions before the latest release. There were 1,123 documents of varying lengths unveiled Tuesday, meaning about a third of the remaining redacted documents have been released in full. About 75% of those records were produced by the CIA. More than 500 IRS records have been withheld from public release entirely.",
      "\"These new records shed new light on the events leading to JFK's assassination, including his mistrust of the CIA, the surveillance of Oswald in Mexico City, and propaganda operations involving Oswald before and after JFK was killed,\" Morley said in a statement referring to Lee Harvey Oswald, Kennedy's assassin. Oswald sought a visa to return to the Soviet Union in October 1963 while in Mexico City, and technical details of the CIA's surveillance operations were revealed for the first time in Tuesday's release.",
      "Another notable document released in full is a\u00a0memo prepared by Kennedy adviser Arthur Schlesinger Jr. about a potential reorganization of the CIA after the disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba in 1961. The\u00a0previously redacted\u00a0section details the number of undercover CIA personnel stationed overseas, with Schlesinger expressing concern that covert CIA activities were encroaching on the State Department.",
      "Various investigations into the JFK assassination over the years \u2014 some as recently as the 1990s \u2014 swept up classified information that dealt with intelligence gathering methods and friendly foreign governments but were not directly linked to the assassination. Portions of documents, and some entire records, had remained classified for decades to protect sources and methods.",
      "David Barrett, a professor of political science at Villanova University who studies the Kennedy presidency, told CBS News that \"non-scholars who dive into these documents are going to be baffled as to what most of them have to do with the Kennedy or other assassinations.\" For scholars like him, however, he said it is \"certainly the most useful release of documents that has occurred because of the redactions being removed.\"",
      "\"Now I know who or what is being referred to. So a memorandum on CIA relations with the Miami newspapers, for example, and details on three CIA officers doing technical collection of intelligence in Cuba \u2014 I've never really had those details before,\" he said.",
      "Larry Sabato, the director of the University of Virginia Center for Politics and author of \"The Kennedy Half-Century,\" told the Associated Press that his team is going through the released files in search of a \"long, long list\" of sensitive documents that were previously heavily redacted. He believes some of those passages may concern Cuba or \"what the CIA did or didn't do relevant to Lee Harvey Oswald.\"",
      "Last month, the FBI said it had\u00a0discovered\u00a0roughly 2,400 records related to the assassination during a search stemming from Mr. Trump's executive action. Those records did not appear in Tuesday's release, according to Morley.",
      "Where to read the new JFK assassination files",
      "The documents have been uploaded to a portal maintained by the National Archives, which can be found here. The Archives maintains the government's trove of records known as the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection.",
      "Not all of the files are available online yet, however. Some are available \"in person, via hard copy or on analog media formats\" at the National Archives at College Park, Maryland. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence said the records that are only available in person are being digitized and will be uploaded to the Archives in the coming days. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard will post updates on social media, and the records will also be on the White House website.",
      "Additional documents remain under court seal, including some for reasons of grand jury secrecy. The IRS-related documents must be unsealed before release, and the Archives and Justice Department are working on making these available.",
      "The Mary Ferrell Foundation runs its own JFK documents repository on its website, which has deeper search functions for exploring the trove of records. The group typically adds new documents shortly after they are released by the Archives.",
      "Why did Trump release these JFK files?",
      "Mr. Trump campaigned on declassifying and releasing records related to the JFK assassination, in part due to his political alliance with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has long called for more transparency about the assassinations that killed his uncle and father.",
      "In 1992, Congress passed a law requiring the government to release all of its records about the assassination by October 2017, while giving the president the authority to withhold records for national security reasons. In his first term, Mr. Trump unveiled thousands of documents, but some of their contents were kept under wraps after lobbying by the CIA and FBI. Other records were withheld altogether.",
      "Over the course of 2021 and 2022, President Biden likewise released thousands of records but kept key portions redacted, frustrating researchers and observers who had called for their full release for years.",
      "When was JFK assassinated?",
      "Kennedy was shot in the head on Nov. 22, 1963, at the age of 46 while riding in a convertible in Dallas, Texas. Oswald, a former Marine and communist activist who had lived in the Soviet Union, was soon arrested for the killing. But Oswald was also shot and killed in the basement of the Dallas police headquarters two days later.",
      "An investigation led by Chief Justice Earl Warren concluded that Oswald acted alone in shooting Kennedy, but the probe has been widely criticized by academics and historians in the 62 years since the assassination.",
      "Oswald had been on the government's radar before the assassination, a fact that the CIA withheld from the Warren Commission. Oswald defected to the Soviet Union in 1959, and returned to the U.S. in 1962. A self-described Marxist, he worked with a pro-Fidel Castro activist group and had contact with Soviet and Cuban consulates in the months leading up to Kennedy's death.",
      "In October 1963, the CIA intercepted a phone call he made to the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City, and the documents released Tuesday detail some technical aspects of the CIA's surveillance of Oswald and Cuban and Soviet officials.",
      "The Associated Press and \n                                                  \n                      Andres Triay\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

      "The Trump administration and Israel approached the governments of Sudan and Somalia, and have also been interested in Syria, as potential places to resettle Palestinians from Gaza, according to three sources familiar with the effort.",
      "The idea of Palestinian resettlement in another country is one of several options the Trump team is chewing over as part of the U.S. president's larger goal of ending Israel's war with Hamas in Gaza and rebuilding the devastated Palestinian enclave.",
      "\"Nobody is expelling any Palestinians,\" President Trump said Wednesday, when the Irish Prime Minister was asked during the two leaders' Oval Office meeting by a Voice of America reporter about the president's controversial remarks in February when he suggested taking ownership of Gaza to rebuild it.",
      "Mr. Trump made the remarks during a Feb. 4 press conference alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, saying Gaza could be the \"Riviera of the Middle East.\"",
      "\"\u200aWe should go to other countries of interest with humanitarian hearts, and there are many of them that want to do this, and build various domains that will ultimately be occupied by the 1.8 million Palestinians living in Gaza, ending the death and destruction,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "A combination of Israeli and U.S. officials communicated to Sudan and Somalia, two diplomatic sources confirmed to CBS News. Senior far-right Israeli government officials have already been calling for Palestinians to migrate from the enclave. Mr. Trump's remarks have only emboldened Israel to reach out to other countries to explore opportunities for Palestinian resettlement, one source said.",
      "Three sources familiar with Mr. Trump's idea of resettling Gazans to another country told CBS News that his administration and Israel have also been interested in Syria. One source familiar with the Trump administration's Middle East policy said that the administration has attempted outreach to Syria's new interim government via a third-party interlocutor. Another source from the region told CBS News that Syria's government had been approached, but it was unclear whether there had been any response from Syria to the outreach.",
      "A senior Syrian official told CBS News that they are unaware of any outreach to their government by Israel or the U.S. about resettlement of Gazans.",
      "Dahir Hassan, Somalia's ambassador to the U.S., told CBS News that \"neither the U.S. administration nor Israeli authorities have approached the Somali government regarding any proposed relocation of Palestinians to Somalia.\" Hassan also cited concern that \"the dissemination of such unverified information risks fueling recruitment propaganda for extremist groups like ISIS and Al-Shabaab, potentially exacerbating security challenges in the region.\"",
      "The Sudanese government has not responded to a CBS News' request for comment.",
      "Syria's fledgling interim government is just three months old, after toppling Bashar al-Assad and his brutal regime which held an iron fist over the Syrian people for decades. The Arab northeast African nation of Sudan is currently embroiled in civil war and a refugee crisis while suffering pockets of famine. Tens of thousands of Sudanese refugees have sought asylum in Israel over the last two decades, only to be detained in the country's desert-based detention centers or left to live without any formal status. The East African country of Somalia is a fragile, formerly failed state where the militant Islamist group Al-Shabaab continues to wage a deadly insurgency.",
      "Since his Feb. 4 news conference, Mr. Trump has suggested Palestinians would have a choice on whether to leave but also indicated that their departure from Gaza could be permanent. In a Fox News interview several days later he said, \"We'll build beautiful communities, safe communities, could be five, six, could be two. But we'll build safe communities a little bit away from where they (the Palestinians) are.\" In the same interview, he said that Palestinians wouldn't have the right to return to Gaza under his plan because the enclave \"is not habitable\" and won't be for years to come.",
      "The United Nations reported in January that over 90% of housing units in Gaza are either damaged or destroyed and 1.9 million Gazan civilians have been displaced. Gaza's health ministry says more than 48,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war between Israel and Hamas, which began after the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack in which Hamas killed around 1,200 Israelis and took roughly 250 more hostage.",
      "Multiple Arab governments, the United Nations and some Democratic lawmakers, quickly denounced Mr. Trump's idea of emptying out Gaza with some defining the idea as ethnic cleansing. Instead, Arab leaders endorsed an alternative Egyptian post-war construction plan for Gaza last week, but the Trump administration and Israel were both quick to reject it, again citing that the Gaza Strip is uninhabitable.",
      "Former President Joe Biden's administration had been sending U.S. officials on a regular basis to meet with the new Syrian government in Damascus in the lead-up to Mr. Trump's inauguration when the visits stopped.\u00a0 Syria's new leader Ahmed al-Sharaa, formerly known as Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, was quick to condemn Mr. Trump's remarks in February, saying that the U.S. president's plan \"is a serious crime that will ultimately fail\". It is unclear what the Trump administration's overall policy toward the new Syrian government will be.",
      "\"The Trump administration should engage directly with the new government in Damascus, particularly after the agreement between Damascus and the SDF (the U.S.-allied Syrian Democratic Forces). And to ensure that Iran never again gains a foothold in Syria, for the true, enduring defeat of ISIS, and to conduct a full withdrawal of U.S. forces in the right way unlike what unfolded in Afghanistan,\" Mouaz Moustafa, executive director of the Washington-based advocacy and humanitarian organization Syrian Emergency Task Force, told CBS News.",
      "Israel has conducted widespread airstrikes in Syria since December, on what it described as Assad regime weapons sites, and seized territory in the buffer zone between both countries. This past week, Israel struck inside a Damascus suburb, saying it was taking out the headquarters of the Islamic Jihad, an Iran-backed militant group that has a substantial foothold in Gaza and the occupied West Bank.",
      "A State Department spokesperson deferred to the Israeli government, and told CBS News that Middle East special envoy Steve Witkoff \"continues to work tirelessly towards either an extension of Phase One (of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire agreement) or an advance to Phase Two with these principles in mind\".",
      "The State Department also referred to remarks by Witkoff from a February Fox News interview in which he said, \"We need to explore new policy prescriptions that ultimately end up in a better life for Gazans and Palestinians.\"",
      "Witkoff also suggested in the same Fox interview that Gaza's entire Palestinian population could go to other Middle East-based Arab nations and other countries beyond the region: \"I think that the president's solution is: how do we address where two million people can go? And I think the obvious answers are: in some respects, Egypt, in some respects, Jordan; but in some respects other countries who have called us up and voluntarily said this is a humanitarian effort, we want to help you\".",
      "Asked by \"Face the Nation\" moderator Margaret Brennan on Sunday about whether the Trump administration is talking to other countries about relocation of two million Palestinians in Gaza, Witkoff said again \"I think we're exploring, Margaret, all alternatives and options that lead to a better life for Gazans. And, by the way, for the people of Israel. So we're exploring all of those things.\"",
      "Millions of displaced Palestinians already live in surrounding Arab countries as refugees, including in Jordan, Syria, Lebanon and Egypt. Far-right Israeli ministers have increasingly called for moving Palestinians in Gaza and also in the West Bank off their land as part of the extreme view it would fulfill a Biblical claim by Jews to the land, and increase Israel's security.",
      "The Israeli government, the White House and its National Security Council all declined to respond to multiple CBS News requests for comment.",
      "Trump's son-in-law and former advisor Jared Kushner first suggested that Gaza's \"waterfront property could be very valuable, if people would focus on building up livelihoods\" during an on-camera discussion at Harvard University in February 2024.",
      "The Associated Press was the first to report Friday that the U.S. and Israel had contacted Sudan, Somalia, and also Somaliland, about resettling Palestinians from Gaza.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/judge-blocks-trumps-executive-order-barring-transgender-people-from-the-military/",
    "published": "Wed, 19 Mar 2025 09:51:00 -0400",
    "summary": "U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes ruled in favor of transgender active-duty service members and transgender people in the process of enlisting.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Tuesday blocked enforcement of a new Defense Department policy barring transgender people from serving in the U.S. military.",
      "U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes granted a request for a preliminary injunction sought by transgender active-duty service members and transgender people who are in the process of enlisting. The judge's order temporarily blocks Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and the military services from implementing President Trump's executive order and additional guidance that prohibits transgender people from serving in the military.",
      "But the judge put her order on hold until March 21 to give the Justice Department time to seek emergency relief from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.",
      "Reyes, appointed by former President Joe Biden, issued her decision after holding several hours of hearings earlier this month, during which she sharply questioned Justice Department lawyers about the Defense Department's justifications for the ban.",
      "\"Indeed, the cruel irony is that thousands of transgender servicemembers have sacrificed \u2014 some risking their lives \u2014to ensure for others the very equal protection rights the Military Ban seeks to deny them,\" Reyes wrote in her 79-page decision, later adding, \"The court's opinion is long, but its premise is simple.\u00a0 In the self-evident truth that 'all people are created equal,' all means all. Nothing more. And certainly nothing less.\"",
      "Jennifer Levi, senior director of transgender and queer rights for GLAD Law, one of the lead attorneys in the case, called the ruling \"decisive\" and said it \"speaks volumes.\"",
      "\"The court's unambiguous factual findings lay bare how this ban specifically targets and undermines our courageous service members who have committed themselves to defending our nation. Given the court's clear-eyed assessment, we are confident this ruling will stand strong on appeal,\" Levi said in a statement.",
      "A spokesperson for the Justice Department called the ruling \"the latest example of an activist judge attempting to seize power at the expense of the American people, who decisively voted to elect President Trump.\"",
      "The policy arose out of an executive order Mr. Trump issued in late January that directed Hegseth to implement a policy for transgender service members based on troop readiness. The order stated that \"adoption of a gender identity inconsistent with an individual's sex conflicts with a soldier's commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one's personal life. A man's assertion that he is a woman, and his requirement that others honor this falsehood, is not consistent with the humility and selflessness required of a service member.\"",
      "The executive order also\u00a0revoked a measure implemented in January 2021 by then-President Joe Biden that allowed transgender individuals to serve in the U.S. military.",
      "In response to Mr. Trump's directive, Hegseth issued a memorandum in early February that halted recruitment of new service members diagnosed with gender dysphoria and paused gender-affirming care for transgender troops. The Pentagon then said in a late February document that the U.S. would begin removing transgender troops from the military within 30 days unless they obtained a waiver.",
      "The memo said that individuals with a diagnosis or history of gender dysphoria \"are no longer eligible for military service.\" It also said that pronoun usage when referring to a service member must reflect his or her sex and barred the use of Pentagon funds for gender-affirming care.",
      "Roughly 1,892 active-duty members of the military received gender-affirming care from the Defense Department between January 2016 and May 2021, according to a January report from the Congressional Research Service. While a Justice Department lawyer told the court earlier this month that the Pentagon does not have data on service members by gender identity, a defense official said that as of Dec. 9, there were about 4,200 troops who had been diagnosed with gender dysphoria.",
      "Between 2015 and 2024, the Defense Department spent $52 million for care to active-duty service members to treat gender dysphoria, according to a February 26 memo from the Pentagon.",
      "The lawsuit before Reyes was filed in late January by a group of more than a dozen transgender active-duty service members, one person enlisted in U.S. Army basic training and five transgender people who were in the process of enlisting. They argued that the ban was unconstitutional and sought a court order blocking its enforcement.",
      "In her decision, Reyes found that the challengers were likely to succeed on their claim that the ban fails a higher level of judicial scrutiny, intermediate scrutiny, because it classifies based on sex and transgender status. The judge also held that the Trump administration's policy is likely driven by unconstitutional animus.",
      "\"The Military Ban is soaked in animus and dripping with pretext,\" she wrote. \"Its language is unabashedly demeaning, its policy stigmatizes transgender persons as inherently unfit, and its conclusions bear no relation to fact.\"",
      "Reyes wrote that Mr. Trump and the Defense Department \"could have crafted a policy that balances the nation's need for a prepared military and Americans' right to equal protection. They still can. The Military Ban, however, is not that policy. The court therefore must act to uphold the equal protection rights that the military defends every day.\"",
      "The judge said government's policy is \"overbroad\" and also includes \"derogatory generalizations about the different talents, capacities, or preferences of transgender persons.\" Such generalizations, Reyes wrote, \"do not suffice to show that a sweeping discriminatory ban is substantially related to military readiness and unit cohesion.\"",
      "The decision from Reyes is likely to be appealed by the Justice Department, but it is the latest legal setback for the Trump administration, since several of its policies have been temporarily blocked by federal judges. A second challenge to the Mr. Trump's military ban is currently underway in Washington state.",
      "Mr. Trump sought to bar transgender people from serving in the military during his first term, in 2017, but an initial Pentagon policy was blocked by federal courts. The plan was then revised in 2018, and it took effect the following year and remained in place until the start of the Biden administration.",

      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has promoted two agents with the Internal Revenue Service who said they faced retaliation after blowing the whistle to Congress and speaking out to CBS News about political interference into their investigation of Hunter Biden's tax crimes.",
      "IRS special agents Gary Shapley and Joseph Ziegler were assigned to Bessent's office as senior advisers for IRS reform, and Shapley was named deputy director of criminal investigations at the agency.",
      "The promotions stand in stark contrast to President Trump's decision on Monday to revoke Secret Service protections for Hunter Biden, despite an executive order signed by his father, former President Joe Biden, extending those protections through July.",
      "Shapley and Ziegler first came forward in 2023, alleging the Department of Justice \"slow-walked\" the yearslong tax probe into Hunter Biden, and that prosecutors told them not to pursue investigative leads related to his father. They were removed from the case \u2014 and temporarily sidelined with pay.",
      "The duo's disclosures came ahead of a series of court decisions that ultimately led President Biden to pardon his son for the crimes related to the agents' investigation. Hunter Biden pleaded guilty to those crimes after a Delaware judge rejected a plea deal that would have given him broad immunity.",
      "\"We have been motivated by one singular mantra: do what's right,\" Shapley said in a statement. \"It's never been easy, and there have been more pitfalls than one would hope, but we appreciate the opportunity Secretary Bessent is giving us to utilize our skills and firsthand knowledge of the agency to further the work of the administration to root out waste and fraud from the federal government and make a difference.\"",
      "In an interview with Fox News Tuesday, Bessent said he is giving Shapley and Ziegler \"a year to investigate the wrongdoing that's going on at the IRS,\" adding that they will make sure \"this Hunter Biden nonsense\" doesn't repeat itself.",
      "The new assignments come as the IRS is drafting plans to cut its workforce by as much as half through layoffs, attrition and buyouts, part of the Trump administration's effort to downsize the federal government. And the prominent postings are an abrupt departure from the tenuous relationship the two IRS whistleblowers previously had with the tax agency.",
      "In December, the federal watchdog that investigates whistleblower complaints substantiated claims by Shapley and Ziegler alleging the IRS had retaliated against them when agency leadership had removed the two agents from the Hunter Biden case at DOJ's request.",
      "The retaliation claim was part of an effort by Shapley and Ziegler to push back against what they believed was a wide-ranging effort by Hunter Biden's attorneys to discredit them. In September, the two men sued Abbe Lowell \u2013 one of Hunter Biden's attorneys \u2013 for defamation. Lowell responded by strenuously disputing the allegations and calling Shapley and Ziegler \"disgruntled.\"",
      "As for Hunter Biden, he recently was granted approval by a California judge to drop a lawsuit he filed against a former Trump White House aide he accused of illegally publishing private photos, emails, and other materials from his now-infamous laptop.",
      "In court documents, Hunter Biden cited financial reasons for dropping the lawsuit. He said his \"income has decreased significantly\" as sales of his art have dried up in the past year, and he was forced out of the house he was renting due to the fires that ravaged Los Angeles in January.",

    "summary": "The chief justice's statement came after President Trump called for a federal judge to be impeached.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Chief Justice John Roberts issued a rare statement Tuesday defending federal judges who have issued decisions against the Trump administration, saying that \"impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement\" with a court's decision.",
      "\"For more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision,\" Roberts said in the statement distributed by the Supreme Court's public information office. \"The normal appellate review process exists for that purpose.\"",
      "Roberts' statement comes after President Trump attacked a federal district judge on Truth Social and called for his impeachment. The judge, James Boasberg, temporarily\u00a0blocked the Trump administration on Saturday from using the wartime law called the Alien Enemies Act to detain and deport noncitizens.",
      "Boasberg had issued an oral order from the bench requiring planes carrying 261 people that were on their way to Central America to return to the U.S. The Trump administration had alleged that 137 of the people on board the planes had ties to the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua and were removed from the U.S. under the Alien Enemies Act. Despite Boasberg's order, two planes landed in El Salvador, sparking allegations that the Trump administration had defied a court order.",
      "\"This Radical Left Lunatic of a Judge, a troublemaker and agitator who was sadly appointed by Barack Hussein Obama, was not elected President - He didn't WIN the popular VOTE (by a lot!), he didn't WIN ALL SEVEN SWING STATES, he didn't WIN 2,750 to 525 Counties, HE DIDN'T WIN ANYTHING!\" Mr. Trump wrote in his post.",
      "The president added that Boasberg and \"many of the Crooked Judges' I am forced to appear before\" should be \"IMPEACHED!!!\"",
      "Mr. Trump's targeting of Boasberg, who was appointed to the U.S. district court in Washington, D.C., by President Barack Obama, is an escalation in the ongoing attacks on federal judges who have been overseeing the dozens of challenges to the president's policies. Some of those judges have ordered the Trump administration to put its plans on hold while legal proceedings move forward, sparking condemnations from the president's allies and threats of impeachment. The Justice Department has appealed many of those rulings and sought emergency relief from the Supreme Court\u00a0in three court fights\u00a0so far.",
      "Federal judges are appointed for life and can only be removed from the bench if they are impeached by the House and convicted by the Senate. Just 15 judges have been impeached in U.S. history, most recently in 2010. Eight of those 15 have been convicted and removed from office.",
      "Elon Musk, a senior adviser to the president, has taken to social media repeatedly to call on the judges to be impeached, claiming they are \"evil.\"",
      "In a\u00a0post last month on X, the social media company he owns, Musk claimed the country is witnessing \"an attempted coup of American democracy by radical left activists posing as judges.\" In\u00a0another post, he wrote that there \"need to be some repercussions above zero for judges who make truly terrible decisions.\"",
      "Republicans in the House have also\u00a0introduced impeachment resolutions\u00a0against at least three judges because of rulings they dislike, which were issued in the early stages of legal challenges to Mr. Trump's policies.",
      "In response to the attacks on members of the judiciary, two Republican-appointed judges warned last week that they strike at judicial independence.",
      "\"Our system of government is premised on three independent branches and a judiciary that can function independently,\" Judge Richard Sullivan, who sits on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit, said during a call with reporters hosted by the Judicial Conference. \"That's what makes it work, and so it's crucial that people understand that.\"",
      "Judge Jeffrey Sutton, of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit, said it's a \"shame\" to see judges attacked simply for doing their jobs.",
      "\"Threats to judges are threats to judicial independence. They've been around for a long time. There's lots of different mechanisms. Threats of impeachment \u2014 this is not the first time this has happened,\" he said. \"One thing worth keeping in mind is if we dilute the standards for impeachment, that's not just a problem for judges, that's a problem for all three branches of government.\"",
      "Roberts has spoken about the importance of judicial independence before, namely in his year-end report issued to close out 2024. He highlighted four areas that he said threatened the independence of judges: violence, intimidation, disinformation and threats to defy lawfully entered judgments.",
      "Roberts is the presiding officer of the Judicial Conference, the policymaking body for the judiciary. Such statements from the chief justice are rare, but it is not the first time Roberts has pushed back against Mr. Trump's comments.",
      "In 2018, after the president complained about a federal judge who ruled against an asylum policy during his first term and referred to him as an \"Obama judge,\" Roberts said the U.S. doesn't have \"Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges.

The White House and the Kremlin both said they agreed to begin negotiations \"immediately\" to achieve a fuller ceasefire. A Russian readout of the call from the Kremlin said a key condition for working toward a resolution to the conflict \"should be the complete cessation of foreign military aid and the provision of intelligence information to Kyiv.\" The White House readout did not contain that information, or Mr. Trump's response.",
      "\"My phone conversation today with President Putin of Russia was a very good and productive one,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"We agreed to an immediate ceasefire on all energy and infrastructure, with an understanding that we will be working quickly to have a complete ceasefire and, ultimately, an END to this very horrible war between Russia and Ukraine. ... Many elements of a contract for peace were discussed, including the fact that thousands of soldiers are being killed, and both President Putin and President Zelenskyy would like to see it end.\"",
      "The call lasted at least 90 minutes, as indicated by the timing of White House updates, but the exact duration hasn't been disclosed yet.",
      "\"Today, President Trump and President Putin spoke about the need for peace and a ceasefire in the Ukraine war,\" a White House readout of the call said. \"Both leaders agreed this conflict needs to end with a lasting peace. They also stressed the need for improved bilateral relations between the United States and Russia.The blood and treasure that both Ukraine and Russia have been spending in this war would be better spent on the needs of their people. ... The leaders agreed that the movement to peace will begin with an energy and infrastructure ceasefire, as well as technical negotiations on implementation of a maritime ceasefire in the Black Sea, full ceasefire and permanent peace. These negotiations will begin immediately in the Middle East.\"",
      "The White House also said Mr. Trump and Putin agreed that an improved relationship between the U.S. and Russia \"has a huge upside,\" including \"enormous economic deals and geopolitical stability when peace has been achieved.\"",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Mr. Trump has his number and can call him at any time.",
      "\"We are skeptical when it comes to trusting the Russians,\" he said Tuesday. \"There is no trust to Putin. That's why I am saying we need to understand how it will work technically so that it will not depend on their desire only. That is it.\"",
      "On Monday, ahead of the call, Mr. Trump said U.S. officials are having \"very serious discussions\" with Russia about \"land that would be kept and lost.\" \"You're sort of creating the edge of a country,\" he said.",
      "Mr. Trump also said Monday that negotiations are complicated, and added that he would love to meet with Putin at some point.",
      "Last week, delegates from the U.S. and Ukraine met in Saudi Arabia and proposed a\u00a030-day ceasefire. While Putin said he\u00a0accepted the idea\u00a0for a ceasefire in principle, he did not commit to a deal and said more discussions were needed.",

    "summary": "Some information demanded by a judge about flights carrying alleged Tren de Aragua gang members is likely to remain private, the Justice Department said.",
    "story": [
      "Plaintiffs suing the Trump administration over use of a war authority to deport alleged gang members warned that failing to block the president from its use would mean anyone could be treated as an enemy alien.",
      "The lawyers for Venezuelan migrants suing the government said Tuesday in an appellate court filing: \"The implications of the government's position are staggering. If the President can designate any group as enemy aliens under the Act, and that designation is unreviewable, then there is no limit on who can be sent to a Salvadoran prison, or any limit on how long they will remain there.\"",
      "Those subject to the 1798 Alien Enemies Act can be summarily arrested, detained and deported, without the due process protections outlined in U.S. immigration law, including opportunities to see a judge and request asylum. Instead, they may be treated as enemy aliens and processed under America's wartime laws. President Trump invoked the act Saturday, and used it to send two planes carrying alleged Tren de Aragua gang members to a prison in El Salvador.",
      "In a hearing Saturday, D.C. U.S. Chief District Judge James Boasberg blocked their deportation, prompting an immediate Justice Department appeal.",
      "On Tuesday, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer provided new details about the Trump administration's deportation flights of alleged gang members, but continued to argue the government had a right to reject a judge's order directing the planes to return to the U.S., even if they were already in the air.",
      "According to a sworn declaration by Robert Cerna, the acting field office director of ICE's enforcement and removal operations, the two planes \"departed U.S. territory and airspace before 7:25 p.m.\" on Saturday \u2014 40 minutes after D.C. District Chief Judge James Boasberg verbally ordered the planes to be returned to the U.S. during a hearing Saturday evening.",
      "The government reiterated Tuesday that because the planes were over international waters and airspace by the time the judge ordered them to turn around, Boasberg no longer had jurisdiction over the migrants.",
      "Attorneys for the Trump administration had also argued in a hearing on Monday that Boasberg did not have authority to redirect the planes because the judge had not put his order demanding the planes to return to the U.S. in writing. The judge responded that his order applied to the planes, regardless of where they were in the air.",
      "Cerna said the government's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act to justify the removal of alleged Tren de Aragua members was signed Friday evening, a day before the flights were publicly announced on Saturday by the White House.",
      "His testimony is part of a court-mandated series of responses to Boasberg, who was frustrated by the government's lack of details on the flights and deportation operations during the hearing on Monday. The rest of the answers Boasberg requested are likely to remain private because of \"operational issues,\" a Justice Department attorney told the court, declining to provide the court with this information publicly.",
      "Those details are likely to include whether additional planes have left the U.S. with alleged Tren de Aragua gang members, a timeline showing when the flights took off from the U.S. and landed in El Salvador and a count of remaining members of the gang in U.S. custody.",
      "Cerna's sworn testimony did not provide all of this information, though he noted that 54 members of Tren de Aragua are in detention in the U.S., and approximately 172 are on the non-detained docket, which means they are not being detained by the government as their immigration proceedings continue. There are also approximately 32 are in criminal custody who have active detainers \u2014 that is, ICE has asked that they be held for up to 48 hours after they're scheduled to be released.",
      "Despite Boasberg's ruling, 261 people were deported to El Salvador Saturday, 137 of whom were removed under the Alien Enemies Act over alleged gang ties, a senior administration official said.",
      "The federal civil lawsuit against Mr. Trump and other administration officials was filed by five Venezuelan men in immigration custody in Texas and New York local jails.",
      "Boasberg's ruling prevents the deportations of the plaintiffs and migrants for 14 days.",
      "Jake Rosen is a reporter covering the Department of Justice. He was previously a campaign digital reporter covering President Trump's 2024 campaign and also served as an associate producer for \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan,\" where he worked with Brennan for two years on the broadcast.

      "The Trump administration provided a detailed accounting\u00a0of the number of probationary employees, generally considered those who were in their jobs for less than one year, who were targeted in the president's drastic plans to scale back the federal workforce in court filings Monday. The information was submitted as part of the administration's compliance with a temporary restraining order issued by U.S. District Judge James Bredar last week.",
      "Justice Department lawyers provided declarations from human resources officials at 18 different agencies who were covered by Bredar's order, which detailed the number of probationary workers who were fired last month and then had to be reinstated to their roles.",
      "Bredar, who sits on the federal district court in Maryland, temporarily blocked the mass firings of probationary workers and ordered them to be reinstated. He is the second judge to order the Trump administration to rehire fired federal workers.",
      "The Justice Department has appealed both decisions. But on Monday, a three-judge panel for the U.S. Appeals for the 9th Circuit declined to put one of the orders, from a federal district judge in California, on hold while proceedings move forward.",
      "In their declarations, the human resources officials across the federal government said they were working to comply with Bredar's order. But they all warned that reinstating removed employees would cause \"significant confusion\" and turmoil for those workers. The officers also noted that an appeals court could reverse the district court's order, subjecting affected employees to multiple changes in their employment status in just a few weeks.",
      "Most of the employees who were rehired were placed on administrative leave with full pay and benefits, the human resources officials said. In a separate filing in a case challenging the mass firings brought in California, Justice Department lawyers said that the administrative leave placement is \"a first part of a series of steps to reinstate probationary employees\" and an \"intermediate measure taken by a number of the agencies in order to return probationary employees to full duty status.\" The judge in that case last week ordered the Trump administration to reinstate fired probationary workers at six agencies.",

    "summary": "The new findings come from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), which sits on a telescope at the Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona.",
    "story": [
      "Scientists are homing in on the nature of a mysterious force called dark energy, and nothing short of the fate of the universe hangs in the balance.",
      "The force is enormous \u2014 it makes up nearly 70% of the universe. And it is powerful \u2014 it is pushing all the stars and galaxies away from each other at an ever faster rate.",
      "And now scientists are getting a little closer to understanding how it behaves. The big question is whether this dark energy is a constant force, an idea first introduced by Albert Einstein in his theory of relativity, or whether the force is weakening, a surprising wrinkle tentatively proposed last year.",
      "Results presented at a meeting of the American Physical Society Wednesday bolster the case that the force is weakening, though scientists are not yet certain and they still haven't worked out what this means for the rest of their understanding of the universe.",
      "The updated findings come from an international research collaboration that is creating a three-dimensional map to see how galaxies have spread and clustered over 11 billion years of the universe's history. Carefully tracking how galaxies move helps scientists learn about the forces that are moving them around.",
      "Called the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), the collaboration released its first analysis of 6 million galaxies and quasars last year and has now added more data, bringing the count to nearly 15 million. Their updated results, taken with other measurements \u2014 exploding stars, leftover light from the young universe and distortions in galaxy shape \u2014 support the idea presented last year that dark energy may be waning.",
      "\"It's moving from a really surprising finding to almost a moment where we have to throw out how we've thought about cosmology and start over,\" said Bhuvnesh Jain, a cosmologist with the University of Pennsylvania who was not involved with the research.",
      "Alexie Leauthaud-Harnett, a spokesperson for the DESI collaboration, called the new observations \"deeply intriguing.\"",
      "\"It is exciting to think that we may be on the cusp of a major discovery about dark energy and the fundamental nature of our universe,\" she said in a statement.",
      "It's not time to completely rule out the idea that dark energy is constant because the new results are still shy of the gold standard level of statistical proof physics requires. The collaboration aims to map around 50 million galaxies and quasars by the end of its survey in 2026.",
      "\"We want to see several different collaborations having similar measurements\" at that gold standard to be sure that dark energy is weakening, said cosmologist Kris Pardo with the University of Southern California who was not involved with the new research.",
      "The \"Big Crunch\"",
      "If dark energy is constant, scientists say our universe may continue to expand forever, growing ever colder, lonelier and still.",
      "If dark energy ebbs with time, which now seems plausible, the universe could one day stop expanding and then eventually collapse on itself in what's called the \"Big Crunch.\" It might not seem like the cheeriest fate, but it offers some closure, said cosmologist and study collaborator Mustapha Ishak-Boushaki of the University of Texas at Dallas.",
      "\"Now, there is the possibility that everything comes to an end,\" he said. \"Would we consider that a good or bad thing? I don't know.\"",
      "Other efforts around the globe have an eye on dark energy and aim to release their own data in the coming years, including the European Space Agency's Euclid mission and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile.",
      "Launched in 2023, the ESA's $1.5 billion Euclid space telescope is equipped with a near-perfect 3-feet 11-inch-wide primary mirror and two instruments: a 600 megapixel visible light camera and a 64-megapixel infrared imaging spectrometer. The telescope's field of view is roughly twice the size of the full moon.",
      "It will take Euclid six years to complete its map of the sky, generating on the order of 100 gigabytes of compressed data per day, or an estimated, difficult-to-imagine 70,000 terabytes over the course of the mission.",

      "The James Webb Space Telescope has directly observed the key chemical of carbon dioxide in planets outside of our solar system for the first time, scientists announced Monday.",
      "The gas giants are not capable of hosting extraterrestrial life, but do offer clues in a lingering mystery about how distant planets form, according to a study in The Astrophysical Journal.",
      "The HR 8799 system, 130 light years from Earth, is only 30 million years old \u2014 just a baby compared to our solar system's 4.6 billion years. A U.S.-led team of researchers used Webb to directly detect carbon dioxide in the atmosphere of all four of the system's known planets, according to the study.",
      "\"Webb's new images of two iconic systems, HR 8799 and 51 Eridani, and their planets have stunned researchers, and provided additional information into the chemical make-up of the young gas giants,\" NASA said in a statement.",
      "They used Webb's coronagraph instruments, which block the light from bright stars to get a better view of the planets revolving around them.",
      "\"It's like putting your thumb up in front of the sun when you're looking up at the sky,\" lead study author William Balmer, an astrophysicist at Johns Hopkins University, told AFP.",
      "Normally, the Webb telescope only detects exoplanets by glimpsing them when they cross in front of their host star.",
      "This \"transiting method\" was how Webb indirectly detected CO2 in the atmosphere of the gas giant WASP-39 in 2022.",
      "But for this latest discovery, \"we're actually seeing the light that is emitted from the planet itself, as opposed to the fingerprint of that light from the host star,\" Balmer said.",
      "This is not easy \u2014 Balmer compared the process to using a torch to spot fireflies next to a lighthouse.",
      "While these gas giants may not be able to host life, it is possible that they had moons that could, he added.",
      "There are missions currently under way to find out if there could be life in the vast oceans underneath the icy shells of several of Jupiter's moons.",
      "\"Key piece of proof\"",
      "Carbon dioxide (CO2) is essential for life on Earth, making it a key target in the search for life elsewhere.",
      "Because CO2 condenses into little ice particles in the deep cold of space, its presence can shed light on planetary formation.",
      "Jupiter and Saturn are believed to have first formed from a \"bottom up\" process in which a bunch of tiny, icy particles came together into a solid core which then sucked in gas to grow into giants, Balmer said.",
      "So the new discovery is a \"key piece of proof\" that far-off planets can form in a similar way to those in our celestial backyard, Balmer said.",
      "But how common this is throughout the universe remains unclear.",
      "\"Our hope with this kind of research is to understand our own solar system, life, and ourselves in the comparison to other exoplanetary systems, so we can contextualize our existence,\" Balmer said. \"We want to take pictures of other solar systems and see how they're similar or different when compared to ours. From there, we can try to get a sense of how weird our solar system really is\u2014or how normal.\"",
      "Astronomers have now discovered nearly 6,000 exoplanets, many of them massive \u2014 and none of them known to be habitable.",
      "The \"huge leap forward we need to make\" is to focus on smaller Earth-sized worlds, Balmer said.",
      "NASA's Nancy Grace Roman space telescope will use a coronagraph to do that just after its planned launch in 2027.",
      "Last year, the Webb telescope discovered carbon dioxide and hydrogen peroxide on the surface of Charon, Pluto's largest moon.",
      "Balmer hopes to use Webb to observe more four-planet systems, but added that future funding was now in question.",
      "Last week the Trump administration announced that NASA's chief scientist has been dismissed, indicating that more cuts were to come for the U.S. space agency.",

    "summary": "Scientists are conducting experiments to generate clean energy through fusion, the same sub-atomic reaction that powers our Sun, with the aim of constructing plants that produce more energy than they consume.",
    "story": [
      "If it looks like the set of some Hollywood sci-fi show, perhaps that's fitting, because what they are doing here is making stars on Earth. \"We are able to make miniature stars, 'cause fusion is the same reaction that powers the Sun and stars,\" said Tammy Ma, who leads the Fusion Energy Initiative at the National Ignition Facility (NIF) in Livermore, California. It's part of the same government laboratory that ensures the safety and reliability of the nation's nuclear stockpile.",
      "\"Every time we do a fusion experiment on the NIF, we are actually the hottest place in the entire solar system, hotter than the center of the Sun,\" Ma said.",
      "The scientists here are using the largest laser ever built. It's 1,000 times more powerful than the entire U.S. electrical grid, and is housed in a massive room the size of a three football fields. Here, 192 laser beams travel nearly a mile, and then focus in on a tiny target, or fuel pellet, smaller than a peppercorn. \u00a0When the lasers hit the pellet, the atoms \"fuse\" together, releasing energy in the process.",
      "That little fuel pellet is only about two millimeters in diameter. But the consequences could be huge.",
      "Fusion is a process that merges atoms together, and releases more energy than fission (which splits atoms apart). Fission is used by today's nuclear power plants and creates hazardous nuclear waste; fusion does not.",
      "Fusion would theoretically provide a nearly-limitless source of clean and safe energy, powering our world without the fossil fuels that are warming the planet and contributing to climate change. It would make energy-intensive technologies like vertical farming and water desalination much cheaper, potentially solving the world's food and water problems. Ma said, \"It is completely clean. There's no carbon anywhere in the equation. There's no high-level nuclear waste. You can place fusion power plants nearly anywhere. It could help meet all of the energy needs for the U.S. now and into the future, even as our energy needs rise.\"",
      "But fusion is hard. After 60 years of research by scientists at NIF, they finally generated a reaction (also called \"ignition\") that produced more energy than it consumed. The breakthrough, in 2022, crucial to ever creating a fusion power plant, made headlines around the world. Humans had unlocked the power of the stars.",

      "Inside the nuclear fusion breakthrough that could be a step to unlimited clean energy in the distant future (\"60 Minutes\")",
      "They have achieved ignition several times since then, and now the race is on to generate enough energy to consistently power a commercial fusion plant.",
      "Bob Mumgaard is CEO and co-founder of Commonwealth Fusion Systems outside of Boston, one of more than two dozen fusion startups getting billions of dollars in funding from the government and investors. \"It's gonna take time, it's gonna take work, but this is the birth of an industry,\" Mumgaard said.",
      "Instead of lasers, Commonwealth uses a cloud of super-heated plasma that burns at around 180 million degrees Fahrenheit, held in place by massive magnets that the company manufactures on site. \"The magnets in this machine will be the strongest magnets in the world,\" Mumgaard said. \"[They] could lift up an aircraft carrier.\"",
      "Commonwealth expects to complete its demonstration reactor next year. It just announced plans to build its first full-scale power plant in Virginia, but that won't deliver energy to the grid until sometime next decade. The demonstration reactor, Mumgaard said, \"is the penultimate step to that.\"",
      "Critics point out that fusion power has been an ever-elusive holy grail, always 20 to 30 years away. But startups like Commonwealth say this time is different. The technology is advancing as fast as the need for clean energy is rising \u2013 stars aligning in the quest to create stars here on Earth.",
      "\"This is not a paper exercise for us,\" Mumgaard said. \"We're putting this machine together, we're buying the parts, we're machining the parts, and it's all coming together at the exact time the world really needs something like this. I think that's a really cool story.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 21 Mar 2025 09:43:02 -0400",
    "summary": "The new findings come from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), which sits on a telescope at the Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona.",
    "story": [
      "Scientists are homing in on the nature of a mysterious force called dark energy, and nothing short of the fate of the universe hangs in the balance.",
      "The force is enormous \u2014 it makes up nearly 70% of the universe. And it is powerful \u2014 it is pushing all the stars and galaxies away from each other at an ever faster rate.",
      "And now scientists are getting a little closer to understanding how it behaves. The big question is whether this dark energy is a constant force, an idea first introduced by Albert Einstein in his theory of relativity, or whether the force is weakening, a surprising wrinkle tentatively proposed last year.",
      "Results presented at a meeting of the American Physical Society Wednesday bolster the case that the force is weakening, though scientists are not yet certain and they still haven't worked out what this means for the rest of their understanding of the universe.",
      "The updated findings come from an international research collaboration that is creating a three-dimensional map to see how galaxies have spread and clustered over 11 billion years of the universe's history. Carefully tracking how galaxies move helps scientists learn about the forces that are moving them around.",
      "Called the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), the collaboration released its first analysis of 6 million galaxies and quasars last year and has now added more data, bringing the count to nearly 15 million. Their updated results, taken with other measurements \u2014 exploding stars, leftover light from the young universe and distortions in galaxy shape \u2014 support the idea presented last year that dark energy may be waning.",
      "\"It's moving from a really surprising finding to almost a moment where we have to throw out how we've thought about cosmology and start over,\" said Bhuvnesh Jain, a cosmologist with the University of Pennsylvania who was not involved with the research.",
      "Alexie Leauthaud-Harnett, a spokesperson for the DESI collaboration, called the new observations \"deeply intriguing.\"",
      "\"It is exciting to think that we may be on the cusp of a major discovery about dark energy and the fundamental nature of our universe,\" she said in a statement.",
      "It's not time to completely rule out the idea that dark energy is constant because the new results are still shy of the gold standard level of statistical proof physics requires. The collaboration aims to map around 50 million galaxies and quasars by the end of its survey in 2026.",
      "\"We want to see several different collaborations having similar measurements\" at that gold standard to be sure that dark energy is weakening, said cosmologist Kris Pardo with the University of Southern California who was not involved with the new research.",
      "The \"Big Crunch\"",
      "If dark energy is constant, scientists say our universe may continue to expand forever, growing ever colder, lonelier and still.",
      "If dark energy ebbs with time, which now seems plausible, the universe could one day stop expanding and then eventually collapse on itself in what's called the \"Big Crunch.\" It might not seem like the cheeriest fate, but it offers some closure, said cosmologist and study collaborator Mustapha Ishak-Boushaki of the University of Texas at Dallas.",
      "\"Now, there is the possibility that everything comes to an end,\" he said. \"Would we consider that a good or bad thing? I don't know.\"",
      "Other efforts around the globe have an eye on dark energy and aim to release their own data in the coming years, including the European Space Agency's Euclid mission and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile.",
      "Launched in 2023, the ESA's $1.5 billion Euclid space telescope is equipped with a near-perfect 3-feet 11-inch-wide primary mirror and two instruments: a 600 megapixel visible light camera and a 64-megapixel infrared imaging spectrometer. The telescope's field of view is roughly twice the size of the full moon.",
      "It will take Euclid six years to complete its map of the sky, generating on the order of 100 gigabytes of compressed data per day, or an estimated, difficult-to-imagine 70,000 terabytes over the course of the mission.",

    "story": [
      "A lunar lander has completed its two-week mission and sent spectacular sunset images as a \"final goodbye\" back to Earth.",
      "The Blue Ghost Mission 1 lander was launched by Firefly Aerospace in mid-January and landed on the moon on March 2. It was the first successful commercial moon landing. The lander delivered 10 NASA science and delivery payloads to the Mare Crisium basin, which is a lava-flooded region on the near side of the moon formed by an asteroid impact.",
      "The payloads were delivered as part of NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Services and Artemis programs, NASA said in a news release, and were used to collect data and perform other scientific operations on the moon.",
      "While making the deliveries, the Blue Ghost lander experienced one lunar day. During the course of that day, it captured several images and videos. It imaged a total solar eclipse from the surface of the moon and also took pictures of the sunset.",

    "summary": "Starliner astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams joined Crew 9 commander Nick Hague and cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov for their long-awaited return to Earth.",
    "story": [
      "Two long-delayed Starliner astronauts, Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and Sunita Williams, returned to Earth aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule Tuesday, finally closing out a repeatedly extended 286-day odyssey in space. They shared the ride home with two outgoing space station crewmates, Crew-9 commander Nick Hague and Russian cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov.",
      "Seventeen hours after undocking from the International Space Station, the Crew Dragon settled to a gentle, on-target splashdown off Florida's Gulf Coast near Tallahassee at 5:57 p.m. EDT.",
      "\"Splashdown! Good mains release,\" Hague radioed SpaceX flight controllers in Hawthorne, California, after the four main parachutes were released from the Crew Dragon.",
      "\"Copy, splashdown,\" a SpaceX engineer replied. \"We see main chutes cut. Nick, Alex, Butch, Suni, on behalf of SpaceX, welcome home.\"",
      "\"What a ride,\" Hague said. \"I see a capsule full of grins, ear to ear.\"\ufeff",
      "A SpaceX recovery ship was stationed nearby to haul the spacecraft on board so the crew could be helped out of the Crew Dragon's cabin and onto stretchers for initial medical checks. The side hatch was opened at 6:38 p.m. EDT and the crew began to emerge into the fresh air and sunshine about 10 minutes later. Williams and Wilmore were the last ones out.",
      "For the two Starliner astronauts, it closed out a marathon mission that was originally supposed to last about eight days but stretched to nine-and-a-half months, covering 4,576 orbits and 121 million miles since launch last June 5 aboard a problem-plagued Boeing capsule. Their flight ranks sixth on the list of longest single NASA missions.",
      "Hague and Gorbunov spent 171 days in orbit since their launch last September aboard the Crew 9 ferry ship.",
      "All station astronauts spend two hours a day in orbit exercising to minimize bone and muscle loss in the weightlessness of space. Even so, Wilmore and Williams will face extensive rehabilitation over the next several weeks and months as their bodies re-adapt to the unfamiliar tug of gravity.",
      "How did the astronauts return to Earth?",
      "After bidding their ISS crewmates farewell, the returning astronauts floated into their Crew Dragon and undocked from the Harmony module's space-facing port early Tuesday, at 1:05 a.m. EDT.",
      "Starting at 5:11 p.m., the flight plan called for an automated seven-and-a-half-minute de-orbit thruster firing to slow the ship down for re-entry.",
      "Twenty-seven minutes later, approaching the Florida Gulf Coast on a southwest-to-northeast trajectory, the Crew Dragon reached the discernible atmosphere, enduring heat shield temperatures of more than 2,500 degrees as the spacecraft rapidly slowed in the thickening air.",
      "Nine minutes after entry, the Crew Dragon's three main parachutes unfurled for the capsule's final descent to splashdown in the Gulf.",
      "From the recovery ship, all four Crew-9 fliers were to be flown to shore by helicopter, where a NASA jet was waiting to ferry them back to Houston and the Johnson Space Center for reunions with family members and more extensive medical checks.",
      "\"Butch and Suni, enjoyed their time on station, they got to do spacewalks and they got to do lots of cool science and things like that,\" said Steve Stich, manager of NASA's commercial crew program. \"Their families, kudos to them for being resilient. ... The families, a huge thank you to them. I'm sure the reunion is going to be wonderful with the families.\"",
      "Why were the astronauts stuck longer at the ISS?",
      "Wilmore and Williams launched to the International Space Station last June 5 on the first piloted test flight of Boeing's Starliner. The spacecraft suffered multiple propulsion system helium leaks and thruster problems during rendezvous with the space station, and NASA eventually decided to keep them on the station and to bring the Starliner down, without its crew, by remote control.",
      "NASA launched the next crew rotation mission \u2014 Crew-9 \u2014 in September carrying just two crew members, Hague and Gorbunov, instead of four. Wilmore and Williams then joined the Crew-9 fliers aboard the ISS for a normal-duration six-month mission.",
      "By keeping them in space as part of Crew-9, NASA was able to minimize the disruption to the ISS crew rotation sequence while maintaining a full slate of experiments and research.",
      "NASA cleared the way for Crew-9's return to Earth by launching four replacements \u2014 Crew-10 commander Anne McClain, pilot Nichole Ayers, cosmonaut Kirill Peskov and Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi \u2014 last Friday.",
      "Normal practice calls for a five-day \"handover\" between crews so the new arrivals can be fully briefed on the ins and outs of station operations and maintenance. But in this case, handover was shortened to just one day to take advantage of predicted favorable splashdown weather in the Gulf.",
      "The plight of the Starliner astronauts generated unprecedented interest during their extended stay in space, making headlines around the world and even prompting claims by President Trump that the crew had been \"abandoned\" in space by the Biden administration.",
      "\"This began when I asked Elon Musk to go up and get the abandoned astronauts, because the Biden administration was incapable of doing so,\" he posted Monday on Truth Social. \"They shamefully forgot about the astronauts, because they considered it to be a very embarrassing event for them.\"",
      "\"Elon and I have taken on the project, sending up the SpaceX Dragon, which has successfully docked and, hopefully, while there is always danger involved in such a mission, they will soon be on their way home,\" his post continued.",
      "After splashdown, the White House tweeted: \"Promise made, promise kept: President Trump pledged to rescue the astronauts stranded in space for nine months. Today, they safely splashed down in the Gulf of America, tanks to @ElonMusk, @SpaceX and @NASA!\"",
      "Mr. Trump did not mention that NASA originally planned to bring the crew home in February. But their mission was extended to March because SpaceX ran into problems with the Crew Dragon spacecraft being processed to carry the replacement Crew 10 into space.",
      "NASA decided last month to swap out the original Crew-10 Dragon for one that was earmarked for a commercial flight later this spring.",
      "That replacement spacecraft, the Crew Dragon \"Freedom,\" blasted off last Friday, carrying Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, pilot Nichole Ayers, cosmonaut Kirill Peskov and Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi to the space station early Sunday.",
      "The Crew-10 flight is what cleared the way for Crew-9 and the Starliner astronauts to come home this week \u2014 about two weeks earlier than the original Crew Dragon could have managed.",
      "For his part, Musk backed up the president's claims about the Biden administration \"abandoning\" the crew. Without offering any evidence, he said NASA turned down an offer to send up a mission specifically to get Wilmore and Williams and bring them back to Earth. No one at NASA has yet confirmed any such offer.",
      "NASA managers have gone out of their way to avoid contradicting the president. At a post-landing news conference, Joel Montalbano, deputy associate administrate for space operations, was repeatedly asked about the president's comments. But he chose not address any specifics.",
      "\"NASA, as an agency, we work for the president,\" he said. \"Whoever's there, we work for them. We had an input from that office, we took a look at it and, you know, our job is to take all the inputs we get and operate as safe and successfully as we can.",
      "\"And that's what we did for this administration, and that's what we would do for any administration.\"",
      "Was this the longest any U.S. astronaut has stayed in space?",
      "While 286 days is a long flight by normal NASA standards, it's well short of the U.S. record for a single flight \u2014 371 days, set by astronaut Frank Rubio in 2022-23.",
      "Ironically, Rubio's record was the result of another extended mission, this one the result of a major coolant leak in the Russian Soyuz he launched aboard. The Russians decided not to bring the crew down aboard their original spacecraft and instead launched a replacement.",
      "As a result, Rubio ended up spending a little more than a full year in space, twice as long as he originally expected.",
      "Given Williams' two previous stays aboard the space station, she will move up to No. 2 on the list of most experienced U.S. astronauts with 608 days in space overall. Only former astronaut Peggy Whitson has more time aloft, 675 days over four flights. Wilmore's total across three flights will stand at 464 days aloft.",

      "The James Webb Space Telescope has directly observed the key chemical of carbon dioxide in planets outside of our solar system for the first time, scientists announced Monday.",
      "The gas giants are not capable of hosting extraterrestrial life, but do offer clues in a lingering mystery about how distant planets form, according to a study in The Astrophysical Journal.",
      "The HR 8799 system, 130 light years from Earth, is only 30 million years old \u2014 just a baby compared to our solar system's 4.6 billion years. A U.S.-led team of researchers used Webb to directly detect carbon dioxide in the atmosphere of all four of the system's known planets, according to the study.",
      "\"Webb's new images of two iconic systems, HR 8799 and 51 Eridani, and their planets have stunned researchers, and provided additional information into the chemical make-up of the young gas giants,\" NASA said in a statement.",
      "They used Webb's coronagraph instruments, which block the light from bright stars to get a better view of the planets revolving around them.",
      "\"It's like putting your thumb up in front of the sun when you're looking up at the sky,\" lead study author William Balmer, an astrophysicist at Johns Hopkins University, told AFP.",
      "Normally, the Webb telescope only detects exoplanets by glimpsing them when they cross in front of their host star.",
      "This \"transiting method\" was how Webb indirectly detected CO2 in the atmosphere of the gas giant WASP-39 in 2022.",
      "But for this latest discovery, \"we're actually seeing the light that is emitted from the planet itself, as opposed to the fingerprint of that light from the host star,\" Balmer said.",
      "This is not easy \u2014 Balmer compared the process to using a torch to spot fireflies next to a lighthouse.",
      "While these gas giants may not be able to host life, it is possible that they had moons that could, he added.",
      "There are missions currently under way to find out if there could be life in the vast oceans underneath the icy shells of several of Jupiter's moons.",
      "\"Key piece of proof\"",
      "Carbon dioxide (CO2) is essential for life on Earth, making it a key target in the search for life elsewhere.",
      "Because CO2 condenses into little ice particles in the deep cold of space, its presence can shed light on planetary formation.",
      "Jupiter and Saturn are believed to have first formed from a \"bottom up\" process in which a bunch of tiny, icy particles came together into a solid core which then sucked in gas to grow into giants, Balmer said.",
      "So the new discovery is a \"key piece of proof\" that far-off planets can form in a similar way to those in our celestial backyard, Balmer said.",
      "But how common this is throughout the universe remains unclear.",
      "\"Our hope with this kind of research is to understand our own solar system, life, and ourselves in the comparison to other exoplanetary systems, so we can contextualize our existence,\" Balmer said. \"We want to take pictures of other solar systems and see how they're similar or different when compared to ours. From there, we can try to get a sense of how weird our solar system really is\u2014or how normal.\"",
      "Astronomers have now discovered nearly 6,000 exoplanets, many of them massive \u2014 and none of them known to be habitable.",
      "The \"huge leap forward we need to make\" is to focus on smaller Earth-sized worlds, Balmer said.",
      "NASA's Nancy Grace Roman space telescope will use a coronagraph to do that just after its planned launch in 2027.",
      "Last year, the Webb telescope discovered carbon dioxide and hydrogen peroxide on the surface of Charon, Pluto's largest moon.",
      "Balmer hopes to use Webb to observe more four-planet systems, but added that future funding was now in question.",

      "Approaching from behind and below, the Crew Dragon, launched Friday evening from the Kennedy Space Center, passed 1,300 feet directly under the station before looping up to a point 720 feet directly ahead of the outpost. From there, it glided straight in for docking at the Harmony module's forward port at 12:04 a.m. EDT.",
      "Motorized latches then engaged to pull the capsule into the docking mechanism for an airtight structural seal. After standard leak checks and umbilical connections, the crew opened the Dragon's forward hatch at 1:35 a.m. and floated into the space station.",
      "Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, an Army colonel and former combat helicopter pilot, told flight controllers she and her fellow fliers had a \"great trip\" from the launch pad to the space station, adding \"I cannot tell you the immense joy of our crew when we looked out the window and we saw the space station for the first time.\"",
      "\"Let me tell you, that is such an amazing journey, you can hardly even put it into words,\" she said. \"The ride up on the Falcon 9, orbiting the Earth for the last couple of days, it's been absolutely incredible ... Thank you very, very much.\"",
      "\"Thank you to SpaceX for the awesome ride up here,\" said co-pilot Nichole Ayers, an Air Force major and F-22 Raptor pilot. \"As a (space) rookie, that was one of the coolest things I've ever done. I can't wait to get to work up here.\"",
      "McClain, Ayers, Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi and Russian cosmonaut Kirill Peskov -- both veteran commercial airline pilots \u2014 are replacing Crew 9 commander Nick Hague, cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov, Starliner commander Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and his pilot, Sunita Williams.",
      "Three other crew members, cosmonauts Aleksey Ovchinin, Ivan Vagner and NASA astronaut Donald Pettit, were launched to the station last September aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft. They're scheduled to return to Earth next month.",
      "Wilmore and Williams were launched last June 5 on the first piloted test flight of Boeing's Starliner astronaut ferry ship. The flight was originally expected to last about eight days.",
      "But during rendezvous with the space station, the Starliner experienced propulsion system problems and NASA eventually ruled out bringing the crew down on the Boeing spacecraft.",
      "Instead, the astronauts were told to remain aboard the station while the Starliner returned to Earth on its own. NASA then bumped two astronauts from the next station flight \u2014 Crew 9 \u2014 freeing up two seats for use by Wilmore and Williams.",
      "When Hague and Gorbunov reached the station, Wilmore and Williams joined them to become part of Crew 9 for a normal six-month tour of duty.",
      "Now that Crew 10 has arrived, Hague, Gorbunov, Wilmore and Williams will help familiarize their replacements with space station operations before undocking and returning to Earth next week with a splashdown in the Gulf near the coast of Florida. NASA announced on Sunday it was targeting Tuesday for the return journey, with undocking scheduled for 1:05 a.m. ET and splashdown at around 6 p.m.",
      "\"NASA and SpaceX met on Sunday to assess weather and splashdown conditions off Florida's coast for the return of the agency's Crew 9 mission from the International Space Station,\" NASA said in a statement.",
      "\"Mission managers are targeting an earlier Crew 9 return opportunity based on favorable conditions (predicted) for the evening of Tuesday, March 18. The updated return target continues to allow the space station crew members time to complete handover duties while providing operational flexibility ahead of less favorable weather conditions expected for later in the week.\"",
      "If all goes to plan, Wilmore and Williams upon landing will have logged 286 days in space since launch last June. While a long flight by any standard, it's still well short of the U.S. record for a single flight \u2014 371 days \u2014 set by astronaut Frank Rubio in 2022-23.",
      "Ironically, Rubio's record was the result of another extended mission, this one the result of a major coolant leak in the Russian Soyuz he launched aboard. The Russians decided not to bring the crew down aboard their original spacecraft and instead launched a replacement.",
      "Rubio ended up spending a little more than a full year in space, twice as long as he originally expected.",
      "Given Williams' two previous stays aboard the space station, she will move up to No. 2 on the list of most experienced U.S. astronauts with around 570 days in space overall, depending on the actual launch date. Only former astronaut Peggy Whitson has more time aloft among U.S. astronauts: 675 days over four flights.",

      "Stragaj says when he picked up the handbag he saw a knife inside.\u00a0 He took the bag back to Becky that morning and confronted her.",
      "\"I said, 'What did you do,' right away.\u00a0 I said, 'What the hell did you do?'\u00a0 And she said, 'You know why I did it,'\" said Stragaj.",
      "He says that confrontation was more than 10 hours before Becky called police to the house that night to report an alleged burglary. Stragaj also claims she threatened him.",
      "\"'And if you say anything, you're never gonna see a house or you're never gonna see a penny,'\" said Stragaj.",
      "Stragaj claims Becky threatened to withhold $75,000 he had invested in real estate with her.",
      "Ten months after the murder Leo Stragaj was arrested, but police kept looking for evidence.",
      "While the homicide investigation document listed Becky Schwartz as a suspect, she has never been charged with anything related to her husband's murder.",
      "But friends and colleagues of Dr. Schwartz have always suspected Becky was involved.",
      "\"It all points to her.\u00a0 She probably wasn't the one who pulled the trigger, but she was behind it all,\" said Dr. Patton.",
      "Her motive?",
      "\"What is the most important thing to Becky Schwartz?\" Van Sant asked Dr. Patton.",
      "\"Money.\u00a0 Money.\u00a0 Money.\u00a0 She is into money like you and I are into breathing air,\" he replied.",
      "\"And greedy, just greedy to the point of it being absurd almost,\" said Carter Schwartz.",
      "But absurd took on a new meaning with Becky after a tragic car accident 30 years ago that killed her 2-year-old son, Christopher.",
      "\"This is a woman whose son was killed by a drunk driver. She went to work for MADD, Mothers Against Drunk Driving. She has a felony conviction for embezzling money from MADD,\" said Dr. Patton.",
      "Becky was convicted of embezzling from Mothers Against Drunk Driving -- more than $12,000, she used to buy a car and a boat for herself.",
      "\"Now, you tell me; what kind of person does that?\" said Dr. Patton.",
      "Becky got five years probation and had to pay back the money she stole.",
      "\"That's like stealing money out of the donation tray at church,\" Dr. Patton remarked.",
      "And there were bizarre behaviors after Dr. Schwartz's death that fed speculation about Becky's involvement. \u00a0Patrick Olive and April Cox say that around 9 a.m., Becky unexpectedly showed up at their house.",
      "\"I heard the door open.\u00a0 She grabs a beer, and come sits on the couch, and drinks a beer,\" said Cox. \"Drinking the beer at 9:00 a.m. definitely not something\u2014\"",
      "\"Yeah, that was definitely not normal,\" said Olive.",
      "\"-- that we've ever seen,\" Cox continued. \"And I don't recall there being a lot of conversation. But I did notice her, you know, being-- a somewhat of a stressed type of thing, you know, putting her head -- hands on her knees. And she was rubbing her hair. And -- you know, and then I think she was gone after she drank the beer.\"",
      "And strangely, Becky never wanted a memorial service. But when Schwartz's colleagues planned one\u2026",
      "\"It turned out Rebecca had canceled any services, any ceremonies, any remembrances for my father. Only later did I find out she held a private funeral or service, if you would, at -- at the house to which I was not invited,\" said Carter.",
      "\"She is clearly a sociopath, without a doubt,\" said Dr. Patton.",
      "\"If evil is to the left, good is to the right. She's about five standard deviations off the left side,\" said Patton.",
      "According to Leo Stragaj, Becky even wanted Carter out of the picture. He claims there was a conversation at a bar along with Becky's son, Ben, a year before Dr. Schwartz was murdered.",
      "\"She goes, 'Listen, I want \u2013 I \u2013 I -- I want you to find somebody to kill Carter Schwartz --\" said Stragaj.",
      "\"Dr. Schwartz's son,\" Van Sant interrupted.",
      "\"-- \u00a0son. And her son goes, 'Mom, are you crazy?\u00a0 What -- what are you saying?\u00a0 Is-- is this -- drink talk and not -- what was that?'\u00a0 And she said, 'No, I'll say it when I'm sober.'\u00a0 And I said, 'Listen, I'm your man for construction, but I don't know what you're lookin' for.'\u00a0 I mean, that's crazy,\" Stragaj explained.",
      "Through a family friend, Ben confirmed that in that conversation he told his mother it was a crazy idea that she shouldn't even joke about.",
      "\"And why would she want you dead?\" Van Sant asked Carter.",
      "\"My guess is because I was finding this information out that she had kept hidden for years,\" he replied.",
      "That \"hidden information,\" Carter says, is that Becky was moving money from their joint bank accounts.",
      "\"And siphoned to where? Where did it go?\" Van Sant asked.",
      "\"Other accounts in only her name. She had credit cards that were only in her name, anything basically my dad couldn't get a hold of,\" Carter replied.",
      "\"And when you present this information, is this jaw dropping to your dad?\" Van Sant asked.",
      "\"I've never seen him move so quickly and he was a man who he could have the biggest argument in the world with you but he was very professional,\" Carter replied. \"He said, 'I'm going home. I'm gonna take care of this.'\"",
      "But Schwartz never did take care of it. And that became a problem for Carter.\u00a0 Because unbeknownst to him, his father had already changed his estate plan a year earlier, leaving his entire fortune to Becky and nothing for his own children.",
      "\"Why would he do that?\" Van Sant asked Carter.",
      "\"Anything I would tell you would be speculation.\u00a0 I'm not sure why,\" he replied. \"I wasn't there when he did it, but I can't imagine why, having sober judgment, anyone would do that.\"",
      "That's one of many unanswered questions.\u00a0 But a shocking incident long in Dr. Schwartz's past may provide a clue.",
      "SECRETS OF THE PAST",
      "A year after Dr. Steven Schwartz was found shot stabbed and strangled in his waterfront mansion, Leo Stragaj sits in jail.",
      "But could a shocking incident deep in Dr. Schwartz's past have played a role in his murder?",
      "Fifty-five years ago in Hobbs, New Mexico, Schwartz himself was involved in another murder case.",
      "\"It happened the day before Thanksgiving of 1961, November\" said Phillip Dyer.",
      "Back then, Dyer was 20 years old, a former high school football star and a buddy of Steven Schwartz.\u00a0 Today, Dyer is an adjunct professor of criminal justice at Youngstown State University in Ohio.",
      "\"That changed my whole life, right there in that point in time,\" he said.",
      "\"48 Hours\" brought Dyer back to New Mexico to tell the story of that day in 1961 with Schwartz, who was 21 and a college dropout. Schwartz was a tall, handsome kid from New York, the son of a doctor.",
      "\"I liked Steven. I really did. I mean -- he was intelligent. He was bright. He was sharp. He just had this kind of dark side to him that \u2026 you couldn't quite put your finger on it,\" Dyer explained.",
      "And on that fall day, the dark side came out. Schwartz decided to rob a local dentist, Dr. Victor Cook.",
      "James Cecil, a local auctioneer in Hobbs for decades, was a patient of Dr. Cook back then.",
      "\"I'd see him on the street from time to time and he'd always ask me, 'How you doin'? How's your teeth doin'?'\" Cecil said.",
      "\"He was just a good dentist and a good -- become a good friend,' Cecil continued. \"I just -- think he was just a great gentleman.\"",
      "In this small town where everybody knew everybody, Dr. Cook was known to carry large amounts of cash.",
      "\"Oh, I imagine he had maybe $1,000 or more at the time on him,\" Cecil said. \"I figure that's why Schwartz went there, to rob him.\"",
      "Schwartz, Dyer says, may have had some gambling debts to pay off.",
      "\"It was well-known that he liked to gamble quite a bit,\" said Dyer.",
      "A desperate kid looking for a way to bail himself out.",
      "\"I don't think he was a badass kid at all. I mean, I don't think any of us were, really,\" said Dyer.",
      "Schwartz had recruited Dyer to drive him to and from the dentist's office.",
      "Dyer wasn't even sure Schwartz was really going go through with it, until he pulled out a gun.",
      "\"I told him-- I said, 'I want nothin' to do with this. I'm leaving,'\" said Dyer.",
      "While Dyer walked away from his car, Schwartz went ahead with his plan. But the robbery of Dr. Cook went terribly wrong.",
      "\"As I read these stories, you know, he didn't want to give 'em his money,\" Cecil explained. \"Said, 'No, you'll have to shoot me. \u2026you're not gonna get my money.'\"",
      "Minutes later Schwartz, driving the car, pulled up to Dyer on the street.",
      "\"And I'm thinkin', 'He couldn't have done anything. It's too -- hasn't been long enough to do anything.' So I run and get in the car, and when I look inside -- get a look at his face when I get in. I turned around and look at him, and his eyes are just bloodshot,\" said Dyer.",
      "\"And what he described to me -- he said, 'I shot the man between the eyes,' and he did this,\" Dyer said, pointing between his eyes.",
      "It was a horrific incident. And to this day, Cecil has the gun Schwartz used to murder Dr. Cook.",
      "\"I thought always thought a lot of him, and I want that gun. So I bought it \u00a0at the auction,\" he said.",
      "\"I think most of us that were involved, that it was a horrendous, despicable and deplorable act,\" said Dyer.",
      "Dyer, the accomplice, went to prison for a year.\u00a0 Schwartz, the shooter, spent nine years in prison.\u00a0 Both sentences were eventually commuted and both men later went to college.\u00a0 Schwartz moved to Italy, where he earned a medical degree.

      "\"The only one that can really answer that question is Dr. Schwartz himself,\" said Wil Florin.",
      "Florin and Tom Roebig are top civil attorneys in Florida, who represented Carter and his family in a wrongful death lawsuit.",
      "\"The person that benefitted was Becky Schwartz and the people that she deems worthy of giving away Dr. Schwartz's money to.\u00a0 And we've alleged that Leo and Becky conspired to murder him,\" said Roebig.",
      "Ben is not named in the lawsuit and there have been no criminal charges filed against him in the murder.\u00a0 But as for Dr. Schwartz's dark past\u2026",
      "\"There's some folks who think that his past was being used against him,\" said Florin.",
      "Used, Florin theorizes, by Becky Schwartz to blackmail her own husband for millions.",
      "\"But is the suggestion -- the possibility that Rebecca Schwartz may have said to him, 'If you don't transfer everything in the estate over to me, I will make this deep dark secret public. I'll ruin your reputation. \u2026Your own children will learn that you are a murderer,'\" Van Sant asked Florin.",
      "\"Well, that's one possibility,\" he replied.",
      "In fact, according to a police document, one of Schwartz's office workers called police to say: \"Rebecca was blackmailing Dr. Schwartz by withholding information that could ruin his career.\"",
      "\"If she knew -- which I have every reason to believe she did -- that's entirely possible that was something used against him,\" Carter acknowledged.",

      "And Becky seduced her new boyfriend with expensive gifts, too.",

      "WHO KILLED DR. SCHWARTZ?",
      "More than three years have passed since Dr. Schwartz's murder, and Becky Schwartz splits her time between Florida and Wisconsin.",
      "\"All these things that we're talking about would never have come to light if it wasn't for money.\u00a0 And big money.\u00a0 Millions and millions of dollars worth of money,\" said Becky's attorney, Denis deVlaming.",
      "DeVlaming says this case is about greed, but it's the greed of the Schwartz children in trying to pin the murder on Becky so they can get their father's money instead of her.",
      "\"They've got to trash her. They gotta show her as somebody that would participate in the murder, because that's the only way they're gonna profit in this case,\" he said.",
      "DeVlaming says all the evidence points to Leo Stragaj.",
      "\"What does the DNA evidence tell you?\" Van Sant asked.",
      "\"That Leo Stragaj was there at the time of murder. That that's how his DNA got there. That's when his DNA got there. And that he was the killer,\" said deVlaming.",
      "\"Why in the world would Leo Stragaj murder Dr. Stephen Schwartz when Schwartz was providing him his entire livelihood?\" Van Sant asked.",
      "\"My theory is that Dr. Schwartz was gonna retire. He was in his 70s. And I think that -- I think that Leo Stragaj believed that his time with the Schwartzes was limited. And he was going to be replaced with somebody far less expensive,\" deVlaming replied. \"And -- if Dr. Schwartz was outta the picture that perhaps Rebecca Schwartz would keep him on.\"",
      "Furthermore, deVlaming says, Stragaj's story of being in the house to retrieve Becky's purse makes no sense.",
      "\"You go grab the bag,\" Van Sant noted.",
      "\"I seen, like, jewelry boxes and one knife on the bag,\" said Stragaj.",
      "\"A knife?\"",
      "\"A knife,\" Stragaj replied. \"Kitchen knife.\"",

      "\"Was there blood on the knife?\" Van Sant asked.",
      "\"No -- not as I recall,\" Stragaj replied.",
      "\"It's hogwash. And the reason it's hogwash is Leo says that he looks in the bag and he sees a butcher knife. What individual would tell somebody that could turn them in, to go pick up the murder weapon that could be turned into the police to get your DNA, (laughs) your fingerprints? It's absolutely laughably ridiculous,\" said deVlaming.",
      "And, deVlaming points out, even Stragaj's alibi was shot down by police, who checked his cell phone records.",
      "\"Here's another quote from the report,\" Van Sant said to Stragaj. \"'Analysis of cell phone activity failed to support his alibi,' -- your alibi. 'Locations and associated times given by [you] did not match cell phone tower.'\"",
      "\"I\u2014well, I told you I don't -- I know what I did. I was with people with alibi all day. And I made two runs because I'm -- I'm in construction site job, $125,000 job. So, I had to go and buy materials or dump a trailer. That\u2014,\" he replied.",
      "\"This looks really bad, though.\u00a0 This looks bad,\" Van Sant pointed out.",
      "\"I know it was bad.\u00a0 I want-- I-- I know it looks bad,\" said Stragaj",
      "And, deVlaming says, Sragaj is a large man capable of physical force, unlike Becky.",
      "\"My client is five foot three.\u00a0 Dr. Schwartz is six foot three.\u00a0 There's no way in the world that she could have shot, stabbed and strangled somebody that big,\" he said.",

      "\"All of those are false. All-- those statements are false,\" deVlaming told Van Sant.",
      "But Stragaj insists he didn't do it\u2014that Becky was the culprit.",

      "\"Your DNA was on the victim.\u00a0 You didn't call 911.\u00a0 And when you were interviewed by investigators, you lied to them.\u00a0 You add all that up, and you've got yourself a murder suspect,\" Van Sant remarked.",
      "\"I know. That's why I'm here,\" he said of being incarcerated.",
      "\"He lied to the police. The police talked to Leo Stragaj. The police took his statement. He never mentioned anything -- anything in his statement to the police about Rebecca Schwartz being in any way responsible for the death of her husband,\" said DeVlaming.",
      "Leo Stragaj admits he never implicated Becky until the day he was arrested.",
      "\"I believe that both Leo Stragaj and Rebecca Schwartz were involved in his murder and caused his death on that date,\" said Carter Schwartz.",
      "So who killed Dr. Schwartz?\u00a0 There was a potential eyewitness of sorts -- the elaborate security camera system in the mansion -- something only Stragaj, Becky and family members knew about.\u00a0 But the hard drive had been removed.",
      "\"Did you remove the hard drive from that security camera\u2014\" Van Sant asked.",
      "\"No, I \u2013\" Stragaj replied.",
      "\"Who do you think did?\u00a0 Who else besides you would know that that hard drive was there?\" Van Sant asked.",
      "\"Her. And if she had somebody else helping her,\" Stragaj replied.",
      "Leo Stragaj awaits trial as the only person charged.\u00a0 But Becky's attorneys are uncertain what the future will hold for her. Police aren't talking because the case is still open.",
      "\"Is she still a person of interest in this case?\" Van Sant asked deVlaming.",

But doctors and health officials say the vaccine, which is normally given as part of the combination measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, is\u00a0highly safe and effective.",
      "While most people's symptoms improve, about 1 in 5 unvaccinated people who get measles will be hospitalized. About 1 out of every 1,000 children with measles will develop brain swelling that can lead to brain damage, and up to 3 of every 1,000 children who become infected will die, the CDC says.",
      "The largest outbreak so far this year has been in West Texas, but cases have been reported in a number of other states around the country as well.",
      "The CBS News data team is tracking confirmed measles cases nationwide, updating this page as new data is released by state health departments and the CDC. (The CDC releases its latest weekly numbers on Fridays.)",
      "The Texas outbreak is primarily affecting\u00a0children and teenagers, nearly all of whom were\u00a0unvaccinated\u00a0or have an unknown vaccination status. State and local health officials confirmed the patient who died was an unvaccinated school-aged child.",
      "The last measles death in the U.S. was in 2019 when a 37-year-old man died from measles complicated by meningitis in California, according to CDC data.",
      "The highest number of confirmed cases in the U.S. in recent years was 1,274 in 2019, driven by outbreaks in New York, California and Washington state, but most years the total has been much lower.",
      "Health experts point to lower vaccination rates as a reason for increases in preventable diseases like the measles.",
      "CDC data shows about 93% of kindergarteners in the U.S. were vaccinated against measles during the 2021-2022 school year and only 92.7% in the 2023-2024 school year. This is\u00a0down from 95.2% during the 2019-2020 school year \u2014 a critical threshold to keep people safe.",
      "\"When more than 95% of people in a community are vaccinated, most people are protected through community immunity (herd immunity),\" the CDC states.",
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a\u00a0noted vaccine skeptic, voiced support for the measles vaccine in early March amid the\u00a0deadly outbreak\u00a0in the Southwest, after previously downplaying the growing cases and making numerous false and misleading claims about the safety of the MMR vaccine.",
      "Kennedy said he was \"deeply concerned about the recent measles outbreak,\" in an opinion piece published by Fox News.",
      "\"Vaccines not only protect individual children from measles, but also contribute to community immunity, protecting those who are unable to be vaccinated due to medical reasons,\" he wrote.",

    "summary": "Trump administration effort to wind down the Education Department could lead to frustration for millions of student loan borrowers, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's executive order on Thursday starting the process of dismantling the Department of Education could throw federal student loan programs into disarray and lead to frustration for millions of borrowers, according to experts.",
      "The Education Department's remit is broad. The agency manages student loans for more than 40 million Americans; oversees $18 billion in Title I funding for elementary and secondary education in low-income areas; issues Pell Grants to help low- and middle-income students pay for college; and administers the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, which lets students apply for loans, grants and other college aid.",
      "\"It takes resources to manage that asset, including trained staff to make sure borrowers have good information and colleges can administer loan programs properly,\" said Peter Granville, a higher education finance expert and fellow at The Century Foundation, a progressive think tank. \"It takes technical expertise that only Education Department officials have.\"",
      "Ahead of the Thursday signing ceremony for Mr. Trump's order, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that the Education Department \"will be much smaller than it is today.\" She said at the time that the agency would, for now, retain oversight of student loans and Pell grants.",
      "Mr. Trump, in his Oval Office remarks on Friday, said the Small Business Administration (SBA) would assume oversight of student loans.",
      "\"I have decided the the SBA, the Small Business Administration ... will handle all of the student loan portfolio. We have a portfolio that's very large, lots of loans,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Trump administration officials had previously said such programs would eventually be transferred to another federal agency, such as the Treasury Department, Commerce Department or SBA.",
      "\"Closing the department does not mean cutting off funds from those who depend on them \u2014 we will continue to support K-12 students, students with special needs, college student borrowers and others who rely on essential programs,\" Education Secretary Linda McMahon said in a statement after Mr. Trump signed the order. \"We're going to follow the law and eliminate the bureaucracy responsibly by working through Congress to ensure a lawful and orderly transition.\"",
      "Though the Trump administration wants to dismantle the Education Department, eliminating it completely would require an act of Congress \u2014 a significant political hurdle given that most Senate legislation requires a filibuster-proof 60 votes to pass.",
      "\"Recipe for chaos\"",
      "Despite the Trump administration's expectations for a smooth wind down of the Education Department, experts warn that the administrative challenges in transferring oversight of student loans from one part of government to another are significant. They also note that prior to Friday, the White House had not released a plan for overseeing student loans as the Education Department shrinks, or specified which department would inherit its duties.",
      "\"It doesn't pass the sniff test that you'd summarily move a complex, large student debt portfolio from the Department of Education, where it's already lived, and just plop it over to the Treasury,\" Jessica Thompson, senior vice president at The Institute for College Access and Success, a nonprofit group focused on education policy, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"We are concerned that there is not a serious, detailed thoughtful plan for reform around what to do with the student loan portfolio.\"",
      "Granville concurred with that assessment. Gutting the Education Department before articulating a plan to reassign student loan oversight \"is not a recipe for efficiency or innovation,\" he said. \"It's a recipe for chaos and frustration for millions of people who rely on the student loan program.\"",
      "The Trump Administration has already slashed the Education Department's staff in half, dismissing employees tasked with managing $1.6 trillion in student loan debt.",
      "\"The department was already understaffed, and with the breadth and depth of the firings last week, we have big questions about the ability to provide service to 40-plus millions borrowers,\" Thompson said.",
      "She points to the long wait times Americans with student loans face in reaching agency staff by phone to get their questions answered. \"We were already in a situation where we needed improvements in customer service, so there is no conceivable way you could gut the institutional expertise that occurred last week and not have repercussions,\" Thompson said.",
      "That could lead to confusion for current and future student borrowers seeking information about loan payments and other servicing issues, duties now handled by the Education Department. Thompson also worries that a sudden vacuum in such information could lead to a spike in loan defaults.",
      "\"Now, they can't call and get advice or have questions about how much their loan payments will be and can they afford them, answered,\" she said.",
      "\"[W]e are barreling toward another student default crisis with less commitment and capacity to help borrowers repay,\" Granville added.",

      "The charges come more than two years after Weiss was fired in January 2023 amid an investigation by university police into possible computer-access crimes at a football building.",
      "Weiss, 42, is charged with 14 counts of unauthorized access to computers and 10 counts of aggravated identity theft.",
      "Officials allege that between 2015 and January 2023, Weiss hacked student-athlete databases of more than 100 colleges that were held by a third-party vendor. Once he gained access to the databases, Weiss allegedly downloaded \"personally identifiable information and medical data of more than 150,000 athletes.\"",
      "Weiss is accused of primarily targeting female student-athletes.",

      "Through the information that he obtained from the databases and his research, Weiss allegedly gained access to email and social media accounts as well as cloud storage accounts of more than 2,000 student-athletes. He's also accused of illegally obtaining the same information of more than 1,300 additional students and alumni from colleges across the U.S.",
      "After obtaining access to the accounts, Weiss reportedly downloaded personal and intimate pictures and videos that were not meant to be shared publicly, officials say.",
      "\"Our office will move aggressively to prosecute computer hacking to protect the private accounts of our citizens,\" said Acting U.S. Attorney Julie Beck in a news release. \"We stand ready with our law enforcement partners to bring those who illegally invade the privacy of others to justice.\"",

      "\"Today's indictment of Matthew Weiss underscores the commitment and meticulous investigative efforts of our law enforcement professionals,\" said Cheyvoryea Gibson, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI in Michigan. \"The FBI Detroit Cyber Task Force, in close collaboration with the University of Michigan Police Department, worked relentlessly on this case to safeguard and protect our community.\"",
      "Weiss served as Michigan's quarterbacks coach in 2021 and as their co-offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach during the 2022 season. Before his time in Ann Arbor, Weiss was on the Baltimore Ravens coaching staff from 2009-2020.",

    "story": [
      "Edesia Nutrition was among the fortunate few whose USAID agreement survived a whipsaw couple of months that saw the cancellation of more than 80% of the agency's foreign assistance contracts.",
      "Despite that, the Rhode Island manufacturer of a life-saving paste for severely malnourished babies last week had to lay off 10% of its workforce. Edesia's founder and CEO, Navyn Salem, said even though her company's contract is active, its invoices to USAID have been rejected twice this week.",
      "The delay in promised funds halted her production line, as well as payments to her largely American supply chain, including farmers who cultivate ingredients for the paste product's key ingredients.",
      "The layoffs were \"the hardest thing I've ever had to do,\" Salem said.",
      "\"The people here are like part of my family. I've been to their weddings. I've been to their family's funerals. I know their grandchildren. We're an interconnected family,\" Salem said.",
      "As Elon Musk, the richest person in the world, and others who work for President Trump have targeted the State Department agency USAID, a variety of global health nonprofits have faltered amid dramatic supply chain disruptions.",
      "Musk himself weighed in on March 2, posting on his social media site that Edesia's contract would be spared.",
      "At the time, a vital USAID payment system had yet to be restored. Salem said it was restarted recently, but on Tuesday and Wednesday she heard from USAID that at least two of her invoices had been rejected. One was denied because her goods had not yet shipped, while the other was denied even though it was for a batch that had shipped. She said it's not clear why that one was rejected.",
      "In the meantime, bills are piling up.",
      "\"There's still payroll and the lights to turn on and the peanut farmers to pay,\" Salem said.",
      "A spokesperson for the State Department replied to questions about the agency's payment systems. The agency did not immediately reply to questions about Edesia's invoices. The spokesperson said a review of the agency's grants and programs ordered by Secretary of State Marco Rubio \"exposed serious flaws in the legacy systems used to approve and issue payments at USAID.\"",
      "\"This has caused significant unforeseen delays and prompted the Administration to take unprecedented steps to implement more streamlined processes,\" the spokesperson said. \"USAID has 27 payment and finance systems, all of which have been found to be inefficient, broken, and built to intentionally make communication with other systems in the federal government impossible.\"",
      "Those unforeseen delays have rippled out beyond Edesia, Salem said.",
      "\"You have American farmers, American commodities brokers, American manufacturers, American shippers, and the NGOs, the American organizations\u2026..if one of those goes down, the whole system stops,\" she said.",
      "Edesia's prescription food, called Plumpy'Nut, had been feeding children in Africa, including South Sudan\u2014a country currently experiencing extreme famine\u2014when the delivery was disrupted.",
      "Plumpy'Nut is a ready-to-use therapeutic food, prescribed for the treatment of severe acute malnutrition in children as young as six months old.",
      "Salem said her production line is capable of making food for 415 babies per hour, but her warehouse is filling up. In the meantime, as it responds to USAID's sudden upheaval, Edesia is itself working to be more efficient.",
      "\"We've just changed from a company that's been here for 16 years to being like a startup, to being more scrappy, we need to change the way we're doing everything,\" Salem said. \"I am endlessly optimistic and hopeful. I believe in the mission we have. I believe that the majority of Americans believe in feeding children, everywhere.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump has taken aim at the Department of Education, but shutting down the department entirely would require an act of Congress.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump announced the signing of an executive order that would begin the process of dismantling the Department of Education \"once and for all.\"",
      "\"We're going to eliminate it, and everybody knows it's right,\" the president said of the department at the White House Thursday. He added, \"We're not doing well with the world of education in this country, and we haven't for a long time.\"",
      "The U.S. spends \"more money per pupil, yet we rank near the bottom of the list in terms of success,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "He claimed that 70% of eighth graders \"are not proficient in either reading or math,\" and \"40% of fourth graders lack even basic reading skills.\" The president said that the administration would be returning education \"back to the states, where it belongs.\"",
      "After he signed the executive order, flanked by schoolchildren at desks on either side of him, the president held it up and invited Education Secretary Linda McMahon to stand with him on stage. Several Republican governors were on hand for the signing, too, including Governors Ron DeSantis of Florida, Mike DeWine of Ohio, Michael Braun of Indiana, Gregg Abbott of Texas and Kim Reynolds of Iowa.",
      "In the two months since Mr. Trump took office, the Education Department's staff has already been slashed in half, and the administration is making plans to transfer some of its functions to other departments.",
      "Despite the president's rhetoric, fully eliminating the Department of Education would require an act of Congress. To advance most legislation in the Senate requires 60 votes, meaning seven Democrats would need to vote for it along with all Republicans.",
      "During the signing ceremony, Mr. Trump seemed to acknowledge that he'll need the backing of some Democratic lawmakers: \"I hope they're going to be voting for it because ultimately, it may come before them.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Thursday on Fox News, ahead of the signing, that the Education Department would be much smaller than it is currently.",
      "A White House official told CBS News on Wednesday that the following services will not be affected by the order: Student loans, Pell grants and Title I, which provides financial assistance to school districts for children from low-income families, and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.",
      "A White House official said Thursday that student loans, IDEA enforcement, and enforcing civil rights laws will remain at a smaller Education Department \"for now,\" but they will eventually be transferred to other departments.",
      "Upon naming Linda McMahon as education secretary, Mr. Trump said he wanted her to \"put herself out of a job.\" After she was confirmed by the Senate earlier this month, she sent a letter to the department titled \"Our Department's Final Mission,\" saying Mr. Trump had \"tasked us with accomplishing the elimination of bureaucratic bloat here at the Department of Education \u2014 a momentous final mission \u2014 quickly and responsibly.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said Thursday that \"hopefully she will be the last secretary of education.\"",

      "CBS News has obtained an internal government list of the names of the Venezuelan men the Trump administration deported to El Salvador as part of a secretive operation last week that has triggered a legal standoff in the U.S. and a debate around the world.",
      "On March 15, the U.S. government deported 238 male Venezuelan citizens on three flights to El Salvador, accusing them of being part of a transnational gang known as Tren de Aragua, which President Trump has labeled a foreign terrorist group and wartime enemy.",
      "Upon landing, the deported men were forcefully led off planes by heavily armed Salvadoran authorities. They were marched into armored vehicles, had their heads shaved and were transferred into cells inside El Salvador's notorious maximum security prison, known as CECOT.",
      "The high-profile deportations quickly set off a legal battle in the U.S. The court fight initially centered on the legality of Mr. Trump's move to invoke the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to expel many of the Venezuelan deportees. It has since expanded into a showdown over whether the Trump administration knowingly defied a federal judge's order to halt deportations under the wartime law and turn the flights around.",
      "U.S. officials have said 137 of the Venezuelan men were treated as \"enemy aliens\" and removed from the country under the 18th century law. The other 101 were deported under regular immigration procedures, the officials have said.",
      "Beyond that, the U.S. government has provided scant details about the deportations and has not publicly released the names of those sent to El Salvador. Family members and lawyers of deportees have said they only learned their loved ones or clients had been deported to the small Central American country through videos and photos posted by the Salvadoran government and news outlets.",
      "The Trump administration has said it verified that all the Venezuelan deportees have connections to Tren de Aragua, but those accusations have been denied by relatives of some of those who were deported. The U.S. government has said in a court declaration that while some of those expelled have criminal histories in the U.S., \"many\" do not.",
      "CBS News is publishing the U.S. government's list of the names of the 238 Venezuelan deportees sent to El Salvador below. How long they will remain imprisoned in El Salvador and whether their family members and lawyers will be allowed to communicate with them remain open questions.",

    "summary": "Over the last year, the NTSB identified 68 bridges built before 1991 that don't have a \"current vulnerability assessment\" and need to be evaluated.",
    "story": [
      "The National Transportation Safety Board recommended Thursday 68 bridges across 19 states be evaluated with a \"vulnerability assessment\" to determine their risk of collapse if involved in a vessel collision in the wake of last year's deadly collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore.",
      "Over the last year, the NTSB identified 68 bridges built before 1991 that don't have a \"current vulnerability assessment.\" The recommendations were issued to 30 owners of the 68 different bridges across the country, NTSB officials announced Thursday.",
      "Some of the bridges include the Golden Gate Bridge in California, the Brooklyn Bridge in New York City and the Sunshine Skyway Bridge in Florida.",
      "In response to the recommendation from the NTSB, the Golden Gate Bridge, Highway and Transportation District said Thursday that the Golden Gate Bridge is \"in full compliance with all state and federal regulations\" and that the district hired a consultant this year to \"conduct an assessment of the South Tower fender system's structural capacity for ship collisions.\"",
      "The NTSB noted that their recommendation does not suggest that the 68 bridges are certain to collapse, but rather those bridge owners evaluate whether the bridges are above the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials' acceptable level of risk.",
      "The 68 bridges were divided into two categories, \"critical/essential\" and \"typical.\" Those deemed critical/essential are those that serve as \"important links.\" The Key Bridge had this classification. Those that are not deemed critical/essential fall under the typical designation.",
      "The recommendation comes as NTSB officials released new information in the Key Bridge collapse investigation Thursday. Nearly a year ago, on March 26, 2024, a large cargo ship lost electrical power and crashed into the Key Bridge, causing it to collapse, and knocking eight roadworkers, six of whom died, into the Patapsco River.",
      "\"Had the Key Bridge's owner, the Maryland Transportation Authority, or MDTA, conducted a vulnerability assessment based on recent vessel traffic as recommended by AASHTO, MDTA would have been aware that the Key Bridge was above the acceptable risk and would have had information to proactively reduce the bridge's risk of a collapse and loss of lives associated with a vessel collision with the bridge,\" NTSB said in a statement Thursday.",
      "The NTSB found that the Key Bridge was almost 30 times greater than the acceptable risk threshold for critical or essential bridges.",
      "NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy said the final report of the Baltimore incident will be released in the fall.",

    "summary": "The Federal Reserve's downbeat outlook on the U.S. economy is a wake-up call for investors.",
    "story": [
      "For President Trump, the barrage of tariffs the U.S. is set\u00a0to unleash on the country's largest trading partners on April 2 amounts to \"Liberation Day,\" as he described the trade measures Thursday on social media. To the Federal Reserve, as Chair Jerome Powell relayed on Wednesday, tariffs are a broadside on economic growth.",
      "Where does that leave investors? Scratching their heads, judging by today's trading. Stocks wobbled early, rebounded and then lost momentum in the afternoon. The S&P 500 fell 12 points, or 0.2%, to close at 5,663, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended largely flat and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.3%.",
      "The dip followed the stock market's modest bounce yesterday after the Fed announced it was standing pat on interest rates, as Wall Street had expected. Indeed, investors may not have learned much from the central bank and Powell's remarks given that economists have already begun forecasting weaker growth and higher inflation as the U.S. moves to deploy tariffs against Canada, China, Europe, Mexico and other countries.",
      "Powell's uncertainty principle",
      "Another thing investors didn't learn from the Fed: The world is a much more uncertain place today than it was before Mr. Trump was re-elected in November. Financial markets have slumped this year as the White House laid out its plans for tariffs, with the S&P 500 falling briefly into correction territory, or 10% below its previous peak. The index is now down 8.4% since reaching its all-time high on Feb. 19.",
      "Still, if there were any lingering doubts that the nation's economic outlook is murky, Powell seemed determined to squash them flat. The Fed chair cited uncertainty five times in his prepared remarks and another dozen times in the following press conference.",
      "That uncertainty refers to the questions regarding how the Trump administration's economic agenda on trade, immigration, fiscal policy and government regulation could affect the economy.",
      "For people thinking of taking out a loan, of course, what is certain is that for now the Fed prefers to assess the impact of these policies before cutting its benchmark interest rate.",
      "That caution, while understandable given the questions hanging over the economy, could itself pose risks \u2014 namely, that the Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank's rate-setting panel, might wait too long before easing back on the stick.",
      "\"[T]he Fed's understandably cautious stance also opens the door for the Committee to be late to the party in the event the economy starts to lose more momentum, which is the higher risk in our opinion,\" TD Cowen analysts said Thursday in note to investors.",
      "There is ample precedent for the Fed mistiming its policy shifts, as it did during the pandemic when an earlier move to tighten rates might have helped head off rising inflation.",
      "To be sure, despite the haze surrounding the economy, Powell remains clear on one thing that should prove reassuring to investors: The risks of a U.S. recession remain low. And although Fed policymakers expect inflation to rise this year to 2.7%, they also think it will recede to 2.2% in 2026 and 2% in 2027.",
      "Barry Bannister, chief equity strategist at Stifel, thinks stocks could climb in the near term as investors focus on word from the Fed that it could still lower rates twice this year. Over the longer term, the question hovering over markets will be how the economy responds to the shock therapy administered by Mr. Trump, and whether the Fed has the medicine to address it.",

    "story": [
      "Wildland firefighters will keep a 4-year-old pay hike under a GOP-led spending bill signed by President Donald Trump, but many worry that mass federal worker firings will leave the nation more vulnerable to wildfires.",
      "Interior Secretary Doug Burgum on Wednesday credited Trump with securing the pay increase in a post on the social media site X. He said the administration is grateful to firefighters who he said \"embody the American spirit by selflessly risking their lives to protect their neighbors, protect their communities and preserve our natural heritage.\"",
      "The permanent pay raise comes as Trump and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency has cut about 3,400 workers at the U.S. Forest Service, about 1,000 at the National Park Service and another 1,000 at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
      "Many of those workers kept trails free of debris, oversaw prescribed burns, thinned forests and were specially trained to work with firefighters. They say staffing cuts threaten public safety, especially in the West, where drier and hotter conditions linked to climate change have increased the intensity of wildfires.",
      "Indiscriminate firings",
      "\"What I'm hearing from my constituents who actually fight fires in Washington state is that Trump and Elon are making wildland firefighters' jobs far more difficult and far more dangerous by indiscriminately firing thousands of Forest Service workers and others who support wildland firefighting,\" Democratic U.S. Sen. Patty Murray said in an email to The Associated Press. \"It's disingenuous and frankly insulting for this administration to pretend otherwise.\"",
      "The federal government has been rehiring some employees under court order after the firings were challenged.",
      "According to the National Federation of Federal Employees, wildland firefighters first began receiving a raise \u2014 50%, or up to $20,000 \u2014 temporarily in 2021 as part of the bipartisan infrastructure law signed by then-President Joe Biden. Congress subsequently extended the raise on a short-term basis.",
      "Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho, oversees forest spending as chair of the House Interior and Environment Appropriations subcommittee and worked to make the pay raise permanent.",
      "\"A permanent pay fix for our wildland firefighters will strengthen recruitment and retention while providing financial security to the first responders who protect our communities,\" Simpson said in a news release.",
      "Celebration and concern from union",
      "Randy Erwin, president of the National Federation of Federal Employees, likewise celebrated the raise, saying the union had been fighting for it for years.",
      "\"Now, that fight is paying off,\" Erwin said in a statement. \"A permanent pay fix means we can shift our focus to addressing other critical issues \u2014 recruitment and retention, housing, mental health benefits, rest and recuperation, and the overall well-being of our nation's wildland firefighting workforce.\"",
      "But he warned that continued efforts by the Trump administration to cut firefighters and their support personnel \"will cripple the workforce and make Americans less safe.\"",
      "\"Congress must not let these harmful plans be carried out,\" Erwin said.",
      "Washington State Forester George Geissler, who leads the state's wildland firefighting efforts, has over 30 years of experience with wildfires. He said federal officials don't appreciate the roles those workers play in fighting fires.",
      "\"I don't think there is a desire to reduce the number of firefighters with the Forest Service,\" he said Wednesday. \"But I do think there is a clear lack of understanding about how the inter-agency wildland fire system is set up, how it works, and how people that don't have 'firefighter' listed as their job are still a massive part of the response system in the country.\"",
      "Former NOAA administrator Rick Spinrad said a reduction in that agency's workforce will also critically inhibit wildland firefighting.",
      "Spinrad said NOAA and the National Weather Service have about 100 \"incident meteorologists,\" or I-Mets, who deploy to wildfires to provide support on the scene \u2014 such as by letting firefighters know where the winds are coming from and what weather conditions are forecast.",
      "\"I know for a fact that some of those I-Mets will not be on the job, so that capability is going to be compromised,\" Spinrad said during a recent press conference with several laid-off NOAA workers.",
      "Gregg Bafundo was laid off last month from his job as a wilderness ranger and wildland firefighter in Washington's Okanogan Wenatchee National Forest.",
      "Bafundo is among those who have at least temporarily been called back to work, but his long-term future with the agency is unclear.",
      "\"I have always placed myself between the danger and my fellow citizens, and now I feel like I've been cast aside like some sort of parasite class or some kind of fraud,\" he said during a press conference hosted by Murray last month. \"These heartless and gutless firings will lead to the loss of lives and property.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Thursday blocked the government from deporting a Georgetown University researcher who was detained by immigration authorities earlier this week as part of the Trump administration's crackdown on activists across college campuses.",
      "Badar Khan Suri, an Indian national, is a postdoctoral associate who was studying and teaching at Georgetown on a student visa. The government cited his alleged \"close connections\" to a Hamas official as justification for revoking the visa, saying he was \"actively spreading Hamas propaganda.\"",
      "Attorneys for Suri filed a writ of habeas corpus and accompanying complaint challenging his detention in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia on Tuesday, one day after his arrest. CBS News obtained the documents on Thursday.",
      "In an order later in the day, Judge Patricia Tolliver Giles said Suri \"shall not be removed from the United States unless and until the Court issues a contrary order.\"",
      "The complaint filed by Suri's attorneys said he was surrounded and detained by masked DHS agents as he was returning to his home in Rosslyn, Virginia, where he lives with his wife Mapheze Saleh and their three children, after breaking his fast for Ramadan on March 17.",
      "\"The agents identified themselves as members of the Department of Homeland Security and stated that the government had revoked his visa,\" the complaint said, adding that \"the agents had face coverings and Ms. Saleh could only see their eyes.\"",
      "Roughly two hours after his arrest, Suri called his wife to let her know that he was being sent to a detention center in Farmville, Virginia, his attorneys said. They added that they believe he is likely to be moved to a detention facility in Los Fresnos, Texas, near the U.S.-Mexico border. As of Thursday, Immigration and Customs Enforcement's online detainee locator showed Suri was being held at a detention facility in Louisiana. His lawyers have filed a motion seeking his return to Virginia.",
      "Suri's attorneys said his \"unjustified detention\" violated his due process rights. They argued that the Trump administration's targeting of noncitizens for removal based on protected speech, namely his and his wife's views of Israel and Gaza, is \"arbitrary and capricious\" and constitutes viewpoint discrimination. They said that he has no criminal record and has not been charged with any crime.",
      "The complaint alleged that the couple had \"long been doxxed and smeared\" online by an \"anonymously-run blacklisting site\" known as The Canary Mission. The site alleges that Saleh, who Suri's attorneys said is a U.S. citizen, \"has worked for Hamas, expressed support for Hamas terrorism and called for Israel's destruction,\" according to a profile dedicated to her on the site. The Canary Mission, the complaint said, runs a blacklist of individuals who its creators believe support Palestinian rights and \"is infamous for bullying, slandering, and defaming academics and students.\" The complaint also alleges that the couple were \"smeared\" by other websites.",
      "A Georgetown University spokesperson said Suri obtained his visa in order \"to continue his doctoral research on peacebuilding in Iraq and Afghanistan.\"",
      "\"We are not aware of him engaging in any illegal activity, and we have not received a reason for his detention,\" the school spokesperson told CBS News. \"We support our community members' rights to free and open inquiry, deliberation and debate, even if the underlying ideas may be difficult, controversial or objectionable. We expect the legal system to adjudicate this case fairly.\"",
      "In its own statement, a spokesperson for DHS told CBS News that Suri was a \"foreign exchange student at Georgetown University actively spreading Hamas propaganda and promoting antisemitism on social media.\"",
      "The DHS spokesperson claimed that Suri had \"close connections to a known or suspected terrorist, who is a senior adviser to Hamas.\"",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued a determination on March 15 that \"Suri's activities and presence in the United States rendered him deportable\" under the Immigration and Nationality Act, the spokesperson added.",
      "The detention follows ICE agents' controversial March 8 arrest in New York City\u00a0of Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University student and green card holder who was involved in the 2024 pro-Palestinian campus protests.",
      "The 30-year-old Khalil, an Algerian national who was born in Syria to Palestinian parents, is also being held in Louisiana detention facility. Khalil was arrested in front of his wife, who was eight-months pregnant at the time.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Thursday temporarily blocked the White House's Department of Government Efficiency from accessing systems at the Social Security Administration containing the sensitive information of millions of Americans, delivering another setback to President Trump's efforts to overhaul the federal government.",
      "U.S. District Judge Ellen Hollander wrote in a 137-page decision that a group of unions challenging DOGE's access to systems of records at the SSA was likely to succeed on its claims that the efforts violated the Privacy Act and a federal law that governs the agency rulemaking process.",
      "She granted a request for a temporary restraining order that was sought by the labor unions, which filed a lawsuit in February that challenged the legality of the SSA's decision to allow DOGE to get its hands on sensitive, personal and confidential information pertaining to millions of Americans.",
      "\"The defense does not appear to share a privacy concern for the millions of Americans whose SSA records were made available to the DOGE affiliates, without their consent, and which contain sensitive, confidential, and personally identifiable information,\" wrote Hollander, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama.",
      "The judge's order blocks officials at the SSA from granting DOGE access to systems containing Americans' personal information. It also requires Elon Musk, DOGE and its team members at the agency to delete all non-anonymized personal information that they obtained from the SSA, and prevents them from accessing any agency computer or software code.",
      "Lee Saunders, president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, cheered the decision as a win for American workers and retirees across the country.",
      "\"The court saw that Elon Musk and his unqualified lackeys present a grave danger to Social Security and have illegally accessed the data of millions of Americans,\" Saunders said in a statement. \"This decision will not only force them to delete any data they have currently saved, but it will also block them from further sharing, accessing or disclosing our Social Security information.\"",
      "The Justice Department has said that 10 members of the DOGE team are working at the SSA, and seven of them have had access to personal information housed in its data systems.",
      "In her opinion, Hollander said that the Trump administration failed to provide the court with a reasonable explanation for why the DOGE team needs access to the data maintained in the SSA's systems to root out fraud and abuse.",
      "\"Defendants disregarded protocols for proper hiring, onboarding, training, and access limitations, and, in a rushed fashion, provided access to a massive amount of sensitive, confidential data to members of the DOGE Team, without any articulated explanation for the need to do so,\" she wrote.",
      "The judge, who sits on the district court in Baltimore, knocked the Justice Department for withholding the names of the DOGE team members in an effort to protect their privacy, but allowing access to millions of Americans' personal information.",
      "The Trump administration, she said, \"have not shown the same level of care with the far more sensitive, confidential data of millions of Americans who entrusted their government with their personal and private information. The trust appears to have been violated, without any articulated need.\"",
      "\"The American public may well applaud and support the Trump administration's mission to root out fraud, waste, and bloat from federal agencies, including SSA, to the extent it exists. But, by what means and methods?\" Hollander said. \"The DOGE Team is essentially engaged in a fishing expedition at SSA, in search of a fraud epidemic, based on little more than suspicion.\"",
      "She accused the Trump administration of giving DOGE \"unbridled access\" to millions of Americans' private data, including their Social Security numbers, medical records, drivers' license numbers, bank and credit card information, tax information, income and work history and their home and work addresses.",
      "\"This intrusion into the personal affairs of millions of Americans \u2014 absent an adequate explanation for the need to do so \u2014 is not in the public interest,\" she said. \"To be sure, rooting out possible fraud, waste, and mismanagement in the SSA is in the public interest. But, that does not mean that the government can flout the law to do so. The president's advisors and employees are not exempt from the statutes Congress enacted to protect American citizens from overbroad and unnecessary access to their [personal information].\"",
      "Mr. Trump established DOGE on his first day back in the White House and has said that he tasked Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, with heading the initiative. The White House has said, though, that Amy Gleason, who worked at DOGE's predecessor entity, is formally the administrator of DOGE. The task force's employees have been dispatched to more than a dozen federal agencies as part of the president's plan to shrink the size of the government.",
      "But DOGE's actions, and specifically access to sensitive government databases, has raised concerns about whether they are complying with a federal law that aims to protect Americans' private information. Lawsuits have been brought seeking to restrict DOGE's access at least five other agencies, as well as claiming that Musk's actions are unconstitutional.",
      "Just earlier this week, another federal judge in Maryland found that Musk and DOGE likely violated the Constitution's Appointments Clause and the separation of powers when they unilaterally acted to shut down the U.S. Agency for International Development.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0President Trump this week joined the growing chorus of calls to punish federal judges who rule against his administration. But impeachment and removal are unlikely under the current makeup of Congress.",
      "The recent calls to impeach federal judges increased earlier this week when Mr. Trump posted on social media that a U.S. district judge overseeing his administration's efforts to deport Venezuelan migrants suspected of being gang members should be impeached.",
      "While the attack by Mr. Trump marked the first time he called for a judge to be impeached, his Republican allies and Elon Musk, a senior White House adviser, have for weeks been denouncing members of the judiciary who have been overseeing the myriad legal challenges to the president's policies and ruled against the administration.",
      "In the House, a small group of hard-right Republican lawmakers have introduced or signed onto resolutions to impeach four of those judges. While it's unlikely the efforts will gain enough traction to result in their removals, they have reignited the debate over impeachment and the high bar for removal for high crimes and misdemeanors.",
      "The GOP calls to impeach a federal judge",
      "The president called for U.S. District Judge James Boasberg's impeachment in a post on social media Tuesday, saying without naming him that \"This judge, like many of the Crooked Judges' I am forced to appear before, should be IMPEACHED!\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt continued the attacks on Boasberg and other judges who have issued preliminary rulings against the administration.",
      "\"The judges in this country are acting erroneously,\" she told reporters during a press briefing. \"We have judges who are acting as partisan activists from the bench. They are trying to dictate policy from the president of the United States. They are trying to clearly slowwalk this administration's agenda and it's unacceptable.\"",
      "Leavitt said the president \"has made it clear that he believes this judge in this case should be impeached.\" She noted that the White House will comply with judicial orders and mount appeals of adverse rulings, as it has done so far but accused judges of undermining the will of the Americans who voted for Mr. Trump.",
      "Freshman Rep. Brandon Gill, a Texas Republican, on Tuesday filed articles of impeachment against Boasberg after Mr. Trump's post, alleging on social media that Boasberg \"is guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors and should be removed from office.\" Five Republicans have signed onto the impeachment articles as cosponsors.",
      "Impeachment resolutions have also been introduced against U.S. District Judges Paul Engelmayer, John Bates and Amir Ali. GOP Rep. Andrew Clyde of Georgia said last month that he was going to draft impeachment articles against U.S. District Judge John McConnell, but they do not appear to have been filed.",
      "How does impeachment work?",
      "Under the Constitution, the basis for impeachment is \"high Crimes and Misdemeanors.\" It's highly unlikely any of the judges who are targets of impeachment resolutions have met that high hurdle.",
      "As with presidential impeachments, the power to impeach, convict and remove judges falls to Congress. While the House has impeachment power, under the Constitution, the Senate is responsible for holding a trial to determine if impeached officials are guilty and should be removed from their post.",
      "After lawmakers bring articles of impeachment in the House, the articles must be adopted by a simple majority for impeachment. The House then transmits the impeachment articles to the Senate, which has the \"sole Power\" under the Constitution to hold a trial that could lead to conviction and removal from office.",
      "But the Senate has a high bar for conviction, with a two-thirds majority required. Although Republicans have a majority in the upper chamber, with 53 seats, that falls short of the 67 senators needed to find an official guilty and remove them from office.",
      "The next steps in Congress",

      "White House deputy chief of staff James Blair told Politico that \"it'll be up to the speaker\" to determine what can be passed and whether to pursue impeachment proceedings, while noting that the president is simply \"highlighting a critical issue.\"",

      "Oklahoma executed a man Thrusday for fatally shooting a woman 20 years ago during a home invasion and robbery.",
      "Wendell Grissom, the death row inmate, received a lethal injection at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester. A prison official told the Associated Press that Grissom, 56, was pronounced dead at 10:13 a.m. It was the first execution in Oklahoma this year and the ninth in the United States. Six were carried out by lethal injection, two by nitrogen gas and one by firing squad.",
      "\"It took him a total of 13 minutes to die, and it took him a total of two minutes to kill my best friend,\" said Dreu Kopf, who was shot multiple times by Grissom but managed to flee the home.",
      "Grissom and a co-defendant, Jessie Floyd Johns, were convicted of killing of Amber Matthews, 23, and wounding her Kopf at Kopf's Blaine County residence in 2005. Johns was sentenced to life in prison without parole.",
      "\"I apologize to all of you that I've hurt,\" Grissom said while strapped to the gurney, an IV line affixed to his right arm. \"I regret so much that I've put that hatred in your heart for me.\"",
      "A minister prayed at Grissom's feet as the lethal drugs began to flow. He exhaled forcefully several times and could be heard snoring when a doctor entered the execution chamber and declared him unconscious about five minutes later. He appeared to stop breathing at 10:09 a.m. and the color started to drain from his face.",
      "More than two dozen of Matthews' friends and family witnessed Grissom's execution.",
      "Prosecutors said Grissom, who had a lengthy criminal record, picked up Johns, who was hitchhiking, and the two men were driving west on Interstate 40 when they decided to commit robberies. They randomly selected Kopf's home near Watonga, where Matthews was visiting Kopf and her two young children.",
      "Matthews was shot twice in the head and left clinging to life on the floor as Kopf, also shot twice and seriously wounded, managed to flee in Grissom's truck to get help, prosecutors said. Grissom and Johns also fled, on a stolen four-wheeler, but quickly ran out of gas and were captured after hitching a ride to a cafe in a nearby county.",
      "Authorities found Kopf's children still inside the home, physically unhurt. Matthews died after being flown by helicopter to an Oklahoma City hospital.",
      "Grissom's attorneys did not dispute his guilt but argued at a clemency hearing that he suffered from brain damage that was never presented to a jury. The state's Pardon and Parole Board denied Grissom's request.",
      "Grissom's attorneys told the board he always accepted responsibility and wrote an apology to Matthews' family during his first interview with police.",
      "\"He cannot change the past, but he is now and always has been deeply ashamed and remorseful,\" said Kristi Christopher, an attorney with the federal public defender's office.",
      "Kopf told the board that she still carries deep mental and physical scars from the attack, including bullet fragments that remain in her body. She said that in the years since the attack she has called 911 when the doorbell rings unexpectedly or a stranger appears in her neighborhood.",
      "\"I lived in a heightened state of fear at all times,\" she said tearfully.",
      "Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond has called Matthew's killing a \"textbook\" death penalty case.",
      "\"The crimes committed by Grissom, random, brutal attacks on innocent strangers in the sanctity of their own home, are the very kind that keep people awake at night,\" Drummond said during last month's hearing.",
      "Oklahoma's approach to acquiring and administering lethal drugs has come under\u00a0serious scrutiny\u00a0in recent years, with the state corrections office previously accused of botching procedures inside the execution chamber and then facing an extensive public safety probe. The state was the first to authorize the controversial new execution method\u00a0nitrogen hypoxia\u00a0in 2015, but to date has never used it. Oklahoma uses a lethal injection cocktail that contains three drugs, beginning with a sedative and following with a second drug to paralyze the inmate and a third to stop the heart.",
      "Before Grissom, the state last\u00a0put an inmate to death by lethal injection\u00a0in December.",
      "Three other executions were scheduled this week around the United States: Louisiana put a man to death Tuesday using nitrogen gas for the first time as it resumed executions after a 15-year hiatus. A man who kidnapped and murdered his girlfriend's ex-husband was executed by lethal injection Wednesday in Arizona. Another lethal injection is scheduled Thursday in Florida.",

    "story": [
      "London's\u00a0Heathrow Airport \u2014 one of the busiest airports in the world \u2014 resumed some flights after being closed for most of Friday after a fire at a nearby electrical substation caused a power outage. An estimated 200,000 travelers could be affected by the shutdown.",
      "The first plane landed around 6:30 p.m. local time, the Associated Press reported.",
      "The airport said the fire late Thursday night at an electrical substation supplying the airport had caused a \"significant power outage,\" but on Friday afternoon, an airport spokesperson said teams had \"worked tirelessly since the incident to ensure a speedy recovery\" and that the facility was \"safely able to begin some flights later today.\" After the announcement, at least one plane could be seen taxiing.",
      "\"Please do not travel to the airport unless your airline has advised you to do so,\" the statement said. \"We will now work with the airlines on repatriating the passengers who were diverted to other airports in Europe. We hope to run a full operation tomorrow and will provide further information shortly.\"",
      "The spokesperson noted that, \"as the busiest airport in Europe, Heathrow uses as much energy as a small city, therefore getting back to a full and safe operation takes time.\"",
      "Heathrow had initially said no flights would go in or out until the end of Friday, warning that it expected \"significant disruption over the coming days.\"",
      "London's Metropolitan Police said there was \"currently no indication of foul play,\" but that counterterrorism police would lead the investigation into the substation fire that shut down Europe's busiest airport.",
      "\"Given the location of the substation and the impact this incident has had on critical national infrastructure, the Met's Counter Terrorism Command is now leading enquiries. This is due to the specialist resources and capabilities within that command that can assist in progressing this investigation at pace to minimize disruption and identify the cause,\" the police said in a statement.",
      "Tracking services showed flights being diverted to London's Gatwick Airport, Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris and Ireland's Shannon Airport. British Airways, whose main hub is Heathrow, said the closure would have a significant impact on its operations and customers, adding that it was working as quickly as possible to update travelers on their options for the \"next 24 hours and beyond.\"",
      "The FlightRadar24 live tracking website showed at least 1,350 flights into and out of Heathrow were affected. According to the online service, the top route to and from Heathrow is the connection with New York's JFK International Airport, with 146 flights every week.",
      "\"I saw the time on the screen started to increase,\" passenger Tori Dunzello, who had been on a flight to the U.K. to attend her father's funeral, told CBS News partner network BBC News. \"I turned on my world map, and I started seeing a big U-turn, and I turned around and said to my husband: 'I think we're turning around.'\"",
      "Dunzello said her flight was diverted to Canada, and she expected it to refuel and return to New York.",
      "The impact of the Heathrow power outage was likely to last several days, leaving thousands of passengers forced to find alternate travel plans.",
      "\"We're talking about several days' worth of disruption to get the planes recovered and start using them again to move planned and disrupted passengers,\" Aviation consultant John Strickland told The Associated Press, comparing the outage to \"a contained version of 9/11 or, to an extent, the Icelandic volcanic eruption\" in 2010 that shut down European airspace.",
      "\"Heathrow being such a busy airport and full, there's no kind of wriggle room for getting out of these kind of things,\" Strickland told the AP.",
      "Britain's National Rail service canceled services to and from Heathrow for the day, though some passengers could still be seen attempting to enter the airport on foot on Friday. They were turned away by police.",
      "The London Fire Brigade said 10 fire engines and around 70 firefighters were sent to tackle the blaze at a substation near the airport in the west London town of Hayes. It started late Thursday night, and by about 8 a.m. local time, the brigade said it was \"under control, but we will remain on scene throughout the day.\"",
      "The power outage affected \"a large number of homes and local businesses, and we are working closely with our partners to minimise disruption,\" Assistant Commissioner Pat Goulbourne said in a\u00a0statement, adding that firefighters had led 29 people to safety from nearby properties, and around 150 people were evacuated.",
      "Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks said in a social media post that the power outage affected more than 16,300 homes, but by Friday afternoon, the National Grid power distributor said the network had \"been reconfigured to restore all customers impacted, including the ability to resupply the parts of Heathrow airport that are connected to\" the substation in Hayes.",
      "\"This is an interim solution while we carry out further work,\" National Grid said, adding: \"We are continuing to work closely with all stakeholders to manage this incident, and are focused on returning to normal resilience levels as soon as possible.\"",
      "Authorities said it wasn't clear what had sparked the blaze at the substation, but local residents reported hearing explosions.",
      "\"I was about 100 yards from the explosion,\" local resident Vaneca Sinclair told the BBC. She said she had been getting ready for bed in her home at about 11:30 p.m. Thursday evening (7:30 p.m. Eastern) when \"suddenly there was this huge bang and the house just shook.\"",
      "\"When the first explosion went off... I literally just ran out of the house,\" another local resident, Savita Kapur, told the BBC. She said she got her elderly mother in her car to drive her to her sister's house. \"When I was driving up my road the second explosion went off and the whole ground shook.\"",
      "\"We will have to look hard at the causes, and also the protection and the resilience that is in place for major, major institutions like Heathrow,\" U.K. energy secretary Ed Miliband told the BBC earlier Friday.",

    "summary": "Under pressure from Trump and with Russia menacing, Germany's incoming leader plans to revamp the country's defense posture. Can he deliver?",
    "story": [
      "Berlin \u2014\u00a0In a landmark shift, Germany is set to embark on its most ambitious defense spending initiative since World War II. Lawmakers have embraced plans unveiled by\u00a0Friedrich Merz, soon to take the reins as Germany's new chancellor, for an enormous boost to the country's military budget, signaling a dramatic transformation in its post-World War II defense posture.",
      "On Friday, the Bundesrat, the upper house of Germany's parliament, approved a 1 trillion euro spending package that effectively lifts a decades-old \"debt brake\" measure in the nation's laws that has capped military spending at less than 1% of national GDP. The legislation includes provisions for a 500 billion euro investment in infrastructure over a 12 year period, aimed at shoring up both the country's flagging economy.",
      "The package exempts from the national debt rules all spending on defense and security, including assistance to Ukraine, over 1% of GDP. The package of reforms, passed earlier in the week by the lower house of parliament, garnered the requisite two-thirds majority of votes in both parliamentary chambers to advance, and is now virtually guaranteed to become law. The plans mark a turning point after years of underinvestment and hesitation in German defense policy, and a fundamental reimagining of the country's role in European and global security.",
      "Merz's proposal envisions major arms deals, including to obtain new fighter jets, and expanded military aid for Ukraine.",
      "At the heart of the incoming leader's strategy is a commitment to spend \"whatever it takes\" on defense. Merz, who will most likely be inaugurated at the beginning of April and then tasked immediately with forming a new coalition government with other parties, has brokered a deal with two likely coalition members to raise hundreds of billions of euros in new defense spending with a focus on two key areas:",
      "First is the plan to create the 500 billion euro special fund for infrastructure projects and to change the strict \"debt brake\" rules to allow defense spending above 1% of GDP. Merz has argued it's essential, \"considering the dangers to our liberty and peace on the continent.\"",
      "The other key aspect of Merz's spending plan is an additional 3 billion euros worth of military aid for Ukraine. The commitment would build on Germany's existing support, which has included deliveries of IRIS-T air defense systems, Patriot missiles, Gepard anti-aircraft guns, Leopard tanks, and Marder infantry fighting vehicles.",
      "Can Merz make good on his defense spending plans?",
      "There are questions about Germany's ability to follow through on Merz's ambitious proposals, especially given its history of consistently falling short of NATO's 2% GDP defense spending target. Germany actually met that 2% goal in 2024 for the first time since the 1990s, perhaps heralding a shift in its approach to defense policy.",
      "EU unveils $840 billion defense investment \"ReArm Europe\" plan",
      "EU unveils $840 billion defense investment \"ReArm Europe\" plan",
      "Economic pressure, both domestic and global, could prove a significant obstacle to the spending plan's implementation. Germany's economy has struggled to recover since the coronavirus pandemic, and there are concerns about the impact of such massive spending increases on the country's fiscal stability.",
      "Christian Lindner, the nation's former finance minister, harshly criticized Merz's plan to boost defense spending and loosen the \"debt brake,\" warning that Germany could soon have \"a trillion euros in higher debt, without having been economically strengthened by it.\"",
      "But for Germany's relationship with the United States, a defense spending revolution \u2014 and even a clear commitment to one \u2014 could represent a turning point. Washington has long pressured Germany, and its other NATO allies, to take on a greater share of the fiscal and military burden of supporting the transatlantic defense alliance.",
      "President Trump has recently called for NATO members to spend at least 5% of their GDPs on defense, a significantly higher proportion than even the U.S. spends. He's also indicated that the U.S. could disregard the Article 5 collective defense clause in NATO's founding treaty, refusing to help defend allies that fail to meet his spending targets. His rhetoric has fueled the urgency behind Germany's military expansion plans.",
      "The planned increase in German defense spending could bolster NATO's deterrence capacity, particularly in Eastern Europe, where Russia's aggression has put member nations on edge.",
      "Germany has already committed to providing 35,000 troops and more than 200 ships and aircraft to help implement NATO's new force model, and additional funding could see those contributions enhanced.",
      "The success of Merz's initiative will be closely watched by Germany's allies. Failure to deliver on the ambitious plans could strain relations with the U.S. and other NATO partners as Western Europe tries to show a united front in the face of the threat from Russia.",

      "The U.S. ranked 24th in the world, one place lower than its 2024 ranking. America previously peaked at 11th place in 2012.",
      "One factor highlighted in the report was the increasing number of people who eat alone.",
      "\"In 2023, roughly 1 in 4 Americans reported eating all of their meals alone the previous day \u2014 an increase of 53% since 2003,\" the report said. \"Dining alone has become more prevalent for every age group, but especially for young people.\"",
      "Data reviewed for the report indicates major differences in the rates of meal-sharing around the world, with sharing meals having a positive effect on wellbeing.",
      "Another factor contributing to America's drop in the rankings, as well as the rankings of some European countries, was \"the rise in political polarization and votes against 'the system,'\" the report said.",
      "\"The country-wide evolution of happiness and trust is highly associated with the rise in the likelihood of voting for anti-system parties in Western Europe and the United States,\" the authors wrote.",
      "Mexico, Costa Rica enter the top 10 for first time",
      "A key reason for the rise in Mexico and Costa Rica's rankings appeared to be family household size.",
      "\"Latin American societies, characterized by larger household sizes and strong family bonds, offer valuable lessons for other societies that seek higher and sustainable wellbeing,\" the report said.",
      "The report compared Mexico to European countries, explaining that even though it is poorer, \"larger households imply a potential advantage to build positive social interactions within the household, which could partially counterbalance the differences in income with Europe.\"",
      "In Europe, 23% of households were single-person, while in Mexico, only 11% were single-person, according to data cited in the report.",
      "\"In both Mexico and Europe, the highest average life satisfaction is reported by people who live in households with four to five members,\" the authors wrote. \"We also observe an inverted U-shaped relationship. Average life satisfaction is lower for people in single-person households as well as households with six or seven members.\"",
      "Dropped wallet experiment",
      "The Gallup World Poll asked people in 2019 if they thought others would return a lost wallet, and found that \"people are much too pessimistic about the benevolence of others.\"",
      "\"When wallets were dropped in the street by researchers, the proportion of returned wallets was far higher than people expected,\" the report said.",
      "The belief that others would return the lost wallets also contributed to a country's ranking.",
      "The Nordic nations, including Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden, ranked in the top 10 countries and were among the top places for expected and actual return of lost wallets, the report said.",
      "\"The wallet data are so convincing because they confirm that people are much happier living where they think people care about each other,\" John F. Helliwell, an economist at the University of British Columbia and a founding editor of the World Happiness Report, said in a statement.",

    "summary": "Here are the latest updates on what's known about Sudiksha Konanki, a University of Pittsburgh student who went missing in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic.",
    "story": [
      "Search efforts pressed on into their second week for Sudiksha Konanki, a college student at the University of Pittsburgh who went missing in early March during a trip to the Dominican Republic resort town Punta Cana.",
      "Details surrounding Konanki's disappearance have begun to emerge as the international investigation continues. Here's what we know so far about her case.",
      "Konanki seen on video walking to beach",
      "Konanki, 20, is from Chantilly, Virginia, a Washington, D.C., suburb, and attends college in Pittsburgh. She has permanent residency in the United States as well as citizenship in India. She arrived in the Dominican Republic for spring break on March 3 and was vacationing with a group of friends, five other women, according to investigators and her parents.",
      "She\u00a0has been missing\u00a0since Thursday, March 6, after surveillance video showed her, three of her friends and two other American men walk toward the beach area outside the Riu Rep\u00fablica hotel. The video was from around 4:15 a.m., investigators in the Dominican Republic said.",
      "Power outages at the hotel may have prompted guests to move outdoors around that time, the hotel said in a statement. An earlier surveillance video showed Konanki and one of her friends hugging at the hotel bar.",
      "One of the men in the group walking to the beach has been identified as 22-year-old Joshua Riibe, an American college student. In the footage, Konanki and Riibe are seen walking with their arms around each other.",
      "Video shows the other four individuals later returning to the hotel, but Konanki and Riibe stayed behind on the beach, a police source said. The last sighting of Konanki and Riibe in the water happened around 4:50 a.m., according to Loudon County Sheriff Mike Chapman, whose office in Virginia is involved in the investigation.",
      "Riibe told police he and Konanki were swept into the ocean by a large wave and both struggled against rough seas. He said he believed Konanki got out of the water but was not certain, according to a person with direct knowledge of Riibe's statements to U.S. investigators.",
      "He is presumed to be the last person who saw Konanki alive.",
      "Konanki's disappearance is so far being investigated as a missing persons case, not a criminal investigation.",
      "The Dominican Republic's attorney general said investigators were exploring whether Konanki drowned, but not ruling out the possibility of foul play.",
      "Chapman said \"it's hard to say\" whether there are indications Konanki's disappearance was anything other than an accident.",
      "\"We know that at about 4:50 a.m. was the last sighting that we had of them in the water. We don't know what happened after that,\" Chapman said in a \"CBS Mornings\" interview. \"And we also don't know what happened between the time that [Riibe] claimed to have come out of the water and the time that he actually left the beach, so it's really hard to say. It'd be speculative on my part to assume or presume anything at this point.\"",
      "Konanki's family seeking closure",
      "The Loudoun County Sheriff's Office told CBS News that Konanki's family has requested that she be declared deceased, expressed gratitude to investigators for their work and expressed a desire for closure following her disappearance in the Dominican Republic.",
      "The family provided the request in writing to the sheriff's office, according to spokesperson Thomas Julia. Julia said the family made a similar request to Dominican authorities.",
      "Konanki's family did not immediately respond to a request for comment. CBS News has learned that their written request referenced Riibe's cooperation with investigators and a lack of evidence collected to date that would suggest foul play was involved in Konanki's disappearance.",
      "Chapman said the family has expressed their belief that she drowned.",
      "\"While a final decision to make such a declaration rests with authorities in the Dominican Republic, we will support the Konanki family in every way possible as we continue to review the evidence and information made available to us in the course of this investigation,\" he said.",
      "Riibe returns to U.S. after facing questioning",
      "Riibe had been confined to a hotel in Punta Cana for more than a week as he faced questioning during the investigation, with officers escorting him anywhere he went. A judge in the Dominican Republic ruled on March 18 that Riibe should be freed from police surveillance.",
      "The law firm representing Riibe, Guzm\u00e1n Ariza, had pushed in legal documents for his freedom, given the absence of any criminal charge, which led to the hearing. In court, Riibe argued to the judge that he was detained inappropriately.",
      "\"I really want to go home and see my family,\" Riibe said. \"I understand I'm here to help but it's been 10 days.\"",
      "His attorneys said earlier that authorities had confiscated Riibe's passport. The judge's March 18 ruling did not include an immediate decision on the issue of returning Riibe's passport, but the next day, his attorneys said the La Altagracia Prosecutor's Office informed Riibe it was willing to return his passport.",
      "\"Although grateful for the decision of the Prosecutor's Office, Joshua decided, for privacy reasons, to request a new one at the United States Consulate, which was urgently issued to him,\" Riibe's attorneys said.",
      "He then returned home to the U.S. with his father, his attorneys said.",
      "Riibe and his parents, Tina and Albert Riibe, extended \"deep sorrow and solidarity\" with Konanski's family in a statement released through his attorneys while he still in Punta Cana.",
      "\"Above all, we wish to contribute to the search efforts and understand the anguish and uncertainty they are going through and we share the hope that Sudiksha will be found as soon as possible,\" the statement said. \"Joshua Riibe is deeply dismayed by her disappearance and has fully cooperated in the search and clarification of the facts from the very beginning.\"",
      "Chapman told \"CBS Mornings\" that Riibe was \"very forthcoming\" with sheriff's detectives who traveled to the Dominican Republic to speak to him, and did not \"seem to hesitate on answering any of the questions that we threw his way.\"",
      "Chapman noted there was \"nothing that would really make us feel as though there was anything untrue coming from Joshua.\"",
      "Originally from Iowa, Riibe is a college senior at St. Cloud State University in Minnesota, where he is pursuing a degree in land surveying.",
      "His family in their statement described him as \"a beloved son, brother, and friend, known for his kind nature, sense of humor, and commitment to his community.\"",
      "They also shared concerns about the \"irregular conditions\" of his detainment in Punta Cana, where, they said, he had been \"subjected to extensive questioning without the presence of official translators or legal counsel until Wednesday, March 12.\" The family retained a lawyer \"to initiate legal actions ensuring his safety and the protection of his rights throughout this process,\" according to the statement.",
      "Intensifying search efforts",
      "More than 300 police and other officials, with support from the FBI, are searching the air, sea and land to locate her, Dominican President Luis Abinader said. The Dominican Republic National Police said they have assembled a new \"high-level commission\" to oversee the case, and Interpol has\u00a0issued a global police alert at the request of investigators.",
      "\"We are concerned,\" Abinader said at a news conference on March 10. \"All government agencies are searching \u2026 because the latest information we have from one of them, from the last person who was with the young woman, what he says according to the reports is that a wave, while on the beach, crashed into them.\"",
      "Dominican Republic National Police said in a statement March 11 that they were \"re-interviewing targeted individuals who were in the victim's proximity at the time of her disappearance.\" Investigators said the individuals included \"hotel employees where Konanki and her companions were staying, with the goal of gathering information to corroborate her movements, interactions, and any relevant details for the investigation.\"",

    "story": [
      "Mexico's attorney general on Wednesday reported irregularities in an investigation by state authorities into an alleged\u00a0cartel killing site and training camp at a ranch in the western state of Jalisco where people searching for relatives found bones and hundreds of articles of clothing and other personal effects.",
      "The \"ranch of horror,\" as some local media have dubbed it, in the town of Teuchitlan, outside Guadalajara, was found by authorities in September 2024. Six months later, a so-called search collective found charred bone fragments and personal items, raising questions about the original investigation by the Jalisco State Prosecutor's Office.",
      "Attorney General Alejandro Gertz Manero, whose office took over the investigation last week, said that investigators in Jalisco failed to register evidence and fingerprints and process vehicles found at the ranch, three of which were later stolen.",
      "He said local authorities didn't investigate the ownership of the ranch and failed to scientifically analyze locations at the ranch to understand if they were used as crematoriums. Investigators did not arrest local officials who have been linked to activities at the ranch, he said.",
      "The extensive evidence meant that the \"truth will come out\" about the grisly discovery at a ranch in the western state of Jalisco, Gertz Manero told a news conference.",
      "The United Nations Human Rights Office last week called for \"thorough, independent, impartial and transparent investigations\" into the apparent crimes.",
      "Gertz Manero said federal prosecutors were also not alerted about the site, as is standard procedure, and cast blame on the state prosecutor's office despite the National Guard carrying out an operation at the site carried out last year. There is still not enough information to confirm if the ranch was used to cremate bodies or train cartel members, he added.",
      "The Jalisco Search Warriors group last week shared images that shocked many in a country that's long accustomed to stark news of cartel warfare, forced disappearances and government corruption. The images and videos showed dozens of shoes, piles of clothing and what appeared to be human bone fragments.",
      "Such collectives have long risked their lives to seek answers about what has happened to Mexico's 120,000 disappeared people in the face of rampant impunity.",
      "Vigils and protests took place over the weekend for the victims of the alleged site.",
      "On Monday, a video was circulated showing masked and heavily armed men who read a statement identifying themselves as the Jalisco New Generation cartel and questioning the motivations of the searchers.",
      "The Jalisco cartel was one of eight Latin American criminal organizations the U.S. government\u00a0designated foreign terrorist organizations\u00a0last month.",
      "Multiple mass graves have been found in recent months in Mexico. In January, at least\u00a056 bodies were discovered\u00a0in unmarked mass graves in northern Mexico, not far from the border with the United States.",
      "A\u00a0mass grave\u00a0discovered last December in a suburb of Guadalajara with dozens of bags of dismembered body parts contained the remains of 24 people, authorities said. That same month, Mexican authorities said they recovered a total of\u00a031 bodies\u00a0from pits in Chiapas, a state plagued by cartel violence.",

    "published": "Wed, 19 Mar 2025 21:05:08 -0400",
    "summary": "Mexico City lawmakers overwhelmingly approve legislation to keep the bullfighting tradition alive, while also keeping the bulls alive.",
    "story": [
      "Mexico City \u2014\u00a0Mexico City lawmakers on Tuesday voted overwhelmingly to ban violent bullfighting, triggering outrage from aficionados and celebration from animal rights advocates. The legislation, approved by a 61-1 vote, prohibits the killing of bulls and the use of sharp objects that could injure the animals. It also sets time limits on how long bulls can be in the ring, all part of an initiative dubbed \"bullfighting without violence.\"",
      "The decision sparked angry protests from bullfighting supporters and matadors, some of whom tried to breach a police barricade at the local Congress. Some carried signs that read \"Being a fan of la fiesta brava (bullfighting) is not a crime, it's a point of pride.\"",
      "Animal rights activists and lawmakers who have been pushing the bill celebrated, however, walking out onto the steps of Congress surrounded by police in riot gear, pumping their fists and carrying stuffed bull dolls.",
      "\"It was either this or nothing,\" said Sof\u00eda Mor\u00edn, an animal rights activist with the organization Culture Without Torture, Mexico Without Bullfighting, leading the initiative to change the laws. \"We prefer this because, without a doubt, it's a huge step in protecting animals.\"",
      "Mexico City Mayor Clara Brugada of the ruling Morena party echoed the activists, saying the decision would turn the Mexican capital into a place \"that respects the rights of animals.",
      "Tuesday's vote appeared to be an attempt to broker a compromise between two warring sides of the debate after years of back-and-forth about the practice.",
      "Bullfighting has long been a tradition and a pastime in Spain and many Latin American nations, but it has come under criticism for animal cruelty because bulls are often killed at the end of the fight. Animal rights groups say approximately 180,000 bulls are killed every year in bullfighting worldwide.",
      "A bloodless form of the attraction took root in California years ago, as reported by CBS San Francisco in 2021. In that version, bulls wear a Velcro pad on their backs while ornately-clad participants on horseback try to affix poles to the raging animals. Then \"forcados\" on foot enter the ring to try and literally grab the bull by the horns, but no blood is shed.",
      "The tradition, which has long drawn big crowds to arenas across Mexico, was dealt a blow when a judge in Mexico City banned the practice in June 2022, shutting down an arena that has been billed as the world's largest bullfighting ring. The judge ruled that bullfights violated city residents' rights to a healthy environment free from violence.",
      "While animal rights advocates celebrated it as a victory, and a step toward ending the bloody tradition, bullfighters said it dealt an economic blow to the city. The National Association of Breeders of Fighting Bulls in Mexico says bullfighting generates 80,000 direct jobs, and 146,000 indirect jobs across the country. Overall, the industry generates approximately $400 million a year.",
      "That was the concern for many in the crowd protesting the end of the violent fights, while others like Juan Pablo Pimienta screamed through a megaphone \"it's an activity where the fighting bull dies in a bullring. That's its nature. ... It is a beast.\"",
      "In 2023, Mexico's Supreme Court overturned the ban without explanation, allowing bullfighting arenas to be flooded once again with fans of the so-called \"fiesta brava.\"",
      "On Tuesday, in a speech before the city's congress, Green Party lawmaker Jes\u00fas Sesma acknowledged that the decision would anger a segment of the city's population.",
      "\"To those families who feel frustrated today, we're here to say that no one lost their job,\" he said. \"There was a middle ground to continue with these bullfighting spectacles, but now without violence.\"",

      "Israel's military said it had targeted a Hamas military site in the enclave's southern al-Mawasi humanitarian zone, near the border with Egypt. At least two civilians were among those killed Wednesday, according to the Red Crescent.",
      "Separately, the United Nations agency UNOPS, which helps implement humanitarian, development and peacebuilding projects around the world, said Wednesday that one of its staffers had apparently been killed in a blast in the central Gaza city of Deir al-Balah.",
      "\"Reports are coming in that a UNOPS colleague has been killed in a detonation in Deir al Balah. It is understood that UNOPS accommodation was hit at approximately 11:30 a.m. this morning,\" the agency said.",
      "The statement from UNOPS came a couple hours after Israel's military issued a statement denying reports that it had struck \"a U.N. compound\" in Deir al-Balah, and adding a call for \"media outlets to act with caution regarding unverified reports.\"",
      "The mounting deaths come after Israel definitively ended a two-month ceasefire with Hamas before dawn Tuesday, resuming full-scale military operations in Gaza and threatening to ramp up its assault further. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in a national address Tuesday night, vowed more strikes to force Hamas to release all of the remaining 59 hostages held in Gaza, about two dozen of whom are still believed to be alive.",
      "On Wednesday, Israel said it launched a \"limited ground operation\" in northern Gaza to retake part of a corridor that bisects it, The Associated Press reported.",

      "\"The level of bodily damage that these children get in particular is insane. My surgeries there consisted of 4- and 5- and 6-year-old kids with significant nerve injuries, and I've had to borrow nerves from both of their legs to graft nerves in their arms,\" he told CBS News in a phone interview. \"Israel has no trouble bombing hospital grounds. Fifty feet from me is a mosque that was thoroughly destroyed. There's no inhibition on their part to focus on population centers.\"",
      "Perlmutter said given the complete lack of medical supplies \u2013 he doesn't even have soap to wash his hands \u2013 made it impossible to properly treat some of the children coming in with grave injuries.",
      "Speaking of one boy, he said \"it would be a blessing if this kid passed, because of the amount of pain and the amount of destruction in his body \u2013 and our ability to deal with it in this setting is impossibly limited \u2013 and there's no place to transfer him to. There's no level-one trauma center. They're all overwhelmed.\"",
      "Israeli protesters condemn Netanyahu's return to war",
      "Black plumes rose along Israel's border fence with Gaza on Tuesday as the tired but unrelenting mother of Israeli hostage Matan Zangauker, holding a smoke canister up to the sky, angrily protested Netanyahu's resumption of military operations.",
      "\"Don't let the prime minister and the members of his government sacrifice the lives of my son Matan and of all the other living hostages just to remain in power,\" shouted Zangauker, a prominent leader of the protests that happen every week. \"We will not give up on you, we will not allow a return to fighting.\"",
      "Hamas terrorists kidnapped her 25-year-old son from Kibbutz Nir Oz during the unprecedented massacre on Oct. 7, 2023.",
      "Demonstrations, led by hostages' families, have exploded across Israel since the strikes in Gaza resumed, with thousands rallying regularly outside Israel's legislature, the Knesset, in Jerusalem and Israel's military headquarters, the Kirya, in Tel Aviv.",
      "\"I don't think they're listening. I don't think that they're listening to the people\u2026 to the people who elected them,\" hostage supporter Carmeet Roth told CBS News at a new tent encampment outside the defense complex. She said she was \"horrified\" when Israel's military relaunched airstrikes on Gaza after nearly two months of a fragile ceasefire. Her hopes for more hostages coming out alive have fallen.",
      "\"I think it is much less likely,\" she said, shaking her head. \"We've seen it before. I mean, it never brought them back. Only agreements and deals brought them back. That's the way to move forward.\"",
      "National polls consistently show a majority of Israelis \u2013 70% in a February survey -- want the ceasefire plan agreed to by Israel and Hamas, which was negotiated by the U.S., Egypt and Qatar, to continue as originally laid out. A second phase of that plan, which should have begun on March 1, stipulated the release of more living hostages in exchange for the full withdrawal of Israel's military from Gaza.",
      "Israel, with support from the Trump administration, demanded a change to those terms as Phase-1 of the agreement ended, however, accusing Hamas of breaching the deal and calling for an extension of the first phase under a new plan it attributed to the White House.",
      "Will Gaza assault destroy Hamas, or just leave \"more hostages dead\"?",
      "Retired General Israel Ziv knows a lot about how Israeli forces operate in the Gaza Strip. He commanded the military's Gaza division during the last major clash in the early 2000s, which, while it paled in comparison to the current war, saw heavy casualties on both sides.",
      "But the 30-year veteran warned that Israel's military may have reached its limit in forcing Hamas to bend to the will of Netanyahu and his far-right government, which has vowed repeatedly to achieve its stated goal of destroying Hamas.",
      "\"You can go up to, let's say, 80%, 90% of destroying the Hamas,\" he said. \"But this last 10%, which is the hardest and the most problematic one, you cannot achieve militarily.\"",
      "Ziv said only a political solution could bring a lasting peace between Israel and Hamas, and he accused Netanyahu of operating \"without enough courage to bring some political solutions to the table.\"",
      "Ziv said Netanyahu was stuck with a Catch-22: Vowing to free the remaining hostages safely while at the same time trying to kill the people who are holding them.",
      "Israel Defense Forces International spokesman Nadav Shoshani insists the military is ready to increase pressure on Hamas, and that doing so would bring the remaining hostages home.",
      "\"We're ready with a different set of plans, including more troops on the ground and a ground operation if needed,\" he told CBS News at a briefing this week. \"History shows that the military pressure could bring back hostages.\"",
      "Ziv disagrees with that assessment.",
      "\"We know over a year now that military pressure does not bring back the hostages,\" he said. \"And in some cases, the other way - it kills them. It kills hostages.\"",
      "\"To my opinion, unfortunately, if we keep on just with those raids and attacks, I think we're going to see more hostages dead.\"",

      "He returned before dawn on Sept. 14, 2019, with at least two other men armed with sledgehammers and crowbars, smashing a window and prying the toilet from its mount. Because the toilet was fully functional and connected to Blenheim Palace's plumbing system before it was taken, the removal caused \"significant damage and flooding in the building,\" police said at the time. The men escaped in stolen vehicles.",
      "\"This was an audacious raid which had been carefully planned and executed,\" prosecutor Shan Saunders said. \"But those responsible were not careful enough, leaving a trail of evidence in the form of forensics, CCTV footage and phone data.\"",
      "The purloined potty was stolen just days after its installation. It has never been recovered but is believed to have been cut up and sold.",

It was a dramatic escalation in an ongoing crackdown on the opposition and dissenting voices in Turkey.",
      "The state-run Anadolu news agency said prosecutors issued detention warrants for the mayor, Ekrem Imamoglu, and some 100 other people. Among those detained was Imamoglu's close aide, Murat Ongun.",
      "Authorities also closed several roads around Istanbul and banned demonstrations in the city for four days in an apparent effort to prevent protests following the arrest.",

      "Private television network NTV said two Istanbul district mayors were among those detained.",
      "Critics note that the crackdown follows significant losses by Erdogan's ruling party in local elections last year, and amid growing calls for early national elections. Government officials insist the courts operate independently and reject claims that legal actions against opposition figures are politically motivated.",
      "\"We are facing great tyranny, but I want you to know that I will not be discouraged,\" Imamoglu said earlier in the day in a video posted on social media.",
      "Germany criticized the arrests Wednesday, with Foreign Ministry spokesperson Sebastian Fischer describing them as \"a serious setback for democracy.\"",

      "Imamoglu was arrested as police searched his home, but it wasn't immediately clear if anything was confiscated. His wife, Dilek Imamoglu, told the private Now television network that police arrived at their residence before dawn and that the mayor was taken around 7:30 a.m.",

      "Imamoglu is also suspected of aiding the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, by allegedly forming an alliance with a Kurdish umbrella organization for the Istanbul municipal elections, the report said. The PKK has waged a decades-long insurgency within Turkey and is designated a terrorist organization by Ankara, Washington and other allies.",

The national ballot is currently scheduled for 2028, but the vote is expected to be brought forward.",
      "Despite all the arrests Wednesday, CHP party chairman Ozgur Ozel told the opposition-aligned Halik TV channel that its primary would go ahead as planned. Ozel called Imamoglu's detention \"an attempted coup against our next president.\"",

      "Turkey's pro-Kurdish Peoples' Equality and Democracy Party condemned the detentions and called for the immediate release of all taken into custody.",
      "The dawn raid on Imamoglu's home and his arrest was a \"disgrace that will not be forgotten for centuries. This operation, which shatters faith in justice, is an attempt to redesign politics through the judiciary,\" Tulay Hatimogullari, the party's co-chairwoman, wrote on X.",
      "As he was being arrested, Ongun, the mayor's aide, appealed for support on X, though he at the time did not appear to know that the mayor was also being taken into custody.",

      "Waltz and Rubio also said Mr. Trump suggested the U.S. could take ownership of and run Ukrainian's nuclear power plants. \"American ownership of those plants would be the best protection for that infrastructure and support for Ukrainian energy infrastructure,\" their statement said.",

      "The idea of Palestinian resettlement in another country is one of several options the Trump team is chewing over as part of the U.S. president's larger goal of ending Israel's war with Hamas in Gaza and rebuilding the devastated Palestinian enclave.",
      "\"Nobody is expelling any Palestinians,\" President Trump said Wednesday, when the Irish Prime Minister was asked during the two leaders' Oval Office meeting by a Voice of America reporter about the president's controversial remarks in February when he suggested taking ownership of Gaza to rebuild it.",
      "Mr. Trump made the remarks during a Feb. 4 press conference alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, saying Gaza could be the \"Riviera of the Middle East.\"",
      "\"\u200aWe should go to other countries of interest with humanitarian hearts, and there are many of them that want to do this, and build various domains that will ultimately be occupied by the 1.8 million Palestinians living in Gaza, ending the death and destruction,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "A combination of Israeli and U.S. officials communicated to Sudan and Somalia, two diplomatic sources confirmed to CBS News. Senior far-right Israeli government officials have already been calling for Palestinians to migrate from the enclave. Mr. Trump's remarks have only emboldened Israel to reach out to other countries to explore opportunities for Palestinian resettlement, one source said.",
      "Three sources familiar with Mr. Trump's idea of resettling Gazans to another country told CBS News that his administration and Israel have also been interested in Syria. One source familiar with the Trump administration's Middle East policy said that the administration has attempted outreach to Syria's new interim government via a third-party interlocutor. Another source from the region told CBS News that Syria's government had been approached, but it was unclear whether there had been any response from Syria to the outreach.",
      "A senior Syrian official told CBS News that they are unaware of any outreach to their government by Israel or the U.S. about resettlement of Gazans.",
      "Dahir Hassan, Somalia's ambassador to the U.S., told CBS News that \"neither the U.S. administration nor Israeli authorities have approached the Somali government regarding any proposed relocation of Palestinians to Somalia.\" Hassan also cited concern that \"the dissemination of such unverified information risks fueling recruitment propaganda for extremist groups like ISIS and Al-Shabaab, potentially exacerbating security challenges in the region.\"",
      "The Sudanese government has not responded to a CBS News' request for comment.",
      "Syria's fledgling interim government is just three months old, after toppling Bashar al-Assad and his brutal regime which held an iron fist over the Syrian people for decades. The Arab northeast African nation of Sudan is currently embroiled in civil war and a refugee crisis while suffering pockets of famine. Tens of thousands of Sudanese refugees have sought asylum in Israel over the last two decades, only to be detained in the country's desert-based detention centers or left to live without any formal status. The East African country of Somalia is a fragile, formerly failed state where the militant Islamist group Al-Shabaab continues to wage a deadly insurgency.",
      "Since his Feb. 4 news conference, Mr. Trump has suggested Palestinians would have a choice on whether to leave but also indicated that their departure from Gaza could be permanent. In a Fox News interview several days later he said, \"We'll build beautiful communities, safe communities, could be five, six, could be two. But we'll build safe communities a little bit away from where they (the Palestinians) are.\" In the same interview, he said that Palestinians wouldn't have the right to return to Gaza under his plan because the enclave \"is not habitable\" and won't be for years to come.",
      "The United Nations reported in January that over 90% of housing units in Gaza are either damaged or destroyed and 1.9 million Gazan civilians have been displaced. Gaza's health ministry says more than 48,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war between Israel and Hamas, which began after the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack in which Hamas killed around 1,200 Israelis and took roughly 250 more hostage.",
      "Multiple Arab governments, the United Nations and some Democratic lawmakers, quickly denounced Mr. Trump's idea of emptying out Gaza with some defining the idea as ethnic cleansing. Instead, Arab leaders endorsed an alternative Egyptian post-war construction plan for Gaza last week, but the Trump administration and Israel were both quick to reject it, again citing that the Gaza Strip is uninhabitable.",
      "Former President Joe Biden's administration had been sending U.S. officials on a regular basis to meet with the new Syrian government in Damascus in the lead-up to Mr. Trump's inauguration when the visits stopped.\u00a0 Syria's new leader Ahmed al-Sharaa, formerly known as Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, was quick to condemn Mr. Trump's remarks in February, saying that the U.S. president's plan \"is a serious crime that will ultimately fail\". It is unclear what the Trump administration's overall policy toward the new Syrian government will be.",
      "\"The Trump administration should engage directly with the new government in Damascus, particularly after the agreement between Damascus and the SDF (the U.S.-allied Syrian Democratic Forces).

      "Israel has conducted widespread airstrikes in Syria since December, on what it described as Assad regime weapons sites, and seized territory in the buffer zone between both countries. This past week, Israel struck inside a Damascus suburb, saying it was taking out the headquarters of the Islamic Jihad, an Iran-backed militant group that has a substantial foothold in Gaza and the occupied West Bank.",
      "A State Department spokesperson deferred to the Israeli government, and told CBS News that Middle East special envoy Steve Witkoff \"continues to work tirelessly towards either an extension of Phase One (of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire agreement) or an advance to Phase Two with these principles in mind\".",
      "The State Department also referred to remarks by Witkoff from a February Fox News interview in which he said, \"We need to explore new policy prescriptions that ultimately end up in a better life for Gazans and Palestinians.\"",
      "Witkoff also suggested in the same Fox interview that Gaza's entire Palestinian population could go to other Middle East-based Arab nations and other countries beyond the region: \"I think that the president's solution is: how do we address where two million people can go? And I think the obvious answers are: in some respects, Egypt, in some respects, Jordan; but in some respects other countries who have called us up and voluntarily said this is a humanitarian effort, we want to help you\".",
      "Asked by \"Face the Nation\" moderator Margaret Brennan on Sunday about whether the Trump administration is talking to other countries about relocation of two million Palestinians in Gaza, Witkoff said again \"I think we're exploring, Margaret, all alternatives and options that lead to a better life for Gazans. And, by the way, for the people of Israel. So we're exploring all of those things.\"",
      "Millions of displaced Palestinians already live in surrounding Arab countries as refugees, including in Jordan, Syria, Lebanon and Egypt. Far-right Israeli ministers have increasingly called for moving Palestinians in Gaza and also in the West Bank off their land as part of the extreme view it would fulfill a Biblical claim by Jews to the land, and increase Israel's security.",

      "Trump's son-in-law and former advisor Jared Kushner first suggested that Gaza's \"waterfront property could be very valuable, if people would focus on building up livelihoods\" during an on-camera discussion at Harvard University in February 2024.",

    "story": [
      "Johannesburg \u2014\u00a0It sounds like the plot of a horror movie. Researchers stuck on a remote research base in Antarctica send an email out to the world, pleading for help as a colleague is accused of assault.",
      "But this was real. An urgent email was sent by a researcher at South Africa's isolated Sanae IV base in Antarctica accusing a man, one of the nine team members, of becoming violent and mentally unstable. In the email sent to a journalist at South Africa's Sunday Times newspaper, the researcher, who has not been identified publicly, requests immediate action to ensure the team's safety.",
      "According to the Times, the researcher alleged that the male team member had physically assaulted a colleague, threatened to kill a different colleague and sexually assaulted another. However, South African officials later said the report of a sexual assault was not correct.",
      "\"His behavior has become increasingly egregious, and I am experiencing significant difficulty in feeling secure in his presence,\" the newspaper quoted the researcher as writing, adding: \"It is imperative that immediate action is taken to ensure my safety and the safety of all employees.\"",
      "South Africa's Department of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment released a statement saying the alleged assault at the base was reported on Feb. 27, triggering a response plan that saw the government agency use \"trained professionals\" to mediate. The department said those mediators continued to engage with the team at the base on \"an almost daily basis.\"",
      "According to the agency, the alleged perpetrator had \"willingly participated in further psychological evaluation, has shown remorse and is willingly cooperative to follow any interventions that are recommended.\"",
      "The statement went on to say the male perpetrator had written an apology to the victim and was willing \"to verbally apologize to other team members.\"",
      "South African Environment Minister Dion George told CBS News on Tuesday that \"the situation at the base remains calm and all is under control.\"",
      "\"I will be keeping close contact with the base to ensure it remains that way,\" said George, adding that a \"team of psychologists and other experts\" were also in \"direct and constant\" contact with the team.",
      "When pressed on what else he could do to ensure the safety of the team, George said he was \"considering available options.\"",
      "Those options may be few, as severe weather conditions have completely cut the base off from the sea. The base sits on stilts near a cliff edge \u2014 a row of buildings that the team will remain in until December, the heart of the Antarctic summer, when a ship is set to depart from South Africa to make the near-15-day journey to retrieve them.",
      "An emergency evacuation, at significant cost, would be required to get the team out before then.",
      "The environment department said it also activated a legal \"labor relations process to investigate the [claim of] physical assault and alleged sexual harassment.\"",
      "There have been several incidents in the past with team members at the remote base threatening violence, and at least two other team members have been evacuated during previous expeditions.",
      "The latest incident has fueled discussions about the reliability of the psychometric tests given to team members before they're deployed to the isolated station. Scientists sent previously to the base and others like it have spoken of how lonely it is, surrounded by white and silence and cut off from the rest of the world, and of the toll that can take on someone's mental health.",

    "summary": "Officials in Hamas-ruled Gaza say the new Israeli assault has killed more than 400 people, as Israel accuses Hamas of refusing to extend the ceasefire.",
    "story": [
      "Deir al-Balah, Gaza Strip \u2014 Israel has launched new strikes in the Gaza Strip, killing more than 400 people, according to the Palestinian territory's Hamas-run Health Ministry, and promising to wield \"increasing military force\" after talks on further hostage releases stalled, according to officials on both sides of the war. The resumption of Israel's war against Hamas on Monday came after almost two months of relative calm in Gaza under a ceasefire the U.S. helped to broker, but which Israel and Hamas could not agree on how to continue.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said in a statement its military is \"currently attacking targets of the Hamas terrorist organization throughout the Gaza Strip, with the aim of achieving the war goals as determined by the political echelon, including the release of all our hostages \u2014 living and dead.\"",
      "\"From now on, Israel will act against Hamas with increasing military force,\" the prime minister's office said.",
      "The health ministry in Gaza, a densely populated coastal enclave that has been run by the U.S.- and Israeli-designated terrorist organization Hamas for almost two decades, said at least 404 people had been killed in Israel's fresh strikes by midday on Tuesday. Video from the territory showed bodies lined up on the floors of hospitals as more casualties streamed in.",
      "The statement from Netanyahu's office said Israel was resuming strikes because of Hamas' repeated refusals to release its hostages and its rejection of all offers it received from the U.S. presidential envoy Steve Witkoff and mediators.",
      "\"If Hamas does not release all the kidnapped, the gates of hell will open in Gaza and Hamas' murderers and rapists will meet the IDF with forces they have never known before,\" Defense Minister Israel Katz said. \"We will not stop fighting until all the kidnapped return home and all the war's goals are achieved.\"",
      "Over the weekend, Witkoff warned that Hamas must release living hostages immediately \"or pay a severe price.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Monday evening that the Trump administration was consulted by the Israelis on their attacks in Gaza.",
      "\"Hamas could have released hostages to extend the ceasefire but instead chose refusal and war,\" National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes told CBS News on Monday.",
      "Hostages families, U.N. and Egypt condemn resumption of war",
      "The group representing the Israeli hostages' families condemned Netanyahu's decision to resume the fighting, accusing him of a \"complete deception,\" arguing that it would endanger the remaining captives, and quickly organizing a new protest against the move.",
      "\"The families' greatest fear has come true \u2014 the Israeli government has chosen to give up on the abductees. We are shocked, angry and anxious about the deliberate disruption of the process to return our loved ones from Hamas captivity,\" the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said in a statement.",
      "\"Returning to fighting before the last abductee is returned will come at the cost of the 59 abductees who are still in Gaza and could be saved and returned,\" the group said, accusing Netanyahu's government of having \"refused to declare an end to the war in order to implement the next steps in the [ceasefire] deal and return all the abductees.\"",
      "The forum dismissed Netanyahu's claim that the resumption of fighting was intended to secure the remaining hostages' release as \"a complete deception.\"",
      "The forum said \"families are now making their way to Jerusalem and calling on the people of Israel to stand with them\" in a protest on Tuesday. \"There is nothing more urgent than this! With each passing day, the danger to the hostages grows. Military pressure could further endanger their lives and complicate efforts to bring them home safely.\"",
      "United Nations human rights chief Volker Turk said he was \"horrified by last night's Israeli airstrikes and shelling in Gaza, which killed hundreds, according to the Ministry of Health in the strip,\" adding that it would \"add tragedy onto tragedy.\"",
      "Farhan Haq, deputy spokesperson for U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, said the U.N. chief was \"shocked by the Israeli airstrikes in Gaza, in which a meaningful number of civilians have been killed. He strongly appeals for the ceasefire to be respected, for unimpeded humanitarian assistance to be reestablished and for the remaining hostages to be released unconditionally.\"",
      "Egypt, which helped negotiate the ceasefire along with the U.S. and Qatar, issued a statement condemning Israel's actions, which it called \"a flagrant violation of the ceasefire agreement and a dangerous escalation that threatens to have dire consequences for the stability of the region.\"",
      "\"Egypt reiterates its complete rejection of all Israeli attacks aimed at re-igniting tension in the region and thwarting efforts aimed at calming the situation and restoring stability. It calls on the international community to intervene immediately to halt the Israeli aggression on the Gaza Strip and prevent the region from re-entering a new cycle of violence and counter-violence,\" Egypt's foreign ministry said.",
      "Hamas says Israel \"fully responsible for violating and overturning\" ceasefire",
      "Hamas also condemned the attacks, accusing Israel of breaching the ceasefire and putting the fate of the remaining hostages in jeopardy.",
      "In a statement, Hamas said it would hold Netanyahu's government \"fully responsible for the repercussions of the treacherous aggression on Gaza, and for the defenseless civilians and our besieged Palestinian people, who are subjected to a brutal war and a systematic policy of starvation.\"",
      "\"Netanyahu and his extremist government have decided to overturn the ceasefire agreement, exposing the prisoners in Gaza to an unknown fate,\" said Hamas, adding a demand for the U.S. and its negotiating partners Egypt and Qatar to \"hold Netanyahu and the Zionist occupation fully responsible for violating and overturning the agreement.\"",
      "In a separate statement, Hamas spokesperson Abdul Latif al-Qanou said Israel's \"coordination with the U.S. administration prior to the attacks confirms the U.S. partnership in the genocide perpetrated against our people and its role in covering up Israeli war crimes.\"",
      "What happened during the ceasefire?",
      "The new strikes come amid the Muslim holy month of Ramadan and after nearly two months of a ceasefire to pause the 17-month-long war that saw dozens of hostages released in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. The first phase of the ceasefire ended on March 1 but the pause in major fighting held until Monday.",
      "Since the first phase of the ceasefire ended, the sides have not been able to agree on a way forward to a second phase aimed at releasing the nearly 60 remaining hostages and ending the war altogether. Netanyahu had repeatedly threatened to resume the war, and President Trump had also issued several warnings and ultimatums to Hamas \u2014 some contradicting the agreed-upon terms of the ceasefire \u2014  as negotiations on a second phase of the ceasefire struggled to materialize.",
      "Egypt, Qatar and the United States had been trying to mediate the next steps in the ceasefire.",
      "Earlier in the month, Israel cut off aid into Gaza, stopping the entry of all goods and supplies into the Palestinian territory. Israel said the aid blockade was aimed at pressuring Hamas to accept a\u00a0proposal drafted by the Trump administration to extend the first phase\u00a0of the ceasefire. Under the proposal, Israel had demanded Hamas immediately hand over half of the remaining hostages held in Gaza, which would have been a significant change in the terms initially agreed to under the deal brokered by the U.S., Qatar and Egypt.",
      "On Friday, Hamas said it had accepted a proposal from mediators to release one living American-Israeli hostage and the bodies of four dual-nationals who had died in captivity. Netanyahu's office cast doubt on the offer last week, accusing the U.S. and Israeli-designated terrorist group of trying to manipulate talks underway in Qatar on the next stage of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire.",
      "In a separate Friday statement, Hamas official Husam Badran reaffirmed what he said was Hamas' commitment to fully implementing the ceasefire agreement in all its phases, warning that any Israeli deviation from the terms would return negotiations to square one.",
      "The agreement had called for negotiations to begin on the ceasefire's more difficult second phase, in which the remaining hostages would be released and Israeli forces would withdraw from Gaza. Hamas is believed to have 24 living hostages and the bodies of 35 others.",
      "The war erupted with Hamas' Oct 7, 2023, cross-border terrorist attack, which killed some 1,200 people and took 250 others hostage. Israel responded with a military offensive that killed over 48,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, and displaced an estimated 90% of Gaza's population. The territory's Health Ministry doesn't differentiate between civilians and militants, but says over half of the dead have been women and children.",
      "While the ceasefire largely halted the fighting, Israel has left troops in Gaza throughout the past two months and continued to strike targets, claiming that Palestinians were trying to carry out attacks or approaching troops in no-go zones.   A number of strikes earlier Monday killed a total of 10 people, according to Palestinian officials.",

      "\"People in blue zones eat healthier, as they consume primarily whole, unprocessed, plant-based foods.\" (iStock)",
      "\"Grandma never gets lonely, because she lives upstairs and helps with the garden,\" Buettner shared as an example. \"She helps cook food and she helps with childcare. And the kids do better because they're getting better attention. And it's this virtuous circle.\"",
      "In blue zones, people typically live in communities where they care about each other, he added.",

      "Faith factor",
      "Data shows that people who regularly go to church live anywhere from four to 14 years longer than people who don't, Buettner noted.",
      "\"You can't measure faith, but you can measure religiosity,\" he said. \"Scientists simply ask people how often they show up at church, temple or mosque, and then they compare the longevity of the people who show up to those who don't show up at all.\"",
      "WARDING OFF DEMENTIA MEANS MORE READING, PRAYING AND LISTENING TO MUSIC: STUDY",

      "Sleep's role in health",
      "In his visits to blue zones, Buettner found that the residents are usually early to bed, early to rise.",
      "\"They have kind of two sleeps, where they'll go to bed shortly after sunset, and then get up at 3 or 4 a.m. and do some chores, and then go back to sleep until sunrise,\" he told Fox News Digital.",

      "\"And some good research shows that people who take a 20-minute nap five days a week have significantly lower rates of cardiovascular disease and about 30% lower rates of cardiovascular mortality,\" Buettner said. \"So napping is definitely part of the blue zone approach to longevity.\"",
      "\"Blue zones give us a very clear set of choices and environmental factors that would help us mindlessly get the years we deserve.\"",
      "Overall, he concluded, anyone can benefit from the lessons learned from the blue zones \u2014 primarily the importance of keeping people healthy in the first place.",
      "\"It\u2019s about shaping their environment so that healthier choices are easier or unavoidable and setting them up for success, so they're subconsciously making better decisions on a day-to-day basis for years or decades,\" Buettner said.",

      "Hospitals made use of sundecks, where patients could be transported for periods of time to take in the sunlight and fresh air, according to Seheult.",
      "JUST ONE NIGHT OF POOR SLEEP COULD HAVE THESE SURPRISING HEALTH EFFECTS",
      "But with the development of penicillin and other advancements in modern medicine, doctors relied less on holistic methods, he said.",
      "The sun's ultraviolet B (UV-B) light produces vitamin D in the body by causing a chemical reaction in the skin, Seheult noted.",
      "Sunlight can boost the body's ability to regulate sleep, circadian rhythm and mood. (iStock)",
      "Vitamin D is a known anti-inflammatory and antioxidant that supports immune health, muscle and brain function, according to Mayo Clinic.",
      "The sun also produces infrared light, which has been shown to relieve pain and inflammation.",
      "Just 15 to 20 minutes of sunlight exposure can help boost the immune system and potentially even ward off chronic disease, according to Seheult.",
      "Balancing risks and benefits",
      "The warnings from medical professionals of sunlight leading to skin cancer may have caused decreased exposure, the doctor suggested.",
      "\"Certainly, if we go outside in the sun for too long for a period of time without protection, we can get those types of skin damage,\" he said.",
      "\"There are some benefits to getting out into the sun, if it's done in moderation and if it's done smartly.\"",
      "But the doctor said some recent studies have found that the more time spent outside in sunlight, the less likely people are to die of all causes, including cancer.",
      "Dr. Richard Weller, a professor of dermatology at the University of Edinburgh, published a piece in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology in August 2024, discussing this data and the need to rethink the influence of the sun.",
      "WHY THE END OF DAYLIGHT SAVING TIME CAN NEGATIVELY AFFECT YOUR HEALTH",
      "\"UVR is a skin carcinogen, yet no studies link sun exposure to increased all-cause mortality,\" Weller wrote in the study abstract.",
      "Walking in green spaces can offer even more light exposure, as trees, leaves and plants are \"highly reflective of infrared light.\" (iStock)",
      "\"Growing evidence shows that\u00a0sunlight has health benefits through vitamin D-independent pathways, such as photomobilization of nitric oxide from cutaneous stores with reduction in cardiovascular morbidity,\" he wrote.",

      "Seheult agreed, encouraging people to \"rethink the idea that the sun is a deadly laser and that actually there are some benefits to getting out into the sun, if it's done in moderation and if it's done smartly.\"",
      "People who are fair-skinned or sensitive to sunlight can wear clothing, hats and other protective gear while still getting the benefits.",
      "\"Infrared light, because it is a long-wavelength, low-energy light, is able to penetrate not only through your skin and deep down into your body, but it's also able to penetrate very easily through clothes,\" Seheult said.",
      "Vitamin D from sunlight acts as an anti-inflammatory and antioxidant, helping to support immune health, muscle and brain function. (iStock)",
      "\"If they're still getting outside, they're going to get quite a bit of infrared light, even in that setting, and not be susceptible to getting [burned]. So, you don't need to have bare skin for sunlight exposure.\"",
      "Sunlight is also still present on cloudy and rainy days and in urban areas, Seheult noted.",
      "WHY HIGHER UV INDEX NUMBERS ARE MORE DANGEROUS DURING SUN EXPOSURE",
      "\"The amount of light inside a building [is] usually no more than 100 lux,\" he said. \"When you go outside on a bright, sunny day, that's 100,000 lux. That's 1,000 times brighter.\"",
      "Although that exposure will be reduced on cloudy days or in the winter, it won't be \"nearly as low\" as indoor lighting, Sehuelt added.",
      "\"Kids are spending so much more time inside,\" Seheult said. \"Any sort of movement that we make toward going outside will be very beneficial.\" (iStock)",
      "To reap the benefits of infrared light without the risk, Seheult recommended going outside and covering up for about 30 minutes, even in the morning or evening while the sun is setting.",
      "\"These are times when there is an abundance of infrared light, far more than you would get inside your home,\" he said.",
      "\"All it takes is about 15 to 20 minutes of infrared light exposure \u2026 and we're seeing effects that last for days.\"",
      "For those who work in an office and spend their daylight hours inside, Seheult suggested taking short breaks and stepping outside into the light or a green space.",
      "For more Health articles, visit www.foxnews.com/health",

      "\"But the only two provisions in the executive order are taking legal steps to continue narrowing the agency's focus and continuing to enforce civil rights and administer ongoing federal financial programs, because those duties cannot be offloaded to other agencies without shifting the burden by congressional action,\" she said.",
      "Students attending college or private schools with student loans or Pell grants will continue to receive their federal funding under Trump's order. Perry said there is \"a misconception\" that schools would be forced to close or raise taxes due to budget shortfalls caused by downsizing the department, but \"federal taxpayer spending actually makes up less than 10% per pupil funding in the state, so the remaining amount is generally split between local and state taxpayers, not federal taxpayers.\"",

Antivirus software can detect and block suspicious links, warn you about potentially harmful websites and prevent malware from being installed on your device.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Always verify the authenticity of unsolicited communications:\u00a0If you receive an unexpected email, text or phone call claiming to be from a government agency, it's essential to confirm its authenticity. Scammers often create a sense of urgency to trick you into taking immediate action. To verify, always use official contact details from government websites. Avoid clicking any links in the message and reach out to the agency directly to confirm whether the communication is legitimate.",
      "3. Reach out directly if you're unsure:\u00a0When you\u2019re unsure about the legitimacy of a message or request, contact the government agency directly using verified contact details. Never respond to the message or click on any links within it. By calling or visiting the agency\u2019s official website, you can ensure you\u2019re communicating with authorized representatives and avoid scammers impersonating government officials.",
      "4. Use strong, unique passwords to protect your accounts:\u00a0One of the best ways to protect your sensitive information from scammers is by using strong, unique passwords for each of your accounts. Avoid using easily guessable passwords like \"password123\" or \"qwerty.\" Instead, create complex passwords that include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers and special characters.",

      "6. Report suspicious tax-related activities immediately: If you suspect a scam or fraudulent activity, it\u2019s crucial to report it to the relevant authorities right away. Whether you\u2019ve received a suspicious message or believe your information has been compromised, reporting it helps prevent further harm. The IRS and other agencies have dedicated channels for reporting fraud, so take action as soon as you can to protect yourself and others from these schemes.",

Invest in personal data removal services: Use a personal data removal service to remove your personal information from data broker and people-finder sites, which scammers often use to find phone numbers and email addresses.

      "\"It\u2019s one of the reasons we don\u2019t operate Facebook, Instagram or our other services in China,\" Zuckerberg said. \"I wanted our services in China because I believe in connecting the whole world and I thought we might help create a more open society. I worked hard to make this happen. But we could never come to agreement on what it would take for us to operate there, and they never let us in.

      "A solar oasis in the heart of India",
      "Tata Power Renewable Energy Limited (TPREL) has achieved a pretty incredible engineering feat that's as impressive as it is innovative. TPREL's 126 MW floating solar project features 213,460 bifacial glass-to-glass modules spread across 260 hectares (642 acres) of water surface between the Indira Sagar and Omkareshwar hydroelectric reservoirs. These advanced panels are expected to generate a whopping 204,580 MWh of clean energy annually, sufficient to power thousands of homes across the region.",
      "Larsen & Toubro (L&T), a global leader in renewable energy solutions, has also played a crucial role in the Omkareshwar Floating Solar Park. L&T successfully commissioned a 90 MW floating solar power plant as part of the project. This significant contribution underscores L&T's expertise in harnessing renewable energy and its commitment to sustainable development.",

      "The Omkareshwar project goes far beyond simply placing solar panels on water. The installation incorporates robust mooring systems, wave breakers and ballast anchors to ensure stability in varying conditions. Flexible cableways allow the structure to adapt to fluctuating water levels and high winds. Additionally, the project hosts the world's largest floating inverter platform, setting a global benchmark in floating solar technology.",

By shading the reservoir, the plant significantly reduces water evaporation, helping to conserve precious resources. The project conserves approximately 32.5 million cubic meters of water annually. The use of water bodies for energy production also frees up land for agriculture and other vital uses. Furthermore, TPREL's 126 MW project is set to offset a staggering 173,893 tonnes of CO2 emissions each year, making a substantial contribution to India's climate goals.",

      "Tech expert Kurt 'CyberGuy' Knutsson joins 'Fox & Friends' to warn of new cyberscams and his tips on how to avoid them.",
      "Change-of-address scams involve some of the most seemingly harmless personal information getting into the wrong hands. This can lead to a whole host of problems, including financial losses and identity theft, although change-of-address fraud is technically a form of identity theft.",
      "This kind of fraud involves a scammer impersonating you to request a change of address with the United States Postal Service (USPS).",
      "Once they have your mail redirected to an address they control, they can go through it at their leisure, looking for mail they can steal and information they can use to perpetrate further scams, like taking out loans or credit cards in your name or using your identity to defraud others.",

      "Here\u2019s how it works, step by step",
      "This detailed breakdown explains the process of a change-of-address scam, from initial targeting to the potential consequences and warning signs to watch for.",
      "A person with criminal intent gets your postal address and full name, something that\u2019s most easily done using a so-called people search site. People search sites, also known as people finder sites, are a kind of data broker that specializes in collecting, organizing and selling access to personal information.",
      "The scammer then mails a change-of-address request to the USPS, providing your name and a new address he has access to. The\u00a0online change-of-address form is generally more secure, requiring confirmation via a bank account. That\u2019s why scammers will almost always mail in the request.",
      "The form requires a signature, but this is unlikely to be verified when processing the request. So, the scammer will either find an image of your signature somewhere, steal a document that includes your signature or simply sign your name any which way.",
      "Now that they\u2019ve redirected your mail straight into their hands, the scammer just has to patiently wait for sensitive mail to arrive. They\u2019re on the lookout for anything they can use to steal from you or defraud you. Bank statements, tax documents, checks and even your household bills can be used to commit further acts of fraud and identity theft.",
      "One of the scariest things a scammer can do once he has enough of your personal information is to commit deed fraud, otherwise known as\u00a0home title theft. You\u2019re far from helpless, though. There are telltale signs that you can watch for to catch change-of-address scams early.",
      "The most obvious sign to watch for is a sudden and persistent drop in the amount of mail entering your mailbox. This only applies to mail addressed to you by name. Mail delivered to your address without an addressee, including mail addressed to \"homeowner\" or \"occupant,\" won\u2019t be affected by a change-of-address scam.",
      "The other major things to keep an eye on are your credit report, credit card statements and bank statements. You can request a free credit report from one of the three credit bureaus once per year.",

      "Start by keeping detailed records: Document everything that\u2019s led you to believe your mail has been redirected. This includes the mail you were expecting, any communication with the senders of the missed mail (such as confirming dispatch dates), suspicious phone calls, texts or emails, and any unusual activity in your online accounts, bank accounts or credit reports.Reach out to the USPS for help: Use the\u00a0online locator to find and contact your local U.S. Postal Inspection Service (USPIS) office. They can assist with investigating fraudulent mail redirection.Take action if identity theft is suspected: If you believe you\u2019ve become a victim of identity fraud, visit the Federal Trade Commission's identity theft portal. This resource will help you develop a recovery plan and guide you through the steps to protect yourself.",

      "Prevention is better than a cure, and, luckily, there\u2019s a lot you can do to stop change-of-address scams before they start.",
      "1. Invest in personal data removal services: Have your personal information removed from data broker databases, including people search sites. They\u2019re the first port of call for many scammers. Without these companies in the mix, scammers aren\u2019t likely to come across your address in the first place.",
      "A reputable personal information removal service can take your data down from hundreds of sites and keep it off by resending removal requests, even as data brokers try to add your information to their databases.",

      "2. Reduce the amount of sensitive mail in your mailbox: Start by switching to paperless options wherever available. This will dramatically reduce the amount of sensitive mail heading to your mailbox, leaving criminals with little value to steal. Check your mail daily, as soon as possible after it\u2019s delivered. Get someone to do this for you if you\u2019re away. Some redirection scams start with mail being stolen from your mailbox. Definitely avoid allowing your mailbox to overflow.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "3. Secure your mailbox: Consider upgrading to a\u00a0locked mailbox\u00a0to prevent mail theft. If you live in an area prone to mail theft, this simple step can stop criminals from intercepting sensitive documents before they even reach you.",
      "4. Use an identity theft protection service:\u00a0Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.\u00a0 They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "5. Set up USPS Informed Delivery: Enroll in\u00a0USPS Informed Delivery, a free service that lets you preview images of incoming mail before it arrives. This can help you spot missing mail early and identify potential issues with mail redirection.",
      "6. Report suspicious activity immediately: If you notice anything unusual, such as missing mail or unauthorized changes to your accounts, report it right away. Contact the USPS, your bank and the Federal Trade Commission to ensure the issue is documented and addressed promptly.",

      "Change-of-address scams might sound like an unlikely threat, but they can wreak havoc on your finances and peace of mind if left unchecked. By staying alert, securing your personal information and taking proactive measures like monitoring your mail and credit, you can greatly reduce the risk of falling victim to these scams.

Consider installing reputable security software that can help detect phishing attempts and warn you about potentially dangerous websites or messages.",

      "5. Report suspicious activity:\u00a0If you receive a text that seems off, report it immediately to your mobile carrier, local law enforcement or the FBI\u2019s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3). Reporting helps authorities track down scammers and prevent further attacks.",
      "6. Consider using a personal data removal service: Personal data removal services can help reduce your exposure to smishing attacks by removing your sensitive information \u2014 like phone numbers, addresses and email details \u2014 from data broker websites. Scammers often rely on these publicly available databases to target victims with personalized phishing texts. These services aren\u2019t foolproof, but they can make it harder for cybercriminals to find and exploit your information. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

With the FBI and cities like New York, San Francisco and others sounding the alarm, I'm stepping up my own security game.

      "AI dashcams are transforming road safety and fleet management through advanced computer vision technology. These smart devices, equipped with both inward- and outward-facing cameras, can detect a wide range of unsafe driving behaviors.",
      "The outward-facing cameras are capable of detecting rolling stops, unsafe lane changes and potential collisions, while the inward-facing cameras monitor driver drowsiness, distraction, seatbelt violations and smoking. The accuracy of these systems is impressive, with detection rates ranging from 88% to 99.5% and false positives as low as 0.5% to 12%.",

      "Despite the safety benefits, the installation of AI dashcams raises significant privacy issues. Many truck drivers view their vehicles as second homes, especially long-haul drivers who spend extended periods on the road. The constant presence of cameras in their workspace raises concerns about perceived invasion of privacy in personal space, fear of constant surveillance and micromanagement and worries about data security and potential misuse of collected information.",
      "The use of outward-facing cameras also affects the privacy of other road users because they may record private citizens without consent. There is a risk of data breaches exposing personal information or location data and concerns about how footage might be used or shared. These concerns underscore the need for careful consideration of privacy rights when deploying such technology.",
      "To address some of these privacy concerns, Motive has implemented features such as Driver Privacy Mode, which allows drivers to disable the driver-facing camera while off duty. Additionally, Motive's AI dashcam system includes privacy controls and the option to activate Driver Privacy Mode for individual drivers, groups or entire fleets. Motive's AI dash cam also incorporates blurring technology to protect the privacy of individuals captured in the footage, further addressing concerns about recording private citizens without consent.",

      "Thirty years on from the fatal sarin nerve gas attack in Tokyo's subway network, survivors and families who lost loved ones are still seeking justice.",
      "Thirteen people were killed and thousands were sickened when cult members released sarin nerve gas in the capital's subway trains on March 20, 1995. The attack remains one of the most shocking atrocities in Japan, a country known for its low crime rates.",
      "20 YEARS LATER, A SURVIVOR RECOUNTS JAPAN'S SARIN GAS ATTACK AND HOW IT AFFECTED HIS LIFE",
      "The cult, Aum Shinrikyo or Supreme Truth, has since disbanded. Its founder, Shoko Asahara, and 12 of his disciples were executed in 2018.",
      "But 1,600 former members still operate under renamed groups and have ignored an order to pay damages to survivors and bereaved families.",
      "Shizue Takahashi lost her husband, a deputy station master, in the attack. The couple was just starting to enjoy time to themselves after raising three children when tragedy struck.",
      "\"My life is still being ruined by Aum and its successor groups,\" said Takahashi, 78. \"We need to carry on and not let the memories fade.\"",
      "People gasped for air and collapsed",
      "At 8 a.m. during the morning rush, five cult members got on separate train cars on three subway lines converging at Kasumigaseki, Japan\u2019s government center, each dropping bags of sarin on the train floors. They punctured the bags with umbrellas, releasing the gas inside the train cars.",
      "Within minutes, commuters poured out of the trains onto the platforms, rubbing their eyes and gasping for air. Some collapsed. Others fled onto the streets where ambulances and rescue workers in hazmat suits gave first-aid.",
      "A subway sign, center top, is seen at the Kodenmacho station, that was affected by a deadly sarin nerve gas attack 30 years ago, in Tokyo, as a passenger gets out of its exit Thursday, March 20, 2025.\u00a0 (AP Photo/Hiro Komae)",
      "Kazumasa Takahashi didn\u2019t know the puddle he was cleaning on the subway car floor was sarin. He collapsed as he removed a bag \u2014 a sacrifice some survivors say saved lives \u2014 and never woke up.",
      "The attack sickened more than 6,000. A 14th victim died in 2020 after battling severe after-effects.",
      "The subway gassing happened after a botched police investigation failed to link the cult to earlier crimes, says Yuji Nakamura, a lawyer for the survivors and the bereaved families. \"It could have been prevented,\" he said.",
      "Two days after the gassing, Tokyo police, carrying a caged canary to detect poison, raided Aum\u2019s headquarters near Mount Fuji, where the cultists lived together, trained and produced sarin. Asahara was found in a hidden compartment.",
      "Apocalyptic cult",
      "Born Chizuo Matsumoto in 1955, Asahara founded Aum Shinrikyo in 1984. The cult combined Hinduism, Buddhism, Christianity and yoga, and attracted young people disillusioned with materialism. He taught that death could elevate their spirits and justified killing as a virtue.",
      "Followers paid to drink Asahara\u2019s bathwater and wore electrical head gear they believed synchronized their brain waves with the guru\u2019s. He prophesized an imminent apocalypse, which only true believers would survive.",
      "Asahara gathered doctors, lawyers and scientists from Japan\u2019s top universities as his closest aides.",
      "Using donations from followers and earnings from yoga classes and health food businesses, they bought land and equipment. Asahara\u2019s scientists developed and manufactured sarin, VX and other chemical and biological weapons.",
      "In 1989, its members killed Tsutsumi Sakamoto, a lawyer who opposed the cult, his wife and baby boy. Their criminal activities escalated after their defeat in the 1990 parliamentary elections. A 1994 sarin attack in the central Japanese city of Matsumoto killed eight and injured more than 140 others.",
      "In all, Aum killed 27 people in more than a dozen attacks that culminated in the subway gassing. It was part of a plot by Asahara to hasten Armageddon, envisioning overthrowing the government.",
      "Still seeking redress",
      "Shizue Takahashi attended most of the Aum criminal trials. She has lobbied for government support, winning the enactment of a law to support crime victims and government benefits of 3 billion yen ($20 million) for more than 6,000 survivors and bereaved families of the Aum crimes.",
      "The government has also enacted laws banning sarin production and possession, and restricted the activities of groups linked to mass killings. Police have since established nuclear, biological and chemical weapons units and beefed up training.",
      "Aum\u2019s main successor, Aleph, has ignored a court order to pay 1 billion yen ($6.7 million) in compensation to survivors and bereaved families. The group has allegedly hidden billions of yen of income from yoga and spiritual seminars.",
      "Many of the subway gassing survivors still suffer health problems and trauma, according to support groups.",
      "Takahashi and others last week called on Justice Minister Keisuke Suzuki to do more to accelerate compensation by Aleph and keep them under close watch.",
      "Survivors and their supporters say lessons have not been sufficiently shared with the public.",
      "Shoko Egawa, a journalist and expert on Aum crimes, says attention on the group has largely focused on its crimes rather than teaching people to stay away from dangerous cults. \"There is still a lot to learn from (the Aum problems), including how they attracted followers, so that we can prevent people from getting their lives ruined by cults,\" Egawa said.",
      "Takahashi recently launched a website that compiles articles and comments by survivors, lawyers and writers, including Haruki Murakami\u2019s 2007 article about his 1997 book \"Underground.\"",
      "Aum\u2019s remnants",
      "At its peak, the cult boasted more than 10,000 followers in Japan and 30,000 in Russia and elsewhere. Aum has disbanded, but about 1,600 people belonging to Aleph and two smaller groups in Japan still practice Asahara\u2019s teachings, said the Public Security Intelligence Agency, which monitors the groups.",

      "The federal government has acknowledged that some reinstated employees will confront various hurdles before they\u2019re up and running at work. In court filings accompanying the Justice Department\u2019s appeal of the reinstatement orders, federal officials argued that restoring \u201cremoved employees to full duty status would impose substantial burdens\u201d on various agencies, \u201ccause significant confusion, and cause turmoil for the terminated employees.\u201d",
      "\u201cSpecifically, all employees offered reinstatement into full duty status would have to be onboarded again, including going through any applicable training, filling out human resources paperwork, obtaining new security badges, re-enrolling in benefits programs and payroll, reinstituting applicable security clearance actions, receiving government furnished equipment, and other requisite administrative actions,\u201d the director of human capital operations at the Environmental Protection Agency said in one such filing.",

Just as it looks like Mark Scout (Adam Scott) will be able to escape Lumon with his wife, Gemma (Dichen Lachman), his \"innie\" makes a startling decision: to stay inside the building and with his own love, Helly R. (Britt Lower).",
      "The decision marks a turning point for the show. While the combative dynamics between the innies and Lumon remain, the growing tension between the innies and outies on the show is poised to become the primary source of conflict \u2014 between Mark S and Mark Scout, and between Helly R and Helena Eagan.",
      "It\u2019s a split that is already showing some signs of fracturing fans who are inclined to root for either the innies or the outies.",
      "Some fans were moved by the grand gesture from Mark S.",
      "\u201cSEVERANCE IS A LOVE STORY,\u201d wrote one X user, with an image of the final shot.",
      "As has become common for \"Severance\" fan reactions on the internet, the memes flowed.",
      "The sci-fi series follows a group of workers at fictional Lumon Industries who have undergone a so-called severance procedure, permanently dividing their consciousnesses between their work and personal lives. \u201cInnies\u201d and \u201couties\u201d have no memories of the other\u2019s life.",
      "Fans have become captivated by the show\u2019s dystopian premise, as well as the cohort of \u201cinnies\u201d that make up Lumon\u2019s dedicated Macrodata Refinement (MDR) team: Mark S., Dylan G. (Zach Cherry), Helly R. (Britt Lower) and Irving B. (John Turturro). Throughout season two, all of the members grapple with their existence as they learn more about their \u201couties.\u201d",
      "Mark Scout (the outie of Mark S.) secretly begins \u201creintegration,\u201d a painful brain surgery process that would meld his \u201cinnie\u201d and \u201coutie\u201d in order to try and remember his experiences as both. It\u2019s all part of an effort to find his wife, Gemma, who was thought to have died in a car accident two years prior but is actually being experimented on by Lumon employees somewhere in the building.",
      "The season two finale revolves around \u201coutie\u201d Mark\u2019s mission to save Gemma from the depths of Lumon. Thanks to help from his sister, Devon (Jen Tullock), and former severed floor manager Harmony Cobel (Patricia Arquette), Mark Scout is able to make an appeal to his \"innie,\" Mark S.",
      "Their conversation \u2014 conducted via recorded messages back and forth on a video camera \u2014 becomes heated. Mark S. shares his reluctance to save someone he doesn\u2019t actually know, especially because Gemma\u2019s reunion with Mark Scout would likely mean the lives of all \u201cinnies\u201d (including his love interest, Helly R.) will come to an end.",
      "Back on the severed floor, Mark S. decides to fulfill his outie\u2019s request after all. Helly R. and Dylan G. help by distracting floor manager Seth Milchick (Tramell Tillman), who has thrown a celebration featuring \u201cchoreography and merriment\u201d \u2014 a particularly surreal scene featuring an animatronic version of Lumon's mythological leader Kier Eagan and an extended performance from a marching band \u2014 to commemorate Mark S.\u2019s completion of his work.",
      "Mark S. makes his way to the testing floor where he becomes his \"outie,\" Mark Scout, and reunites with Gemma. They escape to the severed floor, where \u201cinnie\u201d Mark S. escorts Gemma to a stairwell to help her leave Lumon for good.",
      "But rather than go with her, Mark S. ends up choosing to stay behind with Helly R., and they run off, hand-in-hand, down the hallways of Lumon as Gemma looks on screaming Mark\u2019s name.",
      "\u201cNEVER. LET. YOUR. WIFE. STOP. YOU. FROM. FINDING. YOUR. SOULMATE. #severance\u201d another fan wrote.",
      "\u201cMARK AND HELLY WOULD RATHER LIVE IN HELL THAN A WORLD THAT DOESNT INCLUDE EACH OTHER. this is romance!!\u201d another X user wrote.",
      "But others were outraged he would choose navigating the unknowns of the severed floor with Helly R. instead of letting his \u201coutie\u201d be with Gemma.",
      "\u201cmark being able to walk towards helly with gemma screaming like that on the other side of the door is actually so black hearted and evil \u2026 he will never deserve her #severance\u201d wrote one fan.",
      "\u201ci just don\u2019t understand how anyone could look at someone screaming and crying like gemma was and go nah bye.. mark s you will pay\u201d wrote another fan.",
      "\u201ci love markhelly but honestly\u2026 it\u2019s not the same to me now,\u201d added another X user. \u201cthey\u2019re almost turning into the villains themselves. i don\u2019t want them to find love and freedom and humanity in this way, you know?\u201d",
      "Aside from the dramatic twist at the end, the season 2 finale also revealed one mysterious aspect of the show that fans had been speculating about since season 1: What exactly are the MDR employees doing for Lumon?",
      "According to Cobel, Mark S. and the team have been refining Gemma\u2019s four tempers, creating 25 different consciousnesses \u2014 or innies \u2014 of her. In Gemma\u2019s storyline, it appears each of her consciousness\u2019 experiences is personal to her outie\u2019s tempers in some way, as Lumon tests the limits of the severed chip on the company\u2019s quest to fulfill Kier Eagan\u2019s imagined world without pain.",
      "The countdown to Season 3 begins",
      "Since the show returned in January after a three-year hiatus, fans have inundated platforms like X and Reddit with memes, theories and even fan-cam edits. The massive fandom has helped make \u201cSeverance\u201d\u00a0Apple TV\u2019s biggest hit, with millions of people tuning in week after week.",
      "Ben Stiller, a director and executive producer of the show, has assured fans that there will not be as long of a hiatus between season two and three as there was between seasons one and two.",
      "\u201cNo, the plan is not to [wait three years],\u201d Stiller told Travis and Jason Kelce on an episode of their podcast, \u201cNew Heights.\u201d \u201cHopefully we\u2019ll be announcing what the plan is very soon.\u201d",
      "During a recent appearance on \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live,\u201d Stiller also teased that the creatives behind the series \u201cknow what the ending is, but how we\u2019re getting there is the creative process.\u201d",
      "In the meantime, fans will have to sit tight \u2014 though that may be easier said than done.",
      "\u201cMore Severance please\u2026NNNNOOOWWWWW!!!!!!!\u201d wrote \u201cThe Daily Show Host\u201d Jon Stewart, tagging Stiller in a post on X. \u201c(but actually thank you for what we got!)\u201d"

    "summary": "Law enforcement and extremism experts find no evidence of coordinated attacks on Teslas, despite claims from CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump.",
    "story": [
      "Law enforcement officials and domestic extremism experts say they have found no evidence that a series of attacks on Tesla vehicles and dealerships are coordinated despite such claims from Tesla CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump.",
      "At least 10 Tesla dealerships, charging stations and facilities have been hit by vandals, many of whom have lit cars on fire, while a growing collection of videos posted to social media have shown people defacing and damaging Tesla vehicles. One website appeared to encourage people to target Tesla vehicles, publishing a map with the information of dozens of Tesla owners and Tesla facilities. It\u2019s unknown who started the site.",
      "The attacks have come as Musk has emerged as one of the brightest flashpoints of an already tumultuous second Trump administration, leading a sweeping effort to cut large swaths of the federal government. Musk has decried the attacks on Teslas, and on Thursday claimed on his social media platform X that the attacks were \u201ccoordinated.\u201d He did not provide evidence.",
      "Later that day, Musk also said in a live presentation to the company: \u201cI can\u2019t walk past the TV without seeing a Tesla on fire.\u201d",
      "Trump has also claimed the attacks have been coordinated. In an interview Wednesday on Fox News, he said without evidence that\u00a0 \u201cpeople that are very highly political on the left\u201d are paying the vandals.",
      "Trump has called the destruction of Tesla property domestic terrorism, and Attorney General Pam Bondi announced charges on Thursday against three people accused of vandalizing Tesla properties in Oregon, South Carolina and Washington state.",
      "Publicly available court documents for the three people make no mention of coordination, an NBC News review found.",
      "Experts and law enforcement officials nationwide from the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the two federal agencies investigating the attacks, all told NBC News they have found no evidence of any coordination around the attacks.",
      "Individual field offices for both agencies are handling the incidents on a case-by-case basis, working with partner agencies to determine if they warrant local, state or federal charges, the law enforcement officials said. Several said federal law enforcement agents from various areas of the country have been sharing information on the Tesla attacks, but have not found a common link other than the brand itself.",
      "\u201cIf there is coordination (for the vandalism, not the protests), it\u2019s not in the public domain,\u201d John Horgan, the director of Georgia State University\u2019s Violent Extremism Research Group, said in an email.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no evidence they\u2019re connected,\u201d said John Lewis, a research fellow at George Washington University\u2019s Program on Extremism.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s tricky is that unlike previous culture war flashpoint conspiracies, this one seems to have the attention of the Justice Department,\u201d he said.",
      "Musk, a federal adviser and top donor to Trump, has become the face of massive cuts to the U.S. federal government, leading to growing unpopularity among some Americans. An NBC News poll this month found that while many Americans support cutting federal government waste, a majority now hold negative views of Musk.",
      "And while there does not appear to be any coordination around the attacks on Tesla dealerships, there have been organized efforts, such as Tesla Takedown, aimed at rallying people to show up at Tesla facilities to protest Musk. That group has disavowed violence and property destruction.",
      "Dislike of Musk and Tesla has become increasingly popular online. Videos of people\u00a0 keying Tesla cars and spreading dog feces on Cybertrucks have circulated widely. Police reports say the vandalism has extended to people shooting automatic rifles and throwing Molotov cocktails at Tesla stores.",
      "An FBI spokesperson said the bureau is still gathering information.",
      "\u201cThe FBI is working with our law enforcement partners to investigate a number of incidents in which Tesla charging stations and dealerships were damaged. Incidents have occurred in several states and the FBI is coordinating with federal, state, and local law enforcement partners to gather information,\u201d the spokesperson said.",
      "On his social media platform, Truth Social, Trump said Friday that people who deface Tesla locations could face extrajudicial rendition to El Salvador.",
      "\u201cI look forward to watching the sick terrorist thugs get 20 year jail sentences for what they are doing to Elon Musk and Tesla. Perhaps they could serve them in the prisons of El Salvador, which have become so recently famous for such lovely conditions!\u201d he said.",
      "Lewis, of George Washington University, said the president\u2019s push to label Tesla vandalism as terrorism is worrisome.",
      "\u201cThe idea that you could take Americans who have not been charged with a terrorism offense, let alone convicted of it, and talk about deporting them to a foreign country to serve prison sentences is incredibly chilling,\u201d Lewis said."

      "The men were not deported to their homeland last weekend but were instead sent to El Salvador, where they were jailed in a\u00a0notorious megaprison, raising questions about whether they were given due process.",
      "Lawyers for at least five men have\u00a0said in court filings this week that the U.S. government apprehended their clients in part because of tattoos that immigration authorities believed signaled ties to the gang.",
      "Law enforcement and immigration officials have said in the past they\u2019ve had a challenging time identifying legitimate members of the Venezuelan criminal organization. Often the only information they do have to identify individuals is alleged gang tattoos.",
      "In the case of the recent deportation flights, Robert Cerna, the acting field office director of enforcement and removal operations at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said in a sworn declaration on Monday that officials\u00a0did not solely rely on tattoos\u00a0to identify the deportees as alleged gang members.",
      "But family members\u00a0and attorneys are contesting that assertion, saying the inkings in question merely indicate the men are\u00a0sports fans\u00a0or\u00a0family men, not gang members. They believe their clients and deported relatives were\u00a0falsely accused and targeted because of their tattoos, and denied the men are connected to\u00a0Tren de Aragua\u00a0at all.",
      "Other Latin American gangs, such as the Salvadoran group MS-13, are known to use certain tattoos to identify their membership.",
      "But that\u2019s not the case with the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, according to Ronna Risquez, an expert on the group who authored the Spanish-language book \u201cThe Tren de Aragua: The Gang That Revolutionized Organized Crime in Latin America.\u201d",
      "Risquez said tattoos are not closely connected with affiliation to Tren de Aragua. When asked if there\u2019s a specific tattoo that identifies Tren de Aragua members, Risquez told Noticias Telemundo, \u201cVenezuelan gangs are not identified by tattoos.\u201d",
      "\u201cTo be a member of one of these Venezuelan organizations, you don\u2019t need a tattoo,\u201d she said in Spanish. \u201cYou can have no tattoos and still be part of Tren de Aragua. You can also have a tattoo that matches other members of the organization.\u201d",
      "Law enforcement and immigration officials across the nation have linked several tattoos to Tren de Aragua: stars on shoulders, crowns, firearms, grenades, trains, dice, predatory felines, gas masks, clocks, the Illuminati sign and the jersey number 23 \u2014 which basketball players including Michael Jordan and LeBron James made famous \u2014 in addition to tattoos of roses and the Jumpman logo.",
      "Other tattooed phrases law enforcement says are associated with the gang include \u201cHijos de Dios\u201d (Sons of God), or its abbreviation \u201cHJ,\u201d and \u201cReal Hasta la Muerte\u201d (Real Until Death).",
      "The government of El Salvador stated this week that hundreds of men deported from the U.S. last weekend were members of Tren de Aragua. In a propaganda-style video, the detainees were shown handcuffed in a crouched position as their heads were being shaved ahead of their transfer to the CECOT megaprison, according to El Salvador\u2019s Press Secretariat.",
      "The video shows some prisoners who have tattoos: One man sports ink of a rose, an Illuminati symbol and the Jumpman logo, inspired by Michael Jordan \u2014 all tattoos previously cited by police and immigration authorities as evidence of ties to Tren de Aragua.",
      "But Risquez said that gang members also sport tattoos considered culturally popular at the moment and popular among the general public \u2014\u00a0such as \u201cReal Hasta la Muerte\u201d tattoos, a phrase popularized by Anuel AA, the reggaeton singer.",
      "\u201cThis guy is loved by many Venezuelans and by many Latin Americans who have adopted this tattoo, and they\u2019ve gotten that tattoo,\u201d Risquez said. \u201cSo that tattoo can\u2019t be associated with Tren de Aragua because there are many people who aren\u2019t from the Tren de Aragua, including Anuel, who have that tattoo.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration views Tren de Aragua as a national security threat, saying dangerous members have entered the country illegally. In the U.S., law enforcement has accused dozens of people of belonging to the gang in at least 14 states, according to an NBC News analysis.",
      "The administration has repeatedly cited Tren de Aragua as the embodiment of the criminal immigrant as part of the president\u2019s  aggressive immigration enforcement agenda, which has included sending hundreds of Venezuelan immigrants to the U.S. naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and to the Salvadoran megaprison, as well as stripping hundreds of thousands more of temporary legal status in the U.S.",
      "Targeting Venezuelans because of their tattoos is \u201cwrong and outrageous,\u201d said Bill Hing, a law professor at the University of San Francisco and co-director of the school\u2019s immigration and deportation defense clinic.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very evident that just having a Michael Jordan tattoo does not necessarily mean that a person is a gang member,\u201d said Hing, who has represented hundreds of asylum-seekers from Central America, Colombia and Venezuela.",
      "A neck tattoo of the Jumpman logo was allegedly among the reasons one man was detained at Guantanamo along with 176 other Venezuelans, according to documents filed in a lawsuit by the American Civil Liberties Union and other groups.",
      "\u201cJordan is popular around the world, and for many Venezuelans he\u2019s part of their fashion,\u201d Hing said. He echoed Risquez in saying that most people get tattoos based on pop culture references as well as their geographical or ancestral roots, racial pride and religion.",
      "The idea that a Jordan tattoo or jersey would be used to link someone with Tren de Aragua is close to laughable, said Risquez.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment. But on Tuesday, the White House said in a statement in response to the deportation flights to El Salvador that it was \u201cconfident in DHS intelligence assessments on these gang affiliations and criminality.\u201d It added that the Venezuelan immigrants who were removed from the U.S. had final orders of deportation, though some attorneys and family members of the deportees are contesting that.",
      "\u201cThis administration is not going to ignore the rule of law,\u201d the statement said.",
      "Hundreds of Venezuelans have since been removed from the U.S. under the Alien Enemies Act, which allows the president to expeditiously deport noncitizens during wartime.",
      "Trump invoked this law after he claimed the gang was invading the United States. That justification is now the heart of dispute between Department of Justice lawyers and a federal judge.",
      "But in assessing the use of tattoos as a main identifier of gang affiliation, Risquez pointed out that as in all parts of the world, the only way to determine that a person is a delinquent or criminal is \u201cto conduct a police investigation\u201d and \u201cgrant them due process.\u201d"

      "Watkins is only a sophomore but is arguably the best player in the sport. A certified bucket-getter, Watkins is a multi-level scorer. She finished second in points per game in the regular season, averaging 24.6 points a night. Watkins shoots 6.1 3-pointers per game and is also adept at getting to the free-throw line. Her 8.3 free throws per game were tied for second-most in the country.",
      "Last season as a freshman, Watkins led the Trojans all the way to the Elite Eight, where they were bounced out of the tournament by the Connecticut Huskies. Watkins will certainly be motivated to make her first Final Four, and with the Huskies in USC\u2019s region, she could have a chance to earn some revenge as well.",

      "Paige Bueckers, guard, Connecticut Huskies",
      "Bueckers is the presumed No. 1 pick in the upcoming WNBA Draft. For now, though, she has unfinished business with the Huskies.",
      "After missing an entire year due to a torn ACL, Bueckers returned to the floor last season and averaged a career-best 21.9 points per game, leading UConn all the way to the Final Four. This season, Bueckers has sacrificed a tiny bit of scoring to become more of a playmaker, dishing out 4.9 assists a night, her most since her freshman campaign.",
      "This is Bueckers\u2019s last shot at returning the Huskies to glory. The storied program hasn\u2019t won a championship since reeling off four straight from 2013 to 2016. Bueckers will have to lead a young squad if she hopes to get the job done this year.",
      "Hannah Hidalgo, guard, Notre Dame Fighting Irish",
      "A two-way wrecking ball, Hannah Hidalgo improved her efficiency this year after a splashy freshman season. Hidalgo upped her scoring average, field-goal percentage and 3-point field-goal percentage as a sophomore, becoming a formidable combo with senior forward Olivia Miles.",
      "While Hidalgo can score with the best of them (she finished fourth in points per game with 24.2), her defense may be even more fun to watch. After averaging a preposterous 4.6 steals per game a season ago, Hidalgo wreaked havoc again this year to the tune of 3.7 takeaways a night.",
      "Madison Booker, forward, Texas Longhorns",
      "Booker led the Longhorns to the Elite Eight as a sophomore, and remains a great floor raiser for Texas. While Booker may not be as consistent a scorer as some of the other players on this list, she can fill it up once she gets hot.",
      "It will also be interesting to see if Booker can overcome her most recent performance, when she was held to only 10 points and no assists in the SEC tournament final by South Carolina. How a player of Booker\u2019s caliber tries to overcome defenses geared to hound her every second she\u2019s on the floor should be one of the more intriguing subplots of the tournament.",
      "Lauren Betts, center, UCLA Bruins",
      "The woman in the middle, Betts is in her second season with the Bruins after beginning her collegiate career at Stanford. She was a capital-P Problem this year, averaging career bests in points (19.6), rebounds (9.7), and assists (2.8) per game.",
      "Standing tall at 6-foot-7, Betts knows how to leverage her size on both ends of the floor. She shoots a high percentage and stays close to the basket offensively, while scaring players away from the rim defensively. Her 2.9 blocks a night were fifth-best in the nation in the regular season."

    "story": [
      "As the public face of President Donald Trump\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency, billionaire tech CEO Elon Musk has an expansive portfolio that spans across the many levers of government \u2014 and that could intersect with his wide range of business interests.",
      "But unlike another high-profile \u201cspecial government employee\u201d working in Trump\u2019s White House, AI and crypto czar David Sacks, there\u2019s no evidence that Musk has obtained a conflict of interest waiver. Such a waiver would outline the steps he\u2019s taken to avoid overlaps between his business interests and his government work, include an explanation from the White House counsel about why they feel comfortable with Musk\u2019s arrangement, and it would identify areas where Musk has the green light to weigh in despite his business holdings.",
      "Instead, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told NBC News that Musk has already pledged he\u2019d avoid potential conflicts of interest and like all Trump-appointed \u201cspecial government employees,\u201d he\u2019s \u201cabiding by all applicable laws.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor concerns regarding conflicts of interest between Elon Musk and DOGE, President Trump has stated he will not allow conflicts, and Elon himself has committed to recusing himself from potential conflicts. DOGE has been incredibly transparent about what they\u2019re doing, posting daily updates on X and updating their website,\u201d Leavitt said in a statement to NBC News.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s standard practice for Administrations to hire individuals as Special Government Employees to focus on specific issues, based on their outside experience, for a limited period of time,\u201d Leavitt continued, adding, \u201cAll SGEs are filling out the appropriate paperwork, receiving briefings on ethics rules, including the conflict of interest rules, and abiding by all applicable federal laws.\u201d",
      "The White House first publicly acknowledged Musk\u2019s position on Feb. 3, announcing he\u2019d serve as a \u201cspecial government employee,\u201d a designation used by presidents over the years to allow outside experts to lend their knowledge to the government without having to ditch their private-sector jobs. The administration has sworn under oath that Musk is a \u201csenior adviser to the president,\u201d not a DOGE employee, though Trump has repeatedly emphasized that Musk is running the show there.",
      "It\u2019s no secret that Musk\u2019s broad business portfolio, which includes the space company SpaceX and the electric vehicle company Tesla, intersects with a slew of government regulators and potential government contracts. That\u2019s why Democrats and others have raised concerns about how the government and Musk will ensure those conflicts don\u2019t creep into official administration decisions.",
      "Earlier this month, Musk told Fox Business that DOGE is \u201cpretty much\u201d in every federal department. In one example of the convergence of Musk\u2019s business interests and the federal government, Starlink, his satellite internet service, is being considered for use in more and more places across the federal government. Musk businesses like Tesla and SpaceX have received billions in government subsidies and contracts, and his interests have been involved in key regulatory battles with the federal government over the years.",
      "Musk\u2019s Tesla also relies heavily on China both for production and as a market \u2014 a relationship that came up Friday after Musk received a briefing at the Pentagon that included a discussion on China. During a conversation with reporters in the Oval Office hours later, Trump denied a report that the briefing would include military plans related to a hypothetical war with China, calling Musk a \u201cgreat patriot\u201d and saying that Musk\u2019s business dealings with China would be a reason not to show him something like that.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to show that to anybody, but certainly you wouldn\u2019t show it to a businessman who is helping us so much. He\u2019s a great patriot. He\u2019s paying a big price for helping us cut costs, and he\u2019s doing a great job. He\u2019s finding tremendous waste, fraud and abuse,\u201d Trump said.",
      "\u201cBut I certainly wouldn\u2019t want \u2014 you know, Elon has businesses in China, and he would be susceptible, perhaps, to that, but it was such a fake story,\u201d Trump continued.",
      "The restrictions around \u2018special government employees\u2019",
      "As a \u201cspecial government employee,\u201d Musk is subject to a series of legal restrictions and guardrails aimed at protecting the American people from concerns about conflicts of interest or an outside adviser making financial gains from their advice to the president.",
      "Federal law bars all employees of the executive branch from \u201csubstantially\u201d participating in a \u201cparticular matter\u201d where they, their immediate family or business partners have a \u201cfinancial interest,\u201d though that matter must have a \u201cdirect and predictable effect on that interest\u201d to be forbidden.",
      "If Musk sat on certain kinds of government committees, he could receive a waiver if it was deemed that the need for his services outweighed conflict concerns. But Musk is not publicly linked to a committee that would qualify.",
      "With no indication he qualifies for that kind of waiver, Musk could also receive a conflict of interest waiver under a stricter standard: that \u201cthe financial interest is not so substantial as to be deemed likely to affect the integrity of the employee\u2019s services.\u201d But it\u2019s not clear whether Musk sought, or received, any conflict of interest waivers.",
      "In response to an NBC News inquiry about a potential waiver for Musk, the White House Counsel\u2019s office replied that \u201cthe White House has no disclosures responsive to your request.\u201d And while some ethics documents are not immediately available for release, instead becoming public weeks after submission, the White House press office did not directly address whether Musk has sought or received a conflict of interest waiver that has not yet been released publicly.",
      "Another special government employee, Sacks, did receive a conflict of interest waiver, which has been posted publicly on the White House\u2019s public disclosure portal (releasing these documents publicly upon request is mandated by federal law). That 11-page memo, written by White House Counsel David Warrington, provides a roadmap to the kinds of conflict of interest rules that govern special government employees. The memo shows how Sacks has sought to divest his assets to satisfy the White House\u2019s lawyers, and it demonstrates why he is receiving a conflict of interest waiver in the first place that allows him to participate in \u201ccertain particular matters regarding regulation and policy related to the digital asset industry.\u201d",
      "\u201cBy its very nature, the position of Special Advisor for AI and Crypto requires an appointee with extensive and hands-on experience in financial technology and innovation, with intimate knowledge of the digital asset industry. It would be exceedingly difficult to find such expertise if financial technology executives, software company founders, and venture capital investors in the digital asset industry for excluded from the position,\u201d Warrington wrote in the memo granting Sacks a \u201climited\u201d conflict of interest waiver.",
      "\u201cA core impetus for the nation\u2019s modern conflict of interest laws \u2026 was a recognition that in matters of technology, science, and innovation, the Government required leaders from the private sector to lend their knowledge and experience to the shaping of national public policy,\u201d Warrington added.",
      "Neither Sacks nor Musk has to file a public financial disclosure. (The disclosures they have to file are allowed to remain private unless they begin drawing a substantial government salary.)",
      "A White House official told NBC News that the White House Counsel\u2019s Office vets all \u201cspecial government employees\u201d and advises them of the limits of where they can and can\u2019t participate. And the official added that the outside business interests of \u201cspecial government employees\u201d is a feature, not a bug, as the whole point of the status is to allow successful people to lend their expertise to the federal government.",
      "But the lack of a public waiver, combined with Musk\u2019s sprawling business interests and impact across the federal government, raises concerns from some ethics officials, including those who have been critical of Trump and his administration over conflict of interests in the past.",
      "\u201cA conflict of interest waiver for Musk could not be justified,\u201d Walter Shaub, the former director of the United States Office of Government Ethics who resigned a few months into Trump\u2019s first term, wrote in an email. \u201cElon Musk is the world\u2019s richest individual who is a government contractor. The American people have every reason to want their tax dollars and the resources of their national government to serve only their interests, not the interests of billionaire government contractor who now seems to have stuck his fingers in everything the government does.\u201d"

      "The act had previously only been invoked during major wars \u2014 the War of 1812 and both world wars.",

      "Howell signed off on a restraining order barring portions of  Trump\u2019s executive order punishing Perkins Coie, a law firm that\u2019s done high-profile work for Democrats. The order suspended employees\u2019 security clearances and barred them from federal buildings.",
      "\u201cIt sends chills down my spine when you say that if the president in his view has the position that an individual, or an entity, or a company is operating a way that is not in the nation\u2019s interest, he can issue an executive order like this,\u201d Howell said at a hearing last week, calling it \u201ca pretty extraordinary power for the president to exercise.\u201d",
      "The DOJ filing said the judge \u201chas repeatedly demonstrated partiality against and animus towards the President\u201d over the years, and cited her having signed off on parts of special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s investigations into Trump as one of the reasons she should recuse herself.",
      "'Soaked in animus': Judge halts transgender military ban",
      "Another federal judge in D.C. issued a preliminary injunction barring the Defense Department from implementing Trump\u2019s executive order\u00a0banning transgender people from enlisting or serving in the military.",
      "U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes found the ban is \u201csoaked in animus\u201d and violates the equal protection clause because it discriminates based on transgender status and sex.",
      "\u201cIts language is unabashedly demeaning, its policy stigmatizes transgender persons as inherently unfit, and its conclusions bear no relation to fact,\u201d she wrote, adding that the government failed to produce evidence about how many transgender service members there are, or how transgender status impacts their military readiness.",
      "\u201cTransgender persons have served openly since 2021, but Defendants have not analyzed their service. That is unfortunate. Plaintiffs\u2019 service records alone are Exhibit A for the proposition that transgender persons can have the warrior ethos, physical and mental health, selflessness, honor, integrity, and discipline to ensure military excellence,\u201d Reyes wrote.",
      "At a hearing Friday, the government argued, as it had previously, that the order is focused on people with the medical condition \u201cgender dysphoria.\u201d",
      "Reyes pointed to a Feb. 27 tweet by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth declaring that \u201cTransgender troops are disqualified from service without an exemption.\u201d",
      "\u201cI am not going to abide by government officials saying one thing to the public \u2014 saying what they really mean to the public \u2014 and coming in here to the court and telling me something different, like I\u2019m an idiot,\u201d Reyes told the DOJ attorney assigned to this case. \u201cI am not an idiot.\u201d",
      "The Justice Department\u00a0later called Reyes\u2019 injunction \u201cthe latest example of an activist judge attempting to seize power at the expense of the American people who overwhelmingly voted to elect President Trump.\u201d",

      "\u201cWe have\u00a0a portfolio that is very large, lots of loans, tens of thousands of loans, pretty complicated deal,\u201d Trump said, speaking to reporters in the Oval Office. \u201cThat\u2019s coming out of the Department of Education immediately.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re all set for it,\u201d the president said of the SBA. \u201cThey\u2019re waiting for it.\u201d",

      "Consumer advocates are worried that the mass transfer of accounts could trigger errors, or compromise borrowers\u2019 privacy. They also raised concerns about how a change in agency might affect protections and programs such as Public Service Loan Forgiveness.",
      "Trump said earlier this month that his administration was looking to task any of the Treasury Department, Commerce Department or the Small Business Administration with federal student loan management.",

    "summary": "Law enforcement and extremism experts find no evidence of coordinated attacks on Teslas, despite claims from CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump.",
    "story": [
      "Law enforcement officials and domestic extremism experts say they have found no evidence that a series of attacks on Tesla vehicles and dealerships are coordinated despite such claims from Tesla CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump.",
      "At least 10 Tesla dealerships, charging stations and facilities have been hit by vandals, many of whom have lit cars on fire, while a growing collection of videos posted to social media have shown people defacing and damaging Tesla vehicles. One website appeared to encourage people to target Tesla vehicles, publishing a map with the information of dozens of Tesla owners and Tesla facilities. It\u2019s unknown who started the site.",
      "The attacks have come as Musk has emerged as one of the brightest flashpoints of an already tumultuous second Trump administration, leading a sweeping effort to cut large swaths of the federal government. Musk has decried the attacks on Teslas, and on Thursday claimed on his social media platform X that the attacks were \u201ccoordinated.\u201d He did not provide evidence.",
      "Later that day, Musk also said in a live presentation to the company: \u201cI can\u2019t walk past the TV without seeing a Tesla on fire.\u201d",
      "Trump has also claimed the attacks have been coordinated. In an interview Wednesday on Fox News, he said without evidence that\u00a0 \u201cpeople that are very highly political on the left\u201d are paying the vandals.",
      "Trump has called the destruction of Tesla property domestic terrorism, and Attorney General Pam Bondi announced charges on Thursday against three people accused of vandalizing Tesla properties in Oregon, South Carolina and Washington state.",
      "Publicly available court documents for the three people make no mention of coordination, an NBC News review found.",
      "Experts and law enforcement officials nationwide from the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the two federal agencies investigating the attacks, all told NBC News they have found no evidence of any coordination around the attacks.",
      "Individual field offices for both agencies are handling the incidents on a case-by-case basis, working with partner agencies to determine if they warrant local, state or federal charges, the law enforcement officials said. Several said federal law enforcement agents from various areas of the country have been sharing information on the Tesla attacks, but have not found a common link other than the brand itself.",
      "\u201cIf there is coordination (for the vandalism, not the protests), it\u2019s not in the public domain,\u201d John Horgan, the director of Georgia State University\u2019s Violent Extremism Research Group, said in an email.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no evidence they\u2019re connected,\u201d said John Lewis, a research fellow at George Washington University\u2019s Program on Extremism.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s tricky is that unlike previous culture war flashpoint conspiracies, this one seems to have the attention of the Justice Department,\u201d he said.",
      "Musk, a federal adviser and top donor to Trump, has become the face of massive cuts to the U.S. federal government, leading to growing unpopularity among some Americans. An NBC News poll this month found that while many Americans support cutting federal government waste, a majority now hold negative views of Musk.",
      "And while there does not appear to be any coordination around the attacks on Tesla dealerships, there have been organized efforts, such as Tesla Takedown, aimed at rallying people to show up at Tesla facilities to protest Musk. That group has disavowed violence and property destruction.",
      "Dislike of Musk and Tesla has become increasingly popular online. Videos of people\u00a0 keying Tesla cars and spreading dog feces on Cybertrucks have circulated widely. Police reports say the vandalism has extended to people shooting automatic rifles and throwing Molotov cocktails at Tesla stores.",
      "An FBI spokesperson said the bureau is still gathering information.",
      "\u201cThe FBI is working with our law enforcement partners to investigate a number of incidents in which Tesla charging stations and dealerships were damaged. Incidents have occurred in several states and the FBI is coordinating with federal, state, and local law enforcement partners to gather information,\u201d the spokesperson said.",
      "On his social media platform, Truth Social, Trump said Friday that people who deface Tesla locations could face extrajudicial rendition to El Salvador.",
      "\u201cI look forward to watching the sick terrorist thugs get 20 year jail sentences for what they are doing to Elon Musk and Tesla. Perhaps they could serve them in the prisons of El Salvador, which have become so recently famous for such lovely conditions!\u201d he said.",
      "Lewis, of George Washington University, said the president\u2019s push to label Tesla vandalism as terrorism is worrisome.",
      "\u201cThe idea that you could take Americans who have not been charged with a terrorism offense, let alone convicted of it, and talk about deporting them to a foreign country to serve prison sentences is incredibly chilling,\u201d Lewis said."

      "A rare joint effort launched by the Biden administration and embraced by the Trump White House brought two Palestinian children with cancer from Gaza to the U.S. for treatment this week, multiple sources tell NBC News.",
      "They are among 240 Palestinian children with cancer who have been evacuated from Gaza since the war began so they can get chemotherapy, blood transfusions and other treatments impossible to obtain in the war zone.",
      "But the resumption of fighting threatens to slow these evacuations,  with at least six more children diagnosed with cancer waiting to be extricated from Gaza for desperately needed treatment.",
      "On Wednesday, two Palestinian girls with cancer, 17-year-old Nesma and 12-year-old Leen, who asked that their last names not be disclosed for privacy reasons, finally made it to the U.S. treatment. But at least six other Palestinian children with cancer remain trapped in Gaza as fighting intensifies.",
      "In a rare example of cooperation between members of the Biden and Trump administrations, officials from both have pushed their counterparts in Israel, Egypt, Jordan\u00a0and other countries\u00a0to help get the children and their parents\u00a0or guardians security clearances\u00a0so they can be evacuated for life-saving treatment.",
      "Since the start of the war in Gaza, at least 12 young Palestinian cancer patients who had been approved to leave have died while waiting because of delays and red tape.",
      "The process, which has played out in fits and starts, has been both fraught and frustrating, according to former Biden White House chief of staff, Jeff Zients.",
      "\u201cWe pushed and pushed and pushed and thought we were making progress, and then would be blocked,\u201d he told NBC News.",
      "Modeled after an operation by the Biden administration, U.S. officials and St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital\u00a0that evacuated 1,700 pediatric cancer patients from Ukraine, the Gaza effort proved far more complicated.",
      "While the war in Ukraine has a clear front line, Israel\u2019s unpredictable urban fighting with Hamas in Gaza complicated the rescue effort. For security\u00a0and health reasons, many of the evacuations took place one patient at a time in ambulances forced to navigate bombed out roads.",
      "The effort reached a low point in the spring of 2024. On May 6, 4-year-old cancer patient Nabil Kiheil was cleared to leave the next day by Israeli officials. But Israel\u2019s forces invaded the Rafah area and closed the border overnight, and Nabil\u00a0and his mother had to evacuate to a safer zone in the north.",
      "Forced to wait nearly a month for a crossing from Gaza to Israel to open, Nabil was later evacuated through the Kerem Shalom\u00a0crossing through Israel\u00a0to a hospital in East Jerusalem.",
      "Doctors there found that Nabil\u2019s condition had deteriorated, that he had developed sepsis and his organs had begun to fail. Nabil died in East Jerusalem of cardiac arrest less than a week after his fifth birthday.",
      "Nabil\u2019s death motivated Biden administration officials and doctors from St. Jude to push harder for evacuations, people involved in the operation said.\u00a0From June to November 2024, 46 Palestinian children with cancer got out of Gaza and received treatment in Egypt, Jordan, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Turkey, Italy and Spain.",
      "But in December 2024 and January 2025, 20 children were then denied visas to leave after Israeli officials began questioning whether caregivers of the sick children had ties to Hamas.",
      "September was the worst month in Gaza for relief efforts in all of 2024, with humanitarian assistance levels dropping to less than half of those in the spring. By October, the humanitarian situation in Gaza had grown so dire that Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin sent a letter to their Israeli counterparts demanding that the Israeli government take steps to reverse the trajectory on the ground within 30 days to avoid restrictions on U.S. military aid to Israel, required under U.S. law.",
      "For several months, ceasefire talks were frozen as Biden administration officials repeated the same talking points, of \u201cwe\u2019re close,\u201d and \u201cwe\u2019re getting closer,\u201d while acknowledging that the most difficult sticking points were often left for the end.",
      "After Trump won the election in November, incoming Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. got involved. Over dinner at Mar-a-Lago, he appealed to the president-elect to help the pediatric cancer patients. Trump assigned the task to his special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s so worthy,\u201d Witkoff told NBC News in an interview Thursday. \u201cNo matter what side of the battle lines you\u2019re on here, these are young kids and they needed to get proper care.\u201d",
      "The arrival of Nesma and Leen, the first pediatric cancer patients from Gaza to arrive in the U.S. for treatment, raised hopes of further evacuations. The two teens landed at Washington Dulles International Airport on Thursday on a humanitarian flight organized by St. Jude and paid for by Pfizer, whose CEO Albert Bourla has provided charter passage for cancer patients.",
      "Asked by NBC News if she\u2019s relieved her daughter made it to the U.S., Nesma\u2019s mother, Mirvat, said before leaving Dulles, \u201cI\u2019m happy for her.\u201d",

      "The U.S. Department of Defense on Friday released new guidance on how it will enforce President Donald Trump\u2019s ban on transgender people in the military, and asked a federal judge to lift her recent order blocking the ban.",
      "The memorandum from the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense says the Department of Defense will review service members\u2019 medical records, and within 45 days give them self-assessment questionnaires, to determine whether they have a current diagnosis, history, or symptoms of gender dysphoria, which would make them ineligible for continued service.",
      "Gender dysphoria is the distress experienced when a person\u2019s gender identity does not align with his or her birth sex.",

      "It also states that it cannot currently take effect because of Wednesday\u2019s order by U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes in Washington blocking the Trump administration\u2019s ban in response to a lawsuit by transgender current and would-be service members.",
      "Justice Department lawyers in a motion on Friday asked Reyes to lift her order in light of the new guidance. They argued that Reyes\u2019 order incorrectly found that the policy discriminated against people based on their transgender identity, and that the guidance makes clear that it is based on a medical diagnosis.",
      "Reyes already rejected a similar argument when she blocked the policy.",

      "The men were not deported to their homeland last weekend but were instead sent to El Salvador, where they were jailed in a\u00a0notorious megaprison, raising questions about whether they were given due process.",
      "Lawyers for at least five men have\u00a0said in court filings this week that the U.S. government apprehended their clients in part because of tattoos that immigration authorities believed signaled ties to the gang.",
      "Law enforcement and immigration officials have said in the past they\u2019ve had a challenging time identifying legitimate members of the Venezuelan criminal organization. Often the only information they do have to identify individuals is alleged gang tattoos.",
      "In the case of the recent deportation flights, Robert Cerna, the acting field office director of enforcement and removal operations at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said in a sworn declaration on Monday that officials\u00a0did not solely rely on tattoos\u00a0to identify the deportees as alleged gang members.",
      "But family members\u00a0and attorneys are contesting that assertion, saying the inkings in question merely indicate the men are\u00a0sports fans\u00a0or\u00a0family men, not gang members. They believe their clients and deported relatives were\u00a0falsely accused and targeted because of their tattoos, and denied the men are connected to\u00a0Tren de Aragua\u00a0at all.",
      "Other Latin American gangs, such as the Salvadoran group MS-13, are known to use certain tattoos to identify their membership.",
      "But that\u2019s not the case with the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, according to Ronna Risquez, an expert on the group who authored the Spanish-language book \u201cThe Tren de Aragua: The Gang That Revolutionized Organized Crime in Latin America.\u201d",
      "Risquez said tattoos are not closely connected with affiliation to Tren de Aragua. When asked if there\u2019s a specific tattoo that identifies Tren de Aragua members, Risquez told Noticias Telemundo, \u201cVenezuelan gangs are not identified by tattoos.\u201d",
      "\u201cTo be a member of one of these Venezuelan organizations, you don\u2019t need a tattoo,\u201d she said in Spanish. \u201cYou can have no tattoos and still be part of Tren de Aragua. You can also have a tattoo that matches other members of the organization.\u201d",
      "Law enforcement and immigration officials across the nation have linked several tattoos to Tren de Aragua: stars on shoulders, crowns, firearms, grenades, trains, dice, predatory felines, gas masks, clocks, the Illuminati sign and the jersey number 23 \u2014 which basketball players including Michael Jordan and LeBron James made famous \u2014 in addition to tattoos of roses and the Jumpman logo.",
      "Other tattooed phrases law enforcement says are associated with the gang include \u201cHijos de Dios\u201d (Sons of God), or its abbreviation \u201cHJ,\u201d and \u201cReal Hasta la Muerte\u201d (Real Until Death).",
      "The government of El Salvador stated this week that hundreds of men deported from the U.S. last weekend were members of Tren de Aragua. In a propaganda-style video, the detainees were shown handcuffed in a crouched position as their heads were being shaved ahead of their transfer to the CECOT megaprison, according to El Salvador\u2019s Press Secretariat.",
      "The video shows some prisoners who have tattoos: One man sports ink of a rose, an Illuminati symbol and the Jumpman logo, inspired by Michael Jordan \u2014 all tattoos previously cited by police and immigration authorities as evidence of ties to Tren de Aragua.",
      "But Risquez said that gang members also sport tattoos considered culturally popular at the moment and popular among the general public \u2014\u00a0such as \u201cReal Hasta la Muerte\u201d tattoos, a phrase popularized by Anuel AA, the reggaeton singer.",
      "\u201cThis guy is loved by many Venezuelans and by many Latin Americans who have adopted this tattoo, and they\u2019ve gotten that tattoo,\u201d Risquez said. \u201cSo that tattoo can\u2019t be associated with Tren de Aragua because there are many people who aren\u2019t from the Tren de Aragua, including Anuel, who have that tattoo.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration views Tren de Aragua as a national security threat, saying dangerous members have entered the country illegally. In the U.S., law enforcement has accused dozens of people of belonging to the gang in at least 14 states, according to an NBC News analysis.",
      "The administration has repeatedly cited Tren de Aragua as the embodiment of the criminal immigrant as part of the president\u2019s  aggressive immigration enforcement agenda, which has included sending hundreds of Venezuelan immigrants to the U.S. naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and to the Salvadoran megaprison, as well as stripping hundreds of thousands more of temporary legal status in the U.S.",
      "Targeting Venezuelans because of their tattoos is \u201cwrong and outrageous,\u201d said Bill Hing, a law professor at the University of San Francisco and co-director of the school\u2019s immigration and deportation defense clinic.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very evident that just having a Michael Jordan tattoo does not necessarily mean that a person is a gang member,\u201d said Hing, who has represented hundreds of asylum-seekers from Central America, Colombia and Venezuela.",
      "A neck tattoo of the Jumpman logo was allegedly among the reasons one man was detained at Guantanamo along with 176 other Venezuelans, according to documents filed in a lawsuit by the American Civil Liberties Union and other groups.",
      "\u201cJordan is popular around the world, and for many Venezuelans he\u2019s part of their fashion,\u201d Hing said. He echoed Risquez in saying that most people get tattoos based on pop culture references as well as their geographical or ancestral roots, racial pride and religion.",
      "The idea that a Jordan tattoo or jersey would be used to link someone with Tren de Aragua is close to laughable, said Risquez.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment. But on Tuesday, the White House said in a statement in response to the deportation flights to El Salvador that it was \u201cconfident in DHS intelligence assessments on these gang affiliations and criminality.\u201d It added that the Venezuelan immigrants who were removed from the U.S. had final orders of deportation, though some attorneys and family members of the deportees are contesting that.",
      "\u201cThis administration is not going to ignore the rule of law,\u201d the statement said.",

    "story": [
      "Difficult to watch, but impossible to look away from, \"Adolescence\" has been racking up acclaim since its premiere on Netflix on March 13.",
      "The final episode of the series hinges on a British slang term that American viewers may not be familiar with \u2014 but is important for understanding the plot.",
      "To rewind, the four-episode miniseries begins with the arrest of 13-year-old Jamie Miller (Owen Cooper) for the murder of a fellow classmate, Katie Lewis. Each episode is filmed in one shot, taking place over a single hour in the 13 months after his arrest.",
      "In the last episode, Jamie's parents and sister try to adjust to their new normal. Jamie's father, Eddie Miller (played by series creator Stephen Graham), wakes up in a good mood \u2014 it's his birthday and he seems determined to celebrate.",
      "Yet his happiness is brief, as the cloud of what Jamie did still looms over the family. Lisa Miller (Amelie Pease), Jamie's sister, discovers that the word \"nonse\" has been spray painted on the side of Eddie's van. It's worth noting the word is misspelled, which means a younger person could have vandalized the car.",
      "In its simplest definition, this a British slang term that means \"pedophile.\" The Cambridge Dictionary, spelling it \"nonce,\" defines it as \"a person who commits a crime involving sex, especially sex with a child.\"",
      "Yorkshire native Emmeline Armitage, 25, tells TODAY.com that the power of the word \u201cnonse\u201d has fluctuated.",
      "She says that it\u2019s a word \u201cthat\u2019s sort of associated with certain types of British humor,\u201d like \u201cTV shows from like 10-15 years ago.\u201d",
      "Armitage notes \u201cThe Inbetweeners\u201d \u2014 a British sitcom about teenage boys that ran from 2008 to 2010 \u2014 as an example of a show where the word \u201cwould get thrown around.\u201d",
      "It \u201cdefinitely carried less weight at a certain time,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I\u2019m wondering if it carries a bit more weight to it now that we are in a culture where people are more aware of the things that they\u2019re saying.\u201d",
      "The implication is that people in the Millers' community blame Eddie, and possibly the conditions of Jamie's household, for what he did.",
      "Jamie's guilt is never in question: In the first episode, police find a video of him repeatedly stabbing Katie.",
      "The question, then, becomes why Jamie killed Katie. Creator Graham told Rolling Stone that he knows he is \u201cnot alone in blaming the parents sometimes\u201d when he sees these events like the one in \"Adolescence\" on the news.",
      "But with \u201cAdolescence,\u201d Graham wanted to create a narrative where the parents weren\u2019t at fault.",
      "\u201cI thought to myself, \u2018What if it\u2019s not the parents?\u2019\u201d he told Rolling Stone. \u201cI wanted the dad to be a hardworking man, the kind of man that I was brought up with, like my uncles and my dad, who used to go to work at, like, 6 in the morning and not get home till 8 o\u2019clock at night, Monday to Friday.\u201d",
      "Police uncover that Jamie had been radicalized by incel propaganda online. \"Incel\" is a term that stands for \"involuntary celibate\" and is defined as a group of \u201cheterosexual men who blame women and society for their lack of romantic success\u201d by the Anti-Defamation League.",
      "In Episode 3, during a charged conversation with a therapist, Jamie lets on that he thought he was too ugly to ever receive a woman's affection. When Katie rejected him, then bullied him in an Instagram comment, he got an awful revenge.",
      "Even if his home environment didn't lead Jamie to become a murderer, that doesn't mean the public sees it that way \u2014 which explains the vandalism of the Millers' van.",
      "The Millers, in the finale, confront their own responsibility in what Jamie became. How could they have \u201cmade\u201d a Jamie, they wonder? But they reason that they also \"made\" a Lisa, who is well-adjusted.",
      "The show gives no easy answers about Jamie, and no answers about what's next for the Millers. One year after his arrest, the entire family is paying the price. For now, Eddie will focus on removing the graffiti from his car \u2014 but one could imagine a world where the Millers leave and start over entirely."

      "Each episode has a different focus: Episode 1 is about Jamie\u2019s arrest and processing; Episode 2 jumps ahead a couple of days and shows police detectives following up an investigation at Jamie\u2019s school; Episode 3 returns to Jamie, months later and still in detention but not convicted, being interviewed by a psychiatrist; Episode 4 takes us to Jamie\u2019s family, dealing with the fallout of his alleged crime (as he still hasn\u2019t gone to court), many months later.",
      "Here's a rundown of the ending of \"Adolescence\" and why it leaves no room for easy answers.",
      "Did Jamie kill Katie?",
      "Yes, and this gets cleared up fairly early in the series: In Episode 1, CCTV footage shows Jamie and Katie in an altercation. She pushes him, and he pushes her, and then he stabs her repeatedly.",
      "It\u2019s all shown at a distance, without volume, and unless you knew he had a knife on him it might seem that Jamie was punching her.",
      "Jamie\u2019s father Eddie (series co-creator and co-writer Stephen Graham) is shown the footage in that first episode, and believes it \u2014 despite Jamie insisting he wasn\u2019t the one who killed the girl.",
      "Why did Jamie kill Katie?",
      "Since we know Jamie is guilty early on, what remains to be discovered in the last three episodes is the \u201cwhy,\u201d and that\u2019s where things get complicated.",
      "Police bumble their way through coded teen internet speak, discovering that adolescents are aware of phrases like \u201cmanosphere\u201d and \u201cincel.\u201d",
      "\"Incel\" stands for \"involuntary celibate\" and is defined as a group of \u201cheterosexual men who blame women and society for their lack of romantic success\u201d by the Anti-Defamation League.",
      "They also learn quickly that bullying can happen from multiple angles \u2014 both online in the real world \u2014 that teenagers\u2019 need to be seen and valued by their peers can triumph over everything else they might learn at home or from teachers.",
      "In Episode 3, when we dive deeper into Jamie\u2019s thinking, the series doesn\u2019t let us see a cut-and-dried version of him as either villain or misunderstood victim of bullies. He has a temper, and seems to get pleasure when others are afraid of him. But he can be polite and genuine, unsure exactly of what is going on around him. It\u2019s in this episode where his insistence that he didn\u2019t kill Kate might make some sense in his mind \u2014 he doesn\u2019t see himself as the bad guy, or someone who is capable of killing. But his anger showed him differently.",
      "It appears Jamie killed Katie after being influenced by corners of the internet that convinced him he was too \"ugly\" to receive affection from a woman, as he lets out in his conversation with the therapist in Episode 3.",
      "When Katie turned down his advances and bullied him with an emoji that implied he was an incel, he did something tragic.",
      "What happens to Jamie at the end of \u2018Adolescence\u2019?",
      "Jamie isn\u2019t seen in the last episode, only briefly heard. The final episode looks at an earth-shaking morning in the life of Jamie\u2019s family, with Eddie, his mother Manda (Christine Tremarco) and sister Lisa (Amelie Pease).",
      "While they\u2019re riding in Eddie\u2019s recently-vandalized van, they get a call from Jamie \u2014 who announces he\u2019s changing his plea to \u201cguilty\u201d when he goes to court. He doesn\u2019t give a reason why.",
      "Back home, Eddie and Manda have a mutual breakdown, wondering where they went wrong. They ask if they should have gotten him a computer, and put few restrictions on his using it. Eddie, who was physically abused as a boy, says he only wanted to do better with his children. How could they have \u201cmade\u201d a Jamie? But then they also realize they \u201cmade\u201d a Lisa, who by all lights is doing well in school and acts sensibly.",
      "The final scene features Eddy weeping in his son\u2019s bed, surrounded by Jamie\u2019s belongings and toy teddy bear. He gives the bear a small kiss, and tucks it into bed \u2014 something he probably won\u2019t be able to do with his own son ever again.",
      "Will there be an \u2018Adolescence\u2019 Season 2?",
      "It seems unlikely; the Millers\u2019 story in the miniseries comes to a conclusion of sorts, even if it doesn\u2019t provide pat answers. In theory, \u201cAdolescence\u201d could become an anthology series, with different crimes and different characters, but as of now there\u2019s been no announcement from Netflix that there are plans to replicate the show."

      "\"The Residence,\" which debuted on Netflix March 20, may be a Shondaland production, but it feels more like an Agatha Christie novel come to life.",
      "The first episode of \"The Residence\" sets up the main plot for the limited series, beginning with the death of A.B. Wynter (Giancarlo Esposito), the chief usher at the White House, during a state dinner with Australia.",
      "The show then cuts back and forth between a congressional committee hearing and the events of the night that led to A.B.'s death, including the subsequent investigation led by Detective Cordelia Cupp (Uzo Aduba).",
      "After observing the crime scene, Detective Cupp \u2014 a world-class detective and avid bird watcher who can be described as a mix between Sherlock Holmes and Hercule Poirot \u2014 declares that A.B. did not die by suicide (as it was speculated) but was murdered, launching a lengthy investigation.",
      "Throughout the investigation multiple suspects \u2014 though Detective Cupp refrains from ever calling anyone a suspect \u2014 are identified.",
      "Those identified as potential persons of interest include: White House butler Sheila Cannon (Edwina Findley), first gentleman Elliot Morgan (Barrett Foa), Australian Foreign Minister David Rylance (Brett Tucker), executive pastry chef Didier Gotthard (Bronson Pinchot), White House chef Marvella (Mary Wiseman), President Morgan's social secretary Lilly Schumacher (Molly Griggs), President's brother Tripp Morgan (Jason Lee), maid Elsyie Chayle (Julieth Restrepo), White House engineer Bruce Geller (Mel Rodriguez), \u201cthird man\u201d\u00a0Patrick Doumbe (Timothy Hornor), the president\u2019s oldest friend Harry Hollinger (Ken Marino) and Jasmine Haney (Susan Kelechi Watson, the White House assistant usher who later becomes A.B.'s replacement.",
      "With the wide range of options, a major question looms: Who killed A.B. Wynter \u2014 and better yet, how?",
      "How does 'The Residence' end?",
      "The final episode begins with Detective Cupp contemplating those she deems as persons of interest as she imagines the night of A.B. Wynter's death and his interactions with staff.",
      "She gathers all her potential suspects, knowing the murderer is one of them, but not yet sure who did the deed.",
      "As she attempts to put together the events of the night that A.B. was killed, the detective notes that part of the confusion comes from the amount of people who moved A.B.'s dead body around the house.",
      "First, Bruce Geller moved him, thinking the love of his life Elsyie Chayle had killed him. Then, after a night of partying, Tripp Morgan woke up next to A.B.'s dead body and in a panic moved him while hiding evidence in the process. Tripp also found the apparent suicide note in A.B.'s pocket and slit his wrists with Didier Gotthard's knife for good measure.",
      "But Detective Cupp doesn't believe any of these people killed A.B. She admits they all could have, but there are too many loose ends. And, she's still searching for the murder weapon: a large, ornate clock that has been missing since A.B.'s death.",
      "After taking into account the narrow window of time that someone could possibly kill A.B., amid his many confrontations with staff and his dead body being moved around, Detective Cupp reveals that A.B. was killed in the Yellow Oval Room. Her theory is that the wall in the room has a hidden service corridor -- but has since been sealed in the months after A.B.'s death.",
      "Harry Hollinger reveals that Jasmine Haney ordered the door to be sealed. But Jasmine says she was given an order over the phone by first gentleman Elliott Morgan to seal it. However, Detective Cupp thinks it wasn't Morgan, but someone disguising their voice as him.",
      "Lilly Schumacher admits she ordered the door sealed, pretending to be Elliott Morgan. On the night of the murder, she says she got in a fight with A.B. and in the heat of it, she tore a page out of his diary but later came back to apologize. When she did, she heard a violent fight between him and Elsyie and then returned later to find him dead.",
      "Lilly then accuses Elysie and Bruce of killing A.B. together, saying that they told her they did it. She says she felt bad for them, as Elsyie has a daughter, and gave them the page she tore out of his diary since it looked like a suicide note. Through tears, she says that she sealed the door out of panic and to change the energy of the room.",
      "However, Detective Cupp doesn\u2019t believe her teary performance or her version of the story. Instead, she puts on gloves and grabs a knife from her bag, reopening the sealed door in the Yellow Oval Room. Inside the service passageway, she finds a hidden compartment with the bloody clock, which she brings back out and puts on the mantel.",
      "Detective Cupp explains that Lilly killed A.B. because she hates everyone in the room and the White House as an institution. She then reveals that the heated fight between Harry and A.B. was actually between Lilly and A.B. They fought because A.B. was going to expose her to the president for all the selfish and abusive things she\u2019d done since arriving at the White House which he had documented in his journal.",
      "But, it wasn\u2019t just Lilly's poor behavior he planned to expose. A.B. had found that she was stealing money from the White House, in addition to violating various criminal statutes and ethical codes to secure vendors and invites.",
      "\u201cAnd I think that\u2019s why you tried to grab his journal,\u201d Detective Cupp tells Lilly. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s why when you walked out of his office that night, and stood in the hallway, and read that page that you accidentally ripped out, you decided to kill him. To stage his suicide.\u201d",
      "Detective Cupp explains that Lilly called A.B. to ask him to come to the Yellow Oval Room so she could apologize. Then she called the Secret Service, pretending to be Elliott Morgan, and told them to stay off that floor. Meanwhile, she had gathered a drink dosed in poison from the garden shed and waited for Elysie to exit after her argument with A.B. so she could give him the drink. During her meeting with him, she gave him the page from his journal back, watching him place it in his pocket to later serve as a suicide note.",
      "Detective Cupp said that A.B. tasted the poison, but tossed the rest of it out onto the roses \u2014 burning them. So, Lilly threw a vase at him to finish the job, but missed. She then grabbed the largest object in the room \u2014 a heavy clock \u2014 and killed him with it. Afterward, she escaped into the service passageway, and put the bloody clock inside a hidden storage door within the passageway.",
      "\u201cIt was a brilliant plan and you deserve a lot of credit, but you really only made it as long as you did because of the bizarre miscommunications and regrettable behavior from so many other people in the house,\u201d Detective Cupp says.",
      "Lilly is arrested and Detective Cupp tells the Congressional Committee that she was suspicious of Lilly ever since she said that she had seen Elysie and A.B. arguing, since A.B. always kept his arguments behind closed doors. She also had heard Lilly's impression of Elliott Morgan and thought she was the one who had faked the multiple phone calls from him in an attempt to give orders.",
      "Lilly also blinked, which made Detective Cupp think her tears were fake. The final tip off (before the discovery of the bloody clock that had her fingerprints on it) was when Lilly said she saw Bruce put the note in A.B.'s jacket. Detective Cupp says Lilly was never in the room with them when Detective Cupp discovered the note, so how would Schumacher know it was in A.B.'s jacket pocket.",
      "After solving the his murder, Detective Cupp gives a moving speech honoring A.B.'s legacy and wishes for the White House, which based upon the staff's interactions, appears to be a very divided and chaotic place to work.",
      "\"He loved this house. I didn't know him, but I know that,\" she said. \"Loved the people who work here. Respected them. Understood them. Appreciated them. Saw them. Saw who they were, where they came from, what they had given up to be here, why they were here.\"",
      "She then references a theme brought up earlier in the show when Jasmine Haney explains that the White House is divided between \"us\" (the staff that report to the chief usher and count on him to defend them) and \"them\" (everybody else, from the president to the Secret Service).",
      "\"Why was he here?\" Detective Cupp continued. \"For you, Mr. President. And for you, Mr. Morgan. For everyone here. For all of us. It wasn't 'us versus them' for Wynter. It really wasn't. It was just us. One house. One family. One imperfect union. Trying to make it work. Enduring. He believed in that, in this. And look, I'm just the detective, but I think this is really worth believing in.\""

      "Unfortunately, Mark\u2019s innie is as smart as his outie. He figured out pretty fast that even though Outie Mark was sincere in wanting to re-integrate their personalities and memories after getting Gemma out of Lumon, that would likely be the end of his \u201cinnie\u201d life \u2014 and meaningful love for innie Helly R.

But this was a more empathetic connection: Outie Dylan wrote Innie Dylan a note, which Mr. Milchick (Trammel Tillman) handed to him \u2014 and the note said that Outie Dylan aspired to be the kind of man Innie was.

He gave Dylan the option to stay, or quit.\u00a0Dylan remained at Lumon, and was again critical in holding back the tide so that Mark could be the hero.",

      "\u201cI had to do some research myself,\u201d Reid tells TODAY.com. \u201cAnd I found it all so fascinating that I just wanted to dig right in and take on the role.\u201d",
      "Grace\u2019s story made headlines after one set of her adoptive parents, Michael and Kristine Barnett, were each charged with six counts of neglect of a dependent and two counts of conspiracy to commit neglect of a dependent in 2019. The couple denied the allegations, and Michael Barnett was found not guilty in 2022 following a jury trial. Kristine Barnett\u2019s charges were dismissed.",
      "Grace, who was born with a rare form of dwarfism, was adopted by Michael and Kristine Barnett in 2010, according to a 2021 document from the Court of Appeals in Indiana obtained by TODAY.com.",
      "The Barnetts came to believe Grace was a grown woman, per a 2021 court document from the Court of Appeals in Indiana obtained by TODAY.com. Following two years of psychological and medical evaluations, the Barnetts successfully petitioned to have Grace\u2019s legal birth year changed to 1989, per the document from the Court of Appeals in Indiana.",
      "Medical records reflect that Grace was, in fact, a child when she was adopted.\u00a0According to a 2019 affidavit for probable cause, Michael Barnett admitted to knowing she was a child when they left Grace alone in her own apartment in 2013 and moved to Canada with their three biological children. While living on her own, Grace met another set of adoptive parents, Cynthia and Antwon Mans \u2014 though now Grace lives with the DePaul family in New York.",
      "Inspired by Grace\u2019s story, \u201cGood American Family\u201d is a fictionalized version of both her and the Barnetts\u2019 perspectives from her adoption, allegations against her, her abandonment and the family\u2019s legal troubles.",
      "\u201cOur show does a brilliant job of playing with multiple perspectives and creating our own versions of our characters,\u201d Reid says. \u201cAnd you really have to watch it all to get the full picture of what\u2019s going on.\u201d",
      "But when it all comes down to it, it\u2019s Reid\u2019s performance that will captivate audiences \u2014 and already impressed her co-stars Christina Hendricks, who plays Cynthia Mans, and Mark Duplass, who plays Michael Barnett.",
      "Here's what to know about Reid and her time on the show.",
      "Casting Imogen Faith Reid as Natalia Grace",
      "Series creator and co-showrunner Katie Robbins tells TODAY.com that making \u201cGood American Family\u201d happen was \u201ccontingent\u201d on casting the right actor for the role of Natalia Grace.",
      "\u201cIt was such a challenging part, and it lived and died on finding somebody who could play it,\u201d Robbins says, adding that Reid\u2019s audition tape \u201cblew everybody away.\u201d",
      "Born May 1, 1997, Reid had stand-in and body double parts in \u201cThe One and Only Ivan,\u201d \u201cThe Third Day,\u201d \u201cThe Rings of Power\u201d and \u201cThe Famous Five\u201d prior to \u201cGood American Family,\u201d according to her IMDB. She\u2019s also done some theater in the past.",
      "The newcomer tells TODAY.com she made a self-tape for her audition, but didn\u2019t think she would be cast because she believed the casting directors would \u201cpick an American actress.\u201d",
      "\u201cI went for it anyway because there was nothing to lose. And I think I had done about 400 takes of that self-tape, and my sister was helping me,\u201d she recalls.",
      "Weeks later, she got the role. \u201cIt was just such a surreal, interesting moment. And I\u2019ll never forget that experience,\" she says.",
      "Robbins adds that despite Reid\u2019s lack of on-screen experience, \u201cShe brought us all in with her emotional accessibility, her vulnerability, her ability to play multiple sides and shades of this character.\u201d",
      "She explains that the role of Natalia is \u201cso challenging\u201d because \u201cnot only does she have to play a range of years, but also different versions of the same character.\u201d",
      "Throughout \u201cGood American Family,\u201d Reid had to depict Natalia from the young girl\u2019s perspective, but also from the perspective of other characters in the show.",
      "\u201cAnd Imogen just had this capacity to hold all of that while still being incredibly vulnerable and accessible and warm,\u201d Robbins says, adding that as an actor, Reid made her want to lean in and watch.",
      "The challenges of portraying Natalia Grace",
      "Portraying Grace came with a set of challenges for Reid, but the actor knew that she was the perfect person for the role.",
      "\u201cI think the biggest thing is I\u2019m a little person, and as a little person, I understand the daily struggles that we go through and the judgment that we perceive in everyday life,\u201d Reid tells TODAY.com.",
      "\u201cSo something like that, I knew I could relate to. And also the casting directors, I felt done an amazing job with casting someone like me, who can look young and who can also play older.\u201d",
      "To create her own version of Grace, Reid worked with a dialect coach who helped her go through every script and break down certain sounds and pronunciations.",
      "Duplass, who portrays Natalia\u2019s adoptive father Michael, was just as impressed with Reid\u2019s performance and dedication to her craft.",
      "Aside from this being Reid\u2019s first speaking part on camera \u2014 in an American accent, no less \u2014 Duplass also pointed out the physicality the role required.",
      "\u201cThen you add in that her form of dwarfism is different than Natalia\u2019s dwarfism, so she had to learn a specific physicality that could work inside of her body and feel true to her. She had to build that whole thing out,\u201d Duplass says, adding that Reid was also out of her comfort zone, living in Los Angeles and \u201cthrust right into the identifier of \u2018making TV.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd she was just incredible! I was kind of blown away by her every day,\u201d he says.",
      "Hendricks also worked closely with Reid while portraying Natalia\u2019s next adoptive mother Cynthia Mans. While talking to TODAY.com, Hendricks shared how Reid would constantly be working with a dialect coach as \u201cso professional,\u201d \u201cdedicated and yet so playful and easy.\u201d",
      "She adds that they had \u201cimmediate chemistry\u201d and quickly became friends.",
      "Separating her character from the real Natalia Grace",
      "Reid tells TODAY.com that she did not reach out to Grace ahead of the project.",
      "\u201cI wanted to play my own version. And something that was really important for me was to portray that light and empowerment,\u201d she says. \u201cJust wanting to fight for that justice and to be seen. Those were some key elements that I wanted to implement.\u201d",
      "Reid may be telling one specific timeline of Grace\u2019s life, but the true story continues to make headlines. Earlier this year, the third season of the documentary series \u201cThe Curious Case of Natalia Grace\" was released and included the latest on Grace\u2019s life.",

      "Who could forget the waffle party?",
      "In previous episodes, characters reference a Waffle Party, and Dylan G. finally gets the opportunity to partake in one. We learned that the freaky fete takes place in Kier\u2019s replica home in the Perpetuity Wing on Lumon\u2019s severed floor. It\u2019s a perk where an employee (in a Kier mask) is given the opportunity to commiserate, probably intimately, with four people playing Kier\u2019s \u201cFour Tempers.\u201d",
      "While there are waffles, drenched in syrup and butter, there\u2019s a different kind of devouring that the audience is meant to consider above it.",
      "2. Helena\u2019s hard-boiled egg \u2014 Season 2, Episode 9: \u201cThe After Hours\u201d",
      "After Helena goes for a swim in the episode\u2019s opening, we are treated to a beyond creepy sequence where her father Jame Eagan watches her eat breakfast. On the menu: a single hard-boiled egg, sliced into six equal slices. She eats the egg in very small bites, with a fork and knife, and her father remarks that he\u2019d wish she\u2019d \u201ctake them raw.\u201d (Girl, run.)",
      "Besides all the other disturbing aspects of this meal performance, we\u2019re reminded that in Season 1, Mr. Milchick reveals that Kier\u2019s favorite breakfast was raw eggs with milk, and it\u2019s very clear individuality is frowned upon in this family.",
      "1. Irving\u2019s watermelon bust \u2014 Season 2, Episode 5: \u201cTrojan\u2019s Horse\u201d",
      "By far the most spine-chilling object to appear in \u201cSeverance\u201d arrives after Irving is terminated for, well, trying to drown a coworker. At his \u201cfuneral,\u201d a spread of fruit is served to his surviving coworkers, and in addition to the usual honeydew and cantaloupe is a large, lifelike bust of Irving carved out of watermelon.",
      "The outlandish fruit sculpture is meant to mourn the dearly departed fellow, but slicing into your colleague\u2019s head and taking a refreshing bite has the opposite effect. The fact that Irving\u2019s love, Burt, chose watermelon as his retirement snack adds another layer of woe to the proceedings."

    "story": [
      "Jenny Slate is choosing to not further engage with \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d amid the legal battle between Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni.",
      "In a recent interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Slate declined a question about the 2024 film. When asked how filming the new miniseries \u201cDying for Sex\u201d compared to \"It Ends With Us,\" Slate responded, \u201cI don\u2019t have anything to say about that.\u201d",
      "She continued, \u201cEverything is its own thing. I poured my heart into this work, and every minute of (\u2018Dying for Sex\u2019) was important to me, and I just want to talk about that.\u201d",
      "The actor and comedian, 42, starred in the controversial 2024 drama alongside Lively and Baldoni and promoted the film with the cast. After Lively filed a legal complaint against Baldoni in December accusing him of sexual harassment and participating in a smear campaign to damage her reputation, Slate spoke out to show support for the \u201cA Simple Favor\u201d actor.",
      "In December, Slate sent a statement exclusively to TODAY.com that said she stood by Lively, whom she referred to as a \u201cloyal friend\u201d and \u201ctrusted source of emotional support.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs Blake Lively\u2019s castmate and friend, I voice my support as she takes action against those reported to have planned and carried out an attack on her reputation,\u201d Slate wrote. \u201cBlake is a leader, loyal friend and a trusted source of emotional support for me and so many who know and love her.\u201d",
      "She added, \u201cWhat has been revealed about the attack on Blake is terribly dark, disturbing, and wholly threatening. I commend my friend, I admire her bravery, and I stand by her side.\u201d",
      "Now, as Slate prepares for the release of her next project, \u201cDying for Sex,\u201d Slate is not providing an additional comment on the situation.",
      "After the Hollywood Reporter asked how Slate will handle the controversy during upcoming press events, like red carpets and junkets, she replied, \u201cAnyone can ask anything.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut my only responsibility is to speak about the work I\u2019m there to promote,\u201d she explained. \u201cIt was so important to me to get this job, so why would I spend time talking about anything but that?\u201d",
      "In \u201cIt Ends With Us,\u201d Slate plays Allysa, Lively\u2019s character\u2019s best friend and the sister of Baldoni\u2019s character. As the cast promoted the Colleen Hoover adaptation prior to its Aug. 9, 2024, release, fans pointed out on social media that Lively posed for photos with Slate and co-star Brandon Sklenar at the movie\u2019s New York premiere, but she did not interact with Baldoni. The lack of pictures and interviews with Lively and Baldoni during the press run fueled rumors at the time that there was tension between them.",
      "After Lively filed the sexual harassment complaint, Baldoni's lawyer, Bryan Freedman, called the allegations \u201ccompletely false, outrageous and intentionally salacious.\u201d",
      "Lively then filed a federal lawsuit against Baldoni, his media company Wayfarer Studios, producer Jamey Heath, crisis communications representative Melissa Nathan and publicist Jennifer Abel a few days later on Dec. 31.",
      "Attorneys for Lively said in a statement to NBC News, in part, \u201cMs. Lively previously sent her California Civil Rights Department Complaint in response to the retaliatory campaign Wayfarer launched against her for reporting sexual harassment and workplace safety concerns. Unfortunately, Ms. Lively\u2019s decision to speak out has resulted in further retaliation and attacks. As alleged in Ms. Lively\u2019s federal Complaint, Wayfarer and its associates have violated federal and California state law by retaliating against her for reporting sexual harassment and workplace safety concerns.\u201d",
      "That same day, Baldoni sued the New York Times for libel after the news outlet published an article about Lively's allegations in the California Civil Rights Department complaint.",
      "On Jan. 16, Baldoni filed a lawsuit against Lively, husband Ryan Reynolds, Lively\u2019s rep Leslie Sloane and Sloane\u2019s PR firm, accusing the parties of defamation and other contractual claims. The 179-page complaint alleged that the \u201cGossip Girl\u201d alum took creative control over her character, refused to promote the film unless she could produce edits of the final cut and more accusations.",
      "As the legal back-and-forth continues, U.S. District Court Judge Lewis J. Liman set a trial date of March 9, 2026, to address both lawsuits, according to court documents obtained by NBC News."

    "story": [
      "A rare joint effort launched by the Biden administration and embraced by the Trump White House brought two Palestinian children with cancer from Gaza to the U.S. for treatment this week, multiple sources tell NBC News.",
      "They are among 240 Palestinian children with cancer who have been evacuated from Gaza since the war began so they can get chemotherapy, blood transfusions and other treatments impossible to obtain in the war zone.",
      "But the resumption of fighting threatens to slow these evacuations,  with at least six more children diagnosed with cancer waiting to be extricated from Gaza for desperately needed treatment.",
      "On Wednesday, two Palestinian girls with cancer, 17-year-old Nesma and 12-year-old Leen, who asked that their last names not be disclosed for privacy reasons, finally made it to the U.S. treatment. But at least six other Palestinian children with cancer remain trapped in Gaza as fighting intensifies.",
      "In a rare example of cooperation between members of the Biden and Trump administrations, officials from both have pushed their counterparts in Israel, Egypt, Jordan\u00a0and other countries\u00a0to help get the children and their parents\u00a0or guardians security clearances\u00a0so they can be evacuated for life-saving treatment.",
      "Since the start of the war in Gaza, at least 12 young Palestinian cancer patients who had been approved to leave have died while waiting because of delays and red tape.",
      "The process, which has played out in fits and starts, has been both fraught and frustrating, according to former Biden White House chief of staff, Jeff Zients.",
      "\u201cWe pushed and pushed and pushed and thought we were making progress, and then would be blocked,\u201d he told NBC News.",
      "Modeled after an operation by the Biden administration, U.S. officials and St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital\u00a0that evacuated 1,700 pediatric cancer patients from Ukraine, the Gaza effort proved far more complicated.",
      "While the war in Ukraine has a clear front line, Israel\u2019s unpredictable urban fighting with Hamas in Gaza complicated the rescue effort. For security\u00a0and health reasons, many of the evacuations took place one patient at a time in ambulances forced to navigate bombed out roads.",
      "The effort reached a low point in the spring of 2024. On May 6, 4-year-old cancer patient Nabil Kiheil was cleared to leave the next day by Israeli officials. But Israel\u2019s forces invaded the Rafah area and closed the border overnight, and Nabil\u00a0and his mother had to evacuate to a safer zone in the north.",
      "Forced to wait nearly a month for a crossing from Gaza to Israel to open, Nabil was later evacuated through the Kerem Shalom\u00a0crossing through Israel\u00a0to a hospital in East Jerusalem.",
      "Doctors there found that Nabil\u2019s condition had deteriorated, that he had developed sepsis and his organs had begun to fail. Nabil died in East Jerusalem of cardiac arrest less than a week after his fifth birthday.",
      "Nabil\u2019s death motivated Biden administration officials and doctors from St. Jude to push harder for evacuations, people involved in the operation said.\u00a0From June to November 2024, 46 Palestinian children with cancer got out of Gaza and received treatment in Egypt, Jordan, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Turkey, Italy and Spain.",
      "But in December 2024 and January 2025, 20 children were then denied visas to leave after Israeli officials began questioning whether caregivers of the sick children had ties to Hamas.",
      "September was the worst month in Gaza for relief efforts in all of 2024, with humanitarian assistance levels dropping to less than half of those in the spring. By October, the humanitarian situation in Gaza had grown so dire that Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin sent a letter to their Israeli counterparts demanding that the Israeli government take steps to reverse the trajectory on the ground within 30 days to avoid restrictions on U.S. military aid to Israel, required under U.S. law.",
      "For several months, ceasefire talks were frozen as Biden administration officials repeated the same talking points, of \u201cwe\u2019re close,\u201d and \u201cwe\u2019re getting closer,\u201d while acknowledging that the most difficult sticking points were often left for the end.",
      "After Trump won the election in November, incoming Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. got involved. Over dinner at Mar-a-Lago, he appealed to the president-elect to help the pediatric cancer patients. Trump assigned the task to his special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s so worthy,\u201d Witkoff told NBC News in an interview Thursday. \u201cNo matter what side of the battle lines you\u2019re on here, these are young kids and they needed to get proper care.\u201d",
      "The arrival of Nesma and Leen, the first pediatric cancer patients from Gaza to arrive in the U.S. for treatment, raised hopes of further evacuations. The two teens landed at Washington Dulles International Airport on Thursday on a humanitarian flight organized by St. Jude and paid for by Pfizer, whose CEO Albert Bourla has provided charter passage for cancer patients.",
      "Asked by NBC News if she\u2019s relieved her daughter made it to the U.S., Nesma\u2019s mother, Mirvat, said before leaving Dulles, \u201cI\u2019m happy for her.\u201d",
      "They were then rushed off to the National Institutes of Health, where Nesma will be treated for non-Hodgkin lymphoma."

    "story": [
      "DEIR-AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip \u2014 Local health officials said Israeli strikes killed at least 85 Palestinians across the Gaza Strip overnight and into Thursday, bringing the total to nearly 600 killed since Israel\u00a0shattered a truce\u00a0that had facilitated the release of more than two dozen hostages and brought relative calm since late January.",
      "Hours later, Hamas fired three rockets at Israel without causing casualties, in the first such attack since Israel\u00a0broke the ceasefire\u00a0Tuesday.",
      "Zaher al-Waheidi, head of the records department at the Gaza Health Ministry, said Israeli bombardments have killed at least 592 people in the past three days.",
      "The Israeli military said it was again enforcing a blockade on\u00a0northern Gaza, including Gaza City. Palestinians were not being ordered to leave northern Gaza but can no longer enter, the military said, and are only allowed to move south on foot using the coastal road. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians had returned to\u00a0what remains of their homes\u00a0in the north during the ceasefire.",
      "Early Friday, Israel\u2019s Cabinet unanimously approved Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s request to fire the head of the country\u2019s Shin Bet internal security service. The late-night decision to sack Ronen Bar deepens a power struggle focused largely over who bears responsibility for the Hamas attack that sparked the war in Gaza.",
      "It also could set the stage for a crisis over the country\u2019s division of powers. Israel\u2019s attorney general has ruled that the Cabinet has no legal basis to dismiss Bar.",
      "Israeli ground forces, meanwhile, are pushing into Gaza near the northern town of Beit Lahiya and the southern border city of Rafah, the military said Thursday. The operations come a day after Israel moved to split Gaza in two by retaking part of the strategic\u00a0Netzarim corridor\u00a0that divides Gaza\u2019s north from south.",
      "The military ordered Palestinians to evacuate an area in central Gaza near the city of Khan Younis, saying it would operate there in response to Thursday\u2019s rocket fire from Hamas. The Palestinian militant group said it targeted Tel Aviv. One rocket was intercepted and two fell in open areas, according to the army.",
      "Yemen\u2019s Iran-backed Houthi rebels also launched two missiles at Israel, one early Thursday morning and another in the evening, the military said. Both were intercepted before reaching Israeli airspace, according to the army, and no injuries were reported. Air raid sirens rang out and exploding interceptor rockets were heard in Jerusalem. There have been three such attacks since the United States began a\u00a0new campaign of airstrikes\u00a0against the Houthis earlier this week.",
      "A \u2018bloody night\u2019 for hard-hit Gaza",
      "Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry said overnight Israeli strikes killed at least 85 people, mostly women and children. The ministry\u2019s records do not distinguish between civilians and combatants.",
      "The Indonesian Hospital said it received 19 bodies after strikes in Beit Lahiya, near Gaza\u2019s northern border, which was\u00a0heavily destroyed and largely depopulated\u00a0earlier in the war.",
      "\u201cIt was a bloody night for the people of Beit Lahiya,\u201d said Fares Awad, head of the Health Ministry\u2019s emergency service in northern Gaza, adding that rescuers were still searching the rubble. \u201cThe situation is catastrophic.\u201d",
      "Israel\u2019s military said Thursday its airstrikes in Gaza had killed the head of Hamas\u2019 internal security apparatus and two other militant commanders. Israel has said it only targets militants and blames civilian deaths on Hamas because it operates in densely populated areas. A United Nations-backed group of\u00a0human rights experts\u00a0accused Israel last week of \u201cdisproportionate violence against women and children\u201d during the war in Gaza.",
      "One of the strikes early Thursday hit the Abu Daqa family\u2019s home in Abasan al-Kabira, a village outside Khan Younis near the border with Israel. It was in an area the Israeli military ordered evacuated earlier this week, encompassing most of eastern Gaza.",
      "The strike killed at least 16 people, mostly women and children, according to the nearby European Hospital, which received the dead. Those killed included a father and his seven children, as well as the parents and brother of\u00a0a month-old baby\u00a0who survived along with her grandparents.",
      "\u201cAnother tough night,\u201d said Hani Awad, who was helping rescuers search for more survivors in the rubble. \u201cThe house collapsed over the people\u2019s heads.\u201d",
      "War in Gaza has no end in sight",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s administration reiterated its support for Israel, with White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt saying, \u201cThe president made it very clear to Hamas that if they did not release all of the hostages there would be all hell to pay.\u201d",
      "Israel, which\u00a0cut off the supply of food, fuel and humanitarian aid\u00a0to Gaza\u2019s roughly 2 million Palestinians, has vowed to intensify its operations until Hamas releases\u00a0the 59 hostages it holds\u00a0\u2014 24 of whom are believed alive \u2014 and gives up control of the territory.",
      "Hamas says it will only release the remaining hostages in exchange for a lasting ceasefire and a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, as called for in the ceasefire agreement mediated by the United States, Egypt and Qatar.",
      "Hamas says it\u2019s willing to hand over power to the Western-backed Palestinian Authority or a committee of political independents but will not lay down its arms until Israel ends its decadeslong occupation of lands the Palestinians want for a future state.",
      "Shin Bet chief\u2019s dismissal deepens Israeli political turmoil",
      "Netanyahu said Sunday he would seek Bar\u2019s dismissal, saying he had lost faith in his security chief.",
      "But critics say the move is a power grab by Netanyahu against an independent-minded civil servant.",
      "Tens of thousands of Israelis have demonstrated across the country in recent days in support of Bar, including a mass gathering outside Netanyahu\u2019s office late Thursday in the pouring rain.",
      "A Shin Bet report into the Oct. 7 attack acknowledged failures by the security agency. But it also said that policies by Netanyahu\u2019s government created the conditions for the attack.",
      "Netanyahu is also upset that the Shin Bet has launched an investigation into connections between some of his close aides and the Gulf state of Qatar. His office said Bar\u2019s dismissal would take effect April 10 or before then if a replacement is found.",
      "Bar did not attend the meeting but sent a letter to the Cabinet ahead of time protesting the firing.",
      "He said the dismissal was meant to hinder the agency from further investigating the failures of Oct. 7 and undermining the investigation into whether Qatar influenced the prime minister\u2019s office.",
      "\u201cThis is a direct danger to the security of the state of Israel,\u201d Bar wrote.",
      "The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people and taking 251 hostage, according to Israeli officials. Most of the hostages have been freed in ceasefire agreements or other deals. Israeli forces have rescued eight living hostages and recovered the bodies of dozens more.",
      "Israel\u2019s retaliatory offensive has killed more than 49,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. It does not say how many were militants, but says more than half of those killed were women and children. Israel says it has killed around 20,000 militants, without providing evidence.",
      "The war at its height displaced around 90% of Gaza\u2019s population and has\u00a0caused vast destruction\u00a0across the territory."

      "Plaintiffs said they were deprived of \u201ctheir rights to assemble, speak, learn, and organize freely and safely\u201d and left with \u201clife-altering injuries and post-traumatic stress disorder,\u201d according to a news release about the lawsuit.",
      "Stett Holbrook, a spokesperson for the University of California president\u2019s office, said the office had been notified of the lawsuit and was \u201cgathering additional information.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit, announced Thursday, was filed Wednesday in Los Angeles County Superior Court. It lists 35 plaintiffs \u2014 including students, faculty members and legal observers \u2014 who were on campus during the protests last year.",
      "In addition to alleging that university officials violated the \u201ccivil rights of all pro-Palestinian protesters\u201d and failed to \"address and prevent\" discrimination, the lawsuit names the Los Angeles Police Department, the California Highway Patrol and 20 individuals it calls a \"rioting mob\" as defendants.",
      "The plaintiffs claim the law enforcement agencies used \u201cexcessive physical force\u201d and unlawfully arrested protesters.",
      "The plaintiffs alleged that on May 2, when more than 200 people were arrested at the encampment, police \u201cshot powerful kinetic impact projectiles at peoples\u2019 heads and faces.\u201d",
      "Spokespeople for the California Highway Patrol and the Los Angeles Police Department said the agencies do not comment on pending litigation.",
      "The people the lawsuit describes as a rioting mob are defined as those who participated in a \"brutal, hours-long riot\" against the encampment. Many of them are identified in the complaint as Los Angeles residents but not members of the UCLA community.",
      "The campus police chief resigned in May after he drew intense criticism over his response to\u00a0the April 30 attack on the encampment, when videos taken at the scene showed counterprotesters beating people and hitting people with poles.",
      "The complaint alleges that the counterprotesters \u201cviolently assaulted protesters\" by \"breaking their bones, sexually assaulting them\" and \"burning their eyes with chemical munitions.\"",
      "The plaintiffs allege in the suit that \u201cpolice and private security watched from just a few yards away as the attack raged for hours.\"",
      "\"It was immediately apparent that there was not a semblance of protection for the physical safety of the encampment members, and the mob had successfully transformed a peaceful, interfaith community space into a site of horror,\" the complaint says.",
      "Plaintiffs' personal testimony included in the lawsuit describes violence they say counterprotesters and police officers inflicted upon them.",
      "A student, Jack Kearns, said a member of the group hit him in the head with \"a large piece of wood,\" rendering him unconscious. Another student, Faraaz Qureshi, said he was hit with rubber bullets four times, causing a severe open fracture in his finger and contusions and abrasions on his chest and back.",
      "The lawsuit seeks monetary damage for the physical and psychological injuries it said the protesters experienced.",
      "Holbrook said the university has instituted \u201csystem-wide reforms to promote safety and combat harassment and discrimination\u201d on UC campuses."

      "In contrast, the world\u2019s unhappiest country was once again Afghanistan, where the Taliban continues to make life \u201cespecially difficult\u201d for women and girls, limiting their access to education and employment.",
      "Sierra Leone, a country in West Africa plagued by significant human rights violations, was the second least happy country, while Lebanon ranked third from the bottom, with its past year marked by an ongoing economic crisis and war between Hezbollah \u2014 the Iran-backed militia based in the country \u2014 and Israel.",
      "Despite GDP per capita in the U.S. and Western Europe having continually risen since the mid-2000s, a drop in the happiness of Western democracies \u201ccould be blamed on the feelings of financial insecurity and loneliness experienced by Americans and Europeans \u2014 two symptoms of a damaged social fabric,\u201d the report said.",
      "Declining social trust explains a \u201clarge share\u201d of the rise in political polarization and anti-system votes exemplified by the election of President Donald Trump in the U.S. and Brexit in Britain. The U.K., for instance, came in 20th, marking its lowest reading since 2017.",
      "In a sign of growing loneliness, more Americans are dining solo. About 1 in 4 reported that they ate all their meals alone the previous day \u2014 a 53% increase since 2003.",
      "In the U.S., young adults reported the lowest happiness and social connection of all age groups, researchers said, with loneliness among young people rising globally as well. In 2023, almost 1 in 5 young adults reported having no one for social support.",
      "But the report does include some suggestions about how to promote a more contended society: try having more faith in other people and being nicer to them.",
      "The study found that strangers are actually twice as kind as people expect, with the frequency with which people\u2019s lost wallets were returned to them double the rate at which those surveyed thought.",
      "\u201cThe most heart-warming and important finding from this report is that people are much kinder than we think they are,\u201d Williamson said. \u201cKindness ripples outwards and our expectations about kindness matter.\u201d"

      "Ankara has dramatically curbed civil disobedience since the 2013 nationwide Gezi Park protests against Erdogan\u2019s government prompted a violent state crackdown.",
      "In an interview Thursday, Ozel told Reuters his party would resist but not disrupt public order.",

      "An, who lives in suburban Roslyn Heights, New York, showed up at the home of the target\u2019s son to try to find the father in 2017, the indictment said.",
      "Then, in a series of recorded meetings with the son starting in early 2020, An leaned on him to secure his father\u2019s return to China. An said that he was trying to help the Chinese government communicate with the two, and that he would look good to Chinese officials if he could arrange the father\u2019s return, according to the indictment.",
      "While acknowledging that a Chinese embezzlement case against the father and son was a legally frivolous pressure tactic, An told the son that Chinese officials were monitoring the family\u2019s relatives and would \u201ckeep pestering you\u201d if the father did not return, the indictment said.",
      "\u201cTheir intent is to make your life difficult,\u201d the indictment quotes him as saying.",
      "An even offered to pay back the man\u2019s allegedly ill-gotten gains, according to the indictment, and eventually arranged for a Chinese official to press the man\u2019s son by phone.",
      "In recent years, the U.S. Justice Department has charged dozens of suspects with acts of transnational repression on behalf of China, Iran or other countries. On Thursday, a Manhattan federal jury convicted two men of conspiring to kill Iranian American journalist Masih Alinejad in what U.S. prosecutors claimed was a murder-for-hire plot financed by the Iranian government and foiled when police stopped the intended hit man\u2019s car. Tehran has denied involvement in any schemes to kill people in the U.S.",
      "An was charged in 2020 along with six other people, including his daughter Guangyang An. She is awaiting sentencing after pleading guilty last May. The current status of the other five was not immediately clear.",
      "In a separate case in the same Brooklyn federal courthouse, three men were convicted in 2023 at the first trial surrounding U.S. claims about \u201cOperation Fox Hunt.\u201d Two of those defendants have been sentenced to prison; the third is awaiting sentencing."

      "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 North Korea said Friday that it had test-launched new anti-aircraft missiles, as its military threatened unspecified grave steps against the U.S. and South Korea over their joint military drills that it views as an invasion rehearsal.",
      "The official Korean Central News Agency said that leader Kim Jong Un oversaw the tests Thursday and called the missiles involved \u201canother major defense weapons system\u201d for North Korea.",
      "The missile launches, North Korea\u2019s sixth weapons testing activity this year, occurred on the same day that the U.S. and South Korean militaries concluded their annual Freedom Shield command post exercise. The 11-day training was the allies\u2019 first major joint military exercises since the inauguration of President Donald Trump in January, and the two countries held diverse field training exercises alongside the Freedom Shield drills.",
      "U.S. and South Korean officials describe their combined military drills as defensive in nature, but North Korea slams them as a major security threat. Hours after this year\u2019s Freedom Shield training began on March 10, North Korea fired several ballistic missiles into the sea.",
      "On Friday, the North Korean Defense Ministry alleged that the recent U.S.-South Korean drills involved simulations to destroy underground tunnels in the North to remove its nuclear weapons. An unidentified ministry spokesperson said the U.S. and South Korea would face consequences if they performed similar provocative actions again.",
      "\u201cThe accumulated reckless military moves of the U.S. and the ROK, seized with the daydream that they can jeopardize the sovereignty and security of a nuclear weapons state, can undoubtedly bring the gravest consequences they do not want,\u201d the spokesperson said in a statement carried in KCNA.",
      "ROK is the Republic of Korea, South Korea\u2019s official name.",

      "Trump has said he is willing to reach out to Kim to revive their nuclear diplomacy, but North Korea has not made any public responses to Trump\u2019s overture. Many experts say Kim, now preoccupied with his support of Russia\u2019s war efforts against Ukraine through the supply of troops and conventional weapons, is not likely to embrace Trump\u2019s outreach anytime soon, but could seriously consider it when the war ends.",
      "Kim and Trump met three times in 2018-19 to discuss North Korea\u2019s possible nuclear disarmament, but their diplomacy eventually fell apart due to disputes over U.S.-led economic sanctions on North Korea.",

      "In 2023, when Shoigu, then a defense minister, traveled to North Korea, Kim gave him a personal tour of a North Korean arms exhibition in what outside critics likened to a sales pitch. In September 2024, Shoigu, then with the new security council post, went to North Korea again for a meeting with Kim, and the two discussed expanding cooperation, according to North Korea\u2019s state media."

      "Coventry\u2019s win also was a victory for outgoing IOC president Thomas Bach, who has long been seen as promoting her as his successor. He did not use his right to vote.",

      "A signature Bach policy also has been gender parity, with equal quotas of men and women athletes at the 2024 Paris Olympics and giving a better balance of female members of the IOC and the executive board he chairs, which now has seven women among its 15 members, including Coventry.",

      "Coventry won back-to-back titles in 200-meters backstroke at the 2004 Athens Olympics and Beijing four years later. She joined the IOC in 2013, almost one year after a disputed athlete election at the London Olympics.
