      "LOS ANGELES -- After serving nearly 30 years in prison for killing their parents, the Menendez brothers will plead their case in front of a panel of California state parole board commissioners starting Thursday.",
      "Erik and Lyle Menendez were sentenced in 1996 to life in prison for fatally shooting their father, Jose Menendez, and mother, Kitty Menendez, in their Beverly Hills mansion in August 1989. They were 18 and 21 at the time.",
      "For years after their convictions, the brothers filed petitions for appeals of their cases that were denied. But the brothers became eligible for parole after a Los Angeles judge in May reduced their sentences from life in prison without the possibility of parole to 50 years to life, marking the closest they\u2019ve been to freedom since their convictions.",
      "Even if the board grants their parole, it could still be months before the brothers walk free \u2014 if at all. If the board grants each brother\u2019s parole, the chief legal counsel has 120 days to review the case. Then, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom has 30 days to affirm or deny the parole.",

      "July 1993: The Menendez brothers go on trial, each with a separate jury. Prosecutors argued that they killed their parents for financial gain. The brothers\u2019 attorneys don\u2019t dispute the pair killed their parents, but argued that they acted out of self-defense after years of emotional and sexual abuse by their father.",
      "January 1994: Both juries deadlock.",
      "October 1995: The brothers\u2019 retrial begins, this time with a single jury. Much of the defense evidence about alleged sexual abuse is excluded during the second trial.",

In addition, they submit a letter that Erik wrote to his cousin before the killings about his father\u2019s abuse.",

      "Fandom is a funny thing in the age of social media. Spend enough time scrolling and it\u2019s easy to feel like you really know a celebrity, and all their friends. The new film \u201cLurker,\u201d a Sundance breakout in theaters Friday, explores the question of what might happen if a certain type of fan got a foot in the door, and what they might do to stay there.",
      "Archie Madekwe\u2019s Oliver hardly knows what\u2019s coming when he walks into a trendy Los Angeles clothing shop. A rising music star, Oliver seems already accustomed to a certain amount of attention wherever he goes, with asks for selfies and autographs just part of the deal. So of course he\u2019s taken aback when one of the employees, Th\u00e9odore Pellerin\u2019s Matthew, doesn\u2019t seem to know or care who he is. Oliver doesn\u2019t see that it\u2019s an act and is soon asking this stranger to come around and hang with his entourage.",
      "\u201cAt the beginning Matthew thinks Oliver has this god-given place of celebrity and success,\u201d Pellerin said. \u201cHe quickly understands that he will have to give things to serve a certain purpose in Oliver\u2019s world and his ego. But also that they\u2019re not dissimilar. They\u2019re both playing by a certain rule book that is written by Oliver. If the power becomes Matthew\u2019s, he can also write the rules.\u201d",
      "The film is the directorial debut of Alex Russell, whose own star is rising. He wrote \u201cForks,\u201d widely considered one of the best episodes of \u201cThe Bear,\u201d and won an Emmy for co-executive producing the Netflix series \u201cBeef.\u201d His script for \u201cLurker,\u201d which he wrote sort of as a challenge for himself during COVID lockdowns, immediately became a hot commodity. Madekwe remembers being bummed when he didn\u2019t hear back after he put himself on tape to play the hanger-on.",
      "A few years later, Madekwe\u2019s agent called and said Russell wanted to meet him. Not for Matthew, but for Oliver.",
      "\u201cI had to completely rethink the film and the structure and the what it was about,\u201d Madekwe said. \u201cBut it was most daunting to imagine myself needing to go and meet Alex and convince him that I could play somebody like this cool character.\u201d",
      "He needn\u2019t have been so worried. Unbeknownst to Madekwe, Russell had been doing some stealth behind-the-scenes work. After someone recommended his name, Russell saw Madekwe in a coffee shop one day and just watched him for 20 minutes. His conclusion: This is Oliver.",
      "Russell was cognizant of the limitations he was faced with as a first-time director making an independent film, where things like casting and hiring are often rushed.",
      "\u201cMy goal was to get what I felt like were underrated actors,\u201d Russell said. \u201cPeople who could come in and really hit it out of the park. Then people would look at this movie and be like wow they really took a step up here. That\u2019s kind of where you can punch above your weight if you\u2019re making your first movie and don\u2019t have a huge budget.\u201d",
      "It wasn\u2019t just his leads either, but the full ensemble including Sunny Suljic, Havana Rose Liu, Zack Fox and Daniel Zolghadri \u2014 faces you might recognize, but names you might not yet know. Putting it together was hard work, with strict limits on budget and time, but Russell said the experience of \u201cLurker\u201d was charmed nonetheless.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s only because I got so lucky with decisions I made early on with casting and hiring,\u201d he said. \u201cSo much of it is like I\u2019m just a kid with a screenplay and everyone else has to be really good at their job.\u201d",

      "Often times Russell\u2019s friends in the music world would come around set, giving the off camera times a bit of a meta quality.",
      "\u201cIt didn\u2019t feel a little like the movie sometimes, like just like a group of like young creatives,\u201d Pellerin said. \u201cThere was a real LA film and music scene that was very present. That was helpful for me \u2014 it was like the fun aspect of the movie, not the hard-core humiliation.\u201d",
      "Many involved describe the process as uniquely collaborative. Madekwe also stepped up as a producer, which wasn\u2019t just a vanity title. He was actually involved in many major creative decisions, including recommending Suljic, who he\u2019d just worked with on a music video, and finding locations and some of the music for the film, including a song called \u201cLove and Obsession,\u201d written by Rex Orange County.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an incredibly important film for now,\u201d Madekwe said. \u201cThe relationship that we have with people that we don\u2019t know? I think that conversation is really interesting and exciting. But most importantly, I think it\u2019s really exciting to be at the beginning of Alex Russell\u2019s career and to invest into a filmmaker that I think is gonna be making incredible films for a very long time.\u201d",

      "It'll surely carry weight in modern society, but the phrase is referencing events from nearly a century ago. Based on a true story, \u201cEden\u201d retraces what happened when a group of Europeans attempted to start anew on the remote island of Floreana, only to encounter the earthly failings they hoped to escape: chaos, blackmail, betrayal and even murder.",
      "Howard assembles an impressive cast, though it isn't always enough to make up for the overambitious plot of a film that drags in the middle.",
      "1920s Germany, haunted after accepting blame for World War I, was on the brink of demise, as mass poverty and broad social unrest laid ground for the extremism that birthed the Nazi party.",
      "\u201cEden\u201d shows us none of that, instead dropping us on a small island of the Gal\u00e1pagos, where Dr. Friedrich Ritter ( Jude Law ) and his loyal partner, Dore Strauch Ritter ( Vanessa Kirby ) found solace after fleeing their native country. The idealist doctor is inspired by a newfound purpose of penning radical philosophy that will \u201csave humanity from itself.\u201d",
      "Yet the historical resonance, which could have provided pointed commentary on the parallels between today and the 1920s, falls flat amid the film\u2019s overlong runtime, unlikable characters and shaky accents that most actors stumble in and out of. In the midst of the film\u2019s crafted chaos, the story inevitably loses focus. Still, \u201cEden\u201d made room for some memorable performances.",
      "More adventurists eventually arrive on the island, and just like that, human interaction starts to breed madness.",

      "What results is a cat-and-mouse game between the three groups, ripe with betrayal, distrust and tension. The battle for resources exposes just how much of their morality these people are willing to give up for survival, at least attempting to \u2014 but never fully succeeding \u2014 in addressing the question: When do people bend to human instinct?",
      "The film lacks depth in exploring questions of morality and human nature while depicting Ritter\u2019s lofty goals to save humanity. His philosophy spirals into madness throughout the film, reduced to brief, sometimes painful and surface level sound bites that eventually devolve into incoherent ramblings.",
      "The movie is at its most compelling when its three female actors are on the screen. Different motivations bring them to the island, each of which ultimately centers on the same blind faith in the idea of the masculine leader. They all end up vastly disappointed.",
      "Dore is consumed by an unwavering devotion for Ritter, a man who never lives up to the image she's crafted in her mind. Margaret, having married an older man expecting guidance, is instead forced to build her family's future from the ground up, only to fight tooth and nail to preserve it after her husband nearly destroys them. And the Baroness, who confidently declares herself \u201cthe embodiment of perfection,\u201d oozing with seduction, ultimately crumbles at the rejection of a man.",
      "Arguably, Sweeney \u2014 who is almost unrecognizable as the timid and brunette Margaret \u2014 steals the show. She easily delivers the most impactful scene of the movie, as she was forced to give birth to a baby boy alone in the middle of the desolate island.",
      "It's not hard to guess who won't makes it off the island, either by choice or by force. It is a true story after all. The bloody ending feels unavoidable from the beginning, almost as predictable as human nature itself. But maybe that was the point all along.",

      "\u201cThe phrase, 'With liberty and justice for all' represents the idea that justice should be accessible to everyone. However it is not,\u201d Caprio said in one video. \u201cAlmost 90% of low-income Americans are forced to battle civil issues like health care, unjust evictions, veterans benefits and, yes, even traffic violations, alone.\u201d",
      "Caprio's upbeat take on the job of a judge drew him millions of views. His most popular videos have been those where he calls children to the bench to help pass judgment on their parents. One shows him listening sympathetically to a woman whose son was killed and then dismissing her tickets and fines of $400.",
      "In another clip, after dismissing a red-light violation for a bartender who was making $3.84 per hour, Caprio urged those watching the video not to duck out on their bills.",
      "\u201cIf anyone's watching I want them to know you better not eat and run because you're going to get caught and the poor people who are working hard all day for three bucks an hour are going to have to pay your bill,\" he said.",

      "Prosecutors said in papers filed shortly before midnight Wednesday that Combs masterminded elaborate sexual events for two ex-girlfriends between 2008 and last year that involved hiring male sex workers who sometimes were required to cross multiple state lines to participate.",
      "A jury in July exonerated the Bad Boy Records founder of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking charges that carried the potential penalty of a mandatory 15 years in prison up to life behind bars. But it convicted him of two lesser Mann Act charges that prohibit interstate commerce related to prostitution.",
      "The Mann Act charges each carry a potential penalty of 10 years behind bars. Combs has been denied bail despite his lawyers' arguments that their client should face little to no additional jail time for the convictions. Prosecutors said he must serve multiple years behind bars.",
      "Combs has been in a federal jail in Brooklyn since his September arrest at a Manhattan hotel. Sentencing is scheduled for Oct. 3.",
      "Prosecutors wrote that Combs' attorneys were mistaken when they contended in a submission to the judge late last month that the Mann Act was unduly vague and violates his due process and First Amendment rights.",
      "\u201cEvidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt on the Mann Act counts was overwhelming,\u201d prosecutors wrote.",
      "They noted that the multiday, drug-fueled sexual marathons that Combs demanded of his girlfriends involved hiring male sex workers and facilitating their travel across multiple states for what became known as \u201cfreak-offs\u201d or \u201chotel nights.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors said he then used video recordings he made of the sexual events to threaten and coerce the girlfriends to continue participating in the sometimes weekly or monthly sexual meetings.",
      "\u201cAt trial, there was ample evidence to support the jury\u2019s convictions,\u201d prosecutors said.",
      "They said Combs \u201cmasterminded every aspect\u201d of the sexual meetups, paying escorts to travel across the country to participate and directing the sexual activity that took place between the men and his girlfriends \u201cfor his own sexual gratification\u201d while sometimes joining in.",

She said she participated in hundreds of \u201cfreak-offs.\u201d",
      "A woman who testified under the pseudonym \u201cJane\u201d said she participated in \u201chotel nights\u201d when she dated Combs from 2021 to last September and that the events sometimes lasted multiple days and required her to have sex with male sex workers, even when she was not well.",

      "In their submission requesting acquittal or a new trial, Combs' lawyers argued that none of the elements normally used for Mann Act convictions, including profiting from sex work or coercion, existed.",
      "\u201cIt is undisputed that he had no commercial motive and that all involved were adults,\u201d the lawyers said. \u201cThe men chose to travel and engage in the activity voluntarily. The verdict confirms the women were not vulnerable or exploited or trafficked or sexually assaulted.\u201d",

      "On \u201cBig Money,\u201d Super Bowl-sized singer Jon Batiste opts for a surprisingly intimate sound.",
      "The just over 32-minute, nine-song set will be released Friday, and it\u2019s not nearly as loud as the New Orleans' jazzman's eye-popping wardrobe. The stripped-down, mostly acoustic arrangements create a chill vibe. Simplicity somehow only intensifies the songs\u2019 swing and sway.",
      "Batiste pairs lyrics about devotion, values, angels and ecology with music that mixes folk and funk, gospel and the blues. The range is such that Batiste even plays a little fiddle and mandolin, but he shines brightest on two songs featuring his solo piano.",
      "The first is a wonderful duet with Randy Newman, another piano man with New Orleans roots, who in recent years has been slowed by health issues and kept a low profile. They cover Doc Pomus\u2019 \u201cLonely Avenue,\u201d and Newman\u2019s legendarily froggy tenor provides a comical contrast to Batiste\u2019s vocal sheen. \u201cI could die, I could die, I could die,\u201d Newman sings. \u201cIt sounds like I\u2019m dying.\u201d",
      "Also stellar is \u201cMaybe,\u201d a ballad filled with thick chords and questions about the big picture. \u201cOr maybe we should all just take a collective pause,\u201d Batiste sings, before launching into a keyboard exploration worthy of Jelly Roll Morton.",
      "The bouncy \u201cLean on My Love\u201d draws from Prince, Sly Stone and the Spinners as Batiste sings in unison with Andra Day. The equally buoyant title cut rhymes \u201cmoney\u201d and \u201cdummy\u201d in a strummy sing-along that includes backing vocals by the Womack Sisters, granddaughters of soul singer Sam Cooke.",

      "Their 2020 breakout film, \u201cThe Climb,\u201d begins with two best friends on a bike ride just before Kyle (Marvin) is to be wed. Mid-climb, Mike (Covino) confesses he slept with the bride-to-be. In one long take, an argument on two wheels ensues, with huffing and puffing in between.",
      "Their new follow-up to that film, \u201cSplitsville,\u201d likewise kicks off with heartbreak on the open road. This time, Carey (Marvin), a gym teacher, is driving along a highway with his life coach wife, Ashley (Adria Arjona). They seem happy enough, though there are hints of trouble. When Ashley says she wants to have new experiences, Carey suggests pottery. Ashley corrects him: \u201cI meant sexual.\u201d",

      "Like \u201cThe Climb,\u201d \u201cSplitsville\u201d is a relationship farce that keeps amplifying and recycling. From the scene of the accident, as the credits unspool, Carey trudges seemingly aimless across the countryside. (Splitsville is Nowheresville.) Eventually, though, he arrives at the handsome lakeside home of his childhood best friend, Paul (Covino), who lives there with his wife Julie (Dakota Johnson) and young son Russ (Simon Webster).",
      "Paul and Carey have a close enough relationship that Paul comes right into the shower to check for ticks on Carey. Later that night, he and Julie casually acknowledge that they have an open marriage. Julie, for instance, could sleep with anyone. Even Carey, they note.",

This is \u2014 even here in the low ebb of late summer \u2014 an uncommonly adult farce of infidelity that Cary Grant and Irene Dunne might have chuckled at, even if they didn\u2019t get the \u201cVanilla Sky\u201d reference, the digs about New Balance sneakers or the delight of seeing Nicholas Braun turn up, late in the film, as a mentalist.",
      "I\u2019m convinced, though, that the performer here who would have been most at home in that bygone comedy heyday is Johnson. For the second time this year, following \u201cMateralists,\u201d she finds herself caught between the affections of two men.

      "Jules Witcover, who cowrote one of the nation\u2019s leading political columns for nearly three decades, died Saturday at the age of 98",
      "WASHINGTON -- Jules Witcover, who cowrote one of the nation\u2019s leading political columns for nearly three decades, died Saturday at the age of 98, his daughter Amy Witcover-Sandford said.",
      "Witcover's widely syndicated daily column, written jointly for 24 years with the late Jack Germond, gave him an outlet to register strong opinions, leaving little doubt which politicians he admired or despised. \u201cPolitics Today\u201d began at The Washington Star and then moved to The Baltimore Sun, and he continued writing it solo for another five years at The Sun after his partner retired in 2001.",
      "Witcover also covered the political beat for the Newhouse News Service, The Los Angeles Times and The Washington Post, in books and in several magazines, including The New Republic, Saturday Review and The Nation.",
      "Through his long career, Witcover had a remarkable front seat to history, some of it tragic. He watched Robert F. Kennedy steady first lady Jackie at President John F. Kennedy's grave in 1963. Five years later, in 1968, he pushed his way through a crowded hotel kitchen in Los Angeles after hearing shots and saw Robert F. Kennedy bleeding on the floor. He would later write of RFK's brief presidential campaign in the book \u201c85 Days.\u201d",
      "Witcover described himself and the curmudgeonly Germond as \u201cfriendly rivals laboring for obscure newspaper chains\u201d who enjoyed long, booze-soaked dinners on the campaign trail, a culture that was chronicled in Timothy Crouse\u2019s classic account of reporters covering the 1972 presidential election, \u201cBoys on the Bus.\u201d",
      "When Witcover and Germond began co-writing their column in 1977, \u201cwe often played the good cop/bad cop routine, each of us able to blame the other guy when a column one of us wrote caused a politician to complain. But sometimes, too, one of us would take the bullet for the other when it unjustly came our way. That was the nature of playing duet pianos in the house of ill repute called political writing,\u201d Witcover wrote in The Sun after Germond\u2019s death in 2013.",
      "At its peak, the syndicated column ran five times a week and appeared in about 140 newspapers.",
      "In his final years as a columnist, Witcover relentlessly hammered President George W. Bush over the Iraq war, calling it \u201cthe most wrong-headed foreign policy in my lifetime and the most dangerous.\u201d But he did not blame that view for The Sun\u2019s dropping his column. Editorially, the newspaper also opposed the war, although less vigorously.",
      "\u201cThe war was a colossal mistake from the start and has disintegrated into a calamity, damaging not only the people of Iraq but the international reputation of this country, not to mention the terrible cost in American lives and treasure,\u201d he wrote for the Poynter Institute\u2019s blog.",

      "Witcover was born in Union City, New Jersey, to a Jewish father and Catholic mother. He was raised Catholic and showed an early interest in writing. He wrote in his memoirs that he and a cousin produced a one-page family newspaper on Thanksgiving that they sold for a nickel.",
      "A classmate on his high school basketball team persuaded him to apply to Columbia, which he attended for a semester before joining the Navy. He then re-enrolled in the college after the war ended and obtained a master's degree at Columbia's graduate school of journalism.",
      "Years later, he told a reporter that he thought his ship had come in when a newspaper in the Boston area offered him a starting job covering the Boston Braves in spring training. Before he could get started the team decided to move its franchise to Milwaukee and the opportunity died.",
      "By 1962, 11 years after graduation, he had become a senior correspondent and the chief political writer for the Newhouse News Service.",
      "Witcover lived in Washington with his second wife, Marion Elizabeth Rodgers, a biographer of the journalist H.L. Mencken. His first marriage, of nearly four decades, to Marian Laverty, ended in divorce.",
      "\"Jules was the hardest working newsman I ever knew,\" said Walter Mears, who as the chief political writer for The Associated Press traveled extensively with Witcover. \"On the road, you could hear him banging the typewriter before dawn, working on one of his books. He never stopped writing columns and political histories long after most of us had retired.\"",

      "NEW YORK -- You know the band Devo, right? The guys with the funny red plastic hats and jumpsuits? The New Wave musicians behind the silly \u201cWhip It\u201d video? They had that odd, spiky '80s vibe? Well, it turns out you may not know as much as you think.",
      "The new Netflix documentary \u201cDevo\u201d is an eye-opening examination of an Ohio-born art-rock band that argues they were perhaps the most misunderstood band on the face of the planet. It debuts on the streaming service Tuesday.",
      "\u201cWe were trivialized and pigeonholed,\u201d co-founder Gerald Casale tells The Associated Press. \u201cThis documentary allows us to talk about what we were thinking and what we are motivated by to create what we created.\u201d",
      "Directed by Chris Smith, \u201cDevo\u201d uses archival footage and interviews to trace the band's beginnings, rise and fall, with cameos from fans like David Bowie, Iggy Pop and Neil Young.",
      "Devo introduced themselves to the world in 1977 by making a frenetic version of the Rolling Stones\u2019 \u201cI Can\u2019t Get No) Satisfaction,\u201d which earned them a crucial slot on \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d On stages, they would wriggle like worms or dress like the guys from \u201cGhostbusters.\u201d",
      "They released their Brian Eno-produced debut, \u201cQ: Are We Not Men? A: We Are Devo!,\u201d in 1978 and reached platinum status with 1980\u2019s \u201cFreedom of Choice,\u201d which featured \u201cWhip It,\u201d a hit just as their label was getting ready to drop them.",
      "But behind the odd neck braces and knee pads were powerful art and literary ideas about where the country was going. They named themselves after the idea that modern society was entering a process of \u201cdevolution.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe were seeing a world that was the antitheses of the idealized, promised future ginned up in the \u201950s and \u201960s.\u201d Casale says in the movie. \u201cWhat we saw was regression.\u201d",
      "The nucleus of the band was formed from tragedy: Casale and Mark Mothersbaugh met at Kent State University, where they lived through the 1970 killing of four unarmed anti-war student protesters by the National Guard.",

      "The trial of a man charged with organizing the daytime ambush killing of rapper Young Dolph at a Memphis bakery in 2021 is underway",
      "MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- The trial of a man charged with organizing the daytime ambush killing of rapper Young Dolph at a Memphis bakery in November 2021 began on Monday.",
      "Hernandez Govan, 45, was indicted on first-degree murder, conspiracy to commit first-degree murder and attempted murder charges about a year after Young Dolph was killed. Prosecutors have accused him of organizing the fatal shooting.",
      "Young Dolph, whose legal name was Adolph Thornton Jr., was a rapper, independent label owner and producer who grew up in Memphis and was admired in the city for his charitable works. The 36-year-old was in his hometown to hand out Thanksgiving turkeys to families when his visit to his favorite cookie shop turned into an attack that shocked the entertainment world.",
      "Govan is charged with conspiring with Justin Johnson and Cornelius Smith Jr. to kill Young Dolph.",
      "Johnson was convicted of first-degree murder in September 2024 and the same day, sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole. He was later sentenced for his two other convictions from the trial: conspiracy to commit murder and being a felon in possession of a gun.",
      "During the trial, Smith testified that rapper Yo Gotti\u2019s brother, Anthony \u201cBig Jook\u201d Mims, had put out a $100,000 hit on Young Dolph as well as bounties on all the artists at Young Dolph\u2019s record label, Paper Route Empire. Smith said he and Johnson were \u201clooking for somebody\u201d and \u201cdidn\u2019t know who we were going to catch.\u201d",
      "They knew that Young Dolph and some of the artists on his label were participating in the turkey giveaway, so they were heading in that direction when they saw Young Dolph\u2019s car. They followed him to the cookie shop and opened fire in broad daylight, Smith said. Young Dolph was hit 22 times and died at the scene.",
      "At the earlier trials, prosecutor Paul Hagerman told trial jurors that Cocaine Muzik Group (now known as Collective Music Group), a rival record label founded by Yo Gotti, wanted Young Dolph to work for them, but he turned them down. Young Dolph later wrote diss tracks directed at the label, its artists and its \u201cNo. 2 person,\u201d Big Jook. Big Jook was shot and killed outside a restaurant earlier this year.",
      "Smith testified he received $800 before he was arrested and his defense attorney later received another $50,000.",
      "In addition to Smith\u2019s testimony, prosecutors presented a large amount of circumstantial evidence, including from surveillance cameras and Johnson\u2019s cellphone. The evidence includes calls between Smith and Johnson shortly before the killing and a call between Johnson and Big Jook immediately after.",

      "Margaret Qualley plays a Bakersfield, California, private investigator in Ethan Coen's \u201cHoney Don't.\u201d",
      "The skies are blue, the sun unrelenting and the body count escalating in the Bakersfield, California, of \u201cHoney Don\u2019t!,\u201d where Margaret Qualley\u2019s private investigator tries to get a handle on the nefarious goings-on in her city with a small-town feel.",
      "It\u2019s the second film in Ethan Coen and Tricia Cooke\u2019s so-called \u201clesbian B-movie trilogy,\u201d and while this shaggy caper might not add up to anything significant \u2014 perhaps part of the \u201cB-movie\u201d point \u2014 it is fun and immensely watchable. That\u2019s thanks in large part to Qualley\u2019s turn as the smoothly confident Honey O\u2019Donahue, kind of a Philip Marlowe, or maybe Veronica Mars, in cherry-red lipstick, high heels and silks (inspired choices for the sweltering setting by costume designer Peggy Schnitzer).",
      "Honey is meant to be strikingly \u201cother\u201d in this very downtrodden Bakersfield of eccentrics, dropouts and lost souls, where missing teeth seem to be more prevalent than pedicures. It\u2019s a carnival of very memorable, very Coen-esque misfits, like a grumpy bartender played by Don Swayze and Charlie Day\u2019s clueless police officer Marty Metakawitch. Marty is not the only man in town who has trouble accepting that Honey will never be interested in him. You could play a drinking game with how many times she has to tell hapless men, \u201cI like girls.\u201d",
      "Not only is queer literacy low in this Bakersfield, but many in town seem to have come under the influence of a church leader played by Chris Evans, the Rev. Drew Devlin, whose high-wattage smile and proclivity for flirting have made him a local celebrity. Evans, who seems to be having fun in a weirder role, plays the Rev. Drew as a charismatic creep, an ego-driven and possibly sex-addicted influencer who is also peddling drugs and arranging hits around town. He too has a boss, or bosses, known only as \u201cthe French,\u201d which is amusingly underexplained. And he\u2019s often completely, or nearly, naked and involved in some cringey, experimental acts with his naive followers.",
      "Not unlike the new \u201cThe Naked Gun,\u201d this saga begins with a suspicious vehicular death. The deceased was an almost-client of Honey\u2019s, which sets her off poking around and looking for answers. Most of her cases are of the cheating spouse type, and this is just more interesting. Meanwhile, others start dropping dead too. Some of these deaths feel spiritually, comedically similar to the Mark Pellegrino sequence in \u201cMullholland Drive\u201d (not the only Lynchian nod). And all signs are pointing back to the church, though Honey gets a bit distracted with a new fling in Aubrey Plaza\u2019s lustful cop MG Falcone and some family drama with her wayward niece Corinne (Talia Ryder).",
      "\u201cHoney Don\u2019t\u201d might play more like a pilot episode of a television series than a contained film, but it is a step up from Coen and Cooke's previous effort, \u201cDrive Away Dolls,\u201d which felt constructed of comedic parts whose shelf life expired 20 years ago. This script, written by Coen and Cooke, is probably just as vintage, technically speaking, but it feels more timeless. With a stable of memorable side characters, including Josh Pafchek as the reverend's assistant and Jacnier as a skittish new drug dealer named Hector, \u201cHoney Don\u2019t\u201d is gory, unapologetically sexual, quippy and dark. It also clocks in at under 90 minutes \u2014 they knew just when to get out.",

      "Swiss medical regulators have approved a new malaria treatment for infants, offering hope to many in Africa",
      "KAMPALA, Uganda -- Alice Nekesa did not know she was infected with malaria-causing parasites until it was too late. She was in the fourth month of pregnancy last year when she started bleeding, a miscarriage later attributed to untreated malaria in her.",
      "The Ugandan farmer said recently that she regretted the loss of what would have been her second child \u201cbecause I didn\u2019t discover malaria and treat it early.\u201d",
      "Variations of such cases are commonly reported by Ugandan health workers who witness stillbirths or feverish babies that die within days from undiagnosed malaria. The deaths are part of a wider death toll tied to the mosquito-borne disease, the deadliest across Africa, but one easily treated in adults who seek timely medical care.",
      "Until recently, a major gap in malaria treatment was how to care for newborns and infants infected with malaria who weren\u2019t strong enough to receive regular medication. That changed last month when Swiss medical regulators approved medicine from the Basel-based pharmaceutical company Novartis for babies weighing between 2 and 5 kilograms (nearly 4\u00bd to 11 pounds).",
      "Swissmedic said the treatment, a sweet-tasting tablet that disperses into a syrup when dropped into water, was approved in coordination with the World Health Organization under a fast-track authorization process to help developing countries access much-needed treatment.",
      "Africa\u2019s 1.5 billion people accounted for 95% of an estimated 597,000 malaria deaths worldwide in 2023, according to the WHO. More than three-quarters of those deaths were among children.",

      "Nigeria, Congo and Uganda \u2014 in that order \u2014 are the African countries most burdened by malaria, a parasitic disease transmitted to humans through the bites of infected mosquitoes that thrive and breed in stagnant water.",
      "The drug approved by Swiss authorities, known as Coartem Baby in some countries and Riamet Baby in others, is a combination of two antimalarials. It is a lower dose version of a tablet previously approved for other age groups, including for older children. Before Coartem Baby, antimalarial drugs designed for older children were administered to small infants with careful adjustments to avoid overdose or toxicity.",
      "Ugandan authorities, who have been working to update clinical guidelines for treating malaria, say the new drug will be rolled out as soon as possible. It is not yet available in public hospitals.",

      "Ronald Serufusa, the top malaria official for the district of Wakiso, which shares a border with the Ugandan capital of Kampala, said he believes Coartem Baby will be available \u201cvery, very soon\u201d and that one priority is sensitizing the people adhering to treatment.",

      "TALATAN, China -- Chinese government officials last month showed off what they say will be the world's largest solar farm when completed high on a Tibetan plateau. It will cover 610 square kilometers (235 square miles), which is the size of Chicago.",
      "China has been installing solar panels far faster than anywhere else in the world, and the investment is starting to pay off. A study released Thursday found that the country's carbon emissions edged down 1% in the first six months of 2025 compared to a year earlier, extending a trend that began in March 2024.",
      "The good news is China's carbon emissions may have peaked well ahead of a government target of doing so before 2030. But China, the world's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, will need to bring them down much more sharply to play its part in slowing global climate change.",
      "For China to reach its declared goal of carbon neutrality by 2060, emissions would need to fall 3% on average over the next 35 years, said Lauri Myllyvirta, the Finland-based author of the study and lead analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air.",
      "\u201cChina needs to get to that 3% territory as soon as possible,\u201d he said.",
      "China's emissions have fallen before during economic slowdowns. What's different this time is electricity demand is growing \u2014 up 3.7% in the first half of this year \u2014 but the increase in power from solar, wind and nuclear has easily outpaced that, according to Myllyvirta, who analyzes the most recent data in a study published on the U.K.-based Carbon Brief website.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re talking really for the first time about a structural declining trend in China\u2019s emissions,\u201d he said.",
      "China installed 212 gigawatts of solar capacity in the first six months of the year, more than America's entire capacity of 178 gigawatts as of the end of 2024, the study said. Electricity from solar has overtaken hydropower in China and is poised to surpass wind this year to become the country's largest source of clean energy. Some 51 gigawatts of wind power was added from January to June.",
      "Li Shuo, the director of the China Climate Hub at the Asia Society Policy Institute in Washington, described the plateauing of China's carbon emissions as a turning point in the effort to combat climate change.",
      "\u201cThis is a moment of global significance, offering a rare glimmer of hope in an otherwise bleak climate landscape,\u201d he wrote in an email response. It also shows that a country can cut emissions while still growing economically, he said.",
      "But Li cautioned that China's heavy reliance on coal remains a serious threat to progress on climate and said the economy needs to shift to less resource-intensive sectors. \u201cThere's still a long road ahead,\u201d he said.",

It poses a growing public health threat and is increasingly contributing to overdose deaths, the attorneys general said in a letter dated Monday to DEA Administrator Terry Cole.",

    "story": [
      "Global talks to slash plastic production and the toxic chemicals used to produce plastic products fell apart in Geneva this week",
      "Talks aimed at a global treaty to cut plastic pollution fizzled in Geneva this week, with no agreement to meaningfully reduce the harms to human health and the environment that come with the millions of tons of plastic water bottles, food containers and packaging produced today.",
      "Though as many as 100 countries sought caps on production, powerful oil-producing nations like Saudi Arabia and the United States stood against them. They argued the caps were unnecessary and a threat to their economies and industries.",
      "That means any progress continues to depend on efforts to improve recycling, reuse and product design \u2014 the very things that powerful nations argued were sufficient to address the problem without resorting to production cuts.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about how successful those efforts have been.",
      "The world makes more than 400 million tons of new plastic each year, and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development estimates that could increase by about 70% by 2040 without meaningful change. A great deal of that ends up in landfills or, worse, the environment.",
      "Pollution isn't the only problem. Plastics, made almost entirely from fossil fuels, are a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. Plastics generated 3.4% \u2014 or 1.8 billion tons \u2014 of planet-warming emissions across the globe in 2019, the United Nations says.",
      "Not very.",
      "It's notoriously difficult to recycle plastics; only 6% of what's made gets recycled, according to the OECD. That's largely because different kinds of plastic cannot be recycled together. They have different chemical compositions, making it costly and time-consuming, and requiring a lot of manual sorting.",
      "\u201cThere are many different colors of plastics, many different types of plastics called polymers, and 16,000 to 17,000 different chemicals used to make plastics, so by design, plastics are not easily recyclable,\" said Judith Enck, president of Beyond Plastics, an organization that works to cut plastic pollution.",
      "Experts say plastic is different from materials like paper, cardboard, metal and glass, which all get reused at much higher rates. The Environmental Protection Agency estimates glass recycling at about 31%, and things like steel cans at about 71%. As much as 64% of paper and 74% of cardboard get recycled, according to the American Forest & Paper Association.",
      "But \u201cIf you just think of your own home or apartment, you might have a bright orange hard plastic detergent container on top of your washing machine, and then you might have a plastic bag,\u201d Enck said. \u201cThose two things cannot get recycled together.\"",
      "The plastics industry says innovations in material science are helping to incorporate more recycled plastics into products and enable more plastic products to be recyclable. Ross Eisenberg, president of America\u2019s Plastic Makers, noted the need for an \u201call-of-the-above approach.\u201d",
      "He said this also includes upgrading recycling infrastructure or improving sorting to capture more used plastics. This also means making recycling more accessible and helping consumers know what can and can\u2019t go in the recycling bin.",
      "But there are a lot of limitations to this.",
      "Depending on consumers for accurate pre-sorting is a lot to ask. And cities may hesitate to make costly infrastructure improvements to their recycling programs if there is little financial incentive or market for the recycled material.",
      "\"Local recycling facilities, or markets for the recycled material, don\u2019t always exist. Where the collection and processing infrastructure does exist, the recycling plants are essentially plastic production facilities, with the same air, water, and soil pollution problems that are harmful to local residents,\" said Holly Kaufman, director of The Plastics & Climate Project and senior fellow at World Resources Institute.",

      "California is currently suing oil and gas giant Exxon Mobil, alleging deception about the possibilities of plastic recycling.",
      "Because of this, Kaufman says, \u201cThe aim should be to significantly reduce plastic production, use, and waste, not recycle more.\u201d",
      "\u201cReuse means creating packaging or products designed to be used multiple times, like refillable containers, or more durable zippered bags that can be washed and refilled many times, extending their lifespan and reducing waste,\u201d Eisenberg, of America's Plastic Makers, said.",
      "Experts say reuse is extremely important, but reusable products shouldn\u2019t necessarily be used for consumables because of the risk of microplastics.",
      "Redesigning plastic often means making it easier to recycle. That can be using one material in packaging instead of several, or printing labels directly onto a container rather than using a separate one that is glued on, but that is more complex.",
      "Alternatives to plastics could also be made out of sustainable, less harmful and even regenerative materials, such as seaweed, Kaufman said. There has been progress on this front, but most solutions have not scaled up yet.",

      "Rastafarians in Kenya have celebrated the opening of a new place of worship near Nairobi",
      "NAIROBI, Kenya -- At a recent opening of the newest Rastafari place of worship just outside Kenya\u2019s capital, some of the faithful gathered to sing rhythmic songs, read Scripture and exchange teachings on the appropriate way to live.",
      "The rare event \u2014 opening a tabernacle made of wooden poles and roofed with iron sheets \u2014 illustrated the community\u2019s expanding ranks in a country where until recently Rastafari was not considered a legitimate religion.",
      "Things changed in 2019 with a court ruling in favor of a petitioner who cited discrimination when her school demanded that she cut her dreadlocks, often preferred by those who follow the Rastafari religion.",
      "The student\u2019s refusal to cut her locks had resulted in her expulsion from school, but the High Court ruled Rastafari was a legitimate religion that should be protected, a ruling later affirmed by the Supreme Court.",
      "Across the world, the faithful are known as Rastafarians, members of the movement launched in 1930 with the coronation in Ethiopia of Ras Tafari Mekonnen as Emperor Haile Selassie I. Rastafarians believe Selassie was the final incarnation of the biblical Jesus, and during his reign many Rastafarians made pilgrimage to the Horn of Africa nation. For Rastafarians, Ethiopia was a symbol of pride for its unbroken resistance to colonizers and Selassie was Jah, the deity.",
      "Selassie was removed from power in a 1974 coup by a military junta. He died a year later. But the movement inspired by his rise to power in Ethiopia survives in countries ranging from the United States to Ghana.",
      "It is unclear how many people identify as Rastafari in Kenya, a country dominated by Christians and Muslims. At least 30 Rastafarians came to the tabernacle opening in Ruai, some 25 kilometers (15 miles) east of Nairobi, last month.",
      "In Kenya, the movement is set up under three \u201cmansions\u201d or branches: Nyabinghi, Bobo Ashanti and The Twelve tribes of Israel. The \u201cmansions\u201d represent small groups of Rastafarians who meet to worship together. Unlike traditional places of worship that are housed in architect-designed permanent structures, a Rastafari tabernacle is built with wooden poles, roofed with iron sheets and decorated in the unmistakable Rastafari colors of red, yellow and green.",
      "Rastafarians around the world have a reputation for their unique Afrocentric spirituality, and they are generally known to be peace advocates. They oppose oppression and gravitate to music and art. The Jamaican reggae singer Bob Marley was a famous Rastafari.",
      "There are challenges, including those that stem from misunderstandings about the religion. Across East Africa, Rastafarians are often stereotyped as lazy and indulging in prohibited substances like marijuana. Known to Rastafarians as ganja, marijuana is an important item in religious ceremonies.",
      "The community has been growing in Kenya, attracting mostly young people.",
      "Ng\u2019ang\u2019a Njuguna, a Rastafari elder in the Nyabinghi mansion of Kenya, describes Rastafari as not just a religion but a way of life.",
      "\u201cIt is a spiritual way of life,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is why we connect with nature, we connect with animals, we connect with every living being because Rastafari is all about the spiritual world.\u201d",

      "Christine Wanjiru, a 58-year-old who became a Rastafarian in 1994, making her one of the oldest members of her community, recalled that being one once was difficult as it often attracted discrimination and stigma.",

      "CAIRO -- When Ahlam Saeed awoke last month to the sound of gunfire and roaring vehicle motors, the 43-year-old widow rushed outside her home in war-torn Sudan to find a line of at least two dozen vehicles, many of them motorcycles carrying armed fighters.",
      "\u201cThey were firing at everything and in every direction,\u201d the mother of four said. \u201cIn an instant, all of us in the village were fleeing for safety.\" Many people were gunned down in their houses or while trying to flee.

      "Saeed and her children \u2014 ages 9 to 15 \u2014 were among those who survived after rebel fighters rampaged through Shag al-Num, the small farming village of several thousand people in Sudan\u2019s Kordofan region. In interviews with The Associated Press, Saeed and four other villagers described the July 12 attack, one of the deadliest assaults since the war began more than two years ago over a power struggle between commanders of the military and the rival paramilitary group known as the Rapid Support Forces, or RSF.",
      "The villagers' accounts add to the devastating toll of the conflict, which started in April 2023 and has wrecked the country in northeastern African. The fighting has killed more than 40,000 people, displaced as many as 14 million, caused disease outbreaks and pushed many places to the brink of famine.",

      "The villagers from Shag al-Num said RSF fighters and their allied Janjaweed militias stormed into the community, looting houses and robbing residents, especially of women\u2019s gold. Some victims were held at gunpoint.",
      "Some young villagers attempted to fight back by taking up rifles to defend their homes. The RSF fighters knocked them down and continued their rampage, witnesses said.",
      "\u201cIt was as if the hell\u2019s door was opened,\u201d Saeed said, sobbing. Her straw house and neighboring homes were burned down, and one RSF fighter seized her necklace. \u201cWe were dying of fear,\u201d she said.",

He has now been indicted on charges of supporting a foreign terrorist organization, attempted membership in such a group, and preparing a serious act of violence.",
      "Federal prosecutors said in a statement that the suspect initially planned to carry out an attack in Germany, possibly on the Israeli Embassy. He allegedly found instructions for making explosives on the internet but was unable to pursue the plan because he couldn't get a hold of the necessary components.",
      "At the same time, the suspect was allegedly translating propaganda into Russian and Chechen for IS. Prosecutors said he intended to join the group in Pakistan and get military training, and that he financed the trip by taking out two contracts for expensive smartphones, which he then sold.",

      "JERUSALEM -- U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee sought Wednesday to blame a recent breakdown in Gaza ceasefire talks on the decision by some European leaders to recognize Palestinian statehood.",
      "Talks over a lasting ceasefire have repeatedly stalled since the early months of the war sparked by Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023, attack \u2014 and long before there was any talk of major European states recognizing Palestinian statehood.",
      "The decisions were announced by France, Britain and other countries after the Trump administration\u2019s Mideast envoy had already walked away in frustration from the negotiations, which happened behind closed doors. It's unclear how and when they began to break down.",
      "But Huckabee's remarks in an interview with The Associated Press point to a sharp divide among Western nations about how to approach the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and the rift has only deepened since President Donald Trump took office.",
      "Many European countries have sought to pressure Israel \u2014 the stronger party \u2014 and frame the pursuit of a two-state solution as a way to address the root causes of a conflict that long predates the war in Gaza. But the Trump administration has given Israel wide latitude to end the war on its terms.",
      "The White House fully supported Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s decision to end an earlier ceasefire that Trump had helped broker and resume wide-ranging military operations, during which Israel prevented food, medicine and other goods from entering Gaza for more than two months.",
      "Trump appears to have adopted Israel\u2019s position that further military pressure \u2014 including a planned offensive into some of the most densely populated areas of Gaza \u2014 will force Hamas to surrender.",
      "\u201cWe will only see the return of the remaining hostages when Hamas is confronted and destroyed!!!\u201d Trump posted this week on his Truth Social site.",
      "Meanwhile, France, Britain and more than two dozen other Western-aligned nations have expressed mounting outrage at Israel\u2019s actions, demanding that it halt the fighting and do more to facilitate humanitarian aid. The moves to recognize Palestinians statehood \u2014 which were largely symbolic \u2014 were in part aimed at pressuring Israel to halt its offensive.",
      "Britain explicitly linked the two, saying it would hold off on recognizing a Palestinian state if Israel agreed to a ceasefire in Gaza, stopped building settlements in the West Bank and committed to a two-state solution.",
      "Israel's current government and most of its political class were opposed to Palestinian statehood even before the war, and they now say it would reward Hamas and allow the militants to eventually carry out more Oct. 7-style attacks.",
      "Huckabee, who is himself a longtime opponent of Palestinian statehood, said the \u201cnoise that has been made by European leaders recently ... is having the counterproductive effect that they probably think that they want.\"",
      "\u201cIf they believe that unilaterally calling for a two-state, a Palestinian state recognition, immediately brings them closer, the sad truth is it\u2019s taking them further away,\u201d he said.",

      "New Zealand's government has announced new military spending of $1.6 billion to replace aging aircraft, including helicopters from the United States",
      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) \u2014 New Zealand 's government announced new military spending Thursday of 2.7 billion New Zealand dollars ($1.6 billion) to replace aging aircraft, including helicopters it plans to purchase from the United States, senior officials said.",
      "Cabinet ministers unveiling the package cited rapidly growing global tensions and a deteriorating security environment. New Zealand\u2019s military spending has trailed that of its larger partners in the Five Eyes intelligence sharing group of countries \u2014 which includes the United States, Britain, Canada and Australia \u2014 and the bolstered budget reflects a shift in how the remote island nation is responding to strategic competition among major powers in the Pacific Ocean.",
      "\u201cWe face the most challenging strategic circumstances in New Zealand\u2019s modern history and certainly the worst that anyone today working in politics or foreign affairs can remember,\u201d Foreign Minister Winston Peters, who entered Parliament in 1979, told reporters.",
      "The purchase of military planes and helicopters was the first procurement announced in a government plan, disclosed in April, to double defense spending from 1% to 2% of GDP in the next decade.",
      "The package includes five MH-60R Seahawk helicopters to replace the existing maritime fleet and two Airbus A321XLR aircraft, allowing the retirement of Boeing 757s that are more than 30 years old and were already secondhand when purchased. The helicopters accounted for more than NZ $2 billion of the spending, officials said.",
      "Defense Minister Judith Collins said her government would \u201cmove at pace\u201d to procure the helicopters directly through the United States' foreign military sales program instead of going to a wider tender. Cabinet ministers were expected to consider the final business case in 2026, she told reporters in Wellington on Thursday.",
      "It would take \u201ca few years\u201d to acquire the helicopters, Collins added, because buying new meant New Zealand would need to \u201cwait in line.\u201d She denied the choice to buy from the United States was an attempt to rectify the trade imbalance that has seen New Zealand goods targeted for an adjusted 15% levy when arriving in the U.S. under the Trump administration's global tariffs plan.",

      "The leaders of New Zealand and neighboring Australia this month pledged closer military ties as they are increasingly confronted by great power competition, particularly the rise of China's influence, in the South Pacific Ocean. The region was once neglected by other Western nations, an attitude that has reversed sharply in recent years as the extent of Beijing's attempts to vie for sway with Pacific leaders has become more apparent.",
      "That's proved a challenge for leaders in New Zealand, where use of military ships and aircraft has often been primarily in humanitarian and disaster situations. It has also required a fresh sales pitch on military budgets to a country of 5 million people where the need for defense spending in a remote country with few enemies has traditionally been a difficult sell.",

      "A New Zealand soldier, who pleaded guilty to attempted espionage, has been sentenced Wednesday to two years in military prison followed by discharge from the army",
      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- A New Zealand soldier, who admitted trying to spy for a foreign power, was sentenced to two years in military prison followed by discharge from the army.",
      "The sentencing by a judge and a panel of three senior military officers Wednesday came two days after the man pleaded guilty to three charges, including attempted espionage. It was the first conviction for spying in New Zealand\u2019s history.",
      "The soldier's name was suppressed, as was the name of the country he sought to pass secrets to.",
      "Military court documents said the man believed he was engaged with a foreign agent in 2019 when he tried to communicate military information, including base telephone directories and maps, assessments of security weaknesses, his own identity card and log-in details for a military network. The wording of the charge said his actions were \u201clikely to prejudice the security or defense of New Zealand.\u201d",
      "The soldier wasn\u2019t speaking to a foreign agent, but rather an undercover New Zealand police officer collecting intelligence on alleged right-wing extremist groups, documents supplied by the military court showed.",
      "Judge Kevin Riordan said the espionage attempts were unsophisticated, unlikely to cause harm and naive, but his actions were still serious.",
      "\u201cThere is no such thing as a non-serious act of espionage,\" Riordan said, according to Radio New Zealand. \"There is no trivial act of espionage.\u201d",
      "The soldier came to the attention of law enforcement as part of an operation that was established after a March 2019 terrorist attack on two mosques in the city of Christchurch, when an Australian white supremacist opened fire on Muslim worshipers, killing 51.",
      "Officers spoke to the man twice about his involvement in a group, court documents showed, and after the government became aware he had expressed a desire to defect he was contacted by the undercover officer.",

      "In a statement read to the court by his lawyer, the man said the two nationalist groups with which he was involved were \u201cno more than groups of friends with similar points of view to my own,\u201d according to RNZ. The lawyer, Steve Winter, added that his client denied supporting the Christchurch shooter\u2019s ideology.",
      "The soldier, who was based at Linton Military Camp near the city of Palmerston North, also pleaded guilty to accessing a military computer system for dishonest purposes. The amended suite of three charges replaced 17 counts levelled against him earlier in the proceedings.",
      "New Zealand's Army Chief Maj. Gen. Rose King said there was no place for people like the soldier in the country's military.",
      "\u201cThe actions of this individual were deplorable,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cThey were incredibly poorly judged and brought risk to all of those he served alongside, as well as the wider New Zealand public.\u201d",
      "The three charges carried maximum prison terms varying from seven to 10 years in New Zealand. He had been due to stand trial by court-martial before he admitted the offenses.",
      "His was the first charge in a New Zealand military court for espionage or attempted spying. The last time such a case reached the civilian courts was in 1975, when a public servant was acquitted on charges alleging he had passed information to Russian agents.",

      "Swiss medical regulators have approved a new malaria treatment for infants, offering hope to many in Africa",
      "KAMPALA, Uganda -- Alice Nekesa did not know she was infected with malaria-causing parasites until it was too late. She was in the fourth month of pregnancy last year when she started bleeding, a miscarriage later attributed to untreated malaria in her.",
      "The Ugandan farmer said recently that she regretted the loss of what would have been her second child \u201cbecause I didn\u2019t discover malaria and treat it early.\u201d",
      "Variations of such cases are commonly reported by Ugandan health workers who witness stillbirths or feverish babies that die within days from undiagnosed malaria. The deaths are part of a wider death toll tied to the mosquito-borne disease, the deadliest across Africa, but one easily treated in adults who seek timely medical care.",
      "Until recently, a major gap in malaria treatment was how to care for newborns and infants infected with malaria who weren\u2019t strong enough to receive regular medication. That changed last month when Swiss medical regulators approved medicine from the Basel-based pharmaceutical company Novartis for babies weighing between 2 and 5 kilograms (nearly 4\u00bd to 11 pounds).",
      "Swissmedic said the treatment, a sweet-tasting tablet that disperses into a syrup when dropped into water, was approved in coordination with the World Health Organization under a fast-track authorization process to help developing countries access much-needed treatment.",
      "Africa\u2019s 1.5 billion people accounted for 95% of an estimated 597,000 malaria deaths worldwide in 2023, according to the WHO. More than three-quarters of those deaths were among children.",
      "In Uganda, an east African country of 45 million people, there were 12.6 million malaria cases and nearly 16,000 deaths in 2023. Many were children younger than 5 and pregnant women, according to WHO.",
      "Nigeria, Congo and Uganda \u2014 in that order \u2014 are the African countries most burdened by malaria, a parasitic disease transmitted to humans through the bites of infected mosquitoes that thrive and breed in stagnant water.",
      "The drug approved by Swiss authorities, known as Coartem Baby in some countries and Riamet Baby in others, is a combination of two antimalarials. It is a lower dose version of a tablet previously approved for other age groups, including for older children. Before Coartem Baby, antimalarial drugs designed for older children were administered to small infants with careful adjustments to avoid overdose or toxicity.",
      "Ugandan authorities, who have been working to update clinical guidelines for treating malaria, say the new drug will be rolled out as soon as possible. It is not yet available in public hospitals.",
      "The development of Coartem Baby has given hope to many, with local health workers and others saying the medicine will save the lives of many infants.",
      "Ronald Serufusa, the top malaria official for the district of Wakiso, which shares a border with the Ugandan capital of Kampala, said he believes Coartem Baby will be available \u201cvery, very soon\u201d and that one priority is sensitizing the people adhering to treatment.",

      "In a Wednesday complaint, the FTC accused Fitness International and its subsidiary Fitness & Sports Clubs of illegally charging consumers \u201chundreds of millions of dollars in unwanted recurring fees\u201d as a result of cumbersome cancellation processes. The agency said that tens of thousands of customers have reported difficulties with these policies to date.",
      "\u201cThe FTC\u2019s complaint describes a scenario that too many Americans have experienced \u2014 a gym membership that seems impossible to cancel,\u201d Christopher Mufarrige, director of the agency\u2019s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said in a statement.",
      "Beyond LA Fitness, California-based Fitness International operates brands like Esporta Fitness, City Sports Club, and Club Studio \u2014 spanning across more than 600 locations with over 3.7 million members nationwide. And the FTC pointed to two \u201cunfair and unlawful\u201d cancellation processes that it says these gyms have used for years: in-person cancellation or cancellation by mail.",
      "Both of these options require consumers to print out a form on the gym\u2019s website, which includes logging in with credentials that the agency says some customers don\u2019t have or remember. And if a customer opts for in-person cancellation, there\u2019s limited hours and often difficulty finding a manager to process the forms, the complaint notes \u2014 while mailing the form comes with additional costs.",
      "\u201cEach of these cancellation methods is opaque, complicated, and demanding \u2014 far from simple,\u201d the FTC writes in its complaint. It also alleges that the company doesn\u2019t adequately disclose cancellation offerings when consumers sign up for memberships, and that some will be signed up for additional services with recurring charges without realizing there may be different cancellation requirements.",

      "The moment was especially gratifying for the woman in charge of manufacturing the drones that flew more than 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) to carry out this mission. For months after, Russia no longer had the means to keep up devastating glide bomb attacks like the one that had just targeted her native city of Kharkiv.",

      "Like most defense companies in Ukraine, Fire Point grew out of necessity after Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022. Despite pleas from Ukrainian military officials, Western countries were unwilling to allow Kyiv to use their allies' longer-range weapons to strike targets deep inside Russian territory.",

Their long-range drones had another benefit: they did not need to take off from an air field.",

      "\u201cI think the best drones, or among the best, are Ukrainian drones,\" said Claude Chenuil, a former French military official who now works for a trade group that focuses on defense. \u201cWhen the war in Ukraine ends, they will flood the market.\u201d",
      "Fire Point\u2019s story is not entirely unique. Soon after Russia's 2022 invasion, hundreds of defense companies sprouted almost overnight. The Ukrainian government incentivized innovation by relaxing regulations and making it easier for startups to work directly with military brigades.",
      "Patriotic entrepreneurs in metallurgy, construction and information technology built facilities for researching and making weapons and munitions, with an emphasis on drones. The ongoing war allowed them to test out ideas almost immediately on the battlefield, and to quickly adapt to Russia\u2019s changing tactics.",
      "\u201cUkraine is in this very unique moment now where it is becoming, de facto, the Silicon Valley of defense,\u201d said Ukrainian defense entrepreneur Yaroslav Azhnyuk. \u201cThe biggest strategic asset that we have is that we have been at war with Russia for 11 years.\u201d",
      "A case in point: Fire Point had initially sourced navigational equipment for its drones from a major Western firm, but before long Russia was able to disrupt their effectiveness using electronic warfare; so Fire Point developed its own software to outwit the enemy.",
      "Because defense companies are high-value targets for Russia, many operate underground or hidden within civilian centers to evade detection. Although they are guarded by air defenses, the strategy has the disadvantage of putting civilians at risk. Many Ukrainians have died in imprecise Russian attacks that were likely targeting weapons facilities. Entrepreneurs said the alternative is to operate openly and face attacks that would set back the war effort.",
      "On the day AP reporters visited the Fire Point factory, there were dozens of drones awaiting delivery. They would all be gone within 72 hours, shipped to the battlefield in inconspicuous cargo trucks.",
      "The Fire Point team receives regular feedback from army units, and the company has reinvested most profits toward innovating quickly to keep pace with other drone makers. Increasingly, those profits are being directed to develop a new, more potent weapon.",
      "The company completed testing this year for its first cruise missile, the FP-5. Capable of traveling 3,000 kilometers (1,864 miles) and landing within 14 meters (45 feet) of its target, the FP-5 is one of the largest such missile in the world, delivering a payload of 1,150 kilograms (2,535 pounds), independent experts said. Because initial versions of the missile came out pink after a factory error, they called it the Flamingo \u2014 and the name has stuck.",
      "Fire Point is producing roughly one Flamingo per day, and by October they hope to build capacity to make seven per day, Terekh said.",
      "Even as Zelenskyy and other Ukrainian officials pursue ways to end the war, Terekh said she is skeptical that Russia will accept terms for a real peace. \u201cWe are preparing for a bigger, much scarier war.\u201d",

      "Walmart is reporting higher profits and sales as it pulls in shoppers seeking low prices for groceries and other essentials",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Walmart Inc. reported increases in second-quarter profits and sales Thursday as it pulls in shoppers seeking low prices for groceries and other essentials to offset worries that new U.S. tariffs may make a variety of goods more expensive.",
      "The nation\u2019s largest retailer also increased its annual profit and sales outlook. Quarterly results from Walmart and other major U.S. retailers this week offer clues on how consumers are reacting to the possibility of tariff-related price increases.",
      "The company, based in Bentonville, Arkansas, said it earned $7.03 billion, or 88 cents per share, for the three-month period that ended ended July 31. That compares with $4.50 billion, or 56 cents per share, a year ago.",
      "Sales rose nearly 5% to $177.4 billion.",
      "A growing list of companies, including Procter & Gamble, E.lf. Cosmetics, Black & Decker and Ralph Lauren, told investors in recent weeks that they planned to or already had raised prices because of tariffs, though modestly.",
      "None of that has derailed consumer spending. Shoppers spent at a healthy pace in July, particularly at the nation\u2019s auto dealerships, as signs emerged that President Donald Trump\u2019s trade policies were taking a toll on jobs.",

      "On Tuesday, Home Depot, the nation\u2019s largest home improvement retailer, reported improved sales during its latest quarter as consumers remained focused on smaller projects. Like Walmart, Home Depot's performance missed Wall Street\u2019s expectations.",

      "Target, which has been struggling to reverse a persistent sales malaise, reported another quartely decline in comparable sales and said Wednesday that it would only raise prices as a last resort. Chief Commercial Officer Rick Gomez said shoppers are looking for value and so the discounter would focus more on its store label brands, which tend to be less expensive than national labels.",
      "But it\u2019s Walmart that serves as a barometer of spending given its outsized power in American retailing. The company maintains that 90% of U.S. households rely on Walmart for a range of products, and more than 150 million customers shop on its website or in its stores every week.",

    "story": [
      "Both Wall Street and the White House will be paying close attention to Fed Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s high-profile speech Friday at the Fed\u2019s annual economic symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming",
      "WASHINGTON -- Just three weeks ago, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell spoke to reporters after the central bank had kept its key interest rate unchanged for a fifth straight meeting and said the job market was \u201csolid.\u201d",
      "His assessment was important because if the job market is healthy, there is less need for the Fed to cut its key interest rate, as President Donald Trump has demanded. Two days later, the Labor Department issued a report that cast doubt on that assessment, showing hiring was weak in July and much lower than previously estimated in May and June.",
      "So, there will be a lot of attention paid by Wall Street and the White House to Powell's high-profile speech Friday at the Fed's annual economic symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. If the famously data-dependent Powell shifts gears and takes a gloomier view of the job market, that could open the door for a rate cut at the Fed's next meeting in September.",
      "Powell could also stick to the cautious approach he's maintained all year and reiterate that the central bank needs more time to evaluate the impact of Trump's sweeping tariffs on inflation.",
      "Most economists expect Powell to signal that a rate cut is likely this year, but won\u2019t necessarily commit to one next month. That could disappoint Wall Street, which has put high odds on a September cut.",
      "Powell's speech, his last address at Jackson Hole as chair before his term ends in May, will occur against a particularly fraught backdrop. About a week after the jobs numbers, the latest inflation report showed that price growth crept higher in July. Core prices, which exclude the volatile food and energy categories, rose 3.1% from a year ago, above the Fed's 2% target.",
      "Stubbornly elevated inflation pushes the Fed in the opposite direction that weak hiring does: It suggests the central bank's short-term rate should stay at its current 4.3%, rather than be cut. That would mean other borrowing costs for mortgages, auto loans, and business loans, would stay elevated.",
      "\u201cSo the plot has thickened,\u201d said David Wilcox, a former top Fed economist and now director of economic research at Bloomberg Economics and also a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute. \u201cThe dilemma that the Fed is in has become, if anything, more intense.\u201d",
      "Powell is also navigating an unprecedented level of public criticism by Trump, as well as efforts by the president to take greater control of the Fed, which has long been independent from day-to-day politics.",
      "Most observers credit Powell for his nimble handling of the pressures. An iconic moment in his tenure was Trump's visit to tour the Fed's renovation of its office buildings last month. Trump had charged that Powell mismanaged the project, which had ballooned in cost to $2.5 billion, from an earlier estimate of $1.9 billion.",
      "With both the president and Fed chair in white hard hats on the building site, in front of cameras, Trump claimed the cost had mushroomed even further to $3.1 trillion. Powell shook his head, so Trump handed him a piece of paper purporting to back up his claim.",
      "Powell calmly dismissed the figure, noting that the $3.1 billion included the cost of renovating a third building five years earlier.",

      "Powell appeared to at least temporarily assuage Trump during the tour, after which the president backed off his threats to fire the Fed chair over the project.",
      "The attacks from Trump are the latest challenges for Powell in an unusually tumultuous eight years as Fed chair. Not long after being appointed by Trump in 2018, Powell endured the president's criticisms as the Fed slowly raised its key rate from the low levels where it had remained for years after the 2008-2009 Great Recession.",
      "Powell then found himself grappling with the pandemic, and after that the worst inflation spike in four decades that occurred as government stimulus checks fueled spending while crippled supply chains left fewer goods available.",
      "Powell then oversaw a rapid series of rate hikes that were widely predicted to cause a recession, but the economy continued plugging ahead.",
      "In his latest attempt to pressure the Fed, on Wednesday Trump called on Fed governor Lisa Cook to step down, after an administration official, Bill Pulte, accused her of mortgage fraud. Pulte is head of the agency that regulates mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.",
      "Cook said in a statement that she wouldn't be \u201cbullied\u201d into resigning and added that she was preparing to answer the charges.",
      "For Powell, there's a difficult decision to make on interest rates. The Fed's \u201cdual mandate\u201d calls for it to keep prices stable while seeking maximum employment. But while the weak jobs data suggest the need for a cut, many Fed officials fear inflation will get worse in the coming months.",
      "\u201cThere is still a fair amount that\u2019s still outstanding,\u201d Raphael Bostic, president of the Fed's Atlanta branch, said in an interview, referring to tariff-led price hikes. \u201cOne feedback we\u2019ve gotten both in our surveys and from direct conversations (with businesses) suggests that many still are looking to see the price that they charge their customers increase from where we are today.\u201d",
      "Other economists, however, point to the sharp slowdown in housing as a sign of a weak economy. Sales of existing homes fell in June to their lowest level in nine months amid elevated mortgage rates. Consumer spending has also been modest this year, and growth was just 1.2% at an annual rate in the first half of 2025.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s not a lot to like about the economy right now outside of AI,\" said Neil Dutta, an economist at Renaissance Macro. \u201cThe weakness in the economy isn't about tariffs,\u201d but instead the Fed's high rates, he added.",

      "Federal car safety regulators opened an investigation Thursday into why Tesla has repeatedly broken rules requiring it to tell them quickly about crashes involving its self-driving technology that may soon be deployed in millions of its cars on U.S. roads",
      "NEW YORK -- Federal auto safety regulators are investigating why Tesla has repeatedly broken rules requiring it to quickly tell them about crashes involving its self-driving technology, a potentially significant development given the company's plans to put hundreds of thousands of driverless cars on U.S. roads over the next year.",
      "The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said in a filing on Thursday that Tesla's reports on \u201cnumerous\u201d incidents involving its driver assistance and self-driving features were submitted far too late \u2014 several months after the crashes instead of within five days as required.",
      "The probe comes two months after the electric vehicle maker run by Elon Musk started a self-driving taxi service in Austin, Texas, with hopes of soon offering it nationwide. The company also hopes to send over-the-air software updates to millions of Teslas already on the road that will allow them to drive themselves.",
      "Investors enthusiastic about such plans have kept Tesla stock aloft despite plunging sales and profits due to boycotts over Musk's support for U.S. President Donald Trump and far-right politicians in Europe.",
      "The safety agency said the probe will focus on why Tesla took so long to report the crashes, whether the reports included all the necessary data and details and if there are crashes that the agency still doesn't know about.",

      "Stores for residents are disappearing, along with the friendly atmosphere, he says. In their place are hordes of people shooting selfies, shops selling tourist trinkets and caf\u00e9s whose seating spills into the narrow cobbled streets as overtourism takes its toll.",
      "Baroin has had enough. He put his apartment up for sale after local streets were designated pedestrian-only while accommodating the growing number of visitors.",
      "\u201cI told myself that I had no other choice but to leave since, as I have a disability, it\u2019s even more complicated when you can no longer take your car, when you have to call a taxi from morning to night,\" he told The Associated Press.",
      "From Venice to Barcelona to Amsterdam, European cities are struggling to absorb surging numbers of tourists.",
      "Some residents in one of Paris' most popular neighborhoods for tourists are now pushing back. A black banner strung between two balconies in Montmartre reads, in English: \u201cBehind the postcard: locals mistreated by the Mayor.\u201d Another, in French, says: \u201cMontmartre residents resisting.\u201d",
      "Atop the hill where the Basilica of Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur crowns the city's skyline, residents lament what they call the \u201cDisneyfication\u201d of the once-bohemian slice of Paris. The basilica says it now attracts up to 11 million people a year \u2014 even more than the Eiffel Tower \u2014 while daily life in the neighborhood has been overtaken by tuk-tuks, tour groups, photo queues and short-term rentals.",
      "\u201cNow, there are no more shops at all, there are no more food shops, so everything must be delivered,\u201d said 56-year-old Baroin, a member of a residents' protest group called Vivre a Montmartre, or Living in Montmartre.",
      "The unrest echoes tensions across town at the Louvre Museum, where staff in June staged a brief wildcat strike over chronic overcrowding, understaffing and deteriorating conditions. The Louvre logged 8.7 million visitors in 2024, more than double what its infrastructure was designed to handle.",
      "Paris, a city of just over 2 million residents if you count its sprawling suburbs, welcomed 48.7 million tourists in 2024, a 2% increase from the previous year.",
      "Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur, the most visited monument in France in 2024, and the surrounding Montmartre neighborhood have turned into what some locals call an open-air theme park.",

      "Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook late Wednesday said she wouldn\u2019t leave her post after Trump on social media called on her to resign over an accusation from one his officials that she committed mortgage fraud",
      "WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook late Wednesday said she wouldn't leave her post after Trump on social media called on her to resign over an accusation from one his officials that she committed mortgage fraud.",
      "\u201cI have no intention of being bullied to step down from my position because of some questions raised in a tweet,\u201d Cook said in a statement issued by the Fed.",
      "Bill Pulte, the head of the agency that regulates mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and a Trump appointee, alleged on the X social media platform early Wednesday that Cook had claimed two primary residences -- in Ann Arbor, Michigan and Atlanta -- in 2021 to get better mortgage terms. Mortgage rates are often higher on second homes or those purchased to rent.",
      "Trump followed up Pulte's accusation by calling on Cook to resign, in the latest effort by the administration to exert greater control over one of the few remaining independent agencies in Washington. Trump has repeatedly attacked the Fed's chair, Jerome Powell, for not cutting its short-term interest rate, and even threatened to fire him.",
      "If Cook is forced off the Fed's governing board, it would provide Trump an opportunity to appoint a loyalist. Trump has said he would only appoint officials who would support cutting rates.",
      "Pulte urged the Justice Department to investigate Cook, who was appointed to the Fed\u2019s governing board by former president Joe Biden in 2022. She was reappointed the following year to a term that lasts until 2038, the longest remaining term among the seven governors.",
      "Cook also said, \u201cI do intend to take any questions about my financial history seriously as a member of the Federal Reserve and so I am gathering the accurate information to answer any legitimate questions and provide the facts.\u201d",
      "Pulte, in a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi, said that on June 18, 2021, Cook purchased a home in Ann Arbor and then two weeks later bought a condo in Atlanta. Before joining the Fed, Cook taught at Michigan State University. Pulte also charged that Cook has listed her condo in Atlanta for rent.",
      "A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment.",
      "Just last month, Trump blasted Powell for the ballooning cost of the renovation of two of the Fed\u2019s headquarters buildings, even suggesting that the run-up in costs could constitute a firing offense. He backed off his threats to fire Powell after receiving a tour of the project.",
      "Pulte also suggested that Cook's alleged actions could constitute a fireable offense. Fed officials are protected by law from being removed by a president, except \u201cfor cause,\u201d which is generally seen as some kind of malfeasance or dereliction of duty.",
      "Either way, if Trump seeks to fire Cook, it could lead to a court battle over a president's power to remove Fed governors.",
      "Senate Democrats, including New York Sen. Chuck Schumer, expressed support for Cook and slammed Trump's actions.",

      "NEW YORK -- Target CEO Brian Cornell, who helped reenergize the company but has struggled to turn around weak sales in a more competitive retail landscape since the COVID pandemic, plans to step down Feb. 1.",
      "Minneapolis-based Target Corp. said Wednesday that Chief Operating Officer Michael Fiddelke, a 20-year company veteran, will succeed Cornell. Cornell will transition to be executive chair of the board.",
      "Cornell, 66, took the helm at Target in August 2014. In September 2022, the board extended his contract for three more years and eliminated a policy requiring its chief executives to retire at age 65.",
      "Cornell said the appointment followed several years of board vetting of both internal and external candidates. Fiddelke has overhauled Target\u2019s supply network and expanded the company\u2019s stores and digital services while cutting costs.",
      "\u201cMike was the right candidate to lead our business back to growth,\u201d Cornell told reporters. \u201cAs I arrived at Target, I consistently relied on Michael\u2019s strategic insights and sound judgment when making decisions. Michael has developed a deeper knowledge of our business than anyone I know.\u201d",
      "Fiddelke told reporters he\u2019s stepping into the role with \u201curgency\u201d to reclaim the company\u2019s merchandising authority.",
      "\u201cWhen we\u2019re leading with swagger in our merchandising authority, when we have swagger in our marketing, and we\u2019re setting the trend for retail, those are some of the moments I think that Target has been at its highest in my 20 years,\u201d he said.",
      "In May, Target announced that Fiddelke would lead a new office focused on faster decision-making to help accelerate sales growth.",
      "The change in leadership was announced Wednesday at the same time that Target reported another quarter of sluggish results. The company\u2019s stock was down more than 8% in pre-market trading.",
      "Target reported a 21% drop in net income in the quarter ended Aug. 2. Sales were down slightly and the company reported a 1.9% dip in comparable sales \u2014 those from established physical stores and online channels. Target has seen flat or declining comparable sales in eight out of the past 10 quarters including the latest period.",
      "Target, which has about 1,980 U.S. stores, has been the focus of consumer boycotts since late January, when it joined rival Walmart and a number of other prominent American brands in scaling back corporate diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.",
      "Target\u2019s sales also have languished as customers defect to Walmart and off-price department store chains like TJ Maxx in search of lower prices. But many analysts think Target is stumbling because consumers no longer consider it the place to go for affordable but stylish products, a niche that long ago earned the retailer the jokingly posh nickname \u201cTarzhay.\u201d",
      "In fact, out of 35 merchandise categories that Target tracks, it gained or maintaining market share in only 14 during the latest quarter, Fiddelke told reporters Tuesday.",
      "Meanwhile, Walmart gained market share among households with incomes over $100,000 as U.S. inflation caused consumer prices to rise rapidly. Lower-income shoppers have driven customer growth at Target, suggesting it may have lost appeal with wealthier customers, according to market research firm Consumer Edge.",

      "In March, members of Target\u2019s executive team told investors they planned to regain the chain\u2019s reputation for selling stylish goods at budget prices by expanding Target\u2019s lineup of store label brands and shortening the time it took to get new items from the idea stage to store shelves. The moves would help the company stay close to trends, executives said.",
      "\u201cIn a world where we operate today, our guests are looking for Tarzhay,\u201d Cornell told investors. \u201cConsumers coined that term decades ago to define how we elevate the everything everyday to something special, how we had unexpected fun in the shopping that would be otherwise routine.\u201d",
      "Before joining Target, Cornell spent more than 30 years in leadership positions at retail and consumer-product companies, including as chief marketing officer at Safeway Inc. and CEO at Michaels, Walmart\u2019s Sam\u2019s Club and PepsiCo America Foods. He came to Target when the company was facing a different set of challenges.",
      "Cornell replaced former CEO Gregg Steinhafel, who stepped down nearly five months after Target disclosed a huge data breach in which hackers stole millions of customers\u2019 credit- and debit-card records. The theft badly damaged the chain\u2019s reputation and profits.",
      "Cornell reenergized sales by having his team rev up Target\u2019s store brands. It now has 40 private label brands in its portfolio. And even before the pandemic, Cornell spearheaded the company\u2019s mission to transform its stores into delivery hubs to cut down on costs and speed up deliveries.",
      "Target\u2019s 2017 acquisition of Shipt helped bolster the discounter\u2019s same-day, store-based fulfillment services. Cornell also focused on making its stores better tailored to the local community",
      "The coronavirus pandemic delivered outsized sales for Target as well as its peers as people stayed home and bought pajamas, furnishings and kitchen items. And it continued to see a surge in sales as shoppers emerged from their homes and went to stores. But the spending sprees eventually subsided.",
      "As inflation started to spike, Target reported a 52% drop in profits during its 2022 first quarter compared with a year earlier. Purchases of big TVs and appliances that Americans loaded up on during the pandemic faded, leaving the retailer with excess inventory that had to be sold off.",
      "In July 2023, as shoppers feeling pinched by inflation curtailed their spending, Target said its comparable sales declined for the first time in six years.",
      "Moreover, Target started losing its edge as an authority on style by focusing too much on home furnishings basics, and not enough trendy items, Fiddelke said.",
      "A customer backlash over the annual line of LGBTQ+ Pride merchandise Target stores carried that year further cut into sales.",
      "Although Walmart retreated from its diversity initiatives first, Target has been the focus of more concerted consumer boycotts. Organizers have said they viewed Target\u2019s action as a greater betrayal because the company previously had held itself out as a champion of inclusion.",

      "A train derails and spills at least 1,000 gallons of hazardous materials in the U.S. about once every two months. Nearly half of those derailments resulted in evacuations; more than a quarter resulted in a fire or explosion since 2015, an analysis of federal derailment data showed.",
      "And many communities along the rail lines aren\u2019t prepared to keep people safe when it happens.",
      "That\u2019s the finding of an investigation by the University of Maryland\u2019s Howard Center for Investigative Journalism that reviewed hundreds of rail safety documents and reports and interviewed dozens of industry professionals and first responders.",
      "The Howard Center also obtained unprecedented access to rail data collected by a network of AI-enhanced camera sensors, which allowed reporters to track shipments of hazardous materials along 2,200 miles of rail lines between the U.S.-Canadian border and West Texas.",
      "That data, provided by a private company called RailState LLC, showed that over the last six months at least 130,000 rail cars displaying placards for hazardous materials moved along sections of rail lines stretching from Blaine, Washington, to Amarillo, Texas. Those cars passed the homes of at least 2.5 million people living within a mile of the tracks, along with more than 1,000 schools and 80 hospitals, the analysis found.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say that most communities are probably not aware of what chemicals are going up and down the railroads in their backyard, day in and day out,\u2019\u201d said Jamie Burgess, a hazmat training director at the International Association of Firefighters.",
      "First responders often lack the information, training, equipment and detailed planning needed to safely respond in the immediate aftermath of a hazmat derailment.",
      "Fewer than one in five fire departments nationwide have their own team of hazmat specialists, according to the U.S. Fire Administration.",
      "Confronted with a catastrophic hazmat derailment, local firefighters rely on a web of mutual support \u2014 from nearby departments, regional hazmat teams, state and federal officials, and railroad contractors \u2014 for the expertise and equipment they may lack. Yet those teams might be hours away, leaving firefighters to handle the unfolding crisis on their own.",
      "After a Norfolk Southern train derailed in East Palestine, Ohio, in 2023, it took more than an hour for firefighters with specialized hazmat training to arrive at the scene.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s usually the first time that they\u2019ve ever dealt with something like this, and they\u2019re overwhelmed in the beginning,\u201d said Paul Stancil, who recently left his job as a senior hazardous materials accident investigator with the National Transportation Safety Board. \u201cThat was a problem in East Palestine. It\u2019s a problem in almost every site.\u201d",
      "In 2024, railroad industry-funded hazmat training initiatives reached at least 80,000 first responders, according to industry estimates. But this represents just a fraction of the estimated 1 million career and volunteer firefighters in the U.S, according to U.S. Fire Administration numbers.",
      "Jessica Kahanek, a spokesperson for the Association of American Railroads, said rail is the safest way to transport hazardous materials over land, adding that U.S. railroads safely carried more than 2 million hazardous material shipments in 2024.",
      "The Howard Center analysis of federal data found 57 derailments in the last decade that resulted in the release of at least 1,000 gallons (3,800 liters) of hazardous material. Twenty-six of those derailments resulted in evacuations; 16 caused fires or an explosion.",
      "When such derailments occur, firefighters called to the scene often face a critical problem: Many don\u2019t know what chemicals are on board the train and what the exposure risks might be. And federal regulators have delayed the requirement to immediately supply that information.",
      "In a letter to federal regulators this month, East Palestine Fire Chief Keith Drabick criticized the delay and urged regulators to enforce a stricter timeline on railroads.",
      "\u201cThe 2023 East Palestine derailment in my village highlighted a critical lack of timely communication with public safety about hazardous materials information involved in rail emergencies,\u201d Drabick wrote. Without strict enforcement by regulators, he added, \u201cI am concerned that the derailment in my community could be repeated.\u201d",
      "When communities are unprepared for a hazmat spill, the consequences can be dire.",
      "In 2012, a derailment in Paulsboro, New Jersey, sent several tank cars carrying vinyl chloride \u2014 a highly toxic and flammable chemical \u2014 plunging into a creek. One of the tank cars broke open, spewing a cloud of toxic gas that engulfed the surrounding area.",
      "Local police and volunteer firefighters, initially confused about the chemical released, approached the wreck without breathing protection \u2014 even standing in the cloud. The initial evacuation area was too small, investigators later found, and many nearby residents spent hours in the exposure zone.",

      "President Donald Trump is calling on a Federal Reserve governor to resign over an accusation of mortgage fraud",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump this week called on a Federal Reserve governor to resign over an accusation of mortgage fraud, the latest effort by his administration to exert greater control over one of the few remaining independent agencies in Washington.",
      "Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook says she won't leave her post.",
      "Trump has repeatedly attacked the Fed\u2019s chair, Jerome Powell, for not cutting its short-term interest rate, and even threatened to fire him. Powell, who will speak Friday at an economic symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, says the Fed wants to see how the economy responds to Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs on imports, which Powell says could push up inflation.",
      "Powell's caution has infuriated Trump, who has demanded the Fed cut borrowing costs to spur the economy and reduce the interest rates the federal government pays on its debt. Trump has also accused Powell of mismanaging the U.S. central bank\u2019s $2.5 billion building renovation project.",
      "Firing the Fed chair or forcing out a governor would threaten the Fed\u2019s venerated independence, which has long been supported by most economists and Wall Street investors. Here's what to know about the Fed:",
      "The Fed wields extensive power over the U.S. economy. By cutting the short-term interest rate it controls \u2014 which it typically does when the economy falters \u2014 the Fed can make borrowing cheaper and encourage more spending, accelerating growth and hiring. When it raises the rate \u2014 which it does to cool the economy and combat inflation \u2014 it can weaken the economy and cause job losses.",
      "Economists have long preferred independent central banks because they can more easily take unpopular steps to fight inflation, such as raise interest rates, which makes borrowing to buy a home, car, or appliance more expensive.",
      "The importance of an independent Fed was cemented for most economists after the extended inflation spike of the 1970s and early 1980s. Former Fed Chair Arthur Burns has been widely blamed for allowing the painful inflation of that era to accelerate by succumbing to pressure from President Richard Nixon to keep rates low heading into the 1972 election. Nixon feared higher rates would cost him the election, which he won in a landslide.",
      "Paul Volcker was eventually appointed chair of the Fed in 1979 by President Jimmy Carter, and he pushed the Fed's short-term rate to the stunningly high level of nearly 20%. (It is currently 4.3%). The eye-popping rates triggered a sharp recession, pushed unemployment to nearly 11%, and spurred widespread protests.",
      "Yet Volcker didn't flinch. By the mid-1980s, inflation had fallen back into the low single digits. Volcker's willingness to inflict pain on the economy to throttle inflation is seen by most economists as a key example of the value of an independent Fed.",
      "An effort to fire Powell would almost certainly cause stock prices to fall and bond yields to spike higher, pushing up interest rates on government debt and raising borrowing costs for mortgages, auto loans, and credit card debt. The interest rate on the 10-year Treasury is a benchmark for mortgage rates.",

      "Most investors prefer an independent Fed, partly because it typically manages inflation better without being influenced by politics but also because its decisions are more predictable. Fed officials often publicly discuss how they would alter interest rate policies if economic conditions changed.",
      "If the Fed was more swayed by politics, it would be harder for financial markets to anticipate \u2014 or understand \u2014 its decisions.",
      "Fed chairs like Powell are appointed by the president to serve four-year terms, and have to be confirmed by the Senate. The president also appoints the six other members of the Fed's governing board, who can serve staggered terms of up to 14 years.",
      "Those appointments can allow a president over time to significantly alter the Fed's policies. Former president Joe Biden appointed four of the current seven members: Powell, Cook, Philip Jefferson, and Michael Barr. A fifth Biden appointee, Adriana Kugler, stepped down unexpectedly on Aug. 1, about five months before the end of her term. Trump has already nominated his top economist, Stephen Miran, as a potential replacement, though he will require Senate approval. Cook's term ends in 2038, so forcing her out would allow Trump to appoint a loyalist sooner.",
      "Trump will be able to replace Powell as Fed chair in May 2026, when Powell\u2019s term expires. Yet 12 members of the Fed\u2019s interest-rate setting committee have a vote on whether to raise or lower interest rates, so even replacing the Chair doesn\u2019t guarantee that Fed policy will shift the way Trump wants.",
      "Congress, meanwhile, can set the Fed's goals through legislation. In 1977, for example, Congress gave the Fed a \u201cdual mandate\u201d to keep prices stable and seek maximum employment. The Fed defines stable prices as inflation at 2%.",
      "The 1977 law also requires the Fed chair to testify before the House and Senate twice every year about the economy and interest rate policy.",
      "The Supreme Court earlier this year suggested in a ruling on other independent agencies that a president can't fire the chair of the Fed just because he doesn't like the chair's policy choices. But he may be able to remove him \u201cfor cause,\u201d typically interpreted to mean some kind of wrongdoing or negligence.",
      "It's a likely reason the Trump administration has zeroed in on the building renovation, in hopes it could provide a \u201cfor cause\u201d pretext. Still, Powell would likely fight any attempt to remove him, and the case could wind up at the Supreme Court.",

      "They'll still play the full U.S. Open starting Sunday in New York, but it might save some time to skip ahead to the men's final on Sept. 7",
      "NEW YORK -- OK, sure, maybe it wouldn't be rational to say there's no point in actually holding the full U.S. Open and instead just fast-forwarding to the inevitable matchup for the men's championship between Jannik Sinner \u2014 assuming he's healthy \u2014 and Carlos Alcaraz on Sept. 7.",
      "Seems reasonable, though.",
      "\u201cWe know,\u201d Novak Djokovic acknowledged, \u201cthey\u2019re the dominant force right now.\u201d",
      "When singles action begins Sunday at Flushing Meadows, a change from the usual Monday start, there are cases to be made for various players to make their way to the women's final. The top three in the rankings \u2014 No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka, No. 2 Iga Swiatek and No. 3 Coco Gauff \u2014 have won the past three U.S. Open titles, for example. Other past major champions such as Naomi Osaka or Elena Rybakina have performed well lately; maybe a new face will emerge.",
      "When it comes to the men, there really is just one name that matters in this post-Big Three era, and that name is \u201cSincaraz,\u201d the silly, made-up, \u201cFedal\u201d-style mashup of the guys who are ranked No. 1 (Sinner) and No. 2 (Alcaraz) and have claimed seven Grand Slam trophies in a row and nine of the last 12.",
      "Djokovic took the other three in that span.",
      "There is nothing quite like it in the women\u2019s game at the moment. The past five Slams were won by five players: Swiatek (Wimbledon in July), Gauff (French Open in June), Madison Keys (Australian Open in January), Sabalenka (last year\u2019s U.S. Open) and Barbora Krejcikova (last year\u2019s Wimbledon).",
      "\u201cSinner and Alcaraz,\u201d said Marcos Giron, an American who has been ranked 37th and faced both, \"are bringing a ridiculous level, week in and week out.\"",
      "Look at the ATP rankings, which either could lead after the U.S. Open. Look at the titles. Look at the past two Grand Slam finals, with Alcaraz erasing a two-set deficit and saving three championship points to win the French Open in June, before Sinner won in four sets at Wimbledon in July. Look at the most recent Masters 1000 tournament, the Cincinnati Open, where Sinner didn't drop a set en route to Monday's final but quit because he was feeling ill, ceding the trophy to Alcaraz.",
      "That ended Sinner's 26-match winning streak on hard courts; Alcaraz was responsible for the previous defeat, too. Alcaraz collected his tour-leading sixth trophy this season and has won 39 of his most recent 41 contests.",
      "Since Sinner returned in May from a three-month doping ban, Cincinnati was the fourth event both entered \u2014 and they met to decide the title in all four.",
      "They hit the ball as hard as anyone. Sinner's returns rival Djokovic's for best in the game. Alcaraz's drop shots are unrivaled. The athleticism displayed by both is remarkable. Alcaraz might be the fastest guy around. Sinner's long limbs reach everything.",
      "What sets them apart from others?",

      "Not sure? Head to YouTube and check out Alcaraz vs. Sinner, whether at Roland-Garros this year or at the U.S. Open in 2022 or pretty much any of their 14 showdowns ( Alcaraz leads 9-5 ).",
      "\u201cYou have to earn every point, every game. He makes you suffer (from) the first point of the match until the last ball,\u201d said Alcaraz, a 22-year-old from Spain. \u201cIt's really tough to find holes in his game.\u201d",

      "\u201cWe try,\u201d the 24-year-old from Italy said of their matchups, \u201cto push ourselves to the limits.\"",

      "The schedule released Wednesday includes two off weekends on a calendar that stretches from February to November. It begins with the exhibition Clash on Feb. 1 at Bowman-Gray Stadium in Winston-Salem for the second consecutive year, with the season-opening Daytona 500 to follow on Feb. 15.",
      "The season ends Nov. 8 in Florida at Homestead, which hosted the championship-deciding finale for 18 consecutive years before NASCAR shifted it to Phoenix Raceway in 2020.

      "NASCAR also moved Watkins Glen in New York from its traditional August date to Mother's Day weekend and the all-star race from North Wilkesboro, North Carolina, to Dover so that North Wilkesboro will be a points-paying Cup race, and New Hampshire lost its playoff race to become the penultimate race of the regular season.",

    "story": [
      "The voting technology company suing Fox News for defamation is now entangled in a widening bribery investigation",
      "MIAMI -- Smartmatic, the elections-technology company suing Fox News for defamation, is now contending with a growing list of criminal allegations against some of its executives \u2014 including a new claim by federal prosecutors that a \u201cslush fund\u201d for bribing foreign officials was financed partly with proceeds from the sale of voting machines in Los Angeles.",
      "The new details about the criminal case surfaced this month in court filings in Miami, where the company's co-founder, Roger Pinate, and two Venezuelan colleagues were charged last year with bribing officials in the Philippines in exchange for a contract to help run that country's 2016 presidential elections. Pinate, who no longer works for Smartmatic, has pleaded not guilty.",
      "To buttress the case, federal prosecutors are seeking to introduce evidence they argue shows that some of the nearly $300 million the company was paid by Los Angeles County to help modernize its voting systems was diverted to a fund controlled by Pinate through the use of overseas shell companies, fake invoices and other means.",
      "Smartmatic itself hasn't been charged with breaking any laws, nor have U.S. prosecutors accused Smartmatic or its executives of tampering with election results. Similarly, they haven't accused Los Angeles County officials of wrongdoing, or said whether they were even aware of the alleged bribery scheme. County officials say they weren\u2019t.",
      "But the case against Pinate is unfolding as Smartmatic is pursuing a $2.7 billion lawsuit accusing Fox of defamation for airing false claims that the company helped rig the 2020 U.S. presidential election. Fox says it was legitimately reporting newsworthy allegations.",
      "Smartmatic said the Justice Department\u2019s new filing was filled with \u201cmisrepresentations\u201d and is \u201cuntethered from reality.\u201d",
      "\u201cLet us be clear: Smartmatic wins business because we\u2019re the best at what we do,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cWe operate ethically and abide by all laws always, both in Los Angeles County and every jurisdiction where we operate.\u201d",
      "Still, Fox has gone to court to try to get more information about L.A. County's dealings with Smartmatic. The network has long tried to leverage the bribery allegations to undermine Smartmatic\u2019s narrative about its business prospects \u2013 a key component in calculating any potential damages \u2014 and portray it as a scandal-plagued company brought low by its own legal problems, not Fox's broadcasts.",
      "South Florida-based Smartmatic was founded more than two decades ago by a group of Venezuelans who found early success working for the government of the late Hugo Chavez, a devotee of electronic voting. The company later expanded globally, providing voting machines and other technology to help carry out elections in 25 countries, from Argentina to Zambia.",
      "It was awarded its contract to help with Los Angeles County elections in 2018. The contract, which Smartmatic continues to service, gave the company an important foothold in what was then a fast-expanding U.S. voting-technology market.",
      "But Smartmatic has said its business tanked after Fox News gave President Donald Trump\u2019s lawyers a platform to paint the company as part of a conspiracy to steal the 2020 election.",
      "Fox itself eventually aired a piece refuting the allegations after Smartmatic\u2019s lawyers complained, but it has aggressively defended itself against the defamation lawsuit in New York.",
      "\u201cFacing imminent financial collapse and indictment, Smartmatic saw a litigation lottery ticket in Fox News\u2019s coverage of the 2020 election,\u201d the network\u2019s lawyers said in a court filing.",
      "Smartmatic has disputed Fox's characterization in court filings as \u201clies\u201d and \u201canother attempt to divert attention from its long-standing campaign of falsehoods and defamation.\"",

      "Fox's lawyers also questioned Logan in a deposition about a dinner a Smartmatic executive bought for him at the members-only Magic Castle club and restaurant in Los Angeles and a Smartmatic-paid trip that Logan made to Taiwan in 2019 to oversee the manufacturing of equipment by a Smartmatic vendor. U.S. prosecutors claim that vendor was deeply involved in the alleged kickback scheme in the Philippines. The five-day trip included business class airfare, hotel and numerous meals as well as time for sightseeing, Fox said.",
      "\u201cThe trip\u2019s itinerary demonstrates that the trip was not a financial inspection or audit. It was a boondoggle,\u201d Fox said in court filings.",
      "Logan, who did not report the gifts in his financial disclosures, said in his 2023 deposition that the meal at the Magic Castle was a \u201csocial occasion\u201d unrelated to business and that he was not required to report the trip to Taiwan because his visit was covered by the contract.",
      "Mike Sanchez, a spokesman for Logan's office, said in a statement that the bribery allegations are unrelated to the company\u2019s work for L.A. County and that the county had no knowledge of how the proceeds from its contract would be used. All of Smartmatic\u2019s work has been evaluated for compliance with the contract\u2019s terms, Sanchez added, and as soon as Pinate was indicted he and the other defendants were banned from conducting business with the county.",
      "As for the trip to Taiwan, Sanchez said another county official joined Logan for the trip and the two conducted several on-site visits and conducted detailed reviews of electoral technology products that were required prior the start of their manufacturing. Logan's spouse accompanied him on the trip, but at the couple's own expense, the spokesman added.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, this is an attempt to use the County as a pawn in two serious legal actions to which the County is not a party,\u201d Sanchez said.",
      "Smartmatic has settled two other defamation lawsuits it brought against conservative news outlets Newsmax and One America News Network over their 2020 U.S. election coverage. Settlement terms weren\u2019t disclosed.",
      "U.S. prosecutors in Miami have also accused Pinate of secretly bribing Venezuela's longtime election chief by giving her a luxury home with a pool in Caracas. Prosecutors say the home was transferred to the election chief in an attempt to repair relations following Smartmatic's abrupt exit from Venezuela in 2017 when it accused President Nicolas Maduro 's government of manipulating tallied results in elections for a rubber-stamping constituent assembly.",
      "Smartmatic has denied the bribery allegations, saying it ceased all operations in Venezuela in 2017 after blowing the whistle on the government and has never sought to secure business there again.",
      "\"There are no slush funds, no gifted house,\" the company said. Instead, it accused Fox of engaging in \u201cvictim-blaming\u201d and attempts to use \u201cfrivolous\u201d court filings \u201cto smear us further, twisting unproven Justice Department allegations.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump wants the U.S. government to own a piece of Intel, less than two weeks after demanding the Silicon Valley pioneer dump the CEO that was hired to turn around the slumping chipmaker",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- President Donald Trump wants the U.S. government to own a piece of Intel, less than two weeks after demanding the Silicon Valley pioneer dump the CEO that was hired to turn around the slumping chipmaker. If the goal is realized, the investment would deepen the Trump administration's involvement in the computer industry as the president ramps up the pressure for more U.S. companies to manufacture products domestically instead of relying on overseas suppliers.",
      "The Trump administration is in talks to secure a 10% stake in Intel in exchange for converting government grants that were pledged to Intel under President Joe Biden. If the deal is completed, the U.S. government would become one of Intel's largest shareholders and blur the traditional lines separating the public sector and private sector in a country that remains the world's largest economy.",
      "In his second term, Trump has been leveraging his power to reprogram the operations of major computer chip companies. The administration is requiring Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, two companies whose chips are helping to power the craze around artificial intelligence, to pay a 15% commission on their sales of chips in China in exchange for export licenses.",
      "Trump\u2019s interest in Intel is also being driven by his desire to boost chip production in the U.S., which has been a focal point of the trade war that he has been waging throughout the world. By lessening the country's dependence on chips manufactured overseas, the president believes the U.S. will be better positioned to maintain its technological lead on China in the race to create artificial intelligence.",
      "That's what the president said August 7 in an unequivocal post calling for Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan to resign less than five months after the Santa Clara, California, company hired him. The demand was triggered by reports raising national security concerns about Tan's past investments in Chinese tech companies while he was a venture capitalist. But Trump backed off after Tan professed his allegiance to the U.S. in a public letter to Intel employees and went to the White House to meet with the president, who applauded the Intel CEO for having an \u201camazing story.\u201d",
      "The company isn't commenting about the possibility of the U.S. government becoming a major shareholder, but Intel may have little choice because it is currently dealing from a position of weakness. After enjoying decades of growth while its processors powered the personal computer boom, the company fell into a slump after missing the shift to the mobile computing era unleashed by the iPhone\u2019s 2007 debut.",

      "Intel has fallen even farther behind in recent years during an artificial intelligence craze that has been a boon for Nvidia and AMD. The company lost nearly $19 billion last year and another $3.7 billion in the first six months of this year, prompting Tan to undertake a cost-cutting spree. By the end of this year, Tan expects Intel to have about 75,000 workers, a 25% reduction from the end of last year.",
      "Although rare, it\u2019s not unprecedented for the U.S. government to become a significant shareholder in a prominent company. One of the most notable instances occurred during the Great Recession in 2008 when the government injected nearly $50 billion into General Motors in return for a roughly 60% stake in the automaker at a time it was on the verge of bankruptcy. The government ended up with a roughly $10 billion loss after it sold its stock in GM.",
      "U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC during a Tuesday interview that the government has no intention of meddling in Intel's business, and will have its hands tied by holding non-voting shares in the company. But some analysts wonder if the Trump administration's financial ties to Intel might prod more companies looking to curry favor with the president to increase their orders for the company's chips.",
      "Intel was among the biggest beneficiaries of the Biden administration\u2019s CHIPS and Science Act, but it hasn\u2019t been able to revive its fortunes while falling behind on construction projects spawned by the program.",
      "The company has received about $2.2 billion of the $7.8 billion pledged under the incentives program \u2014 money that Lutnick derided as a \u201cgiveaway\u201d that would better serve U.S. taxpayers if it\u2019s turned into Intel stock. \u201cWe think America should get the benefit of the bargain,\u201d Lutnick told CNBC. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious that it\u2019s the right move to make.\u201d",

      "The AI expansion on the four Pixel 10 models amplifies Google's efforts to broaden the use of a technology that is already starting to reshape society. At the same time, Google is taking a swipe at Apple's Achilles' heel on the iPhone.",
      "Apple so far has only been able to introduce a few basic AI features on the iPhone while failing to deliver on last year\u2019s promise to deliver a more conversational and versatile version of its often-blundering virtual assistant Siri.",
      "Without mentioning the iPhone by name, Google has already been mocking Apple\u2019s missteps in online ads promoting the four new Pixel models as smartphones loaded with AI technology that consumers won\u2019t have to wait for more than a year to arrive.",
      "Google, in contrast, has been steadily increasing the amount of AI that it began to implant on its Pixels since 2023, with this year\u2019s models taking it to another level.",
      "Taking advantage of a more advanced processor, Google is introducing a new AI feature on the Pixel 10 phones called \u201cMagic Cue\u201d that\u2019s designed to serve as a digital mind reader that automatically fetches information stored on the devices and displays the data at the time it\u2019s needed. For instance, if a Pixel 10 user is calling up an airline, Magic Cue is supposed to instantaneously recognize the phone number and display the flight information if it\u2019s in Gmail or a Google Calendar.",
      "The Pixel 10 phones will also come with a preview feature of a new AI tool called \u201cCamera Coach\u201d that will automatically suggest the best framing and lighting angle as the lens is being aimed at a subject. Camera Coach will also recommend the best lens mode to use for an optimal picture.",
      "The premium models \u2014 Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL \u2014 will also include a \u201cSuper Res\u201d option that deploys a grab bag of software and AI tricks to zoom up to 100 times the resolution to capture the details of objects located miles away from the camera. The AI wizardry could happen without users even realizing it\u2019s happening, making it even more difficult to know whether an image captured in a photo reflects how things really looked at the time a picture was taken or was modified by technology.",
      "Google is also offering a free one-year subscription to its AI Pro plan to anyone who buys the more expensive Pixel 10 Pro or Pixel 10 Pro XL models in hopes of hooking more people on the Gemini toolkit it has assembled to compete against OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT.",

Although the company has already said the smarter Siri won't be ready until next year at the earliest, Apple will still be expected to show some progress in AI to demonstrate the iPhone is adapting to technology's AI evolution rather than tilting toward gradual obsolescence. Clinging to a once-successful formula eventually sank the BlackBerry and its physical keyboard when the iPhone and its touch screen came along nearly 20 years ago.",
      "Apple's pricing of the next iPhone will also be under the spotlight, given that the devices are made in China and India \u2014 two of the prime targets in President Donald Trump's trade war.",
      "But Apple appeared to gain a reprieve from Trump's most onerous threats earlier this month by adding another $100 billion on top of an earlier $500 billion investment pledge to the U.S. The tariff relief may enable Apple to minimize or even avoid price increases for the iPhone, just as Google has done with the Pixel 10 models.",

      "Jamel Bishop is seeing a big change in his classrooms as he begins his senior year at Doss High School in Louisville, Kentucky, where cellphones are now banned during instructional time.",
      "In previous years, students often weren\u2019t paying attention and wasted class time by repeating questions, the teenager said. Now, teachers can provide \u201cmore one-on-one time for the students who actually need it.\u201d",

This change has come remarkably quickly: Florida became the first state to pass such a law in 2023.",
      "Both Democrats and Republicans have taken up the cause, reflecting a growing consensus that phones are bad for kids' mental health and take their focus away from learning, even as some researchers say the issue is less clear-cut.",
      "\u201cAnytime you have a bill that\u2019s passed in California and Florida, you know you\u2019re probably onto something that\u2019s pretty popular,\" Georgia state Rep. Scott Hilton, a Republican, told a forum on cellphone use last week in Atlanta.",
      "Phones are banned throughout the school day in 18 of the states and the District of Columbia, although Georgia and Florida impose such \u201cbell-to-bell\u201d bans only from kindergarten through eighth grade. Another seven states ban them during class time, but not between classes or during lunch. Still others, particularly those with traditions of local school control, mandate only a cellphone policy, believing districts will take the hint and sharply restrict phone access.",
      "For students, the rules add new school-day rituals, like putting phones in magnetic pouches or special lockers.",
      "Students have been locking up their phones during class at McNair High School in suburban Atlanta since last year. Audreanna Johnson, a junior, said \u201cmost of them did not want to turn in their phones\u201d at first, because students would use them to gossip, texting \u201ctheir other friends in other classes to see what\u2019s the tea and what\u2019s going on around the building.\u201d",
      "That resentment is \u201cstarting to ease down\u201d now, she said. \"More students are willing to give up their phones and not get distracted.\u201d",
      "But there are drawbacks \u2014 like not being able to listen to music when working independently in class. \u201cI\u2019m kind of 50-50 on the situation because me, I use headphones to do my schoolwork. I listen to music to help focus,\u201d she said.",
      "In a survey of 125 Georgia school districts by Emory University researchers, parental resistance was cited as the top obstacle to regulating student use of social and digital media.",
      "Johnson\u2019s mother, Audrena Johnson, said she worries most about knowing her children are safe from violence at school. School messages about threats can be delayed and incomplete, she said, like when someone who wasn\u2019t a McNair student got into a fight on school property, which she learned about when her daughter texted her during the school day.",
      "\u201cMy child having her phone is very important to me, because if something were to happen, I know instantly,\u201d Johnson said.",
      "Many parents echo this \u2014 generally supporting restrictions but wanting a say in the policymaking and better communication, particularly about safety \u2014 and they have a real need to coordinate schedules with their children and to know about any problems their children may encounter, said Jason Allen, the national director of partnerships for the National Parents Union.",

      "Regent Craft is testing a new type of winged passenger ferry on Narragansett Bay",

      "Its maker, Regent Craft, is betting on both.",
      "Twelve quietly buzzing propellers line the 65-foot (20-meter) wingspan of Paladin, a sleek ship with an airplane's nose. It looks nothing like the sailboats and fishing trawlers it speeds past through New England's largest estuary.",
      "\u201cWe had this vision five years ago for a seaglider \u2014 something that is as fast as an aircraft and as easy to drive as a boat,\u201d said CEO Billy Thalheimer, jubilant after an hours-long test run of the new vessel.",
      "On a cloudy August morning, Thalheimer sat in the Paladin's cockpit and, for the first time, took control of his company's prototype craft to test its hydrofoils. The electric-powered watercraft has three modes \u2014 float, foil and fly.",
      "From the dock, it sets off like any motorized boat. Farther away from land, it rises up on hydrofoils \u2014 the same kind used by sailing ships that compete in America\u2019s Cup. The foils enable it to travel more than 50 miles per hour \u2014 and about a person's height \u2014 above the bay.",
      "What makes this vessel so unusual is that it's designed to soar about 30 feet (10 meters) above the water at up to 180 miles per hour \u2014 a feat that hasn't quite happened yet, with the first trial flights off Rhode Island's seacoast planned for the end of summer or early fall.",
      "If successful, the Paladin will coast on a cushion of air over Rhode Island Sound, lifting with the same \u201cground effect\u201d that pelicans, cormorants and other birds use to conserve energy as they swiftly glide over the sea. It could zoom to New York City \u2014 which takes at least three hours by train and longer on traffic-clogged freeways \u2014 in just an hour.",
      "As it works to prove its seaworthiness to the U.S. Coast Guard and other regulators around the world, Regent is already lining up future customers for commercial ferry routes around Florida, Hawaii, Japan and the Persian Gulf.",
      "Regent is also working with the U.S. Marines to repurpose the same vessels for island-hopping troops in the Pacific. Those vessels would likely trade electric battery power for jet fuel to cover longer journeys.",
      "With backing from influential investors including Peter Thiel and Mark Cuban, Thalheimer says he\u2019s trying to use new technology to revive the \u201ccomfort and refined nature\u201d of 1930s-era flying boats that were popular in aviation\u2019s golden age before they were eclipsed by commercial airlines.",
      "This time, Thalheimer added, they're safer, quieter and emission-free.",
      "\u201cI thought they made travel easier in a way that made total sense to me,\u201d Cuban said by email this week. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to travel around water for short distances. It\u2019s expensive and a hassle. Regent can solve this problem and make that travel fun, easy and efficient.\u201d",
      "Co-founders and friends Thalheimer, a skilled sailor, and chief technology officer Mike Klinker, who grew up lobster fishing, met while both were freshmen at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and later worked together at Boeing. They started Regent in 2020.",
      "They've already tested and flown a smaller model. But the much bigger, 12-passenger Paladin \u2014 prototype of a product line called Viceroy \u2014 began foil testing this summer after years of engineering research and development. A manufacturing facility is under construction nearby, with the vessels set to carry passengers by 2027.",
      "The International Maritime Organization classifies \u201cwing-in-ground-effect\u201d vehicles such as Regent's as ships, not aircraft. But a database of civilian ships kept by the London-based organization lists only six around the world, all of them built before it issued new safety guidance on such craft in 2018 following revisions sought by China, France and Russia.",

Recently, however, social media images of an apparent Chinese military ekranoplan have caught the attention of naval experts amid increasingly tense international disputes in the South China Sea.",
      "Regent has capitalized on those concerns, pitching its gliders to the U.S. government as a new method for carrying troops and cargo across island chains in the Indo-Pacific region. It could also do clandestine intelligence collection, anti-submarine warfare and be a \u201cmothership\u201d for small drones, autonomous watercraft or medical evacuations, said Tom Huntley, head of Regent's government relations and defense division.",

      "Giraffes are now classified into four distinct species in Africa",
      "WASHINGTON -- Giraffes are a majestic sight in Africa with their long necks and distinctive spots. Now it turns out there are four different giraffe species on the continent, according to a new scientific analysis released Thursday.",
      "Researchers previously considered all giraffes across Africa to belong to a single species. New data and genetic studies have led a task force of the International Union for Conservation of Nature to split the tallest mammal on land into four groups \u2014 Northern giraffes, reticulated giraffes, Masai giraffes and Southern giraffes.",
      "Key studies have emerged in the past decade highlighting significant differences between the four species, said the IUCN\u2019s Michael Brown, a researcher in Windhoek, Namibia, who led the assessment.",
      "Naming different giraffes matters because \u201ceach species has different population sizes, threats and conservation needs,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you lump giraffes all together, it muddies the narrative.\u201d",
      "Northern giraffes \u2014 whose range includes parts of Democratic Republic of Congo, South Sudan and Central African Republic \u2013 face threats from political instability and poaching. Masai giraffes in Kenya and Tanzania face pressure from habitat loss, as open savannas are converted to cattle pastures and fields.",
      "Considering four giraffe species \u201cis absolutely the right decision, and it\u2019s long overdue,\u201d said Stuart Pimm, a Duke University ecologist who wasn\u2019t involved in the analysis.",
      "While in the past researchers scrutinized giraffes\u2019 spots, the new categories made use of newer methods including extensive analysis of genetic data and studies highlighting key anatomical differences, such as skull shape.",
      "What appear like horns sticking up from the foreheads of giraffes are actually permanent bony protrusions from the skull, different from deer antlers that are shed annually.",
      "Over the past 20 years, scientists have also gathered genetic samples from more than 2,000 giraffes across Africa to study the differences, said Stephanie Fennessy at the nonprofit Giraffe Conservation Foundation, who helped in the research.",

      "NEW YORK -- When the court lights flicker on at the U.S. Open, tennis stars shine under illumination designed to cut light pollution.",
      "The wedge-shaped lamps around the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows direct light onto the players without spewing it into the surrounding skies.",
      "The stadium complex is the only professional sports venue certified by a group that's trying to preserve the night sky around the world. Across North America and Canada, schools and local parks have also swapped out their lights on baseball fields, running tracks and other recreation grounds to preserve their view of the stars and protect local wildlife.",
      "Night lights can disrupt bird migration and confuse nocturnal critters like frogs and fireflies. Lights on sports fields are especially bright and cool, and often cast their glare into neighborhoods.",
      "In renovations over the past decade, the U.S. Tennis Association swapped metal halide bulbs for shielded LED lights. The complex\u2019s 17 tournament courts \u2014 including Arthur Ashe Stadium \u2014 and five practice courts were approved as dark sky-friendly last year.",
      "USTA officials wanted the best lighting possible on their courts, which also happened to be friendly to dark skies. Their lighting company suggested striking a balance that would satisfy crowds and TV crews while cutting down spillover into the surrounding environment.",
      "\u201cThis is an international event that has an impact on the community,\u201d said the USTA\u2019s managing director of capital projects and engineering Chuck Jettmar. \u201cLet's minimize that and make sure that everybody's happy with it.\u201d",
      "U.S. Open qualifying matches this week were punctuated by players grunting, crickets chirping and audiences cheering. Rows of lights stood like sentries above, adorned with flat visors that guided the glow onto the action.",
      "The lights at Flushing Meadows glow at a quarter of their brightness when the courts are rented for play during the year. They're approved by DarkSky International, a nonprofit that gives similar designations to cities and national parks. The group widened its focus to include sports arenas in recent years and has certified over 30 venues since 2019 \u2014 including high school football fields and youth soccer fields.",
      "\u201cWe live in a world where we need to engage with one another in the nighttime environment, and that\u2019s OK,\u201d said DarkSky spokesperson Drew Reagan. \u201cThat\u2019s a beautiful thing and there\u2019s a way to do that responsibly.\u201d",
      "The organization typically approves proposals at sports fields before any light fixtures are installed or replaced. Once construction is complete, a representative measures the glow and glare against a set of guidelines that benefit the night.",
      "Renovating a field with dark skies in mind can cost about 5% to 10% more than traditional sports lighting, according to James Brigagliano, who runs DarkSky\u2019s outdoor sports lighting program. Venues may require a few extra fixtures since the light shining from them is more targeted.",
      "Most arenas make the change during scheduled maintenance and renovation, working with sports lighting company Musco. The company lights over 3,000 venues a year including college football stadiums, tennis courts and rail yards.",

      "Outer space has emerged as the world's next battlefield, demonstrated by recent cyberattacks on satellites blamed on Russia",
      "WASHINGTON -- As Russia held its Victory Day parade this year, hackers backing the Kremlin hijacked an orbiting satellite that provides television service to Ukraine.",
      "Instead of normal programing, Ukrainian viewers saw parade footage beamed in from Moscow: waves of tanks, soldiers and weaponry. The message was meant to intimidate, and it was also an illustration that 21st century war is waged not just on land, sea and air but also in cyberspace and the reaches of outer space.",
      "Disabling a satellite could deal a devastating blow without a single bullet, and it can be done by targeting the satellite's security software or disrupting its ability to send or receive signals from Earth.",
      "\u201cIf you can impede a satellite's ability to communicate, you can cause a significant disruption,\u201d said Tom Pace, CEO of NetRise, a cybersecurity firm focused on protecting supply chains. He served in the Marines before working on cyber issues at the Department of Energy.",
      "\u201cThink about GPS,\u201d he said. \u201cImagine if a population lost that, and the confusion it would cause.\u201d",
      "More than 12,000 operating satellites now orbit the planet, playing a critical role not just in broadcast communications but also in military operations, navigation systems like GPS, intelligence gathering and economic supply chains. They are also key to early launch-detection efforts, which can warn of approaching missiles.",
      "That makes them a significant national security vulnerability, and a prime target for anyone looking to undermine an adversary's economy or military readiness \u2014 or to deliver a psychological blow like the hackers supporting Russia did when they hijacked television signals to Ukraine.",
      "Hackers typically look for the weakest link in the software or hardware that supports a satellite or controls its communications with Earth. The actual orbiting device may be secure, but if it's running on outdated software, it can be easily exploited.",
      "As Russian forces invaded Ukraine in 2022, someone targeted Viasat, the U.S.-based satellite company used by Ukraine's government and military. The hack, which Kyiv blamed on Moscow, used malware to infect tens of thousands of modems, creating an outage affecting wide swaths of Europe.",
      "National security officials say Russia is developing a nuclear, space-based weapon designed to take out virtually every satellite in low-Earth orbit at once. The weapon would combine a physical attack that would ripple outward, destroying more satellites, while the nuclear component is used to fry their electronics.",
      "U.S. officials declassified information about the weapon after Rep. Mike Turner, R-Ohio, issued a public warning about the technology. Turner has pushed for the Department of Defense to provide a classified briefing to lawmakers on the weapon, which, if deployed, would violate an international treaty prohibiting weapons of mass destruction in space.",
      "Turner said such a weapon could render low-Earth orbit unusable for satellites for as long as a year. If it were used, the effects would be devastating: potentially leaving the U.S. and its allies vulnerable to economic upheaval and even a nuclear attack.",
      "Russia and China also would lose satellites, though they are believed to be less reliant on the same kinds of satellites as the U.S.",
      "Turner compared the weapon, which is not yet ready for deployment, to Sputnik, the Russian satellite that launched the space age in 1957.",
      "\u201cIf this anti-satellite nuclear weapon would be put in space, it would be the end of the space age,\u201d Turner said. \u201cIt should never be permitted to go into outer space. This is the Cuban Missile Crisis in space.\u201d",

      "Minnesota has joined a wave of states suing TikTok, claiming the app uses addictive algorithms that harm young people's mental health",
      "ST. PAUL, Minn. -- Minnesota on Tuesday joined a wave of states suing TikTok, alleging the social media giant preys on young people with addictive algorithms that trap them into becoming compulsive consumers of its short videos.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t about free speech. I\u2019m sure they\u2019re gonna holler that,\" Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said at a news conference. \"It\u2019s actually about deception, manipulation, misrepresentation. This is about a company knowing the dangers, and the dangerous effects of its product, but making and taking no steps to mitigate those harms or inform users of the risks.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit, filed in state court, alleges that TikTok is violating Minnesota laws against deceptive trade practices and consumer fraud. It follows a flurry of lawsuits filed by more than a dozen states last year alleging the popular short-form video app is designed to be addictive to kids and harms their mental health. Minnesota's case brings the total to about 24 states, Ellison's office said.",
      "Many of the earlier lawsuits stemmed from a nationwide investigation into TikTok launched in 2022 by a bipartisan coalition of attorneys general from 14 states into the effects of TikTok on young users\u2019 mental health. Ellison, a Democrat, said Minnesota waited while it did its own investigation.",
      "Sean Padden, a middle-school health teacher in the Roseville Area school district, joined Ellison, saying he has witnessed a correlation between increased TikTok use and an \u201cirrefutable spike in student mental health issues,\u201d including depression, anxiety, anger, lowered self-esteem and a decrease in attention spans as they seek out the quick gratification that its short videos offer.",
      "The lawsuit comes while President Donald Trump is still trying to broker a deal to bring the social media platform, which is owned by China\u2019s ByteDance, under American ownership over concerns about the data security of its 170 million American users. While Trump campaigned on banning TikTok, he also gained more than 15 million followers on the platform since he started sharing videos on it.",
      "No matter who ultimately owns TikTok, Ellison said, it must comply with the law.",

      "TikTok disputed Minnesota's allegations.",
      "\u201cThis lawsuit is based on misleading and inaccurate claims that fail to recognize the robust safety measures TikTok has voluntarily implemented to support the well-being of our community,\" company spokesperson Nathaniel Brown said in a statement. \"Teen accounts on TikTok come with 50+ features and settings designed to help young people safely express themselves, discover and learn.",
      "\"Through our Family Pairing tool, parents can view or customize 20+ content and privacy settings, including screen time, content filters, and our time away feature to pause a teen\u2019s access to our app,\u201d Brown added.",
      "Minnesota is seeking a declaration that TikTok's practices are deceptive, unfair or unconscionable under state law, a permanent injunction against those practices, and up to $25,000 for each instance in which a Minnesota child has accessed TikTok. Ellison wouldn't put a total on that but said, \u201cit's a lot.\u201d He estimated that \u201chundreds of thousands of Minnesota kids\u201d have TikTok on their devices.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not trying to shut them down, but we are insisting that they clean up their act,\u201d Ellison said. \u201cThere are legitimate uses of products like TikTok. But like all things, they have to be used properly and safely.\u201d",
      "Minnesota is also among dozens of U.S. states that have sued Meta Platforms for allegedly building features into Instagram and Facebook that addict people. The messaging service Snapchat and the gaming platform Roblox are also facing lawsuits by some other states alleging harm to kids.",

      "Lawyers for the media giant Meta says a lawsuit brought by families of the victims of the school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, should be thrown out",
      "LOS ANGELES -- A lawsuit filed by families of the Uvalde school shooting victims alleging Instagram allowed gun manufacturers to promote firearms to minors should be thrown out, lawyers for Meta, Instagram's parent company, argued Tuesday.",
      "Nineteen children and two teachers were killed in the May 2022 shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas.",
      "The families sued Meta in Los Angeles in May 2024, saying the social media platform failed to enforce its own rules forbidding firearms advertisements aimed at minors. The families, who were present at last month's hearing, did not appear in court, with a lawyer citing the back-to-school season. Many plaintiffs attended the hearing virtually, he said.",
      "In one ad posted on Instagram, the Georgia-based gunmaker Daniel Defense shows Santa Claus holding an assault rifle. In another post by the same company, a rifle leans against a refrigerator, with the caption: \u201cLet\u2019s normalize kitchen Daniels. What Daniels do you use to protect your kitchen and home?\u201d",
      "The lawsuit alleges those posts are marketed toward minors. The Uvalde gunman opened an online account with Daniel Defense before his 18th birthday and purchased the rifle as soon as he could, according to the lawsuit. He also owned various Instagram accounts and had an \u201cobsessive relationship\u201d with the platform, at times opening the app more than 100 times a day, plaintiffs' lawyers found in an analysis of the shooter's phone.",
      "Meta attorney Kristin Linsley argued that the families provided no proof that minors, including the Uvalde gunman, even read the Daniel Defense posts on Instagram. She also said the posts didn't violate Meta\u2019s policies because they weren\u2019t direct advertisements and did not include links to purchase any products.",
      "Katie Mesner-Hage, representing the victims' families, said the defense\u2019s claim is \u201cfundamentally unfair,\u201d as the plaintiffs don\u2019t have access to Meta data that would indicate whether the shooter encountered those posts. She added that if the content had landed on the shooter\u2019s feed, as the plaintiffs allege, then Meta \u201cnot only knew about it, they designed the system so it would be delivered to him.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey knew more about him than anyone else on the planet,\u201d she said.",
      "Linsley said content advertising firearms for sale on Instagram is allowed if posted by \u201cbrick-and-motor and online retailers,\u201d but visibility of those posts was restricted for minors under Meta\u2019s advertising policies from the end of 2021 to October 2022.",
      "\u201cThis is not a playbook for how to violate the rules. This is actually what the rules are,\u201d Linsley said.",
      "The plaintiff\u2019s team, however, showed a fake profile they created for a 17-year-old boy earlier this month, through which they were able to search Daniel Defense\u2019s Instagram account and see a post that included a picture of a gun, as well as a link to the gun manufacturer\u2019s website.",
      "When the link was clicked, the gun-maker\u2019s website opened, and the team was able to select a firearm and add it to their cart, all within Instagram\u2019s app \u2014 an experiment that refutes Meta\u2019s assertion that posts relating to firearms aren\u2019t visible to users under 21, Mesner-Hage said.",

      "\"The only response a company can have is to not have these kinds of rules at all,\" Linsley said. \u201cIt just gets you down a rabbit hole very quickly.\u201d",
      "Mesner-Hage argued Meta is not protected by the act because social media platforms don\u2019t just host speech, but help curate it through its algorithms. Daniel Defense, she said, didn't have to pay for ads to get free access to Meta's analytical data through its business account on Instagram. That data shows the company which age bracket and gender engaged most with a specific post.",
      "\u201cDaniel Defense is not on Instagram to make friends. ... They\u2019re on there to promote their product,\u201d Mesner-Hage said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a paid advertisement, but I would struggle to describe this as anything other than an advertisement.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit alleges that firearm companies tweaked their online marketing to comply with Meta's policies, including by avoiding the words \u201cbuy\u201d or \u201csell\u201d and not providing links to purchase, and that the social media company did not protect users against such strategies.",
      "Last month, lawyers for Activision also argued that legal proceedings against them should be thrown out, saying the families allegations are barred by the First Amendment. The families alleged that the war-themed video game Call of Duty trained and conditioned the Uvalde gunman to orchestrate his attack.",

      "The oldest previously known example of early human ancestors transporting raw materials for tool-making was about 600,000 years later than the Nyayanga site.",
      "Researchers said it's unclear who these early toolmakers were \u2014 whether members of the Homo genus or a related but extinct branch of the family tree, such as Paranthropus.",
      "Homo sapiens did not arise until much later, around 300,000 years ago.",
      "But the knack for seeking out the best raw materials to make simple technology dates back nearly 3 million years. \u201cWe today are a species that's still technology-dependent \u2014 using tools to spread around the world and adapt to different environments,\u201d said Finestone.",

      "Lucy was recovered in Ethiopia in 1974 from what was an ancient lake near fossilized remains of crocodiles, turtle eggs and crab claws. She was a member of Australopithecus afarensis, an early human species that lived in Africa between about 4 million and 3 million years ago.",
      "This is the second time Lucy has left Ethiopia. The first was in 2013, when she toured the United States.",

      "Federal officials say Arizona, Nevada and Mexico must again live with less Colorado River water as drought lingers in the West",
      "DENVER -- Arizona, Nevada and Mexico will again live with less water from the Colorado River as drought lingers in the West, federal officials announced Friday.",
      "The Colorado River is a critical lifeline to seven U.S. states, 30 Native American tribes, and two Mexican states. The cuts are based on projections for levels at federal reservoirs \u2014 chief among them Lake Powell and Lake Mead \u2014 released every August by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation.",
      "Arizona will again go without 18% of its total Colorado River allocation, while Mexico loses 5%. The reduction for Nevada \u2014 which receives far less water than Arizona, California or Mexico \u2014 will stay at 7%. California won't face any cuts because it has senior water rights and is the last to lose in times of shortage.",
      "Decades of overuse and the effects of long-term drought worsened by climate change means there\u2019s far more demand for water than what actually flows through the river. Low reservoir levels at Lake Mead have triggered mandatory cutbacks every year since 2022, with the deepest cuts in 2023, which hit farmers in Arizona the hardest.",
      "Meanwhile, the states are working to reach agreement by next year on new long-term rules to govern the river in dry years. The Trump administration gave a mid-November deadline for states to reach a preliminary agreement, or risk federal intervention. Negotiations have faced delays as states push back against how much water they should each give up.",
      "The original 1922 Colorado River Compact was calculated based on an amount of water that doesn't exist in today's climate. That leaves the Upper Basin states of New Mexico, Colorado, Wyoming and Utah to share far less water after the required amount is sent to the to the \u201cLower Basin\u201d states of Nevada, Arizona and California. Lots of water is also lost to evaporation and leaky infrastructure.",
      "Fairly splitting the river's water in the era of climate change has been vexing for years, with all of the major users hesitant to give anything up as they anticipate a drier future. There has to be enough water in the reservoirs to reach the tunnels that usher water downstream, and ideally, even more water for hydropower generation. Key infrastructure like the Hoover Dam rely on certain water levels in Lake Mead to generate electricity.",
      "Mandatory cuts and emergency water releases are \u201creactive,\" said John Berggren, a regional policy manager at Western Resource Advocates, a nonprofit focused on climate change.",
      "\u201cIf we are going to be able to have a sustainable Colorado River and not just be responding to crisis after crisis, we need large amounts of flexibility built into this new set of guidelines,\" he said.",

      "The Lower Basin states have helped stave off deeper cuts by coming up with voluntary conservation plans.",
      "\u201cAbsent all of those measures, the river would be in a very bad place,\u201d said J.B. Hamby, chairman of the Colorado River Board of California and a board member for the Imperial Irrigation District, the largest user of the river's water. Still, he knows California, like others, will likely have to give up more in the negotiations.",

      "In a 323-page opinion, all five judges in the Appellate Division's First Department agreed that the half-billion-dollar penalty imposed on Trump should be thrown out.",
      "Two of the judges said Trump was properly held liable for business fraud, but the fine was excessive. Two of the judges said the trial court was wrong to decide Trump committed fraud and the case should be retried -- nonetheless, those two judges said they joined the decision \"with great reluctance\" to allow the case to proceed on appeal to the state's highest court.",
      "A fifth judge said New York Attorney General Letitia James should not have brought the case in the first place.",
      "\"The documentary evidence supports Supreme Court's conclusion that the Attorney General made a prima facie showing that each defendant participated in the fraudulent scheme,\" the opinion said. \"The trial record is also replete with evidence supporting the court's determination that the individual defendants had the requisite intent to defraud, a necessary element of each Penal Law claim.\"",
      "However, said the opinion, \"while harm certainly occurred, it was not the cataclysmic harm that can justify a nearly half billion-dollar award to the State.\"",
      "James, in a statement released following the decision, said that her case \"has merit\" and that she will appeal to the state's highest court in an attempt to reinstate the penalty.",
      "\"The First Department today affirmed the well-supported finding of the trial court: Donald Trump, his company, and two of his children are liable for fraud. The court upheld the injunctive relief we won, limiting Donald Trump and the Trump Organization officers' ability to do business in New York,\" the statement said. \"We will seek appeal to the Court of Appeals and continue to protect the rights and interests of New Yorkers.\"",
      "\"Today's ruling by the New York appeals court is a resounding victory for President Trump and his company,\" said Trump's former personal attorney Alina Habba, who helped represent Trump in the case and was later named interim U.S. attorney for New Jersey. \"The court struck down the outrageous and unlawful $464 million penalty, confirming what we have said from the beginning: the Attorney General's case was politically motivated, legally baseless, and grossly excessive.\"",

      "Federal Jobs Minister Patty Hajdu said now is not the time to take risks with the economy, noting the unprecedented tariffs the U.S. has imposed on Canada. The intervention means the 10,000 flight attendants will return to work soon.",
      "The government\u2019s action came less than 12 hours after workers walked off the job.",
      "\"The talks broke down. It is clear that the parties are not any closer to resolving some of the key issues that remain and they will need help with the arbitrator,\u201d Hajdu said.",
      "Hajdu said the full resumption of services could take days, noting it is up to the Canada Industrial Relations Board. Meanwhile, Wesley Lesosky, president of the Air Canada Component of the CUPE union, accused the government of violating the flight attendants' constitutional right to strike \u2014 and decried Hajdu for only waiting hours to intervene.",
      "\u201cThe Liberal government is rewarding Air Canada\u2019s refusal to negotiate fairly by giving them exactly what they wanted,\u201d Lesosky said.",
      "Air Canada did not immediately have additional comments when reached Saturday afternoon. But Air Canada Chief Operating Officer Mark Nasr previously said it could take up to a week to fully restart operations. It's likely that travelers will continue to see disruptions in the coming days.",
      "The shutdown of Canada\u2019s largest airline early Saturday is impacting about 130,000 people a day, and some 25,000 Canadians may be stranded. Air Canada operates around 700 flights per day.",
      "According to numbers from aviation analytics provider Cirium, Air Canada had canceled a total of 671 flights by Saturday afternoon \u2014 following 199 on Friday. And another 96 flights scheduled for Sunday were already suspended.",
      "Hajdu ordered the Canada Industrial Relations Board to extend the term of the existing collective agreement until a new one is determined by the arbitrator.",
      "\u201cCanadians rely on air travel every day, and its importance cannot be understated,\u201d she said.",
      "Union spokesman Hugh Pouliot didn\u2019t immediately know what day workers would return to work. \u201cWe\u2019re on the picket lines until further notice,\u201d he said.",
      "The bitter contract fight escalated Friday as the union turned down Air Canada\u2019s prior request to enter into government-directed arbitration, which allows a third-party mediator to decide the terms of a new contract.",
      "Flight attendants walked off the job around 1 a.m. EDT on Saturday. Around the same time, Air Canada said it would begin locking flight attendants out of airports.",
      "Ian Lee, an associate professor at Carleton University\u2019s Sprott School of Business, earlier noted the government repeatedly intervenes in transportation strikes.",
      "\u201cThey will intervene to bring the strike to an end. Why? Because it has happened 45 times from 1950 until now,\u201d Lee said. \u201cIt is all because of the incredible dependency of Canadians.\u201d",
      "Last year, the government forced the country\u2019s two major railroads into arbitration with their labor union during a work stoppage. The union for the rail workers is suing, arguing the government is removing a union\u2019s leverage in negotiations.",
      "The Business Council of Canada had urged the government to impose binding arbitration in this case, too. And the Canadian Chamber of Commerce welcomed the intervention.",

      "\u201cWhat\u2019s stressful is to not hear anything from Air Canada,\u201d said Reyt, who is trying to return to Montreal, where he is an associate professor of organizational behavior at McGill University. He said he only received one email from the airline on Thursday warning of potential strike disruptions, but had no further information as of Saturday evening in Cannes, where he was visiting family.",
      "Reyt assumes his upcoming flight could be canceled \u2014 much like the scores of other lengthy disruptions this weekend. \u201cI\u2019m just very surprised that Air Canada let it go this far,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s really a bit disheartening that they fly you somewhere abroad and then they just don\u2019t fly you back.\u201d",
      "Jennifer MacDonald, of Halifax, Nova Scotia, expressed similar frustration. She has been trying to help her brother and cousin get home to Edmonton, Alberta since the second leg of their Air Canada trip was canceled during what was supposed to be a 1-hour layover in Montreal on Friday night.",
      "The two had to pay $300 out of their own pocket for a hotel, MacDonald said. All Saturday morning, they tried to look for rebooking options, but everything was sold out, she added. Eventually, they opted to book a new flight for Aug. 22 out of Halifax, with another family member volunteering to make an eight-hour drive to pick them up in Montreal and bring them back east on Saturday.",
      "\u201cIt will be a multiday ordeal and a multi thousand dollar trip,\u201d MacDonald said. But as stressful as the disruptions have been, she added that her family stands in solidarity with the flight attendants. \u201cWe hope that Air Canada lifts the lockout and negotiates fairly.\u201d",
      "Following the news of the Canadian government forcing arbitration on Saturday, Reyt also expressed concern for Air Canada\u2019s flight attendants. \u201cI think the flight attendants are making some reasonable arguments,\u201d he said, adding that he hopes the intervention isn't \"a way just to silence them.\u201d",

      "\u201cWe are heartbroken for our passengers. Nobody wants to see Canadians stranded or anxious about their travel plans but we cannot work for free,\" Natasha Stea, an Air Canada flight attendant and local union president, said before the government intervention was announced.",
      "The attendants are about 70% women. Stea said Air Canada pilots, who are male dominated, received a significant raise last year and questioned whether they are getting fair treatment.",

      "His death was confirmed by the Dr. James Dobson Family Institute.",
      "Born in 1936 in Shreveport, Louisiana, Dobson started a radio show counseling Christians on how to be good parents and in 1977 founded Focus on the Family. At its peak, the organization had more than 1,000 employees and gave Dobson a platform to weigh in on legislation and serve as an adviser to five presidents.",
      "He became a force in the 1980s for pushing conservative Christian ideals in American politics alongside fundamentalist giants like Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson. He campaigned for bringing religious conservatives into the political mainstream, and in 1989, Falwell called Dobson a rising star. Decades later, he served on a board of evangelical leaders that advised President Donald Trump in 2016. He supported Trump in all three of his presidential campaigns.",

      "Dobson left Focus on the Family in 2010 and founded the institute that bears his name. He continued with the Family Talk radio show, which is nationally syndicated and is carried by 1,500 radio outlets with more than half a million listeners weekly, according to the institute.",
      "\u201cDr. Dobson\u2019s impact endures through the many lives he touched, the families he strengthened, and the unshakable faith he proclaimed,\u201d his family said in a statement announcing his death.",
      "Gary Bauer, a senior vice president at Dobson\u2019s institute, called him a \u201cpioneer\u201d who helped families in a world of shifting values. Dobson interviewed President Ronald Reagan in the Oval Office in 1985, thanking him for concentrating on issues important to families.",
      "Dobson's radio program promoted guests who said they abandoned their homosexuality and instead embraced Christianity.",
      "Dobson was not just an influential voice that helped lead the rise of the Christian, conservative movement to today, where such a large portion of Republican voters consider themselves evangelical conservatives. He was also mentor to today\u2019s leading Christian conservative voices.",
      "Dobson, as a board member on Family Research Council, approached Tony Perkins, then a Louisiana state legislator, to become president of the organization. That was after Perkins grew up in his family church, watching Dobson\u2019s films and following his lead with his own work in the Louisiana Legislature.",
      "In Perkins\u2019 first week as president, he and Dobson stood on the steps of the Alabama Supreme Court to support the installation of a monument to the Ten Commandments in the building. The action led to a court case and the monument\u2019s removal.",
      "Dobson belongs on the \u201cMount Rushmore\u201d of the Christian conservatives, Perkins said, notably for leading an evangelical church-driven counter-movement to a family and parenting ethos of the 1960s embodied in the progressive teachings of Dr. Benjamin Spock.",

      "\u201cHe had a big audience. He was not afraid to speak out. He became a very important voice and there was even talk that he might run for president,\u201d said Ralph Reed, a Christian conservative political organizer and lobbyist who founded the Faith and Freedom Coalition. \u201cIf Jim had decided to run, he would have been a major force.\u201d",

      "Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer called the painting over of the crosswalk with rainbow colors often associated with LGBTQ pride a \u201ccallous\u201d and \"cruel political act.\u201d The massacre at the LGBTQ-friendly nightclub in 2016 was the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history at the time.",
      "\u201cThis crosswalk not only enhanced safety and visibility for the large number of pedestrians visiting the memorial, it also served as a visual reminder of Orlando's commitment to honor the 49 lives taken,\u201d Dyer said.",
      "State Sen. Carlos Guillermo Smith, a Democrat from Orlando, called the overnight removal work a cowardly act.",
      "\u201cThey did this in the middle of the night because they were scared of the resistance because they know what they did was wrong,\u201d said Smith, who is openly gay.",
      "The Florida Department of Transportation did not respond to an emailed inquiry seeking comment. The rainbow crosswalk originally was installed in 2017 by the state, Dyer said.",
      "The state transportation agency had been notifying cities around Florida in recent months that they must remove rainbow-colored crosswalks and intersections or they could face the withholding of transportation funds. Among the cities notified were Delray Beach and Key West.",

      "AUSTIN, Texas -- The first domino in a growing national redistricting battle is likely to fall Wednesday as the Republican-controlled Texas legislature is expected to pass a new congressional map creating five new winnable seats for the GOP.",
      "The vote follows prodding by President Donald Trump, eager to stave off a midterm defeat that would deprive his party of control of the House of Representatives, and weeks of delays after dozens of Texas Democratic state lawmakers fled the state in protest. Some Democrats returned Monday, only to be assigned round-the-clock police escorts to ensure their attendance at Wednesday's session. Those who refused to be monitored were confined to the House floor, where they protested on a livestream Tuesday night.",

Democratic state Rep. Nicole Collier started it when she refused to sign what Democrats called the \u201cpermission slip\u201d needed to leave the House chamber, a half-page form allowing Department of Public Safety troopers to follow them. She spent Monday night and Tuesday on the House floor, where she set up a livestream while her Democratic colleagues outside had plainclothes officers following them to their offices and homes.",
      "Dallas-area Rep. Linda Garcia said she drove three hours home from Austin with an officer following her. When she went grocery shopping, he went down every aisle with her, pretending to shop, she said. As she spoke to The Associated Press by phone, two unmarked cars with officers inside were parked outside her home.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a weird feeling,\u201d she said. \u201cThe only way to explain the entire process is: It\u2019s like I\u2019m in a movie.\u201d",
      "The trooper assignments, ordered by Republican House Speaker Dustin Burrows, was another escalation of a redistricting battle that has widened across the country.

      "A longtime adviser to New York City Mayor Eric Adams who resigned from his administration while under FBI scrutiny gave a reporter a potato chip bag filled with cash Wednesday following a campaign event, a gift her lawyer later insisted wasn\u2019t an attempted bribe.",
      "The local news site The City reported the episode hours after one of its reporters said Winnie Greco had pressed a bag of potato chips into her hands containing a red envelope with a $100 bill and several $20 bills.",
      "The reporter, Katie Honan, had scrutinized Greco\u2019s conduct in the past as a major fundraiser for Adams in the Chinese American community.",
      "Greco\u2019s attorney, Steven Brill, told The Associated Press that the situation was being \u201cblown out of proportion.\"",
      "\u201cThis was not a bag of cash,\u201d Brill wrote in an email. \u201cIn the Chinese culture, money is often given to others in a gesture of friendship and gratitude. And that\u2019s all that was done here. Winnie\u2018s intention was born purely out of kindness.\u201d",
      "Asked why Greco wanted to make such a gesture to Honan, Brill said, \u201cShe knows the reporter and is fond of her.\u201d",

      "In response to the report of the bag filled with cash, Adams\u2019 reelection campaign said it had suspended Greco from further work as an unpaid volunteer and that Adams had no prior knowledge of Greco\u2019s actions.",
      "The City reported Greco had texted Honan to meet her inside a Whole Foods store after they both attended the opening of Adams' campaign headquarters in Harlem.",

      "An attorney who helped design the 9/11 victims\u2019 compensation fund says New Hampshire lawmakers have undermined the fairness of a settlement program for abuse victims at the state\u2019s youth detention center",
      "CONCORD, N.H. -- An attorney who helped design and implement the 9/11 victims\u2019 compensation fund says New Hampshire lawmakers have eroded the fairness of a settlement program for those who were abused at the state\u2019s youth detention center.",
      "Deborah Greenspan, who served as deputy special master of the fund created after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, recently submitted an affidavit in a class-action lawsuit seeking to block changes to New Hampshire\u2019s out-of-court settlement fund for abuse victims. She's among those expected to testify Wednesday at a hearing on the state's request to dismiss the case and other matters.",
      "More than 1,300 people have sued the state since 2020 alleging that they were physically or sexually abused as children while in state custody, mostly at the Sununu Youth Services Center in Manchester. Most of them put their lawsuits on hold after lawmakers created a settlement fund in 2022 that was pitched as a \u201cvictim-centered\u201d and \u201ctrauma-informed\u201d alternative to litigation run by a neutral administrator appointed by the state Supreme Court. But the Republican-led Legislature changed that process through last-minute additions to the state budget Gov. Kelly Ayotte signed in June.",
      "The amended law gives the governor authority to hire and fire the fund's administrator and gives the attorney general \u2014 also a political appointee \u2014 veto power over settlement awards. That stands in stark contrast to other victim compensation funds, said Greenspan, who currently serves as a court-appointed special master for lawsuits related to lead-tainted water in Flint, Michigan.",

He is not accused of shooting Young Dolph, but prosecutors claim he directed the two people who did and was criminally responsible for the commission of premeditated murder.",
      "The 12-person jury began deliberating at about 5:15 p.m., after prosecutors and a defense attorney delivered closing arguments.",
      "Young Dolph \u2014 a rapper, independent label owner and producer whose legal name was Adolph Thornton Jr. \u2014 grew up in Memphis and was admired in the city for his charitable works. The 36-year-old was in his hometown to hand out Thanksgiving turkeys to families when his visit to his favorite cookie shop turned into an attack that shocked the entertainment world.",
      "Authorities said two men exited a white Mercedes-Benz and began shooting at the rapper at the bakery on Nov. 17, 2021. He died after being shot about 20 times, according to a medical examiner's report.",
      "Testifying against Govan was Cornelius Smith Jr., who has admitted to being one of the two shooters who ambushed Young Dolph. Smith previously was the main trial witness against Justin Johnson, who was convicted of first-degree murder in 2024 after Smith named him as the second shooter.",
      "Memphis prosecutors have portrayed the killing as part an effort by Anthony \u201cBig Jook\u201d Mims to get revenge on Young Dolph for diss tracks aimed at Big Jook and the record label he helped run for his brother, rapper Yo Gotti. Smith has testified that Big Jook put out a $100,000 hit on Young Dolph as well as smaller bounties on all the artists at Young Dolph\u2019s record label, Paper Route Empire.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration's announcement this week that it would rescind the security clearances of 37 current and former national security officials was hardly an isolated act.",
      "In ordering the revocation of the clearances, President Donald Trump was turning to a favored retributive tactic that he's wielded \u2014 or at least tried to \u2014 against high-profile political figures, lawyers and intelligence officials.",
      "The latest targets include officials who have served in the government across a range of agencies and positions, including on former President Joe Biden's national security team and at the National Security Agency. Some have been vocal critics of Trump and some have worked directly on matters that infuriated him, including an intelligence community assessment that said Russia interfered on his behalf in the 2016 presidential election.",
      "Security clearances are important tools not only for current national security workers but also former ones who may need them to preserve access to sensitive information in their capacity as contractors.",
      "The practical impact is unclear because it's not known how many of the 37 people newly singled out by Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard still have security clearances. But critics have decried the move as an act of retribution meant to chill dissent or make intelligence officials think twice before reaching conclusions, or engaging in work, that anger the president.",
      "A look at some of the other people and industries affected by Trump's security clearance actions:",
      "On his first day in office, Trump moved to revoke the clearances of more than four dozen former intelligence officials who in 2020 had signed on to a letter saying the Hunter Biden laptop saga bore the hallmarks of a \u201cRussian information operation.\u201d",
      "The list includes prominent officials like James Clapper, director of national intelligence under former President Barack Obama; John Brennan and Leon Panetta, who both served as Obama\u2019s CIA directors, and John Bolton, who was fired as Trump\u2019s national security adviser during his first term.",
      "The laptop storyline surfaced after The New York Post in 2020 reported that it had obtained a hard drive of a computer that Hunter Biden had dropped off at a Wilmington, Delaware, repair shop. The newspaper published communications related to the younger Biden's business dealings in Ukraine.",
      "A subsequent letter from 51 former intelligence officials raised alarms about the provenance of emails reported by the Post. The signatories wrote that they didn\u2019t know whether the emails were authentic but that their emergence has \u201call the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation.\u201d",
      "Trump's then-director of national intelligence and current CIA director, John Ratcliffe, contradicted that assessment by saying there was no intelligence to support the idea that Russia had anything to do with Hunter Biden\u2019s laptop.",

      "U.N. counterterrorism experts warn that Islamic State extremists are exploiting instability in Africa and Syria and remain a significant threat in Afghanistan, Central Asia and Europe",
      "UNITED NATIONS -- Islamic State extremists are exploiting instability in Africa and Syria and remain a significant threat in Afghanistan, Central Asia and Europe, U.N. counterterrorism experts said Wednesday.",
      "The militant group is now using advanced technologies, including artificial intelligence, and social media, which poses a new challenge, the experts told a U.N. Security Council meeting.",
      "The Islamic State group declared a self-styled caliphate in a large swath of Syria and Iraq that it seized in 2014. It was declared defeated in Iraq in 2017 following a three-year battle that left tens of thousands of people dead and cities in ruins, but its sleeper cells remain in both countries and it has affiliates and supporters in many other countries.",
      "The U.N. has seen a resurgence of activity by the Islamic State in the Sahel \u2014 in Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger \u2014 and in West Africa the group has emerged \u201cas a prolific producer of terrorist propaganda and attracted foreign terrorist fighters, primarily from within the region,\u201d said Vladimir Voronkov, who heads the U.N. Office of Counter-Terrorism.",
      "He said arrests in Libya have revealed logistics and financing networks with connections to IS in the Sahel.",
      "In Somalia, Voronkov said, a large-scale IS attack was countered by Somali security forces and some 200 IS fighters were killed and over 150 arrested. But he said despite the losses IS still benefits from regional support networks and remains a threat.",
      "In northcentral Africa\u2019s Lake Chad Basin region, the Islamic State is \"increasingly receiving foreign material and human support to conduct its operations, including money, drones and expertise on improvised explosive devices,\u201d said Natalia Gherman, who heads the executive directorate of the U.N. Counter-Terrorism Committee.",
      "\u201cIts ability to adapt and exploit instability continues to pose significant challenges, particularly in parts of Africa,\u201d she said. \u201cThe continent bears over half the world\u2019s fatalities from terrorist attacks.\u201d",

      "In Afghanistan, the Islamic State group\u2019s Khorasan affiliate \u201ccontinues to represent one of the most serious threats to Central Asia and beyond,\u201d Voronkov said, citing its targeting of civilians, minority groups and foreign nationals.",

      "\u201cAlthough AI is being harnessed to amplify the group\u2019s reach and impact, it also holds significant potential for states to enhance the detection, prevention and disruption of terrorist activities,\u201d Gherman said.",
      "Elisa De Anda Madrazo, president of the Financial Action Task Force, which researches how terrorism is financed, said a major change is that \u201cDigital platforms such as social media, messaging apps and crowdfunding systems are increasingly being abused for terrorist financing.\u201d",

      "As students start school this year, 17 states and the District of Columbia are imposing new cellphone restrictions",
      "Jamel Bishop is seeing a big change in his classrooms as he begins his senior year at Doss High School in Louisville, Kentucky, where cellphones are now banned during instructional time.",
      "In previous years, students often weren\u2019t paying attention and wasted class time by repeating questions, the teenager said. Now, teachers can provide \u201cmore one-on-one time for the students who actually need it.\u201d",
      "Kentucky is one of 17 states and the District of Columbia starting this school year with new restrictions, bringing the total to 35 states with laws or rules limiting phones and other electronic devices in school. This change has come remarkably quickly: Florida became the first state to pass such a law in 2023.",
      "Both Democrats and Republicans have taken up the cause, reflecting a growing consensus that phones are bad for kids' mental health and take their focus away from learning, even as some researchers say the issue is less clear-cut.",
      "\u201cAnytime you have a bill that\u2019s passed in California and Florida, you know you\u2019re probably onto something that\u2019s pretty popular,\" Georgia state Rep. Scott Hilton, a Republican, told a forum on cellphone use last week in Atlanta.",
      "Phones are banned throughout the school day in 18 of the states and the District of Columbia, although Georgia and Florida impose such \u201cbell-to-bell\u201d bans only from kindergarten through eighth grade. Another seven states ban them during class time, but not between classes or during lunch. Still others, particularly those with traditions of local school control, mandate only a cellphone policy, believing districts will take the hint and sharply restrict phone access.",
      "For students, the rules add new school-day rituals, like putting phones in magnetic pouches or special lockers.",
      "Students have been locking up their phones during class at McNair High School in suburban Atlanta since last year. Audreanna Johnson, a junior, said \u201cmost of them did not want to turn in their phones\u201d at first, because students would use them to gossip, texting \u201ctheir other friends in other classes to see what\u2019s the tea and what\u2019s going on around the building.\u201d",
      "That resentment is \u201cstarting to ease down\u201d now, she said. \"More students are willing to give up their phones and not get distracted.\u201d",
      "But there are drawbacks \u2014 like not being able to listen to music when working independently in class. \u201cI\u2019m kind of 50-50 on the situation because me, I use headphones to do my schoolwork. I listen to music to help focus,\u201d she said.",
      "In a survey of 125 Georgia school districts by Emory University researchers, parental resistance was cited as the top obstacle to regulating student use of social and digital media.",
      "Johnson\u2019s mother, Audrena Johnson, said she worries most about knowing her children are safe from violence at school. School messages about threats can be delayed and incomplete, she said, like when someone who wasn\u2019t a McNair student got into a fight on school property, which she learned about when her daughter texted her during the school day.",
      "\u201cMy child having her phone is very important to me, because if something were to happen, I know instantly,\u201d Johnson said.",
      "Many parents echo this \u2014 generally supporting restrictions but wanting a say in the policymaking and better communication, particularly about safety \u2014 and they have a real need to coordinate schedules with their children and to know about any problems their children may encounter, said Jason Allen, the national director of partnerships for the National Parents Union.",

      "\u201cThey could focus more on teaching,\u201d Gazmararian said. \u201cThere were just not the disruptions.\u201d",
      "Another benefit: More positive interactions among students. \u201cThey were saying that kids are talking to each other in the hallways and in the cafeteria,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd in the classroom, there is a noticeably lower amount of discipline referrals.\u201d",

      "On Wednesday, McCown joined other Camp Mystic parents, some wearing buttons memorializing \u201cHeaven's 27,\u201d in demanding that Texas lawmakers pass a bill that would boost camp safety, including generally keeping cabins out of flood plains, instituting new requirements for emergency plans and mandating weather radios.",
      "\u201cIt will hurt my family forever that, for reasons I still do not know, these protections were not in place nor thought out thoroughly for my daughter and the rest of the girls here,\u201d he said. \"Please pass this bill, protect our kids and do not let their deaths be in vain.\u201d",
      "McCown's middle child, Linnie, was sandwiched between two brothers. She was sometimes a pest to her 11-year-old brother. But to the youngest, just 3, she was mother figure, making him cereal on weekends so her parents could catch a few minutes of sleep.",
      "\u201cTo everyone else she was a joy,\" her father told lawmakers. \"She hugged her teachers, was a friend to everybody and spread an infectious giggle everywhere she went.\u201d",

      "County leaders were asleep or out of town. The head of Camp Mystic had been tracking the weather beforehand, but it's now unclear whether he saw an urgent warning from the National Weather Service that had triggered an emergency alert to phones in the area, a spokesperson for camp\u2019s operators said in the immediate aftermath.",

    "summary": "A jury found a man not guilty of organizing the daytime ambush killing of rapper Young Dolph at a Memphis bakery in November 2021.",
    "story": [
      "A man on trial for organizing the ambush killing of rapper Young Dolph\u00a0at a Memphis bakery in 2021 has been found not guilty.",
      "A Memphis jury deliberated about three hours before finding Hernandez Govan, 45, not guilty of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit first-degree murder. He rejected an offer from the state last month to settle with a guilty plea, CBS News affiliate WREG\u00a0reported.",
      "On Thursday, Govan hugged his lawyer and thanked Shelby County Judge Jennifer Mitchell after she told him he was free to go.",
      "Govan was not accused of shooting Young Dolph, but prosecutors claimed he directed the two people who did. The jury was not convinced, however, despite a man's testimony that Govan hired him to \"do the hits\" and was going to take $10,000 as his cut.",
      "Govan's lawyer questioned the quality of the police investigation and the validity of cellphone communications between Govan and the men who shot Dolph, arguing that nothing in the communications directly incriminated Govan or tied him to the killings.",
      "Young Dolph, whose legal name is Adolph Thornton Jr., was a rapper, independent label owner and producer who grew up in Memphis and was admired in the city for his charitable works.",
      "On the day of the 2021 ambush, the 36-year-old was in his hometown to hand out Thanksgiving turkeys to families when his visit to his favorite cookie shop turned into an attack that shocked the entertainment world.",
      "Authorities said two men exited a white Mercedes-Benz and began shooting at the rapper at the bakery. He died after being shot about 20 times, according to a medical examiner's report.",
      "Four years earlier, Young Dolph suffered critical injuries\u00a0in a 2017 attack, when three men approached and shot him over \"beef,\" according to the Los Angeles Police Department. Earlier that same year, he had been involved in a separate shooting where at least 100 bullets were fired at his SUV.",
      "Testifying against Govan was Cornelius Smith Jr., who has admitted to being one of the two shooters who ambushed Young Dolph. Smith previously was the main witness against Justin Johnson, who was convicted of first-degree murder in 2024 after Smith named him as the second shooter.",
      "Smith faces charges for murder and conspiracy to commit murder for his alleged role in Young Dolph's death. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges and does not currently have a trial date set. Johnson was originally sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole following his 2024 conviction, plus an additional 35 years for two additional convictions from his trial.",
      "Memphis prosecutors have portrayed Young Dolph's killing as part of an effort by Anthony \"Big Jook\" Mims to get revenge on Young Dolph for diss tracks aimed at Big Jook and the record label he helped run for his brother, rapper Yo Gotti. Smith has testified that Big Jook put out a $100,000 hit on Young Dolph as well as smaller bounties on all the artists at Young Dolph's record label, Paper Route Empire.",
      "At Johnson's earlier trial, a prosecutor told jurors Cocaine Muzik Group (now known as Collective Music Group), a rival record label founded by Yo Gotti, wanted Young Dolph to work for them, but he turned them down.",
      "Big Jook was shot and killed outside a restaurant in January 2024.",
      "Smith testified Monday that \"I didn't know anything about Paper Route having no hits,\" before Govan told him about them. He said Govan hired him to \"do the hits,\" including giving Smith guns for the killing, and was going to take $10,000 as his cut. Govan was also the person who told him and Johnson that Young Dolph would be in Memphis for the Thanksgiving turkey giveaway, so \"that's our opportunity,\" Smith said.",
      "Prosecutors introduced as evidence dozens of cellphone communications between Johnson, Smith, Govan and Big Jook ahead of the shooting.",
      "Meanwhile, Govan's defense attorney, Manny Arora, tried to paint Smith as an unreliable witness who would say anything to try to get a lighter sentence.",
      "Arora pointed to previous testimony where Smith recalled a chance encounter with Big Jook. At the time, Smith implied that Big Jook was the person who hired him. After Smith was arrested, his attorney called Big Jook's attorney and received somewhere between $38,000 and $50,000 in cash. Smith said on Monday that he did not know who had supplied the money.",
      "Smith also testified that he previously heard that Govan might be working with the FBI. Arora asked why Smith would take a job from Govan if that were the case. Smith said Govan was \"innocent until proven guilty.\"",
      "Govan did not testify in his defense.",
      "Smith is charged with murder and conspiracy to commit murder but has pleaded not guilty and does not yet have a trial date.",
      "Johnson was sentenced last September to life in prison with the possibility of parole. He was later sentenced for two other convictions from the trial: conspiracy to commit murder and being a felon in possession of a gun.",

      "According to the campaign, Williams has lost 31 pounds in 8 months using GLP-1s, though it is unclear which drug she has used. The campaign noted she used another GLP-1 provider before Ro, which currently offers Zepbound, Ozempic, Wegovy and Saxenda.",
      "Drugs known as\u00a0GLP-1 receptor agonists\u00a0mimic a hormone in the body known as glucagon-like peptide 1, which helps signal fullness to the brain and regulate blood sugar. Ozempic is typically used for diabetes while Saxenda, Wegovy and Zepbound are approved for weight loss.",
      "Williams, now a celebrity patient ambassador for Ro, also spoke to the stigma surrounding the popular weight loss drugs.",
      "\"If you're on GLP-1s too, don't let anybody tell you it's the 'easy way out.' You're not taking a shortcut, you're taking care of yourself, and that takes courage,\" she said.",
      "In an interview with\u00a0People magazine on Thursday, Williams said she feels \"really good and healthy.\"",
      "\"I feel light physically and light mentally,\" she told the magazine. \"I just can do more. I'm more active. My joints don't hurt as much. I just feel like something as simple as just getting down is a lot easier for me. And I do it a lot faster.\"",

      "Some people have reported severe GI-related issues, including gastroparesis, a paralysis of the stomach also called delayed gastric emptying. This condition is the basis of\u00a0a lawsuit\u00a0filed in 2023, which claims the drug makers failed to warn consumers.",

      "\"Trekkies are some of the most devoted fans I think in fandom history,\" Gooding said. \"To be embraced with open arms, reprising an iconic character, they've been so generous and so kind to me and so receptive of my take of her.\"",
      "The series, the 11th in the Star Trek franchise, takes place a decade before the original show. Gooding plays a young Uhura, a Starfleet cadet specializing in linguistics. Though she comes from a family of Trekkies herself, she admitted she was not very familiar with the franchise before landing the role.",

      "\"She doesn't know her future, so it's probably best to not be too, too informed,\" Gooding said. \"So I'm not playing as if I know what's going to happen to me, because no one knows what tomorrow brings.\"",
      "This week's episode marks a turning point for Uhura, as she faces scrutiny as she navigates her dual identity as both a young woman in her early twenties and a Starfleet officer entrusted with a lot of responsibility.",
      "\"When that responsibility is interrogated, when her contributions to Starfleet are interrogated in a way that she's not expecting, she has to confront her contributions to the institution that is Starfleet in a way that I don't think Star Trek has given audiences a lens into before,\" Gooding said.",
      "The season also introduces lighter moments, including a budding romance.",
      "\"I just was really excited for her to have some levity and some joy and some flirtation,\" Gooding said. \"A little quasi workplace romance can't hurt anybody in the fictional world. It's just fun to play a recognizable, playful version of this character.\"",

Early on, he shared an apartment with fellow up-and-coming actor Michael Caine (they also shared the same suit for auditions). After making his screen debut as the title character in \"Billy Budd,\" Stamp appeared with Laurence Olivier in \"Term of Trial,\" Monica Vitti in \"Modesty Blaise,\" and Julie Christie in \"Far From the Madding Crowd.\" He appeared in several European films (\"Teorema,\" \"Hu-Man,\" \"The Divine Nymph\"), but he spent much of the '70s on a spiritual quest in India after years of unemployment, believing he has aged out of his early, youthful roles which had played off his dashing good looks.",

Stamp claimed \"Superman\" was the only successful film he'd ever been in, but it left its mark: \"I can rarely get through the day without somebody coming up to me and saying, 'Kneel before Zod!'\" he said.",
      "His film and TV credits included \"Meetings With Remarkable Men,\" \"The Hit,\" \"Legal Eagles,\" \"The Company of Wolves,\" \"Wall Street,\" \"Young Guns,\" \"Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace,\" \"Bowfinger,\" \"His Dark Materials,\" \"Unfinished Song,\" \"Wanted,\" \"The Adjustment Bureau,\" \"A Song for Marion,\" \"Bitter Harvest,\" and \"Last Night in Soho.\" He spent much of his later career playing darker, villainous (but still charismatic) characters.",
      "He published several memoirs, including \"Stamp Album,\" \"Coming Attractions,\" \"Double Feature,\" and \"The Ocean Fell into the Drop.\"",
      "In 1987,\u00a0Stamp told BBC Radio's \"Desert Island Discs\": \"I have a lot of things in my head. Obviously I'm kind of, there's a lot of time when I'm fueled by kind of high-up pain. As an actor, I get a chance to express all the different things that come up out of it. And so, it's a kind of release, it's like a safety valve. The big energy can be channeled into something productive. I think if I didn't have that outlet, then I would be somebody who vacillated from terrific ups to terrific downs, and I consider that psychotic.\" He added, \"I'm lucky because I can do something with all these things that occur to me, I can channel them.\""

    "summary": "Whimsical and romantic, the music of Icelandic singer and cellist Laufey L\u00edn Bing J\u00f3nsd\u00f3ttir blends pop, jazz, classical and bossa nova \u2013 a \"mishmash,\" she calls it. Her latest album is \"A Matter of Time.\"",
    "story": [
      "Laufey's music may not be what you usually think of as \"pop,\" but if pop is short for popular, then she is indeed a pop star. The 26-year-old Icelander has earned a devoted following blending modern lyrics and music with classical and jazz. \"My music is such a combination of the sounds of my childhood,\" she said. \"It's just something that's become a part of me. I wanted to make things that made me happy.",
      "\"I loved Golden Age musicals,\" said Laufey. \"I'd watch 'Carousel' and 'Oklahoma' and 'American in Paris' and 'Sound of Music.' They were so beautiful and had these dance breaks and the dresses were floating and the colors \u2013 that feeling I got from that, I just wanted to create that feeling.\"",
      "The world she inhabits (in her work, anyway) is whimsical and romantic, full of windswept cliffs, frilly dresses and bows \u2026 and cello, almost always cello.",
      "Watch Laufey perform \"I Wish You Love\" with the Iceland Symphony Orchestra:",
      "She says the cello is \"as important to me as my voice. And I think it's really what makes a Laufey song a Laufey song.\"",
      "Laufey L\u00edn Bing J\u00f3nsd\u00f3ttir comes by it naturally. Her Icelandic father introduced her to jazz when she was a girl; her Chinese mother played classical violin. So does Laufey's identical twin sister.",
      "Growing up, she said, she felt different: \"Everyone was like, you know, going to play soccer after school or dance, and I was sitting down and playing music from the 17th century. And then on top that I was a twin, identical twin. I just feel, like, weird on top of weird, on top of weird.\"",
      "And things only got weirder when she started singing, as when she appeared on the TV competition \"Iceland's Got Talent\" singing Alicia Keys' \"If I Ain't Got You,\" at age 13: \"I remember going on singing competitions in Iceland when I was younger and they'd always be like, 'She sounds like a 40-year-old woman that's been divorced twice and she chain-smokes cigarettes,'' Laufey said. \"And I was, like, a 13-year-old girl standing on stage being like, okay, like, I just wanted to be a girl. So, yeah I was always a little bit like \u2026 felt a little bit like a circus act.\"",
      "But Laufey found her footing at the Berklee College of Music in Boston. She started posting original songs and jazz covers on social media during the pandemic, and they quickly went viral.",
      "Laufey performs \"I Love You (For Sentimental Reasons\") on guitar and cello:",
      "I asked, \"Were you surprised that people were responding to the jazz influences?\"",
      "\"I was so shocked, because I'd never seen any example of it before,\" Laufey replied. \"And I'd never seen a community of young people \u2026 that was the most shocking part, that it was young people responding to the music. But there was always a part of me that was like, of course, it's the best music in the world!\"",
      "Now she sells out just about every concert \u2013 like a recent one in Norfolk, Virginia, where one fan, Alissa, told us, \"When I first like showed, like, my parents that, they were like, 'This is what you guys listen to?' And I was like, 'Yeah, like, this is what, like, younger people are listening to!'\"",
      "Another fan, Logan, said, \"I feel like she takes just kind of more 'old people music' and pushes it into, like, a newer generation so that more people can enjoy it.\"",
      "Laufey's new album, \"A Matter of Time,\" comes out this week. A stadium tour will follow.",
      "Her songwriting usually starts on guitar, like her bossa nova-influenced \"From the Start.\"",
      "But she just as easily can weave in a little classical, as she did on her last album, \"Bewitched.\" Last year, \"Bewitched\" briefly knocked Frank Sinatra off the top of the jazz charts \u2013 and then, that album won a best traditional pop vocal Grammy Award, beating such artists as Bruce Springsteen.",
      "And then, Barbra Streisand asked Laufey to sing on her recent album of duets, performing a song Laufey wrote, \"Letter to My 13-Year-Old Self.\" \"It's one of those songs that I wrote just in my most intimate moments and could have been a song that I never put out,\" she said. \"It was a song for me to heal myself. But it's a very hopeful song. It's reaching back to tell your younger self that you're going to be okay.\"",
      "Don't you worry 'bout your curly hair Clothes that don't quite fit you anywhere Voices echo in the gym Another girl's had her first kiss Please don't think too much of it, darling",
      "I asked, \"What do you think your 13-year-old self would think of all of this?\"",
      "\"I think she'd be really excited,\" Laufey replied. \"I think she'd be really happy. There's not a single part of myself that has changed any of my artistic interests to follow some sort of trend. And I get to make exactly the music that I loved back then. So, I think I would've been really, really happy.\"",

    "summary": "The former \"Parks and Recreation\" star heads the surreal, critically-acclaimed series about workers at a mysterious corporation whose brains are altered to create distinctly separate personalities in and out of the office.",
    "story": [
      "Adam Scott was once a solid \"that guy\" \u2013 a steadily working actor you might recognize from any number of roles. He's been active since the early nineties, playing everything from Howard Hughes' press agent in \"The Aviator,\" to a pompous jerk in \"Step Brothers.\" He's acted in large ensemble television shows like \"Party Down\" and \"Parks and Recreation.\" But in 2022, when ads started popping up for a new Apple TV+ show called \"Severance,\" with his face front and center, it was a new experience for Scott.",
      "\"It was terrifying, like, truly,\" he said. \"As an actor, it's something you wait your entire career for, your entire life for. But when it happened, I was immediately terrified, and didn't quite know why. I guess I was afraid that it was just gonna end up being embarrassing, and people were gonna make fun of us, and make fun of me.\"",
      "Quite the opposite. \"Severance\" ended up becoming a critically acclaimed hit. The show's second season is nominated for more Emmys than any other show this year (27 in all), including outstanding drama series, and a lead actor nomination for Scott.",
      "Scott's character, Mark, works for a mysterious, seemingly sinister corporation. When he's off the clock, he has no memory of his work life. He is a \"severed\" employee \u2013 a device in his brain separates his office self from his home self.",
      "In this scene, Mark S. (Adam Scott) meets his non-office self, Mark Scout, through video recordings:",
      "I said, \"A lot of people relate to 'Severance' because of that sentiment of like, 'Wouldn't it be nice to turn your brain off from 9:00 to 5:00 and not do my mind-numbing job?'\u00a0 It sounds like you never really had a job like that, though. How do you tap into that?\"",
      "\"It's funny, because the things that ended up really sort of making a difference in my career were, like, 'Parks and Rec' and 'Party Down' and 'Severance,'\" said Scott. \"They are largely shows that are about work. And these are jobs that I've never actually had to participate in in real life, 'cause I was always in a play or doing a guest spot on 'NYPD Blue' or whatever. I guess I relate to these kind of feelings that these characters have because it's been sort of this long path for me in show business.\"",
      "Scott's path began in his hometown of Santa Cruz, California, where he'd spend hours in his room watching, and imitating, actors he saw on David Letterman.",
      "Did the idea of doing it professionally cross his mind? \"100%,\" said Scott. \"In fact, I used to practice on my bed. I would set it up like a couch. I would practice being on David Letterman. I remember I had a project that I would pretend I was promoting, where Harrison Ford and I were playing father-and-son cops. I'm sure I just looked like an insane person.\"",
      "\"For what it's worth I would watch that today,\" I said.",
      "\"I know, it sounds great!\"",
      "After some success in high school plays, Scott moved to Pasadena to attend the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, where he started thinking that \"Adam Scott\" didn't sound dramatic enough: \"When I was in theater school, I really fancied myself as a very serious actor in the vein of Robert De Niro and Al Pacino. In fact, at one point I wanted to change my last name to Quardero. I remember writing on a piece of paper, 'Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, Adam Quardero.' My mother's maiden name was Quartararo.\"",
      "Scott stuck with his last name and, after graduation, stuck it out through the high and lows of building an acting career. \"One thing I always felt that I knew about myself is that I was never going to leave,\" he said. \"I didn't have any other options. But I knew that I was just gonna stick around until something happened, something came together for me.\"",
      "Scott's five seasons on the NBC sitcom \"Parks and Recreation\" took his career to the next level, although it came with an unexpected downside: now that he was so well known for comedy, it was harder to get dramatic roles.",
      "Ben Stiller, one of the executive producers and the primary director of \"Severance,\" said of Scott, \"He'd done, you know, work that was dramatic before, it just wasn't things that, you know, people really hadn't seen as much of it as his comedy work.",
      "He believed Scott had the skills necessary to play what's essentially two roles \u2013 or at least, two parts of the same person \u2013 sometimes transitioning between his severed personalities in a single shot. \"The key to the effect working really is Adam's change of expression, and just how good he is as an actor technically,\" Stiller said. \"He has to get that timing right of the change with the camera effect, so it's not easy to do. He can take a note just, you know, adjust something, you know, minimally, that very few actors I work with can do as well as him.\"",
      "I asked Stiller, \"It seems like you saw that potential early on. Was it a tough sell for the studio to have him front the show?\"",
      "\"You know, they had a different idea in the beginning, but I said, 'Look, Adam, to me, I think he's the guy,\" Stiller replied.",
      "It's clear fans agree. As part of Apple's massive marketing push for \"Severance,\" viewers were invited to an event at the historic former Bell Labs building in Holmdel, New Jersey, which stands in for the headquarters of the show's fictional Lumon Industries.",
      "Scott said, \"Seeing the photos of this place, of the Bell Labs building, it started dawning on me just the scale of the show and what it was exactly that Ben had in mind.\"",
      "Outside of \"Severance,\" Scott's work life and home life revolve around his wife, Naomi. They produce podcasts, films, and TV shows together. They met in the late '90s, which means she's seen him through a number of career ups and downs. \"I kind of learned that there was a cycle of him, you know, picking himself up off the ground, and I did know how to nurture and encourage that,\" Naomi said. \"That, I knew how to do. But it was hard to watch.\"",
      "I asked, \"What's it been like to see people finally see what you've been seeing for all these years?\"",
      "\"Oh, it's very vindicating!\" she laughed. \"I knew it. It's great. I love it.\"",
      "Adam Scott had to audition for \"Severance,\" and fight for the role. Now, with season three already in the works, the actor who always knew he was in it for the long haul is finally getting his due. Though he recognizes that there is no \"Bank of Hollywood\" that is allowing him to cash in after making 30 years of deposits.\u00a0 \"No \u2013 you're entitled to nothing in show business, and I knew that,\" he said. \"But I also knew that there was something I could bring to it that nobody else could. And I knew that I would have to give all of myself to it in order to pull it off. I would have to use absolutely everything I've learned over 30 years if I was gonna do it right. And so, when I was lucky enough to get the job, that's exactly what I did.\"",

    "summary": "Energy suppliers are having trouble keeping up with the rapid increase in demand, and consumers in some states are seeing higher monthly bills.",
    "story": [
      "A July 11 post in a Hoboken, New Jersey, parenting group on Facebook pointed to a frustrating trend: \"Our utility bill is more than double what it was last month. ... Anything we can do about it?\" The post had several dozen replies and most of the commenters said their home utility bills had also risen dramatically.",
      "On the campaign trail a year ago, President Trump vowed, \"Under my administration, we will be slashing energy and electricity prices by half within 12 months \u2014 at a maximum, 18 months,\" but this year has seen energy prices rising in several states. Residents and governors in five East Coast states are blaming electric supplier, PJM Interconnection. The company is the largest grid operator in the U.S., serving 13 states and 65 million customers.",
      "In New Jersey, energy prices increased on June 1, causing a 17-20% jump in residential customers'utility bills. The utility company PSE&G told its New Jersey customers they should expect to see a higher monthly bill of about $183 for the average customer, an increase of $27.",
      "PSE&G attributed the price hike to \"an increase in energy demand combined with the need for new power generation,\" which it said \"has driven higher supply prices.\" As a utility, PSE&G pointed out that it doesn't earn a profit on the electric supply, so \"these costs are passed through directly to customers.\"",
      "PJM says it is experiencing a rapid increase in energy demand, driven by the power requirements of artificial intelligence, data centers, electrification and a resurgence in U.S. manufacturing. In its latest forecast, PJM forecast a growth in energy demand of 5% over the next 10 years.",
      "\"We don't have enough newer, more reliable energy sources,\" said Alex Ambrose, a policy analyst at New Jersey Policy Perspective, a nonpartisan think tank.",
      "Ambrose says that renewable sources like wind, solar, and battery are the cheapest and fastest forms of energy to bring online and faults PJM for its reluctance to bring clean energy into the grid: \"PJM is also keeping older coal gas plants running, even if they are uneconomical and more expensive.\"",
      "But in an op-ed in NJ Spotlight News, the company blamed a shortfall of energy on \"state and federal decarbonization policies and some economic pressures\" for closing fossil fuel-based power plants in New Jersey. PJM also said it has a queue of 63 gigawatts of projects \u2014 enough to power more than 47 million homes \u2014 waiting to be connected by 2026, and an \"overwhelming majority\" of those projects are renewables.",
      "Rising utility bills likely an issue in New Jersey governor's race",
      "Energy Secretary Chris Wright is starting to worry that high energy prices could hurt Republicans at the ballot box. In a recent interview with Politico, he blamed Democratic policies for \"pushing prices up right now,\" but conceded the political reality that Republicans may suffer in the next elections.",
      "\"Who's going to get blamed for it? We're going to get blamed because we're in office,\" he said.",
      "New Jersey is poised to be among the first to test the issue in the governor's race this November.",
      "\"Affordability is the number one issue in this race, and rising energy prices are also at the top of everyone's mind,\" Ambrose told CBS News.",
      "Mikie Sherrill, the Democratic nominee for governor, in July released a statement accusing PJM of \"mismanagement\" of the grid: \"PJM has refused to plug clean, cheap power like solar into the grid, while giving preference to coal and oil.\"",
      "And earlier this month, her opponent, Republican nominee Jack Ciattarelli, wrote in a post on X about \"Rebecca in Highland Park,\" whose electric bill he said had tripled, \"to more than $1000.\"",
      "\"Why? Because Trenton Democrats, with the approval of my opponent Mikie Sherrill, shut down six electricity generation plants around the state, stopped burning natural gas, and didn't expand our nuclear capabilities in South Jersey,\" Ciattarelli said.",
      "\"We can look at how folks are going to vote in this upcoming election, as a reflection on how they're feeling about the country at large,\" says Ambrose, \"This affordability problem is not going away.\"",
      "A Fairleigh Dickinson University poll earlier this month found that 26% of voters blame the utility companies for price hikes, 19% blame Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy, and 10% say that energy producers are at fault. Murphy is not running for reelection due to term limits.",
      "\"Utility bills directly impact elections,\" says Rob Gramlich, president of Grid Strategies, a D.C.-based energy consultancy firm. Gramlich pointed to the most infamous example of this, the California recall election in 2003, prompted in large part by the state's energy crisis. It cost Democrat Gray Davis the governorship and handed it to Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/federal-reserve-jerome-powell-jackson-hole-speech-friday-trump-inflation/",
    "published": "Thu, 21 Aug 2025 16:10:26 -0400",
    "summary": "Jerome Powell will address the state of the U.S. economy \u2014 and perhaps offer hints about interest rates \u2014 in a closely watched speech this week. Here's what to expect.",
    "story": [
      "When Federal Reserve Chair\u00a0Jerome Powell takes the stage Friday at the annual Jackson Hole, Wyoming, economic forum, he will face pressures ranging from President Trump's repeated calls for his resignation to a recent mix of worrying economic data.",
      "Powell, whose term as Fed chair ends in May of 2026, will likely be making his last major speech as the central bank's leader at the event, which is hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. The symposium is closely watched by investors and economists because it provides a stage for Fed officials to share their views on the economy and the direction of monetary policy.",
      "A focal point in Jackson Hole will be if Powell offers any hints about the Fed's next interest-rate decision, scheduled for Sept. 17. Mr. Trump has badgered the Fed to cut rates, pointing to solid U.S. economic data and muted inflation. Powell has mostly shrugged off that pressure, emphasizing that the central bank is taking a \"wait and see\" approach as it monitors the potential impact of the Trump administration's tariffs on consumer prices.",
      "Yet Powell also faces a complicated economic picture, with recent signals pointing to a slowdown in job growth and one gauge of inflation registering its largest increase in three years.",
      "\"You have this political pressure balanced off against the economic pressure, which makes Powell's job particularly difficult, and it's driving a hyper-focus on what he might say on Friday,\" Melissa Brown, managing director of investment decision research at SimCorp, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The Federal Reserve declined to comment ahead of Powell's speech at the Jackson Hole symposium, whose theme this year is \"Labor Markets in Transition: Demographics, Productivity, and Macroeconomic Policy.\"",
      "The Kansas City Fed will broadcast Powell's speech on its YouTube\u00a0channel\u00a0on Friday at 10 a.m. Eastern Time.",
      "To cut or not to cut?",
      "While Powell is likely to discuss economic trends in Jackson Hole, he is virtually certain to demur on the question of when the Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank's 12-person interest rate-setting panel, might choose to lower its benchmark rate.",
      "That is by design. Fed officials famously keep monetary policy decisions \u2014 which are set deliberatively and by consensus \u2014 private before they are officially announced to avoid roiling financial markets and to insulate the central bank from political pressure.",
      "Meanwhile, policy makers will have a chance to assess several major pieces of economic data before their Sept. 16-17 meeting, including the Labor Department's monthly jobs report on Sept. 5 and the Consumer Price Index on Sept. 11.",
      "The head of the labor statistics bureau\u00a0was fired in August after the agency's latest employment figures showed a sharp slowdown in job-creation, prompting Mr. Trump to question the accuracy of the data. For now, the August payrolls and CPI reports remain on the Labor Department's calendar of scheduled releases.",
      "\"I don't think Powell can push the narrative toward cutting because that leaves him no option but to cut,\" said Mike Sanders, head of fixed income at investment management firm Madison Investments.",
      "\"He has to signal, 'We're still data-dependent and we'll see what the data tells us'\" so the Fed doesn't get pushed into a corner, Sanders added.",
      "For their part, investors are clearly placing their bets on the Fed lowering rates in September for the first time since December 2024. Wall Street economists put the likelihood of a cut at 88%, according to financial data company FactSet, with\u00a0 most expecting a 0.25 percentage-point dip.",
      "At last year's Jackson Hole event, Powell signaled that interest-rate cuts were coming after the central bank had previously raised its benchmark rate to its highest level in 23 years in trying to extinguish inflation. The following month, the Fed announced a jumbo cut\u00a0of 0.50 percentage points in a move to boost economic growth.",
      "Dueling mandates",
      "This year, Powell could similarly use his platform in Wyoming to indicate his openness to a rate cut, according to Will Denyer, chief U.S. economist at Gavekal Research. At the same time, the Fed is also \"in a pickle,\" given troubling jobs data and signs that inflation could be creeping higher, he said in a report this week.",
      "That speaks to the Fed's so-called dual mandate, which is to both maximize employment and minimize inflation. Balancing those two goals can require different \u2014 and sometimes conflicting \u2014 policies, as lowering interest rates can boost job growth while causing inflation to tick higher, and vice versa.",
      "\"Data alone suggests a rising risk of a stagflationary scenario, which is, you know, a Fed nightmare,\" Denyer said. \"That puts them in a bind between their two mandates being in conflict.\"",
      "Minutes for the Fed's July 30 rate decision meeting, when the FOMC again chose to hold rates steady, show that some members \"remained worried that supply-chain disruptions could cause inflation to remain stubbornly elevated,\" signaling that price increases remain top of mind, noted Oxford Economics chief U.S. economist Ryan Sweet in a report on Wednesday.",
      "\"The labor market will be the swing factor on whether the Fed cuts interest rates in September or not,\" he added.",

      "About 44% of adults surveyed by Lightspeed Commerce, a provider of point-of-sale technology for hospitality businesses, said they're ordering from the kids' menus at restaurants. Kids' meals are traditionally less expensive than those on adult menus because portion sizes are usually smaller.",
      "The trend comes as some consumers are cutting back on eating out, with McDonald's and Wendy's earlier this month reported\u00a0sluggish breakfast sales. The companies attributed the trend to heightened economic uncertainty and pressures facing low-income consumers.",

    "story": [
      "Cracker Barrel shed almost $200 million in market value after its stock plunged Thursday following the release of a new logo. The new design eliminates a longstanding drawing of an overall-clad man leaning against a barrel, in favor of a cleaner logo featuring just the chain's name.",
      "Shares of Cracker Barrel fell as much as $8.74, or almost 15%, in Thursday trading, shaving as much as $194.6 million from the company's market value. The stock regained some ground in early afternoon trading, with shares down $8.19, or 13.9%, to $50.84.",
      "Wall Street's reaction to the logo redesign comes as Cracker Barrel has been working to refresh its image through new menu items and redecorated stores that eschew the 55-year-old chain's old-timey approach in favor of a more modern look.",
      "According to the company's website, the man and barrel in the old logo represented \"the old country store experience where folks would gather around and share stories.\"",
      "It's unusual for a company's share price to plunge dramatically due to a logo redesign, although marketing missteps can cause investors to question a company' strategy. Cracker Barrel's overhaul has been overseen by CEO Julie Felss Masino, who last year described the chain as \"not as relevant as we once were,\" and announced plans to update its down-home menu.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Cracker Barrel said that the man portrayed in the logo, known as \"Uncle Herschel,\" will remain \"front and center in our restaurants and on our menu.\"",
      "\"Our values haven't changed, and the heart and soul of Cracker Barrel haven't changed,\" the company said.",
      "The new logo, which will appear on menus and marketing materials, \"is now rooted even more closely to the iconic barrel shape and wordmark that started it all,\" the company said in an Aug. 18 press release.",
      "Conservative commentators took issue with the rebrand, with right-wing podcaster Matt Walsh calling it \"more generic\" on social media. Marketing experts also criticized the company's overhaul. Bolt Health founder Kevin Dahlstrom, who has served as a chief marketing officer at several companies in the financial industry, described Crack Barrel's rebrand as a \"fiasco.\"",
      "\"The holy grail of marketing is to create a brand that customers give a damn about \u2014 and feel some ownership of. It's exceedingly rare and when you have that \u2014 as Cracker Barrel did \u2014 you NEVER EVER abandon it, you only double down on it,\" Dahlstrom wrote on social media.",

At the time, they announced a sweeping trade deal that imposed 15% tariffs on most European goods, warding off the Mr. Trump's threat of a 30% rate if no deal was reached by Aug. 1.",

      "Through a partnership with Zipline, a drone delivery and logistics provider, Chipotle is introducing Zipotle, new delivery service for its customers. With Zipotle, small aircrafts called Zips can deliver digital orders directly to customers' homes in just a few minutes, Chipotle said\u00a0in an announcement on Thursday.",
      "Initially, just \"a small number\" of customers will be able to experience Zipotle, according to Chipotle, which said that it would expand the service in the coming weeks.",
      "The burrito chain is touting Zipotle as a superior delivery service that helps customers get their food faster, so that it stays fresh. Everything on Chipotle's menu is available for drone delivery in the Dallas area, the company added. Orders for Zipotle delivery need to be placed through the Zipline app, available through the Apple and Android app stores.",
      "Here's how it works",
      "Once a customer places an order, a Chipotle worker then packs it and places it at a Zipping Point where a Zip drone picks up the order and delivers it to the customer. When the autonomous aircraft arrives at a customer's home, it hovers about 300 feet in the air while lowering and \"gently\" placing the order on the ground, the company states.",
      "Chipotle said the first location to offer Zipotle delivery is at 3109 Lakeview Pkwy, in Rowlett, a suburb in the eastern part of Dallas.",
      "\"Zipotle is a quick and convenient source of delivery that lets guests enjoy our real food from places that are traditionally challenging to serve, including backyards and public parks,\" Curt Garner, president and chief strategy and technology officer at Chipotle said in the announcement.",

      "For now, each autonomous aircraft can carry orders of up to 5.5 pounds in weight. That will increase eventually to 8 pounds, Chipotle said.",
      "Last year, Chipotle was criticized by some customers who alleged certain restaurants were\u00a0skimping on portions. The company initially denied the claims, before then CEO Brian Niccol\u00a0acknowledged that about 10%\u00a0of Chipotle's 3,500 locations had indeed been underserving customers.",

      "Filed in California federal court, the lawsuit accused Fitness International and Fitness & Sports Clubs of intentionally using complicated cancellation procedures to prevent their customers from ending their gym memberships and other recurring charges. The California-based companies \"have illegally charged hundreds of millions of dollars in unwanted recurring fees\" as a result, the FTC said in its complaint.",
      "Fitness International and Fitness & Sports Clubs run gym chains including L.A. Fitness, Esporta Fitness, City Sports Club and City Studio, according to the FTC, which said they collectively operate more than 600 gym locations and have upwards of 3.7 million members nationwide.",
      "\"The FTC's complaint describes a scenario that too many Americans have experienced \u2013 a gym membership that seems impossible to cancel,\" said Christopher Mufarrige, the director of the Consumer Protection Bureau, in a\u00a0statement\u00a0released by the trade commission. \"Tens of thousands of LA Fitness customers reported difficulties \u2013 cancellation was often restricted to specific times or required speaking to specific managers who were often not present or available.\"",
      "Both companies offer gym memberships for fees as low as $30 per month and as high as $299 per month, and require customers to pay for the first and last month of their memberships upfront before incurring monthly dues and annual fees, the FTC said.

      "\"Each of these cancellation methods is opaque, complicated, and demanding\u2014far from simple,\" the complaint said. \"In particular, Defendants have not adequately disclosed how to cancel when consumers are signing up for their memberships and have presented different, often contradictory, cancellation requirements during sign up, in membership agreements, and on the Defendants' websites.\"",

      "But it's Walmart that serves as a barometer of spending given its outsized power in American retailing. The company maintains that 90% of U.S. households rely on Walmart for a range of products, and more than 150 million customers shop on its website or in its stores every week.",
      "Walmart said\u00a0in May\u00a0that prices had started to increase in late April and got higher in May. But it said Thursday that it had introduced 7,400 price rollbacks, or temporary discounts, across the aisles in the latest quarter.",

      "Global e-commerce sales rose 25%, above the 22% growth in the fiscal first quarter.",
      "Despite Walmart's solid quarter, its stock price was down more than 2% early Thursday as its earnings per share came in below what analysts had expected. Analysts were expecting 73 cents per share on sales of $175.93 billion for the quarter, according to FactSet.",

    "title": "4 reasons why the Trump tariffs haven't caused U.S. inflation to soar",
    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-tariffs-trump-inflation-prices/",
    "published": "Thu, 21 Aug 2025 08:56:31 -0400",
    "summary": "For months, economists warned that the Trump administration's sweeping tariffs would sharply boost consumer prices. Here's why it hasn't happened.",
    "story": [
      "Despite a barrage of new tariffs imposed by the Trump administration this year on dozens of U.S. trade partners, the prices of goods and services across the U.S. have defied many economists' expectations and remained relatively stable.",
      "Economists caution that just because tariffs have yet to trigger a renewed bout of inflation, there is no guarantee that prices won't surge later this year. They note that recent data shows a modest rise in the cost of items including clothing, home furnishings and appliances.",
      "Tariffs \u2014 meaning the rate importers must pay at the border for imported goods \u2014 also take a long time to seep into the economy. That's because companies often try to hold off on passing along higher costs to customers to avoid losing market share to rivals.",
      "Yet experts acknowledge that tariffs have yet to unleash the kind of severe inflationary pressures that could cause prices to spike. For their part, White House officials have consistently maintained that foreign exporters \u2014 not American consumers \u2014 will bear the brunt of added tariff costs.",
      "\"Despite the doom-and-gloom predictions of inflation and recession, it's been months since Liberation Day, and inflation is trending towards an annualized rate not seen since President Trump's first term, while a recent [Council of Economic Advisers] analysis found that prices of imported goods are actually declining,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch, alluding to the baseline and other tariffs President Trump originally announced on April 2.",
      "Here are four reasons economists say explain why inflation isn't jumping despite the highest U.S. tariffs in decades.",
      "Tariffs aren't as high as many people expected",
      "Despite President Trump's many threats to jack up levies on imports, the actual average tariff rate being charged on U.S. imports is not as high as what has been announced, data shows.",
      "The average tariff rate on U.S. imports in June was 9% \u2014 well below the 15% that many economists were forecasting earlier this year following Mr. Trump's\u00a0slew of tariff announcements, according to investment advisory firm Capital Economics.",
      "\"It's not so much that the reaction to tariffs has been low, it's that the effective tariff rate increase has been relatively limited up until June,\" Mark Cus, an economist at Barclays, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Actual U.S. tariffs remain lower than earlier estimates in part because countries facing steeper levies are sending fewer goods to the U.S., according to Barclays and Capital Economics. By contrast, countries with below average tariff rates are shipping more goods to the U.S.",
      "The upshot: Average tariff rates on imports are lower than many economists were projecting earlier this year.",
      "Additionally, many goods imported into the U.S. have been exempted from steeper tariffs. Of the roughly $258 billion worth of imports that hit the U.S. retail market in June, only 48% were subject to tariffs, Barclays data shows. For example, pharmaceuticals, some electronics and many imports from Canada and Mexico are exempt from any new tariffs.",
      "\"While dutiable goods face elevated tariff rates, a substantial portion of U.S. imports remains duty-free,\" Barclays analysts said in a recent report. \"This is a major contributor to the low effective tariff rate.\"",
      "Companies stocked up before higher tariffs kicked in",
      "U.S. retailers built up their inventories earlier this year in expectation that the Trump administration would hike tariffs on imported products and parts. Many retailers are still selling those non-tariffed products, allowing them to delay price hikes, experts said.",
      "For example, \"There was a big jump in imports of goods from Canada that would later be tariffed before the tariffs kicked in, and perhaps imports of those goods in May and June were relatively low, and that shows up as a smaller amount of dutiable goods,\" Barclays' Cus told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Eventually, experts warn, retailers will exhaust those lower-cost goods imported earlier in the year, which could lead to higher prices down the road.",
      "Retailers are swallowing the costs \u2014 for now",
      "For now, many retailers are eating the additional tariff costs.",
      "Businesses \"have been willing to absorb the initial hit via lower margins, although we suspect that was mostly a temporary development as those firms waited for more clarity on where tariff rates would settle,\" analysts with investment adviser Capital Economics said in a recent report.",
      "\"We doubt that is a sustainable outcome over the longer term, however. As the uncertainty over tariff levels eases over the next couple of weeks, giving retailers more clarity on rates over the next year or two, we would expect more firms to raise prices,\" they said.",
      "Tariffs tend to boost inflation gradually",
      "Tariffs typically take many months to seep into company supply chains and and show up in the prices consumers pay at the store.",
      "The full impact of tariffs plays out not immediately but over an extended period of time, peaking roughly a year after they take effect, a June Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas\u00a0report\u00a0noted. That means any U.S. tariffs imposed this year\u00a0would be unlikely to have much of an impact on inflation until later this year and into 2026.",
      "\"Up to now there has been only limited passthrough from tariffs into final consumer prices, but we still expect the impact to gradually mount in the second half of this year,\" Capital Economics analysts said in a report.",
      "A final possibility is that the fears that the Trump administration's turn toward protectionist trade policies would trigger another severe bout of inflation are overblown. The White House has maintained that such a shift will protect jobs and make the U.S. more competitive globally.",
      "\"The Administration has consistently maintained that the cost of tariffs will be paid by foreign exporters who rely on access to the American economy, the world's best and biggest consumer market,\" the White House's Desai said in a statement.",

      "Amid growing concerns about the environmental impact of artificial intelligence, Google says it has calculated the energy required for its Gemini AI service: Sending a single text prompt consumes as much energy as watching television for nine seconds.",
      "The technology giant on Thursday unveiled a new methodology to measure the environmental impact of its AI models, including energy and water consumption as well as carbon emissions.",
      "AI tools have the potential to drive economic growth by boosting productivity and unlocking other efficiencies, economists say. By one estimate from Goldman Sachs, the tech is poised to increase global GDP by 7%, or $7 trillion, over 10 years.",
      "At the same time, scientists are flagging the outsized environmental impact of AI, which is not yet fully understood even as data centers require enormous amounts of electricity.",
      "\"In order to improve the energy efficiency of AI, a clear and comprehensive understanding of AI's environmental footprint is important. To date, comprehensive data on the energy and environmental impact of AI inference has been limited,\" Ben Gomes, Google's senior vice president of learning and sustainability, said in a blog post Thursday.",
      "Aside from their electricity needs, AI data centers also require \"a great deal of water ... \u00a0to cool the hardware used for training, deploying, and fine-tuning generative AI models, which can strain municipal water supplies and disrupt local ecosystems,\" research from MIT\u00a0shows. \"The increasing number of generative AI applications has also spurred demand for high-performance computing hardware, adding indirect environmental impacts from its manufacture and transport.\"",
      "Some new data centers require energy between 100 and 1000 megawatts, roughly equivalent to powering 80,000 to 800,000 homes, according to an April GAO report. For now, however, there are\u00a0no regulations that require corporations to disclose how much energy or water their AI tools consume.",
      "Google said in a technical paper released Thursday by its AI energy and emissions researchers that as adoption of AI tools rises, \"so does the need to understand and mitigate the environmental impact of AI serving.\"",
      "What's the environmental impact of Gemini AI?",
      "Google's new paper on the environmental impact of its own AI tools aims to set a standard for measuring the energy and water consumption as well as carbon emissions of various AI models, the company said.",
      "A typical Gemini text query uses 0.24 watt-hours (Wh) of energy, emits 0.03 grams of carbon dioxide equivalent (gCO2e), and consumes 0.26 milliliters \u2014 or about five drops \u2014 of water.",
      "By comparison, the average ChatGPT query uses 0.34 Wh and about one fifteenth of a teaspoon of water, Sam Altman, CEO of ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, has written.",
      "Google also outlined the progress it has made in reducing the environmental impact of its Gemini platform. Over a recent 12-month period, the energy consumption and carbon footprint of the median Gemini text prompt decreased by factors of 33x and 44x, respectively, it said.",
      "The quality of Gemini's responses also improved over the same time period, the company said.",

      "President Trump called on Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook to resign on Wednesday after one of his administration's officials alleged she had engaged in mortgage fraud and urged an investigation.",
      "Bill Pulte, who Mr. Trump appointed as director of the U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency in March, made the allegations on X, claiming Cook committed mortgage fraud after designating two homes as her primary residence.",
      "The housing regulator also shared an August 15\u00a0letter he sent to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi and Department of Justice official Ed Martin outlining the alleged mortgage fraud. The letter points to documents obtained by the agency, which Pulte claims show Cook falsified bank and property records to \"obtain more favorable loan terms.\"",
      "Pulte alleges Cook pledged in a June 2021 mortgage agreement to buy an Ann Arbor, Michigan, property that she would make the home her primary residence for at least one year, but then two weeks later purchased an Atlanta condominium, which she allegedly also agreed to make her primary residence for a year.",
      "Mortgage rates for primary homes are typically lower than those offered by banks for secondary residences, such as vacation homes or investment properties,\u00a0according to Rocket Mortgage.",
      "In response to Pulte's allegations, Mr. Trump wrote \"Cook must resign, now!!!\" on Truth Social Wednesday morning. The president has also told aides he is considering firing Cook, according to the Wall Street Journal, which cited a senior White House official and another person familiar with the matter.",
      "Pulte also called on the Federal Reserve governor to resign, and said on X that he believes the Justice Department will open a criminal investigation into the alleged mortgage fraud.",
      "The White House did not offer additional comment.",
      "Cook says she won't quit",
      "Cook late Wednesday said she wouldn't leave her post at the Fed. \"I have no intention of being bullied to step down from my position because of some questions raised in a tweet,\" she said in a statement issued by the Fed.",
      "\"I do intend to take any questions about my financial history seriously as a member of the Federal Reserve and so I am gathering the accurate information to answer any legitimate questions and provide the facts,\" she added.",
      "Mr. Trump's call for her to resign comes as the president has been urging the Fed to cut interest rates, while deriding\u00a0Chairman Jerome Powell over the Fed's caution in lowering borrowing costs. Cook holds one of the seats on the 12-person Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, the group at the central bank that makes the decision on whether to cut, hold or raise interest rates based on a majority vote among its members.",
      "Fed set to cut interest rates?",
      "The president has also been\u00a0pushing\u00a0Congress to confirm the nomination of Stephen Miran to the Fed's Board of Governors. Mr. Trump\u00a0appointed Miran, one of his top economic advisers, to serve on the board on an interim basis earlier this month following the resignation of Gov. Adriana Kugler.",
      "Removing Cook from her role and adding Miran \"would not materially alter the composition of the FOMC,\" noted Jaret Seiberg, an analyst with TD Securities, in a research note.",
      "It's also unlikely Miran could be confirmed before the Fed announces its next rate decision on Sept. 17 because the Senate doesn't reconvene until Sept. 2, and a vote would require an \"aggressive schedule\" by the Senate banking committee, Seiberg added.",
      "Wall Street expects Mr. Trump's fervent wish for a rate cut to be granted soon, with economists pegging the probability at 88% that the Fed will lower rates on Sept. 17, according to financial data company FactSet.",
      "In the meantime, Seiberg said he views it as unlikely that Cook will resign before the September Fed meeting.",
      "\"For Cook, resigning will not end the legal probe. It is why we see no incentive for her to react to Pulte by departing before the next FOMC meeting,\" he wrote.",
      "Cook joined the Fed's Board of Governors in May 2022, according to her biography. Prior to her appointment, Cook was an economics professor at Michigan State University.

    "summary": "Some packages of Great Value frozen shrimp sold at Walmart are at risk for potential for Cesium-137 contamination, the FDA says.",
    "story": [
      "Walmart said it is recalling some frozen shrimp after the Food and Drug Administration warned that the seafood items, sold under the Great Value label, are at risk of radioactive contamination and shouldn't be consumed.",
      "The frozen shrimp were imported from Indonesian company PT. Bahari Makmur Sejati and sold at Walmart stores as Great Value brand frozen raw shrimp, the FDA said on Tuesday. The agency noted it has recommended that Walmart recall the product.",
      "\"The health and safety of our customers is always a top priority. We have issued a sales restriction and removed this product from our impacted stores. We are working with the supplier to investigate,\" Walmart said in an email to CBS News.",
      "The company added that consumers who bought the shrimp shouldn't eat it and should throw it out. Customers can contact the store where they purchased the product for a full refund, it added.",
      "The shrimp could be contaminated with a radioactive isotope called Cesium-137, although the FDA said that no products as of yet have tested positive for it. The agency said it issued the warning about Walmart's Great Value shrimp after it had detected Cesium-137 in a single shipment of frozen shrimp from PT. Bahari Makmur Sejati.",
      "That shipment \"did not enter U.S. commerce,\" the FDA said.",
      "Here's what to know about the warning.",
      "Which shrimp products are part of the FDA warning?",
      "The FDA said that consumers \"should not eat or serve certain lots of Great Value raw frozen shrimp from Walmart.\"",

      "What should you do if you bought the shrimp?",
      "Consumers who bought the shrimp cited in the FDA's notice should throw it away, the agency said.",
      "\"Distributors and retailers should dispose of this product and should not sell or serve this product,\" the FDA added.",
      "What is Cesium-137?",
      "Cesium-137, or Cs-137, is the radioactive form of the element cesium, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Produced by nuclear fission, it's used in medical devices and is also a byproduct of nuclear fission in nuclear reactors and weapons testing, the EPA notes.",
      "How dangerous is the potential Cesium-137 contamination?",
      "The Cesium-137 detected in the imported shrimp was about 68 Bq/kg, which the FDA said sits below its threshold of 1200 Bq/kg for \"levels of concern\" for imported foods.",
      "\"At this level, the product would not pose an acute hazard to consumers,\" the FDA said in its warning notice.",
      "However, the FDA noted that repeated low-dose exposure to Cesium-137 carries an \"elevated risk of cancer, resulting from damage to DNA within living cells of the body.\"",
      "It added, \"Avoiding products like the shipment FDA tested with similar levels of Cs-137 is a measure intended to reduce exposure to low-level radiation that could have health impacts with continued exposure over a long period of time.\"",

      "The credit ratings agency, which issued its new assessment of the nation's fiscal health late Monday, said that it is holding its AA+/A-1+ rating steady, with a stable outlook.",
      "The fresh analysis comes after Moody's Ratings, another large credit ratings agency, downgraded the U.S. in May, highlighting investor concerns about the nation's growing debt and policy uncertainty sparked by President Trump's trade policies. While S&P highlighted a range of economic concerns in its report, including the impact of new tax cuts against a backdrop of already high U.S. debt and deficits, the agency also underscored the resiliency of the nation's economy as well as the new tariff revenue generated by the Trump administration.",
      "\"Amid the rise in effective tariff rates, we expect meaningful tariff revenue to generally offset weaker fiscal outcomes that might otherwise be associated with the recent fiscal legislation, which contains both cuts and increases in tax and spending,\" S&P analysts wrote in the ratings note.",
      "The report added, \"The ratings on the U.S. are based on its wealthy, diversified and resilient economy, with per capita GDP over $89,000 in 2025. Since the pandemic, U.S. growth has far surpassed that of its peers.\"",
      "The White House didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The fresh ratings assessment comes as the U.S. economy is showing signs of a slowdown, with GDP decelerating to an average rate of 1.25% during the first half of the year, compared with 2.8% in 2024. The job market also faltered in July, with employers adding a disappointing 73,000 jobs last month,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Labor Department \u2014 far fewer than economists had forecast.",
      "The weak jobs data suggests that businesses are delaying hiring amid the uncertainty created by the Trump administration's new tariff regime, which has been exacerbated by numerous postponements and rate changes.",
      "Amid those headwinds, the revenue generated from tariffs is surging: The U.S. government collected about $30 billion from import duties\u00a0in July, according to the Treasury Department. That amounts to a 242% jump in tariff revenue since July 2024.",
      "While that new revenue will help bolster the nation's finances, it comes at a cost to American consumers and businesses, economists say. Tariffs are paid by U.S. importers \u2014 from\u00a0small businesses to large retailers and manufacturers \u2014 when they accept goods from foreign countries at U.S. ports. Typically, those businesses then raise their prices to cover the costs of these duties, according to economists.",
      "Because of that dynamic, tariffs are viewed as a tax on consumers by economists, with the Tax Policy Center, a tax-focused think tank,\u00a0estimating that the new import duties will cost the average taxpayer about $2,700 in additional costs in 2026.",

      "Fewer young adults are achieving economic and family milestones typically associated with adulthood, according to a recent working\u00a0paper\u00a0from the U.S. Census Bureau.",
      "The paper looked at nationally representative data from 2005 and 2023 to examine changes in young adults' experiences reaching major life events, such as moving out of their parents' house, getting married, and having a child. Researchers found a dramatic shift in the attainment of these milestones in recent decades.",
      "The reason for this, according to the paper, is that more young adults between the ages of 25 and 34 are facing economic barriers compared with previous generations. Changing societal attitudes around family formation are also contributing to the sharp decline in the share of young people reaching what the U.S. Census Bureau considers to be \"key milestones.\"",
      "According to the working paper, \"Changes in Milestones of Adulthood,\" almost half of all young adults in 1975 had reached four milestones associated with adulthood: moving out of one's parents' home, getting a job, getting married and having a child.",
      "Five decades on, that progression has changed dramatically. The share of young adults that have followed the traditional pathway to adulthood has dropped to less than a quarter, according to the paper.",
      "\"...Living arrangements, economic opportunities and attitudes toward family formation have not been experienced in the same fashion across generations of young adults,\" the working paper reads. \"Increases in job turbulence and economic downturns, for example, have resulted in some young adults navigating more volatile and uncertain economic environments.\"",
      "Economic conditions, combined with changing cultural norms, \"have implications for how young people develop their identity as adults,\" the paper states.",
      "This redefinition of young adulthood comes as the cost of everyday essentials, including housing, food, gas and daycare rises. As a result, more Americans are choosing to forego having a family, in some cases because they deem such choices unaffordable, the study finds.",
      "Researchers measured changes in the achievement of individual milestones, too. While one-quarter of young adults achieved all four milestones, 28% met two economic milestones \u2014 moving out of their parents' homes and finding jobs.",
      "Women in the workforce",
      "In the 1970s, getting married, having a child, and living independently, were the second-most common group of milestones young people achieved, next to the completion of all four.",
      "Women's gains in the workforce, along with changing cultural attitudes, however, have led this combination of milestones to become less popular, the report notes.",
      "The completion of education, another marker of adulthood, has overshadowed other milestones over the years as an increasing number of young adults enroll in college, according to the paper.",
      "\"These higher levels of educational attainment result in contemporary cohorts spending a longer portion of their young adult lives enrolled in higher education, potentially delaying other markers of adulthood such as entering the labor force or marriage,\" the working paper states.",
      "When it comes to perceptions of adulthood, having a job takes precedence over marriage, as young adults see economic achievements as more directly tied to adulthood than they do committing to a spouse.",
      "\"Marriage is increasingly viewed as a capstone of adulthood, something to pursue after achieving economic stability through completing formal education, establishing an independent household and becoming employed,\" the working paper states.",

    "summary": "The union representing 10,000 Air Canada flight attendants says it's reached a tentative agreement with the carrier and their strike, which had entered its fourth day, is over.",
    "story": [
      "Toronto \u2014 Air Canada said Tuesday it will restart operations gradually after a tentative agreement was reached with the union for 10,000 flight attendants to end a strike that disrupted the travel plans of hundreds of thousands of passengers.",
      "The Canadian Union of Public Employees, or CUPE, made the announcement\u00a0on its Facebook page\u00a0early Tuesday.",
      "It came after the union and Air Canada resumed talks late Monday for the first time since the strike began over the weekend. The walkout affected about 130,000 travelers a day at the peak of the summer travel season.",
      "Canada's largest airline said flights will start resuming Tuesday evening.",
      "Flight attendants walked off the job early Saturday after turning down the airline's request to enter into government-directed arbitration, which allows a third-party mediator to decide the terms of a new contract.",
      "The union said the agreement will guarantee members pay for work performed while planes are on the ground, resolving one of the major issues that drove the strike.",
      "\"Unpaid work is over. We have reclaimed our voice and our power,\" the union said in a statement. \"When our rights were taken away, we stood strong, we fought back \u2014 and we secured a tentative agreement that our members can vote on.\"",
      "Air Canada Chief Executive Michael Rousseau said restarting a major carrier is a complex undertaking and said regular service may require seven to 10 days. Some flights will be canceled until the schedule is stabilized.",
      "\"Full restoration may require a week or more, so we ask for our customers' patience and understanding over the coming days,\" Rousseau said in a statement.",
      "The two sides reached the deal with the help of a mediator early Tuesday morning. The airline said mediation discussions \"were begun on the basis that the union commit to have the airline's 10,000 flight attendants immediately return to work.\" Air Canada declined to comment further on the agreement until the ratification process is complete. It noted a strike or lockout is not possible during this time.",
      "The union said it is \"required to advise our membership that we must fully cooperate with resumption of operations,\" adding that the talks that settled the strike began at 7 p.m. Monday lasted until 4:23 a.m. Tuesday.",
      "Earlier, Air Canada said rolling cancellations would extend through Tuesday afternoon after the union defied a second return-to-work order.",
      "The Canada Industrial Relations Board had declared the strike illegal Monday and ordered the flight attendants back on the job. But the union said it would defy the directive. Union leaders also ignored a weekend order to submit to binding arbitration and end the strike by Sunday afternoon.",
      "The board is an independent administrative tribunal that interprets and applies Canada's labor laws. The government ordered the board to intervene.",
      "Labor leaders objected to the Canadian government's repeated use of a law that cuts off workers' right to strike and forces them into arbitration, a step the government took in recent years with workers at ports, railways and elsewhere.",
      "\"Your right to vote on your wages was preserved,\" the union said in a post on its website.",
      "Air Canada operates around 700 flights per day. The airline estimated Monday that 500,000 customers would be affected by flight cancellations.",
      "Aviation analytics firm Cirium said that as of Monday afternoon, Air Canada had called off at least 1,219 domestic flights and 1,339 international flights since last Thursday, when the carrier began gradually suspending its operations ahead of the strike and lockout that began early Saturday.",

    "story": [
      "As students savor the last dregs of summer before heading back to school, many families are shopping for supplies earlier this year to get ahead of tariffs.",
      "Over half of U.S. households that earn less than $50,000 a year say they plan to buy only essential school items, while 74% say they are shopping earlier than usual to avoid a potential hit from tariffs,\u00a0according\u00a0to the National Retail Federation (NRF), a trade organization that opposes higher import duties.",
      "Many back-to-school essentials, from clothing and footwear to personal electronics, are imported. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce\u00a0estimates that the U.S. tariff rate on such goods has jumped to an average of 18% this year, more than triple the 5% rate in 2024.",
      "Families with children in kindergarten through 12th grade are projected to spend an average of $858 on clothing, shoes, school supplies and electronics this year, NRF found. That's down slightly from $875 in 2024, as inflation has continued to ease this year, although up sharply from $697 in 2019, the group's data shows.",
      "Record high prices",
      "Recent data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\u00a0shows\u00a0that the cost of school supplies and books is at a record high. A recent analysis from The Century Foundation also found that prices for a typical assortment of school supplies are up more than 7% in price this year, with goods such index cards and binders subject to even steeper price hikes.",
      "School supplies cut across a range of goods categories, from dorm room d\u00e9cor, clothing and personal electronics to staples including writing implements, notebooks and backpacks.",
      "\"Consumers are being mindful of the potential impacts of tariffs and inflation on back-to-school items, and have turned to early shopping, discount stores and summer sales for savings on school essentials,\" Katherine Cullen, NRF vice president of industry and consumer insights, said in a statement.",
      "Although steep new U.S. tariffs haven't delivered the kind of shock to the economy that some forecasters expected, many consumers are worried, shopping expert Trae Bodge told CBS News' Kelly O'Grady.",
      "\"All of the studies that I'm seeing are showing that consumers are concerned,\" Bodge said. \"We are seeing prices ticking up because of tariffs, because of inflation. And so people are worried about being able to afford the things they need for school.\"",
      "The Consumer Price Index \u2014 a closely watched inflation gauge \u2014 rose 2.7% in July on an annual basis, slightly cooler than economists had forecast.",
      "How to save",
      "Large retailers are rolling out deep discounts on some school supplies, with items like notebooks, folders, crayons and erasers selling for less than $1.",
      "For big-ticket items, experts urge consumers to compare prices. That includes cross-checking in-store prices against online deals. For example, a $269 Samsung Galaxy tablet at one retailer was available for $220 on its app. Most retailers also will match the best price on their own websites, Bodge noted.",
      "When it comes to personal electronics, many of which are imported and now subject to President Trump's wide-reaching tariffs, Bodge urges consumers to consider buying refurbished models.",
      "\"A lot of retailers offer refurbished items that also come with a warranty, and that's a really good option if you're looking to save,\" she said.",
      "When it comes to products like pencils and notebooks, buying a store-brand over a name-brand also often offers savings. For clothes, experts advise waiting until school starts \u2014 when kids ask for whatever is trendy, you'll have a little money left over.",
      "Another way to both manage your budget while imparting a lesson on spending is to give teens a gift card, Bodge said. \"So they will be much more careful spending their money versus your money. And they'll stay on budget by doing this,\" she told CBS News.",

    "summary": "Energy suppliers are having trouble keeping up with the rapid increase in demand, and consumers in some states are seeing higher monthly bills.",
    "story": [
      "A July 11 post in a Hoboken, New Jersey, parenting group on Facebook pointed to a frustrating trend: \"Our utility bill is more than double what it was last month. ... Anything we can do about it?\" The post had several dozen replies and most of the commenters said their home utility bills had also risen dramatically.",
      "On the campaign trail a year ago, President Trump vowed, \"Under my administration, we will be slashing energy and electricity prices by half within 12 months \u2014 at a maximum, 18 months,\" but this year has seen energy prices rising in several states. Residents and governors in five East Coast states are blaming electric supplier, PJM Interconnection. The company is the largest grid operator in the U.S., serving 13 states and 65 million customers.",
      "In New Jersey, energy prices increased on June 1, causing a 17-20% jump in residential customers'utility bills. The utility company PSE&G told its New Jersey customers they should expect to see a higher monthly bill of about $183 for the average customer, an increase of $27.",
      "PSE&G attributed the price hike to \"an increase in energy demand combined with the need for new power generation,\" which it said \"has driven higher supply prices.\" As a utility, PSE&G pointed out that it doesn't earn a profit on the electric supply, so \"these costs are passed through directly to customers.\"",
      "PJM says it is experiencing a rapid increase in energy demand, driven by the power requirements of artificial intelligence, data centers, electrification and a resurgence in U.S. manufacturing. In its latest forecast, PJM forecast a growth in energy demand of 5% over the next 10 years.",
      "\"We don't have enough newer, more reliable energy sources,\" said Alex Ambrose, a policy analyst at New Jersey Policy Perspective, a nonpartisan think tank.",
      "Ambrose says that renewable sources like wind, solar, and battery are the cheapest and fastest forms of energy to bring online and faults PJM for its reluctance to bring clean energy into the grid: \"PJM is also keeping older coal gas plants running, even if they are uneconomical and more expensive.\"",
      "But in an op-ed in NJ Spotlight News, the company blamed a shortfall of energy on \"state and federal decarbonization policies and some economic pressures\" for closing fossil fuel-based power plants in New Jersey. PJM also said it has a queue of 63 gigawatts of projects \u2014 enough to power more than 47 million homes \u2014 waiting to be connected by 2026, and an \"overwhelming majority\" of those projects are renewables.",
      "Rising utility bills likely an issue in New Jersey governor's race",
      "Energy Secretary Chris Wright is starting to worry that high energy prices could hurt Republicans at the ballot box. In a recent interview with Politico, he blamed Democratic policies for \"pushing prices up right now,\" but conceded the political reality that Republicans may suffer in the next elections.",
      "\"Who's going to get blamed for it? We're going to get blamed because we're in office,\" he said.",
      "New Jersey is poised to be among the first to test the issue in the governor's race this November.",
      "\"Affordability is the number one issue in this race, and rising energy prices are also at the top of everyone's mind,\" Ambrose told CBS News.",
      "Mikie Sherrill, the Democratic nominee for governor, in July released a statement accusing PJM of \"mismanagement\" of the grid: \"PJM has refused to plug clean, cheap power like solar into the grid, while giving preference to coal and oil.\"",
      "And earlier this month, her opponent, Republican nominee Jack Ciattarelli, wrote in a post on X about \"Rebecca in Highland Park,\" whose electric bill he said had tripled, \"to more than $1000.\"",
      "\"Why? Because Trenton Democrats, with the approval of my opponent Mikie Sherrill, shut down six electricity generation plants around the state, stopped burning natural gas, and didn't expand our nuclear capabilities in South Jersey,\" Ciattarelli said.",
      "\"We can look at how folks are going to vote in this upcoming election, as a reflection on how they're feeling about the country at large,\" says Ambrose, \"This affordability problem is not going away.\"",
      "A Fairleigh Dickinson University poll earlier this month found that 26% of voters blame the utility companies for price hikes, 19% blame Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy, and 10% say that energy producers are at fault. Murphy is not running for reelection due to term limits.",
      "\"Utility bills directly impact elections,\" says Rob Gramlich, president of Grid Strategies, a D.C.-based energy consultancy firm. Gramlich pointed to the most infamous example of this, the California recall election in 2003, prompted in large part by the state's energy crisis.

    "summary": "After Texas moved forward on a new Trump-backed congressional map this week, California Gov. Gavin Newsom responded, \"It's on,\" moving forward on his own redistricting plan that favors Democrats.",
    "story": [
      "California's contentious new congressional maps, championed by Gov. Gavin Newsom, easily advanced in the state Assembly on Thursday, setting up for final passage in the Senate before landing on Newsom's desk.",
      "The new map would shift five of California's Republican U.S. House seats to be more favorable to Democrats in the 2026 midterm elections.",
      "The bill now heads to the state Senate. If the measure is successful, Californians would then vote on a constitutional amendment for the\u00a0new boundaries\u00a0during a special election on Nov. 4.",
      "That election is likely to be expensive and unpredictable given how quickly the effort has come together and how little time there is between the legislature's actions and voters starting to have their say.",
      "California's legislative votes are happening just one day after Texas state representatives passed a GOP-backed congressional map on Wednesday at the request of President Trump, following a weekslong standoff in which Democratic lawmakers left Texas to delay a vote. These new Texas maps could help secure five additional GOP-leaning seats during the upcoming midterm elections. Republicans in the state have been adamant the Texas changes are fair, while Texas Democrats have already signaled the maps will be challenged in court.",
      "Shortly after the Texas House passed the maps, Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom posted \"It's on\" on social media. When Texas first launched its redistricting effort, Newsom had vowed to redraw the Golden State's congressional districts to counter the Lone Star State's plan and neutralize any potential GOP gains.",
      "Newsom \u2014 who is widely seen as a possible 2028 presidential contender \u2014 sarcastically congratulated Texas GOP Gov. Greg Abbott on X, saying, \"you will now go down in history as one of Donald Trump's most loyal lapdogs. Shredding our nation's founding principles. What a legacy.\"",
      "Although California Republicans have denounced the redistricting plan as a \"tit for tat strategy,\" the state's Democrats on Thursday touted that the effort is different from Texas since it will be ultimately approved by the state's voters.",
      "\"In California, we will do whatever it takes to ensure that voters, not Donald Trump, will decide the direction of this country,\" said Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas. \"This is a proud moment in the history of this assembly. Californians, we believe in freedom. We will not let our political system be hijacked by authoritarianism, and today, we give every Californian the power to say no. To say no to Donald Trump's power grab and yes to our people, to our state and to our democracy.\"",
      "President Trump late Wednesday congratulated Texas Republicans for passing the new maps, writing on social media that \"Everything Passed, on our way to FIVE more Congressional seats and saving your Rights, your Freedoms, and your Country, itself.\" He also encouraged GOP-led Indiana and Florida to take on redistricting.",
      "The relatively rare mid-decade redistricting gambit comes as both parties prepare to face off in 2026 and has major implications nationwide. Republicans have a narrow majority at the moment, and Democrats winning back three seats in the 2026 midterms could be enough to flip control of the chamber if the lines used in the 2024 election were still in place. Redistricting in red states could change that dynamic significantly however, and with it the impact of the final two years on Mr. Trump's second term in office.",
      "Texas and California are the two biggest redistricting battlegrounds, but Mr. Trump has pushed\u00a0similar efforts in GOP-led Indiana and Florida, and New York Democrats have floated redrawing their House map. The Republican-led state of Missouri could also try and redraw a Democratic district in the coming weeks, and new maps are also expected in Ohio, where a redraw brought about by state law could impact some of the red state's Democratic members of Congress.",
      "Earlier this week, former President Barack Obama acknowledged that he was not a fan of partisan gerrymandering but he backed Newsom's redistricting plan anyway at a fundraiser in Martha's Vineyard and on social media, calling it a \"smart, measured approach.\"",
      "Less than 24 hours before\u00a0 California's scheduled vote, Newsom joined a press call with Democratic party leaders, urging support for his state's redistricting effort.",
      "\"This is about taking back our country,\" Newsom told reporters. \"This is about the Democratic Party now punching back forcefully and very intentionally.",
      "A draft congressional map unveiled by California Democrats late last week would heavily impact five of the state's nine Republican U.S. House members. It would redraw Reps. Doug LaMalfa and Kevin Kiley's Northern California districts, tweak Rep. David Valadao's district in the Central Valley and rearrange parts of densely populated Southern California, impacting Reps. Ken Calvert and Darrell Issa. And some more competitive Democrat-held districts could be tilted further from the GOP.",
      "There's no guarantee that Democrats will win in all five newly recast districts.",
      "Democrats hold large majorities in both chambers of California's state legislature. But some legal hurdles still lie ahead, and Republicans in the state have pushed back against the redistricting plans.",
      "Unlike Texas, California has an independent redistricting commission that was created by voters earlier this century. To overhaul the current congressional map, a constitutional amendment would need to be passed by a two-thirds vote in California's Assembly and Senate and be approved by voters in the fast-moving fall election.",
      "On Wednesday, the California Supreme Court denied a GOP attempt to stop the mid-cycle redistricting. California Republicans had legally challenged Democrats' efforts, claiming the state's constitution gives Californians the right to review new legislation for 30 days. But Chief Justice Patricia Guerrero said they \"failed to meet their burden of establishing a basis for relief at this time.\"",
      "The GOP legislators who filed the legal challenge told CBS News the ruling is \"not the end of this fight,\" vowing to keep fighting the redistricting plan in the courts.",
      "In a phone interview with CBS News on Wednesday, California Senate Minority Leader Brian Jones, a Republican, condemned Newsom's redistricting efforts.",
      "\"This whole process is illegal from the beginning and violates the current California Constitution,\" Jones said. \"The voters spoke with a loud voice in 2008 and 2010 that they were taking this process out of the politicians' hands and putting the responsibility into an independent commission.\"",
      "Democrats faced a flurry of questions from Republican lawmakers during hearings this week on the alleged lack of transparency in the drafting of these maps and the financial implications of the Nov. 4 special election.",
      "\"If we're talking about the cost of a special election versus the cost of our democracy or the cost that Californians are already paying to subsidize this corrupt administration, those costs seem well worth paying at this moment,\" said Democratic state Assemblyman Isaac G. Bryan.",
      "Democratic lawmakers and Newsom have repeatedly emphasized that these redistricting efforts would not get rid of the independent commission and that the new maps he's hoping to put in place will be the lines used through the 2030 election. The commission would go back to drawing the state's congressional maps after the 2030 census, according to Newsom, who says this is only being done as a response to Mr. Trump and Texas' redistricting.",
      "That notion was rejected by Jones, who said: \"Growing up, I was taught two wrongs don't make a right, so no, it is not justified.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/federal-reserve-jerome-powell-jackson-hole-speech-friday-trump-inflation/",
    "published": "Thu, 21 Aug 2025 16:10:26 -0400",
    "summary": "Jerome Powell will address the state of the U.S. economy \u2014 and perhaps offer hints about interest rates \u2014 in a closely watched speech this week. Here's what to expect.",
    "story": [
      "When Federal Reserve Chair\u00a0Jerome Powell takes the stage Friday at the annual Jackson Hole, Wyoming, economic forum, he will face pressures ranging from President Trump's repeated calls for his resignation to a recent mix of worrying economic data.",
      "Powell, whose term as Fed chair ends in May of 2026, will likely be making his last major speech as the central bank's leader at the event, which is hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. The symposium is closely watched by investors and economists because it provides a stage for Fed officials to share their views on the economy and the direction of monetary policy.",
      "A focal point in Jackson Hole will be if Powell offers any hints about the Fed's next interest-rate decision, scheduled for Sept. 17. Mr. Trump has badgered the Fed to cut rates, pointing to solid U.S. economic data and muted inflation. Powell has mostly shrugged off that pressure, emphasizing that the central bank is taking a \"wait and see\" approach as it monitors the potential impact of the Trump administration's tariffs on consumer prices.",
      "Yet Powell also faces a complicated economic picture, with recent signals pointing to a slowdown in job growth and one gauge of inflation registering its largest increase in three years.",
      "\"You have this political pressure balanced off against the economic pressure, which makes Powell's job particularly difficult, and it's driving a hyper-focus on what he might say on Friday,\" Melissa Brown, managing director of investment decision research at SimCorp, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The Federal Reserve declined to comment ahead of Powell's speech at the Jackson Hole symposium, whose theme this year is \"Labor Markets in Transition: Demographics, Productivity, and Macroeconomic Policy.\"",
      "The Kansas City Fed will broadcast Powell's speech on its YouTube\u00a0channel\u00a0on Friday at 10 a.m. Eastern Time.",
      "To cut or not to cut?",
      "While Powell is likely to discuss economic trends in Jackson Hole, he is virtually certain to demur on the question of when the Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank's 12-person interest rate-setting panel, might choose to lower its benchmark rate.",
      "That is by design. Fed officials famously keep monetary policy decisions \u2014 which are set deliberatively and by consensus \u2014 private before they are officially announced to avoid roiling financial markets and to insulate the central bank from political pressure.",
      "Meanwhile, policy makers will have a chance to assess several major pieces of economic data before their Sept. 16-17 meeting, including the Labor Department's monthly jobs report on Sept. 5 and the Consumer Price Index on Sept. 11.",
      "The head of the labor statistics bureau\u00a0was fired in August after the agency's latest employment figures showed a sharp slowdown in job-creation, prompting Mr. Trump to question the accuracy of the data. For now, the August payrolls and CPI reports remain on the Labor Department's calendar of scheduled releases.",
      "\"I don't think Powell can push the narrative toward cutting because that leaves him no option but to cut,\" said Mike Sanders, head of fixed income at investment management firm Madison Investments.",
      "\"He has to signal, 'We're still data-dependent and we'll see what the data tells us'\" so the Fed doesn't get pushed into a corner, Sanders added.",
      "For their part, investors are clearly placing their bets on the Fed lowering rates in September for the first time since December 2024. Wall Street economists put the likelihood of a cut at 88%, according to financial data company FactSet, with\u00a0 most expecting a 0.25 percentage-point dip.",
      "At last year's Jackson Hole event, Powell signaled that interest-rate cuts were coming after the central bank had previously raised its benchmark rate to its highest level in 23 years in trying to extinguish inflation. The following month, the Fed announced a jumbo cut\u00a0of 0.50 percentage points in a move to boost economic growth.",
      "Dueling mandates",
      "This year, Powell could similarly use his platform in Wyoming to indicate his openness to a rate cut, according to Will Denyer, chief U.S. economist at Gavekal Research. At the same time, the Fed is also \"in a pickle,\" given troubling jobs data and signs that inflation could be creeping higher, he said in a report this week.",
      "That speaks to the Fed's so-called dual mandate, which is to both maximize employment and minimize inflation. Balancing those two goals can require different \u2014 and sometimes conflicting \u2014 policies, as lowering interest rates can boost job growth while causing inflation to tick higher, and vice versa.",
      "\"Data alone suggests a rising risk of a stagflationary scenario, which is, you know, a Fed nightmare,\" Denyer said. \"That puts them in a bind between their two mandates being in conflict.\"",
      "Minutes for the Fed's July 30 rate decision meeting, when the FOMC again chose to hold rates steady, show that some members \"remained worried that supply-chain disruptions could cause inflation to remain stubbornly elevated,\" signaling that price increases remain top of mind, noted Oxford Economics chief U.S. economist Ryan Sweet in a report on Wednesday.",
      "\"The labor market will be the swing factor on whether the Fed cuts interest rates in September or not,\" he added.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/gabbard-barred-sharing-intelligence-russia-ukraine-negotiations-five-eyes-partners/",
    "published": "Thu, 21 Aug 2025 15:47:00 -0400",
    "summary": "A July 20 memo ordered U.S. intelligence agencies not to share information about Russia-Ukraine talks with Five Eyes partners U.K., Canada, Australia and New Zealand.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 As Russia's war in Ukraine rages on despite high-level meetings to discuss a possible path to peace, CBS News has learned that Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, issued a directive weeks ago to the U.S. intelligence community ordering that all information regarding the Russia-Ukraine peace negotiations not be shared with U.S.-allied intelligence partners.",
      "The memo, dated July 20 and signed by Gabbard, directed agencies to not share information with the so-called Five Eyes, the post-World War II intelligence alliance comprising the U.S., U.K., Canada, Australia and New Zealand, multiple U.S. intelligence officials told CBS News. They spoke under condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive national security matters.",
      "The officials said the directive classified all analysis and information related to the volatile Russia-Ukraine peace negotiations as \"NOFORN,\" or no foreign dissemination, meaning the information could not be shared with any other country or foreign nationals. The only information that could be shared was information that had already been publicly released. The memo also limited distribution of material regarding peace talks to within the agencies that created or originated the intelligence.",
      "The memo does not seem to prevent the sharing of diplomatic information gathered by other means separate from the U.S. intelligence community, or military operational information unrelated to the talks \u2014 such as the details the U.S. shares with the Ukrainian military to aid in their defensive operations.",
      "Contacted by CBS News, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence referred questions to the White House, which did not respond.",
      "\"In general, the value of the Fives Eyes intelligence partnership is that when we are making and they are making policy decisions, we can both augment each other's intelligence and therefore know more about the plans, intentions, and capabilities of our adversaries,\" explained Steven Cash, a former intelligence officer at the Central Intelligence Agency and Department of Homeland Security.",
      "\"Among the reasons for that sort of default is the expectation that we and the other four are all sitting on the same side of the table with some other adversary on the other side,\" Cash said.",
      "He said it's important for the allies to have \"a common intelligence picture\" so policymakers and negotiators \"can coordinate our positions and get the best deal we can, or fight the best war we can.\" Cash is the executive director of The Steady State, a nonprofit organization made up of former U.S. intelligence and national security professionals and government officials concerned with threats to American democracy.",
      "In March 1946, Winston Churchill spoke of the \"special relationship\" between the U.S. and the U.K. and the threat of the \"Iron Curtain\" that had \"descended across the Continent.\" The United States and Britain first forged their intelligence alliance in secret, signing an agreement to pool information as a bulwark against the Soviet Union.",
      "Later, Canada, Australia and New Zealand joined the arrangement, transforming what began as a bilateral pact into the five-nation network that would come to be known as the Five Eyes.",
      "But now, nearly 80 years later, some former U.S. government officials warn that the breadth of Gabbard's order could undermine the intelligence community alliance \u2014 discouraging analysts from sharing insights and eroding trust among allies who have long relied on open exchanges to form a common picture of global threats and paths to successful negotiation.",
      "Cash and CBS News national security contributor Sam Vinograd, a former homeland security official, said Five Eyes often has intelligence that helps the U.S. produce comprehensive intelligence assessments, especially about Russia, given the access Five Eyes partners have to other intelligence sources.",
      "\"Shutting our most trusted partners off from intelligence assessments could have a chilling effect on critical intelligence sharing if our partners believe they're being shut out of key access \u2014 including on key matters in their region. They could decide to take similar steps toward the U.S.,\" Vinograd said.",
      "She added, \"Policy-wise, if our Five Eyes partners think they are being shut off from key information. They could choose to create new structures and channels without us. A lack of full collaboration with our closest partners could lead them to discuss matters impacting our national security without our input and perspective.\"",
      "Still, other former intelligence officers contend Gabbard's directive is commonplace within the U.S. intelligence community, and the criticism is much ado about nothing. They say both the U.S. and the other members of the intelligence alliance frequently withhold information from each other in diverging interest areas. Ezra Cohen, a Hudson Institute fellow who served as the acting undersecretary of defense for intelligence at the Pentagon, suggested that condemnation of Gabbard's memo likely stems from a dislike of Trump administration policies and her leadership as director of national intelligence.",
      "\"There is a lot of information we do not share even with our Five Eyes partners, and it works in the reverse. There's a lot of U.K. eyes-only material. There's a lot of Australian eyes-only material,\" said Cohen.",
      "\"Our interests are not always aligned with our Five Eyes partners,\" Cohen said. \"And where we have diverging interests, and it's not just Ukraine, we absolutely mark things NOFORN.\"",
      "He admits it's possible the directive could result in depriving the U.S. of information, but maintains these types of decisions have historically been the norm between all of the Five Eyes members. He said the claim that the directive represents \"a chilling of the relationship\" between the U.S. and Five Eyes seems \"a little bit like faux outrage.\"",
      "As intelligence work and diplomatic efforts continue, largely out of the public eye, the war in Ukraine continues to take a deadly toll. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned Moscow Thursday for launching hundreds of drones and dozens of missiles in an attack overnight, \"as if nothing had changed at all. As if there were no efforts by the world to stop this war.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 21 Aug 2025 15:27:26 -0400",
    "summary": "Lizelle Gonzalez was indicted on murder charges in 2022, after she used medication to induce an abortion. The charges were later dropped.",
    "story": [
      "A South Texas woman who was arrested on murder charges in 2022 after using medication to terminate her pregnancy has alleged new details about her case against a local sheriff and prosecutors, claiming they violated her constitutional rights.",
      "Her Aug. 12 court filing comes as the debate over medicated abortion is heating up in Texas, with Attorney General Ken Paxton announcing a new effort to prevent the abortion pill from being mailed into Texas.",
      "\"These abortion drug organizations and radical activists are not above the law, and I have ordered the immediate end of this unlawful conduct,\" Paxton said Wednesday.",
      "The case of Lizelle Gonzalez was among the first to expose the complexities of criminalizing the use of medication to end a pregnancy. Starr County, located on the southern Texas border, launched an investigation into Gonzalez after hospital staff reported to law enforcement that she had taken medication to induce an abortion when she was 19 weeks pregnant. Three months later, she was indicted and arrested. Gonzalez spent three days in jail before her $500,000 bond was posted, and the charges were ultimately dropped.",
      "While Texas has one of the strictest abortion bans in the country, it's not a crime for a woman to obtain or seek abortion care for herself. The state's restrictions on abortion target physicians and those who aid a woman in obtaining or seeking an abortion, whether it's surgical or induced by use of abortion drugs like mifepristone and misoprostol.",
      "According to new filings in the lawsuit made last week, District Attorney Gocha Ramirez dropped the charges against Gonzalez after public outcry over Gonzalez's arrest. Included in an exhibit in the lawsuit was a text Ramirez wrote to his son, in which he admitted he'd made a mistake and even called Gonzalez to apologize, stating he \"didn't know what happened.\"",
      "In the most detailed account to date of the events surrounding Gonzalez's arrest, her attorneys laid out in the 70-page lawsuit the events that they say led the Starr County district attorney, the assistant D.A. and the sheriff to pursue a case against her, even though records suggest prosecutors knew her actions did not violate state law.",
      "\"They should have known from the very beginning that the conduct that they were investigating was not going to ever equal probable cause for homicide,\" said Lauren Johnson, director of the Abortion Criminal Defense Initiative at the American Civil Liberties Union. \"The penal code is very clear that a pregnant person cannot be charged with \u2014 cannot be guilty of a crime, of a homicide, for ending a pregnancy themselves.\"",
      "According to the original complaint filed in March 2024, Gonzalez says she went to an emergency room in January 2022 after taking misoprostol, an abortion-inducing medication.",
      "Less than an hour after she was discharged, she returned to the hospital with complaints of abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding. After an exam detected no fetal cardiac activity, doctors performed a cesarean section to deliver a stillborn fetus.",
      "After the procedure, a nurse at the hospital called 911 and reported the procedure to local police, who then contacted the Starr County Sheriff's Office. The nurse later said the hospital's administrators directed her to report the incident \"because, she said, abortions could now be considered murder due to a 'change in the law,'\" according to the complaint.",
      "\"It is not an overstatement to say that Lizelle's life was entirely upended by what happened to her,\" said Johnson, who is representing Gonzalez in the lawsuit. \"She wanted to live her life and didn't want to be criminalized and have her mugshot in her local community. And have something that should have been a very personal decision be something that was made public.\"",
      "In July, the Southern District Court of Texas denied Starr County officials' attempts to have the lawsuit dismissed after the prosecutors and sheriff raised claims of absolute and qualified immunity, respectively. The immunity doctrine has been developed by the courts to restrict legal liability of government officials, such as law enforcement, judges and prosecutors. Absolute immunity applies a complete shield from legal action regardless of the legality or constitutionality of the official's actions. Qualified immunity however can not shield a government actor, like law enforcement, if they violate \"clearly established\" statutory or constitutional rights.",
      "However, the court filings allege that all three county officials named in the suit \u2014 Ramirez, first assistant prosecutor Alexandria Barrera and Sheriff Rene Fuentes \u2014 violated \"clearly established\" constitutional rights when they pursued a murder charge and arrest for an action the law clearly states is not a crime. And they allege that the prosecutors acted outside of their prosecutorial capacity by directing the investigation and providing legal advice to drive the indictment\u00a0 \u2014 which Gonzalez argues would exempt them from any immunity.",
      "The A.C.L.U. says the hundreds of pages of evidence it has gathered contradict the claim by county officials that they didn't know that it was not lawful to pursue a murder charge against Gonzalez. In a sworn deposition, an investigator with the sheriff's office testified that she wasn't ready to charge Gonzalez with murder but was instructed to do so by Barrera.",
      "\"No practices have been put in place or conduct changed to prevent something like this from happening or being done differently in the future,\" says Johnson. \"I think that part has been especially alarming and really does highlight the need for ways to shine a light on this conduct and also really force elected officials to follow the law when they're using the immense power that they have.\"",
      "The Starr County District Attorney's office has not yet responded to a request for comment.",

    "summary": "Jinchao Wei, who was an active-duty sailor stationed in San Diego, was found guilty of charges he sold military secrets to China.",
    "story": [
      "A U.S. Navy sailor was convicted Wednesday of charges that he sold military secrets, including details about military warships, to a Chinese intelligence officer while on active duty in exchange for payment.",
      "Jinchao Wei, also known as Patrick Wei, who was an active-duty sailor stationed at Naval Base San Diego, was found guilty by a jury in federal court in San Diego of six counts. The charges on which he was convicted include conspiracy to commit espionage, espionage, and unlawful export of technical data about U.S. defense vehicles in exchange for $12,000.",
      "Wei was a machinist's mate in the U.S.S. Essex, an amphibious assault ship, and held a security clearance that gave him access to sensitive national security defense information about the ship's operations and capabilities.",
      "Federal prosecutors alleged that Wei was approached in February 2022 over social media by someone who claimed to be a naval enthusiast, but in reality was a Chinese intelligence officer. Between the time of their first encounter and Wei's arrest in August 2023, Wei sent photographs, videos and information about the ship's weapons to his handler, in addition to information about ship movement and the potential vulnerabilities of the vessels. Wei also sent information about other Navy ships that he had taken from restricted computer systems. He was paid $12,000 over that period by the Chinese agent.",
      "Prosecutors also presented evidence that Wei and the Chinese agent tried to cover up their communications. According to the U.S. Attorney's Office in Southern California, Wei used encrypted apps and created multiple online accounts to receive payments from his Chinese handler, whom he referred to as \"Big Brother Andy.\" Prosecutors said Wei used digital \"dead drops\" and a computer and phone that were provided by the agent.",
      "When Wei began providing the handler with information, he told another U.S. Navy sailor that he had been asked to spy for the Chinese government, the U.S. Attorney's Office said.",
      "After he was arrested, Wei was asked by FBI investigators to describe his actions involving the Chinese intelligence agent.",
      "\"Espionage,\" he responded, according to prosecutors. They said Wei, during that interview also told investigators, \"I'm screwed.\"",
      "\"The defendant, who took an oath to protect our Nation and was entrusted with a security clearance as a petty officer in the United States Navy, sold out his country for $12,000,\" Assistant Attorney General for National Security John A. Eisenberg said in a statement. \"He violated his oath, betrayed his uniform and fellow sailors, and turned his back on his adopted nation for money. This verdict serves as a warning to those who do not take seriously the solemn obligations of their positions of trust or their duty to this Nation. Do not be tempted by easy money because you will be prosecuted and sent to prison.\"",
      "Wei is scheduled to be sentenced on Dec. 1. The maximum penalty for the charges is life in prison.",
      "Wei's lawyer, Sean Jones, said in a statement to CBS News,\"It was never disputed that Jinchao made numerous errors in judgment. He was young and naive and regrettably agreed to share some very low level information in exchange for easy money.\"",
      "He said Wei \"loves America\" and \"has no allegiance to China,\" and believed he was selling the information to someone for \"the apparent personal or professional benefit of the recipient,\" and not for the benefit of China. Jones said the information Wei sold consisted of \"outdated maintenance manuals to a broken and obsolete steam powered ship.\" Jones added that he believes Wei's actions had \"absolutely no effect on national security\" and expressed hope that \"given the substantial mitigating factors he will receive a fair sentence.\"",
      "The Chinese official's successful spying efforts are viewed as part of a developing area\u00a0in Chinese covert activities that counterintelligence officials are calling \"virtual espionage.\" The practice \u2014 in which Chinese intelligence officers target members of the military and others of high interest on social media, draw them into correspondence, and extract sensitive information from them \u2014 is seen as a rising threat, officials told CBS News.",
      "In March, two active-duty U.S. soldiers and one former soldier were arrested after being accused of selling state secrets to foreign countries, including China, the Justice Department announced.",
      "In a separate case from 2024, another U.S. Navy petty officer pleaded guilty to handing over sensitive information about the U.S. military after he was contacted in a stock trading chat group on the Chinese-owned social media network WeChat.",

      "One of the justices on the Appellate Division, First Judicial Department wrote that the penalty, known as a disgorgement, against Mr. Trump, two of his sons and other executives and their company was \"an excessive fine barred by the Eighth Amendment.\"",
      "In February 2024, a New York judge ordered Mr. Trump and his codefendants to pay the state nearly $364 million in \"ill-gotten gains\" and millions more in interest dating back years, a total that has since ballooned to about $527 million. Judge Arthur Engoron's judgment left Mr. Trump on the hook for nearly 98% of the total.",
      "New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement Thursday that her office will appeal the decision to the Court of Appeals, the state's highest court. Her statement lauded one aspect of the ruling, which left in place sanctions barring Mr. Trump from serving as an officer or director of any corporation or other legal entity in the state for three years. His sons, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., were banned for two years.",
      "\"The court upheld the injunctive relief we won, limiting Donald Trump and the Trump Organization officers' ability to do business in New York. It should not be lost to history: yet another court has ruled that the president violated the law, and that our case has merit,\" James said.",

But Engoron disagreed, ruling in February 2024 that Trump and his codefendants had misrepresented his wealth and inflated the valuations of his properties by hundreds of millions of dollars over the course of a decade. The state said the scheme was intended to trick banks and insurers into offering more favorable deal terms.",
      "The president appealed the judgment, and the five-justice appellate panel heard arguments in September 2024. At least two of the justices seemed skeptical of the size of the judgment. One called it \"immense\" and \"troubling.\" Mr. Trump was represented during the September proceeding by D. John Sauer, who is now the solicitor general.",
      "The court's ruling",
      "In a complex 323-page series of opinions on Thursday, the justices wrote that they were deeply divided, with two saying a new trial should be ordered and one writing that the case should be tossed altogether. A majority of four justices settled on an alternate path: vacating the massive financial penalty without resolving the merits of the case. The penalty, as one wrote, \"was far from a reasonable approximation\" of the amount that was warranted.",
      "Justice David Friedman, who dissented from the majority, noted that two of the four justices who voted to vacate the penalty \"do not actually agree with the resolution of the appeal for which they are voting.\"",
      "\"I find it remarkable that, although a three-justice majority of this five-justice panel believe that the judgment in favor of the Attorney General should not stand \u2026 the result of the appeal is the affirmance of the judgment, albeit as modified to eliminate the disgorgement award,\" Friedman wrote.",
      "\"To draw a sports analogy, it is as if a team is awarded a touchdown without crossing the goal line,\" he continued.",
      "Justices John Higgitt and Llin\u00e9t Rosado said they would have preferred to order a new trial, but would join the majority \"with great reluctance.\"",
      "\"Under the truly extraordinary circumstances here, where none of the writings enjoys the support of a majority, we are moved to take this action to permit this panel to arrive at a decision and to permit the parties and the Court to avoid the necessity of reargument,\" they wrote. \"We must therefore agree with Justice Friedman in his observation that a remarkable situation has necessitated a remarkable solution.\"",
      "The appellate court typically issues decisions within a few months of arguments, but the intricacy of the legal issues at hand seems to have delayed a final ruling. Sources on both sides of the dispute expressed surprise to CBS News about the length of the wait for a resolution, as the seasons changed and the court drew closer to a year without word from the court.",
      "James' office has defended the punishment, saying it accurately reflected the size of Mr. Trump's profits from fraud.",
      "Engoron wrote in his ruling that documents in evidence prove \"over and over again\" that the defendants falsely inflated Mr. Trump's wealth and reported those fraudulent numbers to business partners.",
      "He said Mr. Trump's \"complete lack of contrition and remorse borders on pathological,\" and said his company gave their accountants \"blatantly false financial data.\"",
      "Despite overturning the judgment, the appellate panel concluded that Engoron \"was even-handed at trial, and allowed both sides to 'make their case.'\"",
      "Mr. Trump testified during a bench trial in the case, in November 2023, blaming his employees and others while also insisting his books were kept appropriately. Accused of falsely inflating his wealth, Mr. Trump claimed the opposite was true, saying his company \"underestimated\" the value of his properties.",
      "\"The numbers you are talking about here is, you know, they are very big numbers, very, very big. Far bigger \u2014 the values are far bigger than what is on the financial statement,\" Mr. Trump said, later adding, \"billions of dollars more.\"",
      "Engoron concluded that testimony by Mr. Trump, his sons and other Trump Organization executives was not credible. A majority of the appellate panel agreed with that determination, as well as another related to Mr. Trump's former lawyer and \"fixer\" Michael Cohen, who testified against Mr. Trump.",
      "\"We defer to the court's findings that the testimony of President Trump, Donald Trump, Jr., Eric Trump, Jeffrey McConney and Allen Weisselberg were not credible, and that the testimony of Michael Cohen was credible,\" the court said.",

      "The U.S. will impose a 15% tariff on imports of European cars, pharmaceuticals and other products, according to a joint statement issued Thursday by the Trump administration and European Union.",
      "The pact also calls for the 27-member EU to eliminate tariffs on all American industrial exports and to offer preferred terms for some seafood and farm products, while the U.S. will reduce tariffs accordingly.",
      "The new framework, which is an agreement to facilitate trade negotiations between countries rather than a finalized deal, comes after President Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen met briefly in July at Mr. Trump's Turnberry golf course in Scotland. At the time, they announced a sweeping trade deal that imposed 15% tariffs on most European goods, warding off the Mr. Trump's threat of a 30% rate if no deal was reached by Aug. 1.",
      "In the latest pact, the U.S. reaffirmed its pledge to limit import duties on most European goods, including cars, drugs and semiconductors to no more than 15%, pending additional legislative actions by the EU.",
      "The agreement also covers $750 billion in energy purchases and $600 billion in EU investments by 2028.",
      "\"This Framework Agreement represents a concrete demonstration of our commitment to fair, balanced, and mutually beneficial trade and investment,\" the White House and EU said in a joint statement. \"This Framework Agreement will put our trade and investment relationship \u2013 one of the largest in the world \u2013 on a solid footing and will reinvigorate our economies' reindustrialization.\"",
      "After the agreement is fully implemented, the average effective U.S. tariff on imports from EU countries will range from 10% to 14%, according to Eurasia Group, a consulting firm focused on political risk. Together, the U.S. and the EU account for 44% of the global economy.",
      "What's inside the framework pact",
      "The framework impacts a broad range of items produced by the U.S. and the EU, ranging from dairy products to lobster. Some of the additional provisions include:",
      "The EU will \"provide preferential market access\" for U.S. agricultural goods and seafood, including dairy products, fresh and processed fruits and vegetables, soybean oil and pork and bison meat.\u00a0The EU pledged to take steps to extend a 2020 agreement for lobster imports, which had expired in July, including expanding the scope to include processed lobster.The U.S. will reduce tariffs on EU-made automobiles to 15% once the European trading bloc formalizes its elimination of tariffs on all American industrial exports.\u00a0A pledge by the EU to buy at least $40 billion's worth of U.S. AI chips for its computing centers.The EU said it would \"substantially increase procurement of military and defense equipment from the United States, with the support and facilitation of the U.S. government,\" although the framework didn't include a dollar figure for the purchases.The EU and U.S. agreed to streamline requirements for sanitary certificates for pork and dairy products, part of an effort to address nontariff barriers to trade.",

      "\"This is a serious, strategic deal -- and we are fully behind it. A wide range of sectors, including strategic industries such as cars, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, and lumber, stand to benefit,\" said the EU trade commissioner Maros Sefcovic.",
      "The terms of the deal are likely to face pushback from some EU member states, notably the provisions requiring countries in the trading bloc to open their markets to U.S. farm products, according to Eurasia Group.

    "published": "Thu, 21 Aug 2025 10:00:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The Department of Homeland Security figure comes with caveats, researchers who study population demographics told CBS News, and it's too early to conclude that there's been a mass exodus.",
    "story": [
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said last week that the number of unauthorized immigrants living in the U.S. has declined by 1.6 million since President Trump began his immigration crackdown.",
      "\"This is massive,\" Noem said in a statement, crediting the decline in part to an ad campaign warning undocumented immigrants to leave or face arrest and deportation.",
      "\"This new data shows illegal aliens are hearing our message,\" she added. In the Department of Homeland Security's news release, Noem did not specify how many of those individuals were believed to have departed the U.S. voluntarily, versus those who have been deported.",
      "But the vast majority would have had to have left without making any contact with DHS to reach that total. According to internal government figures previously obtained by CBS News, over the first six months of President Trump's second term, the administration deported nearly 150,000 people and recorded 13,000 who self-deported.",
      "A DHS spokesperson told CBS News that it sourced the 1.6 million figure from its own numbers out of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, although its news release included a chart from an analysis released earlier this month by the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that supports immigration restrictions.",
      "It did not provide additional information on how USCIS calculated this estimate.",
      "Any estimate of the current unauthorized population at this stage comes with caveats, researchers who study population demographics told CBS News, and it's too early to conclude that there's been a mass exodus.",
      "A new analysis from the Pew Research Center, released Thursday, estimated that there were 14 million unauthorized immigrants living in the U.S. as of 2023. That's the latest year for which data from the Census Bureau's American Community Survey is available \u2014 the survey that experts say is the gold standard for making these population estimates.",
      "The Pew Research Center's analysis found that the undocumented immigrant population swelled by 3.5 million from 2021 to 2023, driven largely by recent arrivals during the Biden administration.",
      "It had previously declined by 1.1 million between the start of the Obama administration and the end of the first Trump administration, Pew found.",
      "Meanwhile, the analysis from the Center for Immigration Studies is based on another Census Bureau survey known as the Current Population Survey. The CPS polls about 60,000 households \u2014 about 2% of the size of the American Community Survey's sample \u2014 making some estimates less reliable. Experts also note some immigrants may not respond amid increased enforcement.",
      "The Pew Research Center analyzed the CPS data as well, and found similar results, showing the unauthorized immigrant population may have continued to grow into 2024 and started to decline in 2025.",
      "\"For [20]25, all we have is CPS data and that points to a decline from a January peak of immigrants,\" Jeffrey Passel, the Pew report's lead author, told CBS News. \"How big the decline is could be affected by the decrease in response rates.\"",
      "To estimate the unauthorized population, researchers typically subtract the number of immigrants with legal status from the overall foreign-born population. Estimating the foreign-born population in the absence of the American Community Survey can be tricky.",
      "The Census Bureau, which oversees both surveys, cautions against using the Current Population Survey to estimate the foreign-born populations due to its sample size.",
      "Zooming in on the foreign-born population within the CPS survey makes a small sample size even smaller, introducing wide margins of error, experts say. The foreign-born population makes up about 14% of the total U.S. population, according to the latest ACS survey.",
      "The analysis from the Center for Immigration Studies estimated that the total foreign-born population, which includes both legal and illegal immigrants, fell by 2.2 million between January and July, including 600,000 non-citizens with legal status.",
      "Steven Camarota, the lead author on that analysis, said the decline in the overall foreign-born population is statistically significant, or not due to chance, despite the wide margins of error. He noted that response rates have declined for more than a decade, but haven't prevented the survey from tracking the previous increases in the foreign-born population prior to January 2025.",
      "Data is not available on the response rates among foreign-born people compared with U.S.-born people surveyed, so it isn't clear how much of the recent decline in the response rate is reflective of a drop off among immigrants.",
      "\"Given that the foreign-born is a small minority of the population, you can have a meaningful decline in the foreign-born response rate without having much of a decline in the overall response rate,\" Jed Kolko, an economist who served as under secretary of commerce for economic affairs during the Biden Administration, told CBS News.",
      "Still, Kolko said there are other indicators that the unauthorized population has begun to decline. Industries that rely heavily on labor from unauthorized workers, such as construction, hotels and restaurants, have seen greater drops in employment than all other industries, according to his analysis of a Bureau of Labor Statistics survey of employers rather than households.",

    "story": [
      "Internal government documents obtained by CBS News show the Trump administration has expanded its campaign to persuade countries around the world to aid its crackdown on illegal immigration by accepting deportations of migrants who are not their own citizens.",
      "The documents indicate Uganda in East Africa recently agreed to accept deportees from the U.S. who hail from other countries on the continent, as long as they don't have criminal histories. It's unclear how many deportees Uganda would ultimately accept under the arrangement with the U.S. government.",
      "Honduras' government has also agreed to receive deportees from other Spanish-speaking countries in Latin America, including families traveling with children, the documents show. The government of Honduras agreed to a relatively small number of deportations \u2014 just several hundred over two years \u2014 but the documents indicate it could decide to accept more.",
      "Both agreements are based on a \"safe third country\" provision of U.S. immigration law that allows officials to reroute asylum-seekers to countries that are not their own if the U.S. government makes a determination that those nations can fairly hear their claims for humanitarian protection.",
      "The two bilateral deals outlined in the internal documents are part of a large-scale diplomatic effort that President Trump's administration has staged to strike deportation arrangements with nations across several continents, including those with problematic human rights records. The administration has argued those agreements are key to its mass deportation campaign, since there are some migrants who can't easily be deported to their home countries because of strained diplomatic relations or other reasons.",
      "At least a dozen countries have already accepted or agreed to accept deportees from other nations since the second Trump administration took office, and U.S. officials have been aggressively courting other governments. Internal government documents show the Trump administration has also asked countries like Ecuador and Spain to receive these so-called third country deportees from the U.S.",
      "Representatives for the Department of Homeland Security did not respond to requests to comment on CBS News' reporting.",
      "A senior State Department official said, \"We don't comment on the content of private diplomatic negotiations, but the State Department is doing everything possible to support the President's policy of keeping Americans safe by removing illegal aliens who have no right to be in the United States.\"",
      "On Wednesday, Uganda's government confirmed the deportation agreement with the U.S., saying the two countries are working on implementation details. The country's foreign ministry said Uganda \"prefers\" to receive migrants from other parts of Africa.",
      "\"The Agreement is in respect of Third Country Nationals who may not be granted asylum in the United States but are reluctant to or may have concerns about returning to their countries of origin,\" Uganda's foreign ministry said in a statement. \"This is a temporary arrangement with conditions including that individuals with criminal records and unaccompanied minors will not be accepted.\"",
      "Earlier this summer, the Supreme Court gave the Trump administration the green light to deport migrants to third countries with a minimal degree of notice and due process. The decision paved the way for the administration to continue expanding a practice it has relied on since the beginning of Mr. Trump's second term.",
      "In February, the Trump administration convinced Costa Rica and Panama to take in several hundred African and Asian migrants who had claimed asylum along the U.S.-Mexico border. Then, in March, the U.S. flew more than 200 Venezuelans accused of gang membership to El Salvador, where they were held incommunicado for months at a notorious prison until they were returned to Venezuela last month under a prisoner swap.",
      "The administration has also sent immigrants convicted of violent crimes and who hail from Cuba, Jamaica, Mexico, Laos, Myanmar, Yemen and other countries to violence-torn South Sudan and the tiny southern African kingdom of Eswatini. Guatemala, Kosovo and Rwanda have announced they will receive deportees from the U.S. who come from other nations.",
      "Last week, the State Department said the U.S. had signed a \"safe third country\" asylum agreement with Paraguay. Mexico, under an arrangement that predates Mr. Trump's second term, accepts the return of some Latin American migrants who crossed the U.S. southern border illegally.",
      "Human rights advocates have strongly denounced the Trump administration effort, saying migrants could be deported to countries where they could be harmed or returned to the place they fled. Some of the countries persuaded to sign deportation agreements have been plagued by reports of human rights abuses.",
      "In a report released last week, the State Department described \"negative developments in the human rights situation in Uganda,\" citing unlawful killings, \"arbitrary\" arrests, disappearances and a lack of action from the government to curb human rights abuses. The report also noted, however, that Uganda has worked with United Nations officials to provide humanitarian protection to refugees.",
      "Doris Meissner, who oversaw the now-defunct Immigration and Naturalization Service under the Clinton administration, said the U.S. government has long faced difficulties deporting some migrants due to diplomatic constraints. But she noted efforts to deport them to third countries were generally undertaken in \"exceptional\" cases only.",
      "Meissner, who is now a senior fellow at the Migration Policy Institute think tank,  suggested the Trump administration may be employing different sources of leverage \u2014 like threats of visa sanctions and funding commitments \u2014 to persuade as many countries as possible to take in deportees from other nations.",
      "Noting deportations to third countries remain relatively limited in scale, Meissner said a main driver behind the Trump administration's diplomatic efforts is a desire to send a message of deterrence to those in the U.S. illegally, one that highlights the possibility that they could be sent to distant countries where they have no ties.",
      "\"The broader reason beyond that is fear and intimidation and ultimately, incentivizing self deportation,\" she said.",

      "The USS Gravely, the USS Jason Dunham and the USS Sampson were to depart for the region over the next few days, the official said.",
      "A Defense Department official confirmed to The Associated Press that the military assets had been assigned to the region in support of counter narcotics efforts. The official, who was not authorized to comment about military planning, said the vessels would be deployed \"over the course of several months.\"",
      "The deployment of U.S. destroyers and personnel comes as Mr. Trump pushes for using the U.S. military to thwart cartels he blames for the flow of fentanyl and other illicit drugs into American communities, and for perpetuating violence in some U.S. cities.",
      "Mr. Trump has also pressed Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum to cooperate more on security than her predecessor, specifically by more aggressively pursuing Mexico's cartels. But she has drawn a clear line when it comes to Mexico's sovereignty, rejecting suggestions by Mr. Trump and others of any intervention by the U.S. military.",
      "Mr. Trump in February designated Venezuela's Tren de Aragua, MS-13 in El Salvador and six groups based in Mexico as foreign terrorist organizations. His Republican administration has also stepped up immigration enforcement against alleged gang members.",
      "The terror designation is normally reserved for groups like al-Qaeda and ISIS, which use violence for political ends \u2014 not for money-focused crime rings such as the Latin American cartels.",
      "But the Trump administration argues the international connections and operations of the groups \u2014 including drug trafficking, migrant smuggling and violent pushes to extend their territory \u2014 warrant the designation.",
      "Earlier this month, the Trump government announced it was doubling to $50 million a reward for the arrest of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, accusing him of being one of the world's largest narco-traffickers and working with cartels to flood the U.S. with fentanyl-laced cocaine.",
      "The press office of Venezuela's government did not respond to a request for comment from the AP on the deployment of the U.S. destroyers. But without mentioning the ships, Foreign Minister Yvan Gil, in a statement on Tuesday, dismissed the Trump administration's drug-trafficking accusations against Venezuela.",
      "\"Washington's accusing Venezuela of drug trafficking reveals its lack of credibility and the failure of its policies in the region,\" Gil said. \"While Washington threatens, Venezuela steadily advances in peace and sovereignty, demonstrating that true effectiveness against crime is achieved by respecting the independence of its peoples. Every aggressive statement confirms the inability of imperialism to subdue a free and sovereign people.\"",
      "The statement was followed by the government's decision to temporarily ban the purchase, sale and operation of drones in Venezuela's airspace. In 2018, drones armed with explosives detonated near Maduro in an apparent assassination attempt while he was delivering a speech to hundreds of soldiers being broadcast live on television.",
      "On Monday, Maduro said the U.S. had increased its threats against Venezuela and announced the planned deployment of more than 4.5 million militia members around the country.

      "Entering Wednesday, the bill needed to pass two votes in the House to advance to the Senate. Each vote passed 88-52.",
      "Before the final vote, lawmakers debated a series of amendments offered by Democrats, all of which were rejected by the Republican majority. The bill was the sole item on the agenda for the day's floor session, which began at 10 a.m.",
      "\"Big WIN for the Great State of Texas!!!\" President Trump said in a Truth Social post late Wednesday night. \"Everything Passed, on our way to FIVE more Congressional seats and saving your Rights, your Freedoms, and your Country, itself.

      "If the Senate approves the House version without changes, the legislation could be sent to Gov. Greg Abbott by the end of the week. If not, the two chambers will need to reconcile differences in a conference committee.",
      "Bill passed after Democrats broke quorum",
      "The vote came after a dramatic standoff earlier this month, when Democratic lawmakers fled the state to break quorum and block action on the redistricting bill. Their absence stalled the Legislature and effectively ended the first special session, delaying the measure for two weeks.",
      "Democrats return under tight restrictions",

      "\"They have racist implications, yes,\" said Rep. Nicole Collier (D-Fort Worth), who spent two nights sleeping in the House chamber to avoid being taken into custody by DPS before the vote. \"You need to be able to trust the voters to elect the candidate they want and keep them together in their same communities. That didn't happen today. Today, they just split that up. So, it's very disappointing to see this is the trajectory they're going.\"",
      "Rep. Katrina Pierson (R-Rockwall) pushed back on the criticism.",

Minority voters are turning Republican, and that is how this map is drawn. It's perfectly legal. Of course, they are going to take us to court, but we will win.\"",
      "Rep. Venton Jones (D-Dallas) expressed deep frustration.",
      "\"My most sincere reaction is disappointment,\" Jones said. \"Once again, Republicans continue to make power grabs on the back of Black and Brown communities. We fought for one of the most important issues we have as Texans, and that's our right to vote. We're going to still continue to fight. We're going to take this to the courts.\"",

      "President Trump called on Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook to resign on Wednesday after one of his administration's officials alleged she had engaged in mortgage fraud and urged an investigation.",
      "Bill Pulte, who Mr. Trump appointed as director of the U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency in March, made the allegations on X, claiming Cook committed mortgage fraud after designating two homes as her primary residence.",
      "The housing regulator also shared an August 15\u00a0letter he sent to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi and Department of Justice official Ed Martin outlining the alleged mortgage fraud. The letter points to documents obtained by the agency, which Pulte claims show Cook falsified bank and property records to \"obtain more favorable loan terms.\"",
      "Pulte alleges Cook pledged in a June 2021 mortgage agreement to buy an Ann Arbor, Michigan, property that she would make the home her primary residence for at least one year, but then two weeks later purchased an Atlanta condominium, which she allegedly also agreed to make her primary residence for a year.",
      "Mortgage rates for primary homes are typically lower than those offered by banks for secondary residences, such as vacation homes or investment properties,\u00a0according to Rocket Mortgage.",
      "In response to Pulte's allegations, Mr. Trump wrote \"Cook must resign, now!!!\" on Truth Social Wednesday morning. The president has also told aides he is considering firing Cook, according to the Wall Street Journal, which cited a senior White House official and another person familiar with the matter.",
      "Pulte also called on the Federal Reserve governor to resign, and said on X that he believes the Justice Department will open a criminal investigation into the alleged mortgage fraud.",
      "The White House did not offer additional comment.",
      "Cook says she won't quit",
      "Cook late Wednesday said she wouldn't leave her post at the Fed. \"I have no intention of being bullied to step down from my position because of some questions raised in a tweet,\" she said in a statement issued by the Fed.",
      "\"I do intend to take any questions about my financial history seriously as a member of the Federal Reserve and so I am gathering the accurate information to answer any legitimate questions and provide the facts,\" she added.",
      "Mr. Trump's call for her to resign comes as the president has been urging the Fed to cut interest rates, while deriding\u00a0Chairman Jerome Powell over the Fed's caution in lowering borrowing costs. Cook holds one of the seats on the 12-person Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, the group at the central bank that makes the decision on whether to cut, hold or raise interest rates based on a majority vote among its members.",
      "Fed set to cut interest rates?",
      "The president has also been\u00a0pushing\u00a0Congress to confirm the nomination of Stephen Miran to the Fed's Board of Governors. Mr. Trump\u00a0appointed Miran, one of his top economic advisers, to serve on the board on an interim basis earlier this month following the resignation of Gov. Adriana Kugler.",
      "Removing Cook from her role and adding Miran \"would not materially alter the composition of the FOMC,\" noted Jaret Seiberg, an analyst with TD Securities, in a research note.",
      "It's also unlikely Miran could be confirmed before the Fed announces its next rate decision on Sept. 17 because the Senate doesn't reconvene until Sept. 2, and a vote would require an \"aggressive schedule\" by the Senate banking committee, Seiberg added.",
      "Wall Street expects Mr. Trump's fervent wish for a rate cut to be granted soon, with economists pegging the probability at 88% that the Fed will lower rates on Sept. 17, according to financial data company FactSet.",
      "In the meantime, Seiberg said he views it as unlikely that Cook will resign before the September Fed meeting.",
      "\"For Cook, resigning will not end the legal probe. It is why we see no incentive for her to react to Pulte by departing before the next FOMC meeting,\" he wrote.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge in New York on Wednesday declined the Justice Department's request to unseal grand jury material in the case of late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, saying prosecutors had failed to demonstrate that \"special circumstances\" warranted the disclosure.",
      "Judge Richard Berman of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York issued his ruling in a 14-page decision denying the government's motion to unseal the documents.",
      "Berman wrote that the grand jury material in question includes the testimony of just a single witness, an FBI agent \"who had no direct knowledge of the facts of the case and whose testimony was mostly hearsay.\" The documents the government was seeking to unseal included roughly 70 pages of transcripts of the agent's two presentations to the grand jury, a PowerPoint exhibit and a call log.",
      "Berman noted that the Justice Department's files on Epstein dwarf those stemming from the grand jury. Proceedings before grand juries are typically kept secret.",
      "\"A significant and compelling reason to reject the Government's position in this litigation is that the Government has already undertaken a comprehensive investigation into the Epstein case and, not surprisingly, has assembled a 'trove' of Epstein documents, interviews, and exhibits. And, the Government committed that it would share its Epstein investigation materials with the public,\" Berman wrote.",
      "\"The Government is the logical party to make comprehensive disclosure to the public of the Epstein Files. By comparison, the instant grand jury motion appears to be a 'diversion' from the breadth and scope of the Epstein files in the Government's possession,\" Berman wrote, quoting a decision by another judge in New York who\u00a0denied the government's move to unseal material in the case of Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's co-conspirator who is serving a 20-year sentence on sex-trafficking charges.",
      "\"The information contained in the Epstein grand jury transcripts pales in comparison to the Epstein investigation information and materials in the hands of the Department of Justice,\" he concluded.",
      "Berman wrote that the grand jury material is \"merely a hearsay snippet of Jeffrey Epstein's alleged conduct.\" He cited \"possible threats to victims' safety and privacy\" as one of the factors that weighed in favor of not releasing the documents.",
      "The Justice Department declined to comment on Berman's ruling.",
      "The family of Virginia Giuffre, one of Epstein's most well-known accusers, who died by suicide earlier this year, said in a statement, \"We applaud Judge Richard Berman's decision not to release the grand jury testimony in the Ghislaine Maxwell case. We wholeheartedly agree with his assessment that the Department of Justice (DOJ) is creating a diversion with its actions regarding the grand jury motion, which distracts from the vast scope of the Epstein files in the government's possession.\"",
      "\"We recognize the critical importance of protecting survivors; it is essential that we redact any information that could jeopardize their safety or privacy. Their well-being must always be our priority,\" the family said. \"At the same time, we demand accountability for all individuals implicated in these heinous acts. Those responsible must be held to the fullest extent of the law. We will not accept anything less than justice for Virginia and all survivors.\"",
      "In July, the Justice Department asked the judges overseeing the Maxwell and Epstein cases to release the grand jury material that formed the basis for the federal charges against them, a move that came amid uproar over the department's review of the so-called \"Epstein files\" and decision not to release additional documents in the government's possession.",
      "Epstein was investigated by federal authorities in Florida in the 2000s, a probe that ended in a non-prosecution agreement and a guilty plea on state prostitution charges. He was arrested again on federal sex trafficking charges in 2019 and died in a Manhattan jail weeks later. Several investigations determined he died by suicide.",
      "There has been increasing pressure on the Trump administration from Democrats and many Republicans to disclose more information about the Epstein case. The Justice Department issued findings of a review of the Epstein investigation in July, saying it had found no evidence of a \"client list\" or indication that Epstein blackmailed prominent figures, an announcement that spurred more questions from skeptics.",
      "Republicans in Congress have pushed for more transparency since the Justice Department's review. The House Oversight Committee issued a subpoena to the department for documents related to Epstein earlier this month. The committee said Tuesday that it expects to receive documents later this week, and intends to begin releasing them pending a review to redact victims' information.",

    "story": [
      "Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard is slashing her office's staff by around 40% \u2014 the latest major Trump-era change slated for the intelligence agency.",
      "The Office of the Director of National Intelligence, or ODNI, is planning on cutting its headcount to around 1,300 employees, down from approximately 2,000 in February and 1,500 as of mid-August, according to a senior ODNI official.",
      "The cuts at ODNI are expected to save around $700 million annually, Gabbard's office estimated in a\u00a0statement. The total budget for all U.S. intelligence agencies exceeded $100 billion last year.",
      "Gabbard said ODNI \"has become bloated and inefficient, and the intelligence community is rife with abuse of power.\"",
      "In a fact sheet on the changes \u2014 dubbed \"ODNI 2.0\" \u2014 the agency said several departments it argued were redundant would be refocused. Those include the National Counterproliferation and Biosecurity Center, which monitors for weapons of mass destruction; the Foreign Malign Influence Center, which describes its mission as \"mitigating threats to democracy\"; and the Cyber Threat Intelligence Integration Center, which handles cybersecurity.",
      "The agency is also planning on shutting down the National Intelligence University, merging it with the Pentagon's National Defense University. And it will shutter the External Research Council and Strategic Futures Group, which ODNI accused of partisanship.",
      "ODNI was created in response to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, which investigators say was preceded by a lack of communication between U.S. intelligence agencies. Its duties include overseeing the dozens of agencies that make up the intelligence community and advising the president on intelligence matters. Since ODNI's founding around 20 years ago, some members of both parties have supported changes to the agency.",
      "Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee, hailed Gabbard's restructuring plans. Earlier this year, Cotton introduced a bill that would cap the number of full-time ODNI employees at 650.",
      "\"Congress created the ODNI to be a lean organization that used small staffs to coordinate across the Intelligence Community and execute specific, important tasks. Today's announcement is an important step towards returning ODNI to that original size, scope, and mission,\" Cotton said in a statement.",
      "Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, criticized Gabbard's moves in a statement. He pointed to \"broad, bipartisan agreement that the Office of the Director of National Intelligence is in need of thoughtful reform.\"",
      "\"But given Director Gabbard's track record of politicizing intelligence \u2013 including her decision just yesterday to revoke security clearances from career national security officials \u2013 I have no confidence that she is the right person to carry out this weighty responsibility,\" said Warner, in reference to Gabbard's\u00a0announcement Tuesday revoking\u00a0the security clearances for dozens of current and former government officials, accusing them of \"politicization or weaponization of intelligence.\"",

    "story": [
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Tuesday that the entire wall along the U.S.-Mexico border is going to be painted black to make it hotter and deter illegal immigration \u2014 an idea she said was \"specifically at the request\" of President Trump.",
      "Noem spoke during a visit to a portion of the wall in New Mexico, where she also picked up a roller brush to help out with the painting.",
      "She touted the height of the wall as well as its depth as ways to deter people seeking to go over or under the walls. And Noem said Homeland Security was going to be trying black paint to make the metal hotter.",
      "\"That is specifically at the request of the president, who understands that in the hot temperatures down here when something is painted black it gets even warmer and it will make it even harder for people to climb. So we are going to be painting the entire southern border wall black to make sure that we encourage individuals to not come into our country illegally,\" Noem said.",
      "U.S. Border Patrol Chief Mike Banks, who attended the event with Noem, said the paint would also help deter rust.",
      "During Mr. Trump's first term, building the wall was a central focus of his hardline immigration policy, though construction on the wall faced some legal and logistical delays. During his second term, his mass deportation agenda with arrests in the interior of the country has been the main focus, but Homeland Security will be getting about $46 billion to complete the wall as part of new funding passed by Congress in the Trump-backed \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act\" this summer.",
      "The Trump administration has sought to fortify the southern border in other ways, too. Thousands of military personnel have been sent to the U.S.-Mexico border, and Mr. Trump has authorized the military to take control of narrow strips of public land along the border. Crossing into those territories is considered entering a military base, allowing them to be detained by both Border Patrol and the Defense Department, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said earlier this year.",
      "Noem said the federal government has been building about a half mile of barrier every day.",
      "\"The border wall will look very different based on the topography and the geography of where it is built,\" she said.",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump is working to coordinate a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, which would be the first face-to-face interaction between the two leaders since Russia invaded Ukraine more than three years ago.",
      "Asked about arranging the meeting on Tuesday, Mr. Trump said on Fox & Friends that he would let Putin and Zelenskyy meet first before getting involved himself, saying \"they haven't been exactly best friends.\"",
      "\"I hope President Putin is going to be good, and if he's not, that's going to be a rough situation,\" Mr. Trump said. He noted that he's hopeful Zelenskyy will \"do what he has to do,\" saying he has to \"show some flexibility also.\"",
      "Budapest, Hungary, is among the locations being considered for possible meeting between Zelenskyy and Putin, a source with knowledge of the planning told CBS News. Hungary has \"expressed its openness and willingness to host the talks,\" as have a handful of other countries, the source said. Politico first reported that Budapest was under consideration to host the talks.",
      "The White House hopes to settle on a date and location for the meeting by the end of this week. German Chancellor Merz said Monday that the goal is for the meeting to take place within the next two weeks.",
      "Mr. Trump told talk radio host Mark Levin on Tuesday that he's aiming for direct Putin-Zelenskyy talks because he believes it would be better for the two leaders to start by meeting one-on-one, \"just to see\" what happens. After that, the U.S. president said he will meet with the Ukrainian and Russian leaders to \"get it closed\" if necessary, which he noted it \"probably will be.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's efforts come one day after an extraordinary series of meetings at the White House between the U.S. president, Zelenskyy and European leaders. In a display of unity, Zelenskyy and the European leaders stressed the importance of security guarantees in a peace deal, which Mr. Trump said could come with U.S. coordination. He said Tuesday that no U.S. troops would be on the ground as part of a security guarantee, but has left the door open to U.S. air support.",
      "Attention has now turned to a possible summit between Putin and Zelenskyy. After Monday's meetings, Mr. Trump said he placed a call to Putin to set up the meeting, and he \"picked it up very happily,\" despite the late hour in Russia. Mr. Trump called it a \"very good call.\"",
      "\"I told him that we're going to set up a meeting with President Zelenskyy, and you and he will meet, and then after that meeting, if everything works out OK, I'll meet and we'll wrap it up,\" Mr. Trump said. He added that it takes \"two to tango,\" and that \"they have to have somewhat of a relationship, otherwise, we're just wasting a lot of time.\"",
      "It is still unclear whether the bilateral meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy would be immediately followed by trilateral talks in the same location, or if Mr. Trump would make arrangements to participate in trilateral talks in a different city on another date after Putin and Zelenskyy have met.",
      "Zelenskyy told CBS News shortly after leaving the White House that a date had not been set to meet with Putin. In a post on X Tuesday, Zelenskyy called the talks in Washington \"truly a significant step toward ending the war and ensuring the security of Ukraine and our people.\"",
      "\"We are already working on the concrete content of the security guarantees,\" Zelenskyy said. \"Today, we continue coordination at the level of leaders. There will be discussions, and we are preparing the relevant formats.\"",
      "A Russian spokesperson would only say that high-level talks would take place, but would not confirm that Putin would be involved.",
      "Mr. Trump, who met with Putin in Alaska last week, expressed urgency around the timing of the next meeting, suggesting that waiting too long would result in thousands of deaths. In what appeared to be a hot mic moment Monday, Mr. Trump told French President Emmanuel Macron that Putin \"wants to make a deal for me.\"",
      "The president outlined on Fox that he has been surprised that Zelenskyy and Putin are \"getting along a little bit better than I thought,\" adding that \"they're the ones that have to call the shots.\"",
      "\"We're going to find out about President Putin in the next couple of weeks, that I can tell you, and we're going to see where it all goes,\" Mr. Trump said. \"It's possible that he doesn't want to make a deal.\"",
      "At the White House press briefing, press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that Putin and Zelenskyy have \"expressed a willingness to sit down with each other,\" and that \"accommodations for that meeting are underway.\"",
      "Meanwhile, security guarantees for Ukraine emerged as a key issue during Monday's meetings, with Zelenskyy calling them a \"starting point towards ending the war.\"",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Monday that the U.S. will work with European and other allies to provide security guarantees for Ukraine after the war, although he did not provide specifics. And Macron said discussions on what the U.S. is willing to provide could begin as soon as Tuesday.",
      "On the security guarantees, Mr. Trump said the European leaders are \"willing to put people on the ground,\" and that \"we're willing to help them with things, especially, probably if you could talk about by air because there's nobody has the kind of stuff we have.\" But the president added that \"I don't think it's going to be a problem.\"",
      "\"There will be some form of security,\" Mr. Trump said. \"It can't be NATO, because that was a \u2014 that's just not something that would ever, ever happen.\"",
      "Leavitt outlined Mr. Trump's position Tuesday afternoon, saying \"the president has definitely stated U.S. boots will not be on the ground in Ukraine, but we can certainly help in the coordination and perhaps provide other means of security guarantees to our European allies.\"",
      "\"The president understands security guarantees are crucially important to secure a lasting peace and he has directed his national security team to coordinate with our friends in Europe,\" she added.",

      "During his annual treks to the North Cascades, Pelto has hiked nearly 6,000 miles, and slept 800 nights in a tent. \u00a0\"We got our picture window,\" he said of the view. \"It's also one of those places that's really special to us as a family.\"",
      "His son Ben, daughter Jill, and now his nine-month-old granddaughter Wren have joined him in the field.",
      "Jill Pelto has spent 17 summers by her dad's side, but she doesn't just collect data. As the project's art director, she paints it. The data points that she and her dad measure eventually will go into her art. \"Data is a story about something in the real world and that story has meaning and emotion,\" she said. \"And that's what I'm trying to bring into my art.\"",
      "Her watercolor paintings are more than just beautiful landscapes; they reveal the science. Look closely and you see a bar graph of glacier decline in the North Cascades. One piece showing temperature rise and ice loss made the cover of Time magazine.",
      "Jill said, \"I think sometimes when people see data there's this instant reaction, and so it's not like the data is any different in my art, but something about that combination maybe gets people to kind of put down the wall of like, 'Oh, I can't understand this,' or 'You know, this is not something I'm interested in.'\"",
      "I said, \"The average person is not going to read a scientific report, but they will see a painting. And it does impact you in a different way.\"",
      "\"Yes, definitely,\" said Jill.",
      "Her art has given her dad a new way to share the story he's been recording for the past 42 years. And it's also changed their relationship: \"We do it so seamlessly at this point,\" Mauri said.",
      "\"Feels like you're one team out here?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yeah,\" he replied.",
      "Jill added, \"This bigger project just means so much to us and has shaped our lives. So, sharing that year after year is beyond special.\"",
      "And now, Mauri Pelto has just eight summers left to fulfill his 50-year promise. Asked what he thinks it will be like to no longer come out to the glaciers, Mauri replied, \"I don't know, I can't remember what it was like to not come out here. This landscape has been shaped by ice, and so to understand the landscape and the ice, you really have to walk across it.\"",

      "Through a partnership with Zipline, a drone delivery and logistics provider, Chipotle is introducing Zipotle, new delivery service for its customers. With Zipotle, small aircrafts called Zips can deliver digital orders directly to customers' homes in just a few minutes, Chipotle said\u00a0in an announcement on Thursday.",
      "Initially, just \"a small number\" of customers will be able to experience Zipotle, according to Chipotle, which said that it would expand the service in the coming weeks.",
      "The burrito chain is touting Zipotle as a superior delivery service that helps customers get their food faster, so that it stays fresh. Everything on Chipotle's menu is available for drone delivery in the Dallas area, the company added. Orders for Zipotle delivery need to be placed through the Zipline app, available through the Apple and Android app stores.",
      "Here's how it works",
      "Once a customer places an order, a Chipotle worker then packs it and places it at a Zipping Point where a Zip drone picks up the order and delivers it to the customer. When the autonomous aircraft arrives at a customer's home, it hovers about 300 feet in the air while lowering and \"gently\" placing the order on the ground, the company states.",
      "Chipotle said the first location to offer Zipotle delivery is at 3109 Lakeview Pkwy, in Rowlett, a suburb in the eastern part of Dallas.",

    "published": "Thu, 21 Aug 2025 16:10:26 -0400",
    "summary": "Jerome Powell will address the state of the U.S. economy \u2014 and perhaps offer hints about interest rates \u2014 in a closely watched speech this week. Here's what to expect.",
    "story": [
      "When Federal Reserve Chair\u00a0Jerome Powell takes the stage Friday at the annual Jackson Hole, Wyoming, economic forum, he will face pressures ranging from President Trump's repeated calls for his resignation to a recent mix of worrying economic data.",
      "Powell, whose term as Fed chair ends in May of 2026, will likely be making his last major speech as the central bank's leader at the event, which is hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. The symposium is closely watched by investors and economists because it provides a stage for Fed officials to share their views on the economy and the direction of monetary policy.",
      "A focal point in Jackson Hole will be if Powell offers any hints about the Fed's next interest-rate decision, scheduled for Sept. 17. Mr. Trump has badgered the Fed to cut rates, pointing to solid U.S. economic data and muted inflation. Powell has mostly shrugged off that pressure, emphasizing that the central bank is taking a \"wait and see\" approach as it monitors the potential impact of the Trump administration's tariffs on consumer prices.",
      "Yet Powell also faces a complicated economic picture, with recent signals pointing to a slowdown in job growth and one gauge of inflation registering its largest increase in three years.",
      "\"You have this political pressure balanced off against the economic pressure, which makes Powell's job particularly difficult, and it's driving a hyper-focus on what he might say on Friday,\" Melissa Brown, managing director of investment decision research at SimCorp, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The Federal Reserve declined to comment ahead of Powell's speech at the Jackson Hole symposium, whose theme this year is \"Labor Markets in Transition: Demographics, Productivity, and Macroeconomic Policy.\"",
      "The Kansas City Fed will broadcast Powell's speech on its YouTube\u00a0channel\u00a0on Friday at 10 a.m. Eastern Time.",
      "To cut or not to cut?",
      "While Powell is likely to discuss economic trends in Jackson Hole, he is virtually certain to demur on the question of when the Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank's 12-person interest rate-setting panel, might choose to lower its benchmark rate.",
      "That is by design. Fed officials famously keep monetary policy decisions \u2014 which are set deliberatively and by consensus \u2014 private before they are officially announced to avoid roiling financial markets and to insulate the central bank from political pressure.",
      "Meanwhile, policy makers will have a chance to assess several major pieces of economic data before their Sept. 16-17 meeting, including the Labor Department's monthly jobs report on Sept. 5 and the Consumer Price Index on Sept. 11.",
      "The head of the labor statistics bureau\u00a0was fired in August after the agency's latest employment figures showed a sharp slowdown in job-creation, prompting Mr. Trump to question the accuracy of the data. For now, the August payrolls and CPI reports remain on the Labor Department's calendar of scheduled releases.",
      "\"I don't think Powell can push the narrative toward cutting because that leaves him no option but to cut,\" said Mike Sanders, head of fixed income at investment management firm Madison Investments.",
      "\"He has to signal, 'We're still data-dependent and we'll see what the data tells us'\" so the Fed doesn't get pushed into a corner, Sanders added.",
      "For their part, investors are clearly placing their bets on the Fed lowering rates in September for the first time since December 2024. Wall Street economists put the likelihood of a cut at 88%, according to financial data company FactSet, with\u00a0 most expecting a 0.25 percentage-point dip.",
      "At last year's Jackson Hole event, Powell signaled that interest-rate cuts were coming after the central bank had previously raised its benchmark rate to its highest level in 23 years in trying to extinguish inflation. The following month, the Fed announced a jumbo cut\u00a0of 0.50 percentage points in a move to boost economic growth.",
      "Dueling mandates",
      "This year, Powell could similarly use his platform in Wyoming to indicate his openness to a rate cut, according to Will Denyer, chief U.S. economist at Gavekal Research. At the same time, the Fed is also \"in a pickle,\" given troubling jobs data and signs that inflation could be creeping higher, he said in a report this week.",
      "That speaks to the Fed's so-called dual mandate, which is to both maximize employment and minimize inflation. Balancing those two goals can require different \u2014 and sometimes conflicting \u2014 policies, as lowering interest rates can boost job growth while causing inflation to tick higher, and vice versa.",
      "\"Data alone suggests a rising risk of a stagflationary scenario, which is, you know, a Fed nightmare,\" Denyer said. \"That puts them in a bind between their two mandates being in conflict.\"",
      "Minutes for the Fed's July 30 rate decision meeting, when the FOMC again chose to hold rates steady, show that some members \"remained worried that supply-chain disruptions could cause inflation to remain stubbornly elevated,\" signaling that price increases remain top of mind, noted Oxford Economics chief U.S. economist Ryan Sweet in a report on Wednesday.",
      "\"The labor market will be the swing factor on whether the Fed cuts interest rates in September or not,\" he added.",

    "published": "Thu, 21 Aug 2025 15:27:26 -0400",
    "summary": "Lizelle Gonzalez was indicted on murder charges in 2022, after she used medication to induce an abortion. The charges were later dropped.",
    "story": [
      "A South Texas woman who was arrested on murder charges in 2022 after using medication to terminate her pregnancy has alleged new details about her case against a local sheriff and prosecutors, claiming they violated her constitutional rights.",
      "Her Aug. 12 court filing comes as the debate over medicated abortion is heating up in Texas, with Attorney General Ken Paxton announcing a new effort to prevent the abortion pill from being mailed into Texas.",
      "\"These abortion drug organizations and radical activists are not above the law, and I have ordered the immediate end of this unlawful conduct,\" Paxton said Wednesday.",
      "The case of Lizelle Gonzalez was among the first to expose the complexities of criminalizing the use of medication to end a pregnancy. Starr County, located on the southern Texas border, launched an investigation into Gonzalez after hospital staff reported to law enforcement that she had taken medication to induce an abortion when she was 19 weeks pregnant. Three months later, she was indicted and arrested. Gonzalez spent three days in jail before her $500,000 bond was posted, and the charges were ultimately dropped.",
      "While Texas has one of the strictest abortion bans in the country, it's not a crime for a woman to obtain or seek abortion care for herself. The state's restrictions on abortion target physicians and those who aid a woman in obtaining or seeking an abortion, whether it's surgical or induced by use of abortion drugs like mifepristone and misoprostol.",
      "According to new filings in the lawsuit made last week, District Attorney Gocha Ramirez dropped the charges against Gonzalez after public outcry over Gonzalez's arrest. Included in an exhibit in the lawsuit was a text Ramirez wrote to his son, in which he admitted he'd made a mistake and even called Gonzalez to apologize, stating he \"didn't know what happened.\"",
      "In the most detailed account to date of the events surrounding Gonzalez's arrest, her attorneys laid out in the 70-page lawsuit the events that they say led the Starr County district attorney, the assistant D.A. and the sheriff to pursue a case against her, even though records suggest prosecutors knew her actions did not violate state law.",
      "\"They should have known from the very beginning that the conduct that they were investigating was not going to ever equal probable cause for homicide,\" said Lauren Johnson, director of the Abortion Criminal Defense Initiative at the American Civil Liberties Union. \"The penal code is very clear that a pregnant person cannot be charged with \u2014 cannot be guilty of a crime, of a homicide, for ending a pregnancy themselves.\"",
      "According to the original complaint filed in March 2024, Gonzalez says she went to an emergency room in January 2022 after taking misoprostol, an abortion-inducing medication.",
      "Less than an hour after she was discharged, she returned to the hospital with complaints of abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding. After an exam detected no fetal cardiac activity, doctors performed a cesarean section to deliver a stillborn fetus.",
      "After the procedure, a nurse at the hospital called 911 and reported the procedure to local police, who then contacted the Starr County Sheriff's Office. The nurse later said the hospital's administrators directed her to report the incident \"because, she said, abortions could now be considered murder due to a 'change in the law,'\" according to the complaint.",
      "\"It is not an overstatement to say that Lizelle's life was entirely upended by what happened to her,\" said Johnson, who is representing Gonzalez in the lawsuit. \"She wanted to live her life and didn't want to be criminalized and have her mugshot in her local community. And have something that should have been a very personal decision be something that was made public.\"",
      "In July, the Southern District Court of Texas denied Starr County officials' attempts to have the lawsuit dismissed after the prosecutors and sheriff raised claims of absolute and qualified immunity, respectively. The immunity doctrine has been developed by the courts to restrict legal liability of government officials, such as law enforcement, judges and prosecutors. Absolute immunity applies a complete shield from legal action regardless of the legality or constitutionality of the official's actions. Qualified immunity however can not shield a government actor, like law enforcement, if they violate \"clearly established\" statutory or constitutional rights.",
      "However, the court filings allege that all three county officials named in the suit \u2014 Ramirez, first assistant prosecutor Alexandria Barrera and Sheriff Rene Fuentes \u2014 violated \"clearly established\" constitutional rights when they pursued a murder charge and arrest for an action the law clearly states is not a crime. And they allege that the prosecutors acted outside of their prosecutorial capacity by directing the investigation and providing legal advice to drive the indictment\u00a0 \u2014 which Gonzalez argues would exempt them from any immunity.",
      "The A.C.L.U. says the hundreds of pages of evidence it has gathered contradict the claim by county officials that they didn't know that it was not lawful to pursue a murder charge against Gonzalez. In a sworn deposition, an investigator with the sheriff's office testified that she wasn't ready to charge Gonzalez with murder but was instructed to do so by Barrera.",
      "\"No practices have been put in place or conduct changed to prevent something like this from happening or being done differently in the future,\" says Johnson. \"I think that part has been especially alarming and really does highlight the need for ways to shine a light on this conduct and also really force elected officials to follow the law when they're using the immense power that they have.\"",

      "A U.S. Navy sailor was convicted Wednesday of charges that he sold military secrets, including details about military warships, to a Chinese intelligence officer while on active duty in exchange for payment.",
      "Jinchao Wei, also known as Patrick Wei, who was an active-duty sailor stationed at Naval Base San Diego, was found guilty by a jury in federal court in San Diego of six counts. The charges on which he was convicted include conspiracy to commit espionage, espionage, and unlawful export of technical data about U.S. defense vehicles in exchange for $12,000.",
      "Wei was a machinist's mate in the U.S.S. Essex, an amphibious assault ship, and held a security clearance that gave him access to sensitive national security defense information about the ship's operations and capabilities.",
      "Federal prosecutors alleged that Wei was approached in February 2022 over social media by someone who claimed to be a naval enthusiast, but in reality was a Chinese intelligence officer. Between the time of their first encounter and Wei's arrest in August 2023, Wei sent photographs, videos and information about the ship's weapons to his handler, in addition to information about ship movement and the potential vulnerabilities of the vessels. Wei also sent information about other Navy ships that he had taken from restricted computer systems. He was paid $12,000 over that period by the Chinese agent.",
      "Prosecutors also presented evidence that Wei and the Chinese agent tried to cover up their communications. According to the U.S. Attorney's Office in Southern California, Wei used encrypted apps and created multiple online accounts to receive payments from his Chinese handler, whom he referred to as \"Big Brother Andy.\" Prosecutors said Wei used digital \"dead drops\" and a computer and phone that were provided by the agent.",
      "When Wei began providing the handler with information, he told another U.S. Navy sailor that he had been asked to spy for the Chinese government, the U.S. Attorney's Office said.",
      "After he was arrested, Wei was asked by FBI investigators to describe his actions involving the Chinese intelligence agent.",
      "\"Espionage,\" he responded, according to prosecutors. They said Wei, during that interview also told investigators, \"I'm screwed.\"",
      "\"The defendant, who took an oath to protect our Nation and was entrusted with a security clearance as a petty officer in the United States Navy, sold out his country for $12,000,\" Assistant Attorney General for National Security John A. Eisenberg said in a statement. \"He violated his oath, betrayed his uniform and fellow sailors, and turned his back on his adopted nation for money. This verdict serves as a warning to those who do not take seriously the solemn obligations of their positions of trust or their duty to this Nation. Do not be tempted by easy money because you will be prosecuted and sent to prison.\"",
      "Wei is scheduled to be sentenced on Dec. 1. The maximum penalty for the charges is life in prison.",
      "Wei's lawyer, Sean Jones, said in a statement to CBS News,\"It was never disputed that Jinchao made numerous errors in judgment. He was young and naive and regrettably agreed to share some very low level information in exchange for easy money.\"",
      "He said Wei \"loves America\" and \"has no allegiance to China,\" and believed he was selling the information to someone for \"the apparent personal or professional benefit of the recipient,\" and not for the benefit of China. Jones said the information Wei sold consisted of \"outdated maintenance manuals to a broken and obsolete steam powered ship.\" Jones added that he believes Wei's actions had \"absolutely no effect on national security\" and expressed hope that \"given the substantial mitigating factors he will receive a fair sentence.\"",
      "The Chinese official's successful spying efforts are viewed as part of a developing area\u00a0in Chinese covert activities that counterintelligence officials are calling \"virtual espionage.\" The practice \u2014 in which Chinese intelligence officers target members of the military and others of high interest on social media, draw them into correspondence, and extract sensitive information from them \u2014 is seen as a rising threat, officials told CBS News.",
      "In March, two active-duty U.S. soldiers and one former soldier were arrested after being accused of selling state secrets to foreign countries, including China, the Justice Department announced.",
      "In a separate case from 2024, another U.S. Navy petty officer pleaded guilty to handing over sensitive information about the U.S. military after he was contacted in a stock trading chat group on the Chinese-owned social media network WeChat.",
      "Jake Rosen is a reporter covering the Department of Justice. He was previously a campaign digital reporter covering President Trump's 2024 campaign and also served as an associate producer for \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan,\" where he worked with Brennan for two years on the broadcast. Rosen has been a producer for several CBS News podcasts, including \"The Takeout,\" \"The Debrief\" and \"Agent of Betrayal: The Double Life of Robert Hanssen.\""

    "published": "Thu, 21 Aug 2025 13:52:40 -0400",
    "summary": "Meteorologists are closely tracking the projected path and forecast of Hurricane Erin, which is the first hurricane to develop over the Atlantic this year.",
    "story": [
      "Hurricane Erin was beginning to move away from the North Carolina coast early Thursday after bringing tropical storm conditions to the state's Outer Banks, the National Hurricane Center in Miami said as it cautioned people not to swim at most U.S. East Coast beaches due to \"life-threatening surf and rip currents.\"",
      "Erin\u00a0isn't expected to make landfall in the U.S., but storm surge warnings\u00a0remain in place for parts of North Carolina and parts of the Outer Banks are under evacuation orders. North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein\u00a0declared a state of emergency\u00a0in the state.",
      "\"This is a life-threatening situation,\" the Miami-based National Hurricane Center said in its 8 a.m. update Thursday. \"Persons located within these areas should take all necessary actions to protect life and property from rising water and the potential for other dangerous conditions.\"",
      "Meanwhile, a tropical storm warning is in effect for a swath of the North Carolina and Virginia coastline.",
      "What category is Hurricane Erin?",
      "Erin, the first Atlantic hurricane of 2025, was a Category 2 storm early Thursday as it churned over the Atlantic off the southeast U.S. coast.",
      "It exploded to a Category 5 on Saturday before being downgraded, and its strength fluctuated in recent days.",
      "As of Thursday afternoon, Erin had maximum sustained winds of 100 mph and was moving north-northeast at 18 mph, according to an advisory from the National Hurricane Center. The storm's center was about 285 miles east of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, and 400 miles northwest of Bermuda.",
      "The hurricane center said \"gradual weakening is forecast during the next couple of days\" and \"Erin is expected to become post-tropical by Saturday.\"",
      "A\u00a0Category 2 hurricane\u00a0is defined as having maximum sustained winds from 96 mph to 110 mph. Erin was just under what's considered a major storm, capable of causing devastating damage with maximum sustained winds of at least 111 mph.",
      "Maps show Hurricane Erin's forecast path",
      "The center of the storm was expected to move over the western Atlantic between the U.S. East Coast and Bermuda through early Friday, then pass south of Atlantic Canada on Friday and Saturday, the hurricane center said.",
      "Erin is a \"large and growing\" storm, with hurricane-force winds extending outward up to 105 miles from the center and tropical storm-force winds extending up to 320 miles from the center, forecasters said.",
      "Tropical storm warnings were in effect from Beaufort Inlet, North Carolina, to Chincoteague, Virginia, including Pamlico and Albemarle sounds. Bermuda upgraded its tropical storm watch to a tropical storm warning on Thursday afternoon. A tropical storm warning means tropical storm conditions are expected somewhere within the warning area, while a watch means they are possible.",
      "A storm surge warning was also issued for the Outer Banks, meaning there was a danger of life-threatening inundation from coastal flooding.",
      "Hurricane Erin's \"spaghetti models\"",
      "A \"spaghetti map\" of the forecast models shows the storm skirting the Caribbean islands and remaining well offshore of the U.S. East Coast as it moves north and curves back over the Atlantic.",
      "A high-pressure system in the Atlantic was expected to steer Erin away from the U.S. coast while a cold front was also forecast to push the hurricane offshore, CBS News Bay Area meteorologist Jessica Burch reported.",
      "When is Hurricane Erin expected to impact the U.S.?",
      "Erin isn't forecast to hit the U.S. directly, though tropical storm conditions were hitting parts of the Outer Banks on Thursday.",
      "Forecasters warned of dangerous storm surge combining with high tide could flood areas with as much as 2 feet to 4 feet of water. Evacuations were ordered for\u00a0Hatteras Island\u00a0and\u00a0Ocracoke Island\u00a0in the Outer Banks ahead of the expected flooding. Some homes in Rodanthe appeared on the verge of collapse.",
      "Rough ocean conditions were also expected to cause life-threatening surf and rip currents. Hatteras and Ocracoke islands were vulnerable to waves of 15 feet to 20 feet, forecasters said. The dangerous conditions resulted in dozens of people being rescued this week in Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina.",
      "Mike Brennan, the hurricane center's director, said the dangerous conditions were expected to last for much of the week across almost the entire East Coast. He urged people to heed any warnings from local officials. The National Hurricane Center reported that when Erin's center passed a NOAA buoy in the Atlantic Ocean, the device recorded a maximum wave height of 45 feet.",
      "\"It's just not going to be a very safe environment to be in the ocean,\" Brennan said.",
      "Rip currents a potentially deadly threat",
      "Rip currents\u00a0are narrow channels of fast-moving water that commonly occur along U.S. coastlines and can pull even strong swimmers away from shore. They're the reason for\u00a0more than 80%\u00a0of beach rescues.",
      "In addition to the warnings along the North Carolina coast, some beaches ranging from South Florida up to New England are also taking precautions.",
      "Erin is expected to bring dangerous rip currents along the Jersey Shore and south-facing New York beaches,\u00a0CBS News New York reported, with the risk continuing through the week. Officials at some New Jersey beaches and the popular summer destination of Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, prohibited swimming as a precaution, and more closures may follow.",
      "\"You're allowed on the beach, but you will not be allowed in the water because we have treacherous conditions going on right now,\" said Ed Schneider, beach patrol captain in Wildwood, New Jersey, told CBS News Philadelphia. \"We have a rip current warning, we have [a] rough surf warning, we have [a] storm warning, and conditions are bad.\"",
      "First hurricane of the Atlantic season",
      "Erin formed as a tropical storm\u00a0last week west of the island nation of Cabo Verde, a few hundred miles off Africa's western coast. It is the fifth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, which started in June and runs through November. Erin strengthened to a hurricane on Friday.",
      "So far this year, Tropical Storm Chantal is the only one to have made landfall in the U.S., bringing deadly flooding to North Carolina in early July. In June, Barry made landfall as a tropical depression on Mexico's eastern coast.",
      "Erin's increased strength comes as the Atlantic hurricane season approaches its peak in September. According to the hurricane center, most of the season's activity typically happens between mid-August and mid-October. In the eastern Pacific Ocean, hurricane season starts on May 15 with a peak in activity typically seen in late August.",
      "The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA, forecast an above-normal season for the Atlantic this year, expecting between 13 and 18 named storms.",
      "Tropical storms have maximum sustained winds of at least 39 mph. Forecasters with NOAA anticipated that between five and nine of the storms this year could become hurricanes, which have sustained winds of at least 74 mph. Hurricanes are rated on a scale based on their wind speeds, ranging from Category 1, the weakest, to Category 5, the most severe rating.",
      "NOAA forecasters predicted there could be between two and five major hurricanes in the Atlantic this season.",

    "story": [
      "Cracker Barrel shed almost $200 million in market value after its stock plunged Thursday following the release of a new logo. The new design eliminates a longstanding drawing of an overall-clad man leaning against a barrel, in favor of a cleaner logo featuring just the chain's name.",
      "Shares of Cracker Barrel fell as much as $8.74, or almost 15%, in Thursday trading, shaving as much as $194.6 million from the company's market value. The stock regained some ground in early afternoon trading, with shares down $8.19, or 13.9%, to $50.84.",
      "Wall Street's reaction to the logo redesign comes as Cracker Barrel has been working to refresh its image through new menu items and redecorated stores that eschew the 55-year-old chain's old-timey approach in favor of a more modern look.",
      "According to the company's website, the man and barrel in the old logo represented \"the old country store experience where folks would gather around and share stories.\"",
      "It's unusual for a company's share price to plunge dramatically due to a logo redesign, although marketing missteps can cause investors to question a company' strategy. Cracker Barrel's overhaul has been overseen by CEO Julie Felss Masino, who last year described the chain as \"not as relevant as we once were,\" and announced plans to update its down-home menu.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Cracker Barrel said that the man portrayed in the logo, known as \"Uncle Herschel,\" will remain \"front and center in our restaurants and on our menu.\"",
      "\"Our values haven't changed, and the heart and soul of Cracker Barrel haven't changed,\" the company said.",

    "story": [
      "A panel of justices on a New York appellate court threw out the half-billion-dollar penalty in the civil fraud case against President Trump and others on Thursday, ruling that the fine was \"excessive\" while saying they were divided on the merits of the case.",
      "One of the justices on the Appellate Division, First Judicial Department wrote that the penalty, known as a disgorgement, against Mr. Trump, two of his sons and other executives and their company was \"an excessive fine barred by the Eighth Amendment.\"",
      "In February 2024, a New York judge ordered Mr. Trump and his codefendants to pay the state nearly $364 million in \"ill-gotten gains\" and millions more in interest dating back years, a total that has since ballooned to about $527 million. Judge Arthur Engoron's judgment left Mr. Trump on the hook for nearly 98% of the total.",
      "New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement Thursday that her office will appeal the decision to the Court of Appeals, the state's highest court. Her statement lauded one aspect of the ruling, which left in place sanctions barring Mr. Trump from serving as an officer or director of any corporation or other legal entity in the state for three years. His sons, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., were banned for two years.",
      "\"The court upheld the injunctive relief we won, limiting Donald Trump and the Trump Organization officers' ability to do business in New York. It should not be lost to history: yet another court has ruled that the president violated the law, and that our case has merit,\" James said.",
      "Mr. Trump hailed the decision in a post on Truth Social, claiming \"TOTAL VICTORY,\" despite the limited nature of the ruling.",
      "\"I greatly respect the fact that the Court had the Courage to throw out this unlawful and disgraceful Decision that was hurting Business all throughout New York State,\" Mr. Trump wrote.",
      "James first brought the case in 2022, alleging Mr. Trump oversaw a scheme to deliberately mislead companies he was in business with about the values of properties and Mr. Trump's overall net worth.",
      "Mr. Trump's lawyers have long argued that the civil case was driven by politics. But Engoron disagreed, ruling in February 2024 that Trump and his codefendants had misrepresented his wealth and inflated the valuations of his properties by hundreds of millions of dollars over the course of a decade. The state said the scheme was intended to trick banks and insurers into offering more favorable deal terms.",
      "The president appealed the judgment, and the five-justice appellate panel heard arguments in September 2024. At least two of the justices seemed skeptical of the size of the judgment. One called it \"immense\" and \"troubling.\" Mr. Trump was represented during the September proceeding by D. John Sauer, who is now the solicitor general.",
      "The court's ruling",
      "In a complex 323-page series of opinions on Thursday, the justices wrote that they were deeply divided, with two saying a new trial should be ordered and one writing that the case should be tossed altogether. A majority of four justices settled on an alternate path: vacating the massive financial penalty without resolving the merits of the case. The penalty, as one wrote, \"was far from a reasonable approximation\" of the amount that was warranted.",
      "Justice David Friedman, who dissented from the majority, noted that two of the four justices who voted to vacate the penalty \"do not actually agree with the resolution of the appeal for which they are voting.\"",
      "\"I find it remarkable that, although a three-justice majority of this five-justice panel believe that the judgment in favor of the Attorney General should not stand \u2026 the result of the appeal is the affirmance of the judgment, albeit as modified to eliminate the disgorgement award,\" Friedman wrote.",
      "\"To draw a sports analogy, it is as if a team is awarded a touchdown without crossing the goal line,\" he continued.",
      "Justices John Higgitt and Llin\u00e9t Rosado said they would have preferred to order a new trial, but would join the majority \"with great reluctance.\"",
      "\"Under the truly extraordinary circumstances here, where none of the writings enjoys the support of a majority, we are moved to take this action to permit this panel to arrive at a decision and to permit the parties and the Court to avoid the necessity of reargument,\" they wrote. \"We must therefore agree with Justice Friedman in his observation that a remarkable situation has necessitated a remarkable solution.\"",
      "The appellate court typically issues decisions within a few months of arguments, but the intricacy of the legal issues at hand seems to have delayed a final ruling. Sources on both sides of the dispute expressed surprise to CBS News about the length of the wait for a resolution, as the seasons changed and the court drew closer to a year without word from the court.",
      "James' office has defended the punishment, saying it accurately reflected the size of Mr. Trump's profits from fraud.",
      "Engoron wrote in his ruling that documents in evidence prove \"over and over again\" that the defendants falsely inflated Mr. Trump's wealth and reported those fraudulent numbers to business partners.",
      "He said Mr. Trump's \"complete lack of contrition and remorse borders on pathological,\" and said his company gave their accountants \"blatantly false financial data.\"",
      "Despite overturning the judgment, the appellate panel concluded that Engoron \"was even-handed at trial, and allowed both sides to 'make their case.'\"",
      "Mr. Trump testified during a bench trial in the case, in November 2023, blaming his employees and others while also insisting his books were kept appropriately. Accused of falsely inflating his wealth, Mr. Trump claimed the opposite was true, saying his company \"underestimated\" the value of his properties.",
      "\"The numbers you are talking about here is, you know, they are very big numbers, very, very big. Far bigger \u2014 the values are far bigger than what is on the financial statement,\" Mr. Trump said, later adding, \"billions of dollars more.\"",
      "Engoron concluded that testimony by Mr. Trump, his sons and other Trump Organization executives was not credible. A majority of the appellate panel agreed with that determination, as well as another related to Mr. Trump's former lawyer and \"fixer\" Michael Cohen, who testified against Mr. Trump.",

      "The new framework, which is an agreement to facilitate trade negotiations between countries rather than a finalized deal, comes after President Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen met briefly in July at Mr. Trump's Turnberry golf course in Scotland. At the time, they announced a sweeping trade deal that imposed 15% tariffs on most European goods, warding off the Mr. Trump's threat of a 30% rate if no deal was reached by Aug. 1.",
      "In the latest pact, the U.S. reaffirmed its pledge to limit import duties on most European goods, including cars, drugs and semiconductors to no more than 15%, pending additional legislative actions by the EU.",

    "summary": "A jury found a man not guilty of organizing the daytime ambush killing of rapper Young Dolph at a Memphis bakery in November 2021.",
    "story": [
      "A man on trial for organizing the ambush killing of rapper Young Dolph\u00a0at a Memphis bakery in 2021 has been found not guilty.",
      "A Memphis jury deliberated about three hours before finding Hernandez Govan, 45, not guilty of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit first-degree murder. He rejected an offer from the state last month to settle with a guilty plea, CBS News affiliate WREG\u00a0reported.",
      "On Thursday, Govan hugged his lawyer and thanked Shelby County Judge Jennifer Mitchell after she told him he was free to go.",
      "Govan was not accused of shooting Young Dolph, but prosecutors claimed he directed the two people who did. The jury was not convinced, however, despite a man's testimony that Govan hired him to \"do the hits\" and was going to take $10,000 as his cut.",
      "Govan's lawyer questioned the quality of the police investigation and the validity of cellphone communications between Govan and the men who shot Dolph, arguing that nothing in the communications directly incriminated Govan or tied him to the killings.",
      "Young Dolph, whose legal name is Adolph Thornton Jr., was a rapper, independent label owner and producer who grew up in Memphis and was admired in the city for his charitable works.",
      "On the day of the 2021 ambush, the 36-year-old was in his hometown to hand out Thanksgiving turkeys to families when his visit to his favorite cookie shop turned into an attack that shocked the entertainment world.",
      "Authorities said two men exited a white Mercedes-Benz and began shooting at the rapper at the bakery. He died after being shot about 20 times, according to a medical examiner's report.",
      "Four years earlier, Young Dolph suffered critical injuries\u00a0in a 2017 attack, when three men approached and shot him over \"beef,\" according to the Los Angeles Police Department. Earlier that same year, he had been involved in a separate shooting where at least 100 bullets were fired at his SUV.",
      "Testifying against Govan was Cornelius Smith Jr., who has admitted to being one of the two shooters who ambushed Young Dolph. Smith previously was the main witness against Justin Johnson, who was convicted of first-degree murder in 2024 after Smith named him as the second shooter.",
      "Smith faces charges for murder and conspiracy to commit murder for his alleged role in Young Dolph's death. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges and does not currently have a trial date set. Johnson was originally sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole following his 2024 conviction, plus an additional 35 years for two additional convictions from his trial.",
      "Memphis prosecutors have portrayed Young Dolph's killing as part of an effort by Anthony \"Big Jook\" Mims to get revenge on Young Dolph for diss tracks aimed at Big Jook and the record label he helped run for his brother, rapper Yo Gotti. Smith has testified that Big Jook put out a $100,000 hit on Young Dolph as well as smaller bounties on all the artists at Young Dolph's record label, Paper Route Empire.",
      "At Johnson's earlier trial, a prosecutor told jurors Cocaine Muzik Group (now known as Collective Music Group), a rival record label founded by Yo Gotti, wanted Young Dolph to work for them, but he turned them down.",
      "Big Jook was shot and killed outside a restaurant in January 2024.",
      "Smith testified Monday that \"I didn't know anything about Paper Route having no hits,\" before Govan told him about them. He said Govan hired him to \"do the hits,\" including giving Smith guns for the killing, and was going to take $10,000 as his cut. Govan was also the person who told him and Johnson that Young Dolph would be in Memphis for the Thanksgiving turkey giveaway, so \"that's our opportunity,\" Smith said.",
      "Prosecutors introduced as evidence dozens of cellphone communications between Johnson, Smith, Govan and Big Jook ahead of the shooting.",
      "Meanwhile, Govan's defense attorney, Manny Arora, tried to paint Smith as an unreliable witness who would say anything to try to get a lighter sentence.",
      "Arora pointed to previous testimony where Smith recalled a chance encounter with Big Jook. At the time, Smith implied that Big Jook was the person who hired him. After Smith was arrested, his attorney called Big Jook's attorney and received somewhere between $38,000 and $50,000 in cash. Smith said on Monday that he did not know who had supplied the money.",
      "Smith also testified that he previously heard that Govan might be working with the FBI. Arora asked why Smith would take a job from Govan if that were the case. Smith said Govan was \"innocent until proven guilty.\"",
      "Govan did not testify in his defense.",
      "Smith is charged with murder and conspiracy to commit murder but has pleaded not guilty and does not yet have a trial date.",
      "Johnson was sentenced last September to life in prison with the possibility of parole. He was later sentenced for two other convictions from the trial: conspiracy to commit murder and being a felon in possession of a gun.",

      "If you look up at the sky in Texas and see what could be a flying burrito, you may not be imagining things: Chipotle on Thursday launched an autonomous aerial delivery service for digital orders in the Dallas area.",
      "Through a partnership with Zipline, a drone delivery and logistics provider, Chipotle is introducing Zipotle, new delivery service for its customers. With Zipotle, small aircrafts called Zips can deliver digital orders directly to customers' homes in just a few minutes, Chipotle said\u00a0in an announcement on Thursday.",
      "Initially, just \"a small number\" of customers will be able to experience Zipotle, according to Chipotle, which said that it would expand the service in the coming weeks.",
      "The burrito chain is touting Zipotle as a superior delivery service that helps customers get their food faster, so that it stays fresh. Everything on Chipotle's menu is available for drone delivery in the Dallas area, the company added. Orders for Zipotle delivery need to be placed through the Zipline app, available through the Apple and Android app stores.",
      "Here's how it works",
      "Once a customer places an order, a Chipotle worker then packs it and places it at a Zipping Point where a Zip drone picks up the order and delivers it to the customer. When the autonomous aircraft arrives at a customer's home, it hovers about 300 feet in the air while lowering and \"gently\" placing the order on the ground, the company states.",
      "Chipotle said the first location to offer Zipotle delivery is at 3109 Lakeview Pkwy, in Rowlett, a suburb in the eastern part of Dallas.",
      "\"Zipotle is a quick and convenient source of delivery that lets guests enjoy our real food from places that are traditionally challenging to serve, including backyards and public parks,\" Curt Garner, president and chief strategy and technology officer at Chipotle said in the announcement.",
      "\"With Zipline, you tap a button, and minutes later food magically appears \u2014 hot, fresh, and ultra-fast,\" Zipline CEO and co-founder Rinaudo Cliffton said in the same announcement. \"What once felt like science fiction is soon going to become totally normal,\" he added.",
      "For now, each autonomous aircraft can carry orders of up to 5.5 pounds in weight. That will increase eventually to 8 pounds, Chipotle said.",
      "Last year, Chipotle was criticized by some customers who alleged certain restaurants were\u00a0skimping on portions. The company initially denied the claims, before then CEO Brian Niccol\u00a0acknowledged that about 10%\u00a0of Chipotle's 3,500 locations had indeed been underserving customers.",

      "Two beachfront homes in North Carolina's Outer Banks appear to be on the verge of collapse as they are pounded by strong waves from\u00a0Hurricane Erin. Nearly a dozen neighboring homes have fallen into the Atlantic Ocean since 2020.",
      "While the swells from storms like Erin make things worse, the conditions threatening the houses are always present. The placement of the homes along the water puts them at risk, according to the National Park Service, which oversees much of the area.",
      "Many of the homes along the beaches of the Outer Banks are on properties once filled with land, dunes and dry sand that are now partially or fully covered with ocean water \"on a regular basis,\" the agency says.",
      "Photos show teetering homes",
      "Photos show the Rodanthe, North Carolina, homes on elevated wooden support beams, with water churning beneath them. High tides were sending surges of water into the support beams on Thursday morning. In one image, the beams appear to be unsteady and bending inwards.",
      "Rodanthe, home to about 200 people, sticks out further into the Atlantic Ocean than any other part of North Carolina. Barrier islands like the Outer Banks were never an ideal place for development, according to experts. The islands\u00a0typically form\u00a0as waves deposit sediment off the mainland. And they move based on weather patterns and other ocean forces.\u00a0Some even disappear.",
      "Decades ago, houses and other buildings were smaller, less elaborate and easier to move from the encroaching surf, said David Hallac, superintendent of the Cape Hatteras National Seashore in the Outer Banks.",
      "\"Perhaps it was more well understood in the past that the barrier island was dynamic, that it was moving,\" Hallac said. \"And if you built something on the beachfront it may not be there forever or it may need to be moved.\"",
      "At least 11 other houses have toppled into the surf in Rodanthe in the past five years, according to the National Park Service. In September 2024, three houses collapsed in just one week. Rising water levels mean more structures are always at risk: Some places along the Outer Banks lose up to 10 to 15 feet of beachfront a year, Hallac said.",
      "\"All of a sudden, the foreshore, that area between low water and high water, is right up next to somebody's backyard. And then the erosion continues,\" he said.",
      "A 2024 report from a group of federal, state and local officials studying threatened oceanfront structures in North Carolina found that 750 of nearly 8,800 such structures in the state are considered at risk from erosion.",

Carol Diller, 96, stayed behind \u2014 but told CBS News she fears the impact of the eroding shoreline on the motel she has owned for 70 years. The buildings are up against a national park and can't be rebuilt any further back, she said.",

      "His death was confirmed by the Dr. James Dobson Family Institute.",
      "Dobson started a radio show counseling Christians on how to be good parents and founded Focus on the Family in Colorado Springs in 1977, which at its peak had more than 1,000 employees and gave him a platform to weigh in on legislation, advise White House panels and advocate against laws to ban conversion therapy to \"cure\" gay people.",
      "He became a force in the 1980s for pushing conservative Christian ideals in American politics alongside fundamentalist giants like Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson. He campaigned for bringing religious conservatives into the political mainstream, and in 1989, Falwell called Dobson a rising star. Decades later, he served on President Trump's Evangelical Executive Advisory Board.",

      "An anti-pornography crusader, Dobson recorded a video interview with serial killer Ted Bundy the day before his Jan. 24, 1989, execution in Florida. Bundy told Dobson that exposure to pornography helped fuel his sexual urges to a point that he looked for satisfaction by mutilating, killing and raping women.",

    "published": "Thu, 21 Aug 2025 10:00:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The Department of Homeland Security figure comes with caveats, researchers who study population demographics told CBS News, and it's too early to conclude that there's been a mass exodus.",
    "story": [
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said last week that the number of unauthorized immigrants living in the U.S. has declined by 1.6 million since President Trump began his immigration crackdown.",
      "\"This is massive,\" Noem said in a statement, crediting the decline in part to an ad campaign warning undocumented immigrants to leave or face arrest and deportation.",
      "\"This new data shows illegal aliens are hearing our message,\" she added. In the Department of Homeland Security's news release, Noem did not specify how many of those individuals were believed to have departed the U.S. voluntarily, versus those who have been deported.",
      "But the vast majority would have had to have left without making any contact with DHS to reach that total. According to internal government figures previously obtained by CBS News, over the first six months of President Trump's second term, the administration deported nearly 150,000 people and recorded 13,000 who self-deported.",
      "A DHS spokesperson told CBS News that it sourced the 1.6 million figure from its own numbers out of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, although its news release included a chart from an analysis released earlier this month by the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that supports immigration restrictions.",
      "It did not provide additional information on how USCIS calculated this estimate.",
      "Any estimate of the current unauthorized population at this stage comes with caveats, researchers who study population demographics told CBS News, and it's too early to conclude that there's been a mass exodus.",
      "A new analysis from the Pew Research Center, released Thursday, estimated that there were 14 million unauthorized immigrants living in the U.S. as of 2023. That's the latest year for which data from the Census Bureau's American Community Survey is available \u2014 the survey that experts say is the gold standard for making these population estimates.",
      "The Pew Research Center's analysis found that the undocumented immigrant population swelled by 3.5 million from 2021 to 2023, driven largely by recent arrivals during the Biden administration.",
      "It had previously declined by 1.1 million between the start of the Obama administration and the end of the first Trump administration, Pew found.",
      "Meanwhile, the analysis from the Center for Immigration Studies is based on another Census Bureau survey known as the Current Population Survey. The CPS polls about 60,000 households \u2014 about 2% of the size of the American Community Survey's sample \u2014 making some estimates less reliable. Experts also note some immigrants may not respond amid increased enforcement.",
      "The Pew Research Center analyzed the CPS data as well, and found similar results, showing the unauthorized immigrant population may have continued to grow into 2024 and started to decline in 2025.",
      "\"For [20]25, all we have is CPS data and that points to a decline from a January peak of immigrants,\" Jeffrey Passel, the Pew report's lead author, told CBS News. \"How big the decline is could be affected by the decrease in response rates.\"",
      "To estimate the unauthorized population, researchers typically subtract the number of immigrants with legal status from the overall foreign-born population. Estimating the foreign-born population in the absence of the American Community Survey can be tricky.",
      "The Census Bureau, which oversees both surveys, cautions against using the Current Population Survey to estimate the foreign-born populations due to its sample size.",
      "Zooming in on the foreign-born population within the CPS survey makes a small sample size even smaller, introducing wide margins of error, experts say. The foreign-born population makes up about 14% of the total U.S. population, according to the latest ACS survey.",
      "The analysis from the Center for Immigration Studies estimated that the total foreign-born population, which includes both legal and illegal immigrants, fell by 2.2 million between January and July, including 600,000 non-citizens with legal status.",
      "Steven Camarota, the lead author on that analysis, said the decline in the overall foreign-born population is statistically significant, or not due to chance, despite the wide margins of error. He noted that response rates have declined for more than a decade, but haven't prevented the survey from tracking the previous increases in the foreign-born population prior to January 2025.",
      "Data is not available on the response rates among foreign-born people compared with U.S.-born people surveyed, so it isn't clear how much of the recent decline in the response rate is reflective of a drop off among immigrants.",
      "\"Given that the foreign-born is a small minority of the population, you can have a meaningful decline in the foreign-born response rate without having much of a decline in the overall response rate,\" Jed Kolko, an economist who served as under secretary of commerce for economic affairs during the Biden Administration, told CBS News.",
      "Still, Kolko said there are other indicators that the unauthorized population has begun to decline. Industries that rely heavily on labor from unauthorized workers, such as construction, hotels and restaurants, have seen greater drops in employment than all other industries, according to his analysis of a Bureau of Labor Statistics survey of employers rather than households.",

It remained a Category 2 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of around 105 mph.",
      "The hurricane center on Thursday was also watching two tropical disturbances far out in the Atlantic that could develop into named storms in coming days.

      "A federal appeals court has cleared the way for the Trump administration to end temporary deportation protections for more than 60,000 people from Nicaragua, Honduras and Nepal \u2014 at least for now.",
      "A lower court last month blocked the Department of Homeland Security from ending Temporary Protected Status, or TPS, for the three countries until at least mid-November to give the court more time to weigh the issue. The judge sided with plaintiffs who argued the Trump administration's plan to wind down TPS was \"motivated by racial animus.\"",
      "But on Wednesday, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit put that ruling on hold pending appeal. The order \u2014 which was issued by a panel of three judges nominated under the Clinton, Bush and first Trump administrations \u2014 did not offer a rationale for the decision.",
      "Tens of thousands of migrants from Nicaragua, Honduras and Nepal rely on TPS, a program that grants temporary reprieve from deportation and work permits to people whose home countries are deemed unsafe due to war or natural disaster.",
      "If they don't have any other means to stay in the U.S. legally \u2014 like a green card or an asylum application \u2014 those who lose their TPS are no longer eligible to work in the country lawfully and are at risk of deportation.",
      "Prior to last month's ruling, the Trump administration sought to end TPS for Nepal on Aug. 5, and for Nicaragua and Honduras in early September.",
      "The American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California \u2014 one of the organizations that sued the administration over the TPS decision \u2014 called Wednesday's ruling \"devastating.\"",
      "\"I am heartbroken by the court's decision,\" Sandhya Lama, one of the plaintiffs in the case, said in a statement released by the ACLU. \"I've lived in the U.S. for years, and my kids are U.S. citizens and have never even been to Nepal. This ruling leaves us and thousands of other TPS families in fear and uncertainty.\"",
      "DHS called the ruling a \"significant legal victory\" in a statement.",
      "\"Temporary Protected Status was always meant to be just that: Temporary,\" DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said. \"TPS was never meant to be a de facto asylum system, yet that is how previous administrations have used it for decades while allowing hundreds of thousands of foreigners into the country without proper vetting.\"",
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has sought to wind down TPS for hundreds of thousands of migrants from Afghanistan, Cameroon, Haiti, Venezuela and other countries, arguing their protections have been in place for too long or that conditions in those nations have improved enough to allow their nationals to return.",
      "The Trump administration, for example, has noted that the TPS programs for Honduras and Nicaragua were first created in 1999, after Hurricane Mitch caused catastrophic floods and killed thousands in Central America. The TPS program for Nepal was announced in 2015, after an earthquake hit the small Asian country. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem has said all three countries have recovered from those environmental disasters.",
      "But San Francisco-based U.S. District Judge Trina Thompson said last month the TPS holders who sued Noem were likely to succeed in arguing that her decisions were \"preordained\" actions that did not fully consider lingering conditions in Honduras, Nepal and Nicaragua.",
      "The judge also referenced a comment made by President Trump during the 2024 campaign in which he said migrants entering the U.S. illegally were \"poisoning the blood of our country.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 21 Aug 2025 15:47:00 -0400",
    "summary": "A July 20 memo ordered U.S. intelligence agencies not to share information about Russia-Ukraine talks with Five Eyes partners U.K., Canada, Australia and New Zealand.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 As Russia's war in Ukraine rages on despite high-level meetings to discuss a possible path to peace, CBS News has learned that Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, issued a directive weeks ago to the U.S. intelligence community ordering that all information regarding the Russia-Ukraine peace negotiations not be shared with U.S.-allied intelligence partners.",
      "The memo, dated July 20 and signed by Gabbard, directed agencies to not share information with the so-called Five Eyes, the post-World War II intelligence alliance comprising the U.S., U.K., Canada, Australia and New Zealand, multiple U.S. intelligence officials told CBS News. They spoke under condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive national security matters.",
      "The officials said the directive classified all analysis and information related to the volatile Russia-Ukraine peace negotiations as \"NOFORN,\" or no foreign dissemination, meaning the information could not be shared with any other country or foreign nationals. The only information that could be shared was information that had already been publicly released. The memo also limited distribution of material regarding peace talks to within the agencies that created or originated the intelligence.",
      "The memo does not seem to prevent the sharing of diplomatic information gathered by other means separate from the U.S. intelligence community, or military operational information unrelated to the talks \u2014 such as the details the U.S. shares with the Ukrainian military to aid in their defensive operations.",
      "Contacted by CBS News, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence referred questions to the White House, which did not respond.",
      "\"In general, the value of the Fives Eyes intelligence partnership is that when we are making and they are making policy decisions, we can both augment each other's intelligence and therefore know more about the plans, intentions, and capabilities of our adversaries,\" explained Steven Cash, a former intelligence officer at the Central Intelligence Agency and Department of Homeland Security.",
      "\"Among the reasons for that sort of default is the expectation that we and the other four are all sitting on the same side of the table with some other adversary on the other side,\" Cash said.",
      "He said it's important for the allies to have \"a common intelligence picture\" so policymakers and negotiators \"can coordinate our positions and get the best deal we can, or fight the best war we can.\" Cash is the executive director of The Steady State, a nonprofit organization made up of former U.S. intelligence and national security professionals and government officials concerned with threats to American democracy.",
      "In March 1946, Winston Churchill spoke of the \"special relationship\" between the U.S. and the U.K. and the threat of the \"Iron Curtain\" that had \"descended across the Continent.\" The United States and Britain first forged their intelligence alliance in secret, signing an agreement to pool information as a bulwark against the Soviet Union.",
      "Later, Canada, Australia and New Zealand joined the arrangement, transforming what began as a bilateral pact into the five-nation network that would come to be known as the Five Eyes.",
      "But now, nearly 80 years later, some former U.S. government officials warn that the breadth of Gabbard's order could undermine the intelligence community alliance \u2014 discouraging analysts from sharing insights and eroding trust among allies who have long relied on open exchanges to form a common picture of global threats and paths to successful negotiation.",
      "Cash and CBS News national security contributor Sam Vinograd, a former homeland security official, said Five Eyes often has intelligence that helps the U.S. produce comprehensive intelligence assessments, especially about Russia, given the access Five Eyes partners have to other intelligence sources.",
      "\"Shutting our most trusted partners off from intelligence assessments could have a chilling effect on critical intelligence sharing if our partners believe they're being shut out of key access \u2014 including on key matters in their region. They could decide to take similar steps toward the U.S.,\" Vinograd said.",
      "She added, \"Policy-wise, if our Five Eyes partners think they are being shut off from key information. They could choose to create new structures and channels without us. A lack of full collaboration with our closest partners could lead them to discuss matters impacting our national security without our input and perspective.\"",
      "Still, other former intelligence officers contend Gabbard's directive is commonplace within the U.S. intelligence community, and the criticism is much ado about nothing. They say both the U.S. and the other members of the intelligence alliance frequently withhold information from each other in diverging interest areas. Ezra Cohen, a Hudson Institute fellow who served as the acting undersecretary of defense for intelligence at the Pentagon, suggested that condemnation of Gabbard's memo likely stems from a dislike of Trump administration policies and her leadership as director of national intelligence.",
      "\"There is a lot of information we do not share even with our Five Eyes partners, and it works in the reverse. There's a lot of U.K. eyes-only material. There's a lot of Australian eyes-only material,\" said Cohen.",
      "\"Our interests are not always aligned with our Five Eyes partners,\" Cohen said. \"And where we have diverging interests, and it's not just Ukraine, we absolutely mark things NOFORN.\"",
      "He admits it's possible the directive could result in depriving the U.S. of information, but maintains these types of decisions have historically been the norm between all of the Five Eyes members. He said the claim that the directive represents \"a chilling of the relationship\" between the U.S. and Five Eyes seems \"a little bit like faux outrage.\"",
      "As intelligence work and diplomatic efforts continue, largely out of the public eye, the war in Ukraine continues to take a deadly toll. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned Moscow Thursday for launching hundreds of drones and dozens of missiles in an attack overnight, \"as if nothing had changed at all. As if there were no efforts by the world to stop this war.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 21 Aug 2025 13:52:40 -0400",
    "summary": "Meteorologists are closely tracking the projected path and forecast of Hurricane Erin, which is the first hurricane to develop over the Atlantic this year.",
    "story": [
      "Hurricane Erin was beginning to move away from the North Carolina coast early Thursday after bringing tropical storm conditions to the state's Outer Banks, the National Hurricane Center in Miami said as it cautioned people not to swim at most U.S. East Coast beaches due to \"life-threatening surf and rip currents.\"",
      "Erin\u00a0isn't expected to make landfall in the U.S., but storm surge warnings\u00a0remain in place for parts of North Carolina and parts of the Outer Banks are under evacuation orders. North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein\u00a0declared a state of emergency\u00a0in the state.",
      "\"This is a life-threatening situation,\" the Miami-based National Hurricane Center said in its 8 a.m. update Thursday. \"Persons located within these areas should take all necessary actions to protect life and property from rising water and the potential for other dangerous conditions.\"",
      "Meanwhile, a tropical storm warning is in effect for a swath of the North Carolina and Virginia coastline.",
      "What category is Hurricane Erin?",
      "Erin, the first Atlantic hurricane of 2025, was a Category 2 storm early Thursday as it churned over the Atlantic off the southeast U.S. coast.",
      "It exploded to a Category 5 on Saturday before being downgraded, and its strength fluctuated in recent days.",
      "As of Thursday afternoon, Erin had maximum sustained winds of 100 mph and was moving north-northeast at 18 mph, according to an advisory from the National Hurricane Center. The storm's center was about 285 miles east of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, and 400 miles northwest of Bermuda.",
      "The hurricane center said \"gradual weakening is forecast during the next couple of days\" and \"Erin is expected to become post-tropical by Saturday.\"",
      "A\u00a0Category 2 hurricane\u00a0is defined as having maximum sustained winds from 96 mph to 110 mph. Erin was just under what's considered a major storm, capable of causing devastating damage with maximum sustained winds of at least 111 mph.",
      "Maps show Hurricane Erin's forecast path",
      "The center of the storm was expected to move over the western Atlantic between the U.S. East Coast and Bermuda through early Friday, then pass south of Atlantic Canada on Friday and Saturday, the hurricane center said.",
      "Erin is a \"large and growing\" storm, with hurricane-force winds extending outward up to 105 miles from the center and tropical storm-force winds extending up to 320 miles from the center, forecasters said.",
      "Tropical storm warnings were in effect from Beaufort Inlet, North Carolina, to Chincoteague, Virginia, including Pamlico and Albemarle sounds. Bermuda upgraded its tropical storm watch to a tropical storm warning on Thursday afternoon. A tropical storm warning means tropical storm conditions are expected somewhere within the warning area, while a watch means they are possible.",
      "A storm surge warning was also issued for the Outer Banks, meaning there was a danger of life-threatening inundation from coastal flooding.",
      "Hurricane Erin's \"spaghetti models\"",
      "A \"spaghetti map\" of the forecast models shows the storm skirting the Caribbean islands and remaining well offshore of the U.S. East Coast as it moves north and curves back over the Atlantic.",
      "A high-pressure system in the Atlantic was expected to steer Erin away from the U.S. coast while a cold front was also forecast to push the hurricane offshore, CBS News Bay Area meteorologist Jessica Burch reported.",
      "When is Hurricane Erin expected to impact the U.S.?",
      "Erin isn't forecast to hit the U.S. directly, though tropical storm conditions were hitting parts of the Outer Banks on Thursday.",
      "Forecasters warned of dangerous storm surge combining with high tide could flood areas with as much as 2 feet to 4 feet of water. Evacuations were ordered for\u00a0Hatteras Island\u00a0and\u00a0Ocracoke Island\u00a0in the Outer Banks ahead of the expected flooding. Some homes in Rodanthe appeared on the verge of collapse.",
      "Rough ocean conditions were also expected to cause life-threatening surf and rip currents. Hatteras and Ocracoke islands were vulnerable to waves of 15 feet to 20 feet, forecasters said. The dangerous conditions resulted in dozens of people being rescued this week in Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina.",
      "Mike Brennan, the hurricane center's director, said the dangerous conditions were expected to last for much of the week across almost the entire East Coast. He urged people to heed any warnings from local officials. The National Hurricane Center reported that when Erin's center passed a NOAA buoy in the Atlantic Ocean, the device recorded a maximum wave height of 45 feet.",
      "\"It's just not going to be a very safe environment to be in the ocean,\" Brennan said.",
      "Rip currents a potentially deadly threat",
      "Rip currents\u00a0are narrow channels of fast-moving water that commonly occur along U.S. coastlines and can pull even strong swimmers away from shore. They're the reason for\u00a0more than 80%\u00a0of beach rescues.",
      "In addition to the warnings along the North Carolina coast, some beaches ranging from South Florida up to New England are also taking precautions.",
      "Erin is expected to bring dangerous rip currents along the Jersey Shore and south-facing New York beaches,\u00a0CBS News New York reported, with the risk continuing through the week. Officials at some New Jersey beaches and the popular summer destination of Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, prohibited swimming as a precaution, and more closures may follow.",
      "\"You're allowed on the beach, but you will not be allowed in the water because we have treacherous conditions going on right now,\" said Ed Schneider, beach patrol captain in Wildwood, New Jersey, told CBS News Philadelphia. \"We have a rip current warning, we have [a] rough surf warning, we have [a] storm warning, and conditions are bad.\"",
      "First hurricane of the Atlantic season",
      "Erin formed as a tropical storm\u00a0last week west of the island nation of Cabo Verde, a few hundred miles off Africa's western coast. It is the fifth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, which started in June and runs through November. Erin strengthened to a hurricane on Friday.",
      "So far this year, Tropical Storm Chantal is the only one to have made landfall in the U.S., bringing deadly flooding to North Carolina in early July. In June, Barry made landfall as a tropical depression on Mexico's eastern coast.",
      "Erin's increased strength comes as the Atlantic hurricane season approaches its peak in September. According to the hurricane center, most of the season's activity typically happens between mid-August and mid-October. In the eastern Pacific Ocean, hurricane season starts on May 15 with a peak in activity typically seen in late August.",
      "The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA, forecast an above-normal season for the Atlantic this year, expecting between 13 and 18 named storms.",
      "Tropical storms have maximum sustained winds of at least 39 mph. Forecasters with NOAA anticipated that between five and nine of the storms this year could become hurricanes, which have sustained winds of at least 74 mph. Hurricanes are rated on a scale based on their wind speeds, ranging from Category 1, the weakest, to Category 5, the most severe rating.",
      "NOAA forecasters predicted there could be between two and five major hurricanes in the Atlantic this season.",

      "The pact also calls for the 27-member EU to eliminate tariffs on all American industrial exports and to offer preferred terms for some seafood and farm products, while the U.S. will reduce tariffs accordingly.",
      "The new framework, which is an agreement to facilitate trade negotiations between countries rather than a finalized deal, comes after President Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen met briefly in July at Mr. Trump's Turnberry golf course in Scotland. At the time, they announced a sweeping trade deal that imposed 15% tariffs on most European goods, warding off the Mr. Trump's threat of a 30% rate if no deal was reached by Aug. 1.",
      "In the latest pact, the U.S. reaffirmed its pledge to limit import duties on most European goods, including cars, drugs and semiconductors to no more than 15%, pending additional legislative actions by the EU.",
      "The agreement also covers $750 billion in energy purchases and $600 billion in EU investments by 2028.",
      "\"This Framework Agreement represents a concrete demonstration of our commitment to fair, balanced, and mutually beneficial trade and investment,\" the White House and EU said in a joint statement. \"This Framework Agreement will put our trade and investment relationship \u2013 one of the largest in the world \u2013 on a solid footing and will reinvigorate our economies' reindustrialization.\"",
      "After the agreement is fully implemented, the average effective U.S. tariff on imports from EU countries will range from 10% to 14%, according to Eurasia Group, a consulting firm focused on political risk. Together, the U.S. and the EU account for 44% of the global economy.",

      "Ukrainian officials said the Russian attack hit energy infrastructure, private homes, an American electronics factory \u2014 where President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the 15 injuries were sustained, and a kindergarten.",
      "\"Last night, the Russian army set one of its insane anti-records. They struck civilian infrastructure, residential buildings, and our people,\" Zelenskyy said in a message posted on social media. He called the electronics plant an \"American investment\" and an \"ordinary civilian enterprise\" producing \"everyday items as coffee machines.\"",
      "\"This is also a target for the Russians. Very telling. The fire is still being extinguished at the enterprise. As of now, 15 people are known to have been affected by this strike. All of them have been provided with the necessary assistance,\" he said.",

As if there were no efforts by the world to stop this war.\"",
      "\"A response is needed,\" he added. \"So far, there has been no signal from Moscow that they are really going to engage in meaningful negotiations and end this war. Pressure is needed. Strong sanctions, strong tariffs.\"",
      "There has been a lot of talk \u2014   outside of Ukraine \u2014 about a peace deal amid Mr. Trump's ramped-up diplomacy. But inside Ukraine, people continue to live and die in a war zone more than three years after Russia launched its full-scale invasion. Many in the country, like their president, simply don't believe that Putin really wants to end the war. They think he's just playing along with the ceasefire narrative to avoid angering Mr. Trump.",
      "In the meantime, Putin's army continues to expand its massive seizure of territory in eastern Ukraine. The Russian defense ministry claimed Thursday that forces had captured yet another village in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region.",
      "Major Taras Berezovets of the Ukrainian forces told CBS News that even if Putin were to agree to a ceasefire, the Russian leader simply should not be trusted.",
      "\"Absolutely not,\" Berezovets told CBS News. \"He's a cheater, he's a criminal \u2026 and he would never accept the fact that independent Ukraine still exists.\"",
      "That is why Ukraine wants security guarantees \u2014 a promise of protection from the U.S. and its NATO allies in the event Russia should invade again after any eventual ceasefire is implemented.",
      "President Trump has been adamant that such a guarantee would not involve U.S. boots on the ground, and Vice President JD Vance said Wednesday that Europe would have to bear most of the costs.",
      "Getting all sides, including Russia, to agree to those security guarantees may be next to impossible, however. After his meeting with Putin, Mr. Trump met with Zelenskyy and European leaders in Washington to hold separate talks, and said he was working on organizing a direct summit between the Ukrainian and Russian leaders.",
      "But Moscow has downplayed the prospects of a Putin-Zelenskyy summit any time soon, and officials have said Russia should be included in any looming discussions on security guarantees for Ukraine.",
      "In a post on his own social media platform, Mr. Trump said Thursday \u2014 without mentioning the latest violence in the war \u2014 that it was \"very hard, if not impossible, to win a war without attacking an invaders country. ... There is no chance of winning! It is like that with Ukraine and Russia.\"",

The suspect, partially named as Serhii K., is accused of being part of a group \"who placed explosive devices on the Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 gas pipelines,\" the prosecutors said.",
      "He is \"believed to have been one of the coordinators of the operation,\" they added.",
      "The Nord Stream pipelines connecting Russia and Germany via the Baltic Sea were damaged in September 2022 by huge underwater explosions, believed to be an act of sabotage.",
      "In the years since the mysterious explosions, Ukraine and Russia have both vehemently denied any involvement.",
      "German media have reported the investigation pointed to a Ukrainian cell of five men and one woman who had chartered the yacht \"Andromeda\" from the port of Rostock and carried out the attack.",
      "Their aim was to destroy the pipelines to prevent battlefield enemy Russia from profiting in future from gas sales to Europe, according to Der Spiegel and other media.",
      "Serhii K. was arrested in the early hours of Thursday in the Italian province of Rimini, the German prosecutors said. He and his accomplices are accused of using a yacht that departed Rostock to carry out the attack, they said.",
      "\"The yacht had previously been rented from a German company with the help of forged identity documents obtained through intermediaries,\" they added.",
      "The news of the arrest comes about one year after German media reported that a European arrest warrant had been requested for another Ukrainian man, a diving instructor whose last known address was in Poland, in connection with the attack on the Nord Stream pipelines.",
      "The Polish prosecutor's office told AFP in August 2024 that it had received the warrant for the man \u2014 identified only as \"Volodymyr Z.\" \u2014 a couple months earlier \"in connection with proceedings against him in Germany.\"",

    "story": [
      "The United States is deploying three Aegis guided-missile destroyers to the waters off Venezuela as part of President Trump's effort to combat threats from Latin American drug cartels, a White House official confirmed to CBS News on Wednesday, confirming a report by the Reuters news agency.",
      "The USS Gravely, the USS Jason Dunham and the USS Sampson were to depart for the region over the next few days, the official said.",
      "A Defense Department official confirmed to The Associated Press that the military assets had been assigned to the region in support of counter narcotics efforts. The official, who was not authorized to comment about military planning, said the vessels would be deployed \"over the course of several months.\"",
      "The deployment of U.S. destroyers and personnel comes as Mr. Trump pushes for using the U.S. military to thwart cartels he blames for the flow of fentanyl and other illicit drugs into American communities, and for perpetuating violence in some U.S. cities.",
      "Mr. Trump has also pressed Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum to cooperate more on security than her predecessor, specifically by more aggressively pursuing Mexico's cartels. But she has drawn a clear line when it comes to Mexico's sovereignty, rejecting suggestions by Mr. Trump and others of any intervention by the U.S. military.",
      "Mr. Trump in February designated Venezuela's Tren de Aragua, MS-13 in El Salvador and six groups based in Mexico as foreign terrorist organizations. His Republican administration has also stepped up immigration enforcement against alleged gang members.",
      "The terror designation is normally reserved for groups like al-Qaeda and ISIS, which use violence for political ends \u2014 not for money-focused crime rings such as the Latin American cartels.",
      "But the Trump administration argues the international connections and operations of the groups \u2014 including drug trafficking, migrant smuggling and violent pushes to extend their territory \u2014 warrant the designation.",
      "Earlier this month, the Trump government announced it was doubling to $50 million a reward for the arrest of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, accusing him of being one of the world's largest narco-traffickers and working with cartels to flood the U.S. with fentanyl-laced cocaine.",
      "The press office of Venezuela's government did not respond to a request for comment from the AP on the deployment of the U.S. destroyers. But without mentioning the ships, Foreign Minister Yvan Gil, in a statement on Tuesday, dismissed the Trump administration's drug-trafficking accusations against Venezuela.",
      "\"Washington's accusing Venezuela of drug trafficking reveals its lack of credibility and the failure of its policies in the region,\" Gil said. \"While Washington threatens, Venezuela steadily advances in peace and sovereignty, demonstrating that true effectiveness against crime is achieved by respecting the independence of its peoples. Every aggressive statement confirms the inability of imperialism to subdue a free and sovereign people.\"",
      "The statement was followed by the government's decision to temporarily ban the purchase, sale and operation of drones in Venezuela's airspace. In 2018, drones armed with explosives detonated near Maduro in an apparent assassination attempt while he was delivering a speech to hundreds of soldiers being broadcast live on television.",
      "On Monday, Maduro said the U.S. had increased its threats against Venezuela and announced the planned deployment of more than 4.5 million militia members around the country. The militias were created by then-President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez to incorporate volunteers who could assist the armed forces in the defense of external and domestic attacks.",
      "\"The empire has gone mad and has renewed its threats to Venezuela's peace and tranquility,\" Maduro said at an event in Caracas, without mentioning any specific action.",
      "Maduro was indicted in a New York federal court in 2020, during the first Trump presidency, along with several close allies on federal charges of narco-terrorism and conspiracy to import cocaine. The U.S. offered a $15 million reward for his arrest at the time.",

    "story": [
      "Abrupt and potentially irreversible changes in Antarctica driven by climate change could lift global oceans by meters and lead to \"catastrophic consequences for generations,\" scientists warned Wednesday.",
      "More broadly, a state-of-knowledge review by a score of top experts revealed accelerating shifts across the region that are often both a cause and effect of global warming, according to a study published in Nature, a peer-reviewed international scientific journal.",
      "The study's authors suggest that limiting\u00a0CO2 emissions, and in turn preventing global warming from exceeding at least 1.5 degrees Celsius, \"will be imperative\" to reduce and prepare for the broad effects of abrupt Antarctic and Southern Ocean changes.",
      "\"Antarctica is showing worrying signs of rapid change across its ice, ocean and ecosystems,\" lead author and Australian National University professor Nerilie Abram told the Agence France-Presse. \"Some of these abrupt changes will be difficult to stop.\"",
      "Shifts in different facets of Antarctica's climate system amplify each other and have accelerated the pace of warming globally as well, Abram said.",
      "The study looked at evidence of abrupt change \u2014 or \"regime shifts\" \u2014 in sea ice, regional ocean currents, the continent's ice sheet and ice shelves, and marine life. It also examined how they interact.",
      "Floating sea ice does not significantly add to sea level when it melts, but its retreat does replace white surfaces that reflect almost all of the sun's energy back into space with deep blue water, which absorbs the same amount instead.",
      "Ninety percent of the heat generated by manmade global warming is soaked up by oceans.",
      "Retreating sea ice",
      "After increasing slightly during the first 35 years that satellite data was available, Antarctic sea ice cover plunged dramatically over the last decade.",
      "Since 2014, sea ice has retreated on average 120 kilometers, or roughly 75 miles, from the continent's shoreline. That contraction has happened about three times faster in 10 years than the decline in Arctic sea ice over nearly 50.",
      "By July 2025, daily sea ice extent in both hemispheres was at its third lowest in the 47-year satellite record, according to the\u00a0National Snow and Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado Boulder.",
      "Data from NASA, released in 2020, indicated that Antarctica and Greenland had lost thousands of gigatons of ice between 2003 and 2019, indirectly contributing to more than half an inch of overall sea level rise around the world.",
      "Last September, scientists warned that the Antarctic Ice Sheet, officially called the Thwaites Glacier, would deteriorate \"further and faster,\" with the increased melting expected to trigger rising sea levels. Research conducted by the International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration, a collective of more than 100 scientists, found that the volume of water flowing into the sea from the Thwaites glacier and others nearby had doubled from the 1990s to the 2010s.",
      "The \"overwhelming evidence of a regime shift in sea ice\" means that, on current trends, Antarctica could essentially become ice free in summer sooner than the Arctic, the recent study published Wednesday in Nature found.",
      "This will speed up warming in the region and beyond, and could push some marine species toward extinction, experts warned.",
      "Over the last two years, for example, helpless emperor penguin chicks perished at multiple breeding grounds, drowning or freezing to death when sea ice gave way earlier than usual under their tiny feet.",
      "Of five sites monitored in the Bellingshausen Sea region in 2023, all but one experienced a 100% loss of chicks, earlier research reported.",
      "Unlike sea ice, ice sheets and the ice shelves to which they are connected are on \u2014 or supported by \u2014 land.",
      "The world would need to heat up by 5 degrees Celsius compared with pre-industrial levels to melt the entire Antarctic ice sheet, which would lift global oceans an almost unimaginable 58 meters, or nearly 200 feet.",
      "Point of no return",
      "Global warming to date \u2014 on average about 1.3 degrees Celsius \u2014 is fast approaching a threshold that would cause part of the ice sheet to generate at least three meters of sea level rise, flooding coastal areas inhabited today by hundreds of millions, the study said.",
      "\"Unstoppable collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet is one of the most concerning global tipping points,\" said Abram.",
      "\"The evidence points to this being triggered at global warming well below 2\u00b0C.\"",
      "Another potential risk is the collapse of the Antarctic Overturning Circulation, a system of ocean currents that distribute heat and nutrients within the the region and globally.",
      "A \"rapid and substantial slowdown\" of the currents has already begun, and evidence from the previous interglacial period \u2014 between two ice ages \u2014 before our own, 125,000 years ago, points to an abrupt stagnation of the system under conditions similar to those seen today.",
      "\"This would lead to widespread climate and ecosystem impacts,\" ranging from an intensification of global warming to a decrease in the ocean's capacity to absorb CO2, the study reported.",
      "Ultimately, the only way to slow down the interlocking changes is to stop adding more planet-warming gases into the atmosphere.",
      "\"The greenhouse gas emission decisions that we make over the coming decade or two will lock in how much ice we will lose and how quickly it will be lost,\" Abram said.",

Many faced significant hardships during their transfer as they grappled with the challenges of displacement and their uncertain future.",

      "The Israeli military said it had called up an additional 60,000 reservists and extended the service of 20,000 \"as part of the next phase of 'Operation Gideon's Chariot'\" - the name of Israel's military operation in Gaza.",
      "Israel is preparing to launch an expanded military operation in Gaza City, possibly in the coming days, even as negotiators scramble to bring Israel and Hamas to a ceasefire after 22 months of fighting.",
      "It comes as human rights groups warn that a humanitarian crisis could worsen in Gaza, where most residents have been displaced, vast neighborhoods lie in ruins and communities are facing the threat of famine.",
      "An Israeli military official, speaking on the condition of anonymity in line with military regulations, said the Israel Defense Forces will be operating in parts of Gaza City where they have not yet operated and where they believe Hamas is still active.",
      "The official said Israeli troops are already operating in the Zeitoun and Jabaliya neighborhoods of Gaza City to prepare the groundwork for the expanded operation, which is expected to receive approval from the chief of staff in the coming days.",
      "The IDF regards Gaza City as Hamas' main military and governing stronghold and Israeli troops will again be targeting Hamas' vast underground tunnel network, the official added.",
      "Although Israel has targeted and killed much of Hamas' senior leadership, parts of the militant group are actively regrouping and carrying out attacks, including launching rockets toward Israel, the official said.",
      "It remains unclear when the operation will begin, but it could be a matter of days. The official said the operation was expected to last between four to six months.",
      "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has consistently said the objective of the war is to secure the release of the remaining hostages and ensure Hamas and other militants can never again threaten Israel.",
      "The planned offensive, first announced earlier this month, has heightened international condemnation of Israel and fueled fears that it will lead to another mass displacement of Palestinians.",
      "Netanyahu said on Aug. 9 that it would span parts of Gaza City and the central camps [or for newly displaced people. Hundreds of thousands of displaced people are sheltering in the city and it holds some of the last remnants of critical infrastructure.",
      "AP journalists saw small groups heading south from the city this week, but how many will voluntarily flee remains unclear. Some said they were waiting to see how events unfold before moving yet again, and many insist nowhere is safe from airstrikes.",
      "The Israeli call-up comes as a growing campaign of exhausted reservists is accusing the government of perpetuating the war for political reasons and failing to bring home the remaining hostages.",
      "The families of the hostages and former army and intelligence chiefs have also expressed opposition to the expanded operation in Gaza City. Most of the families of the hostages want an immediate ceasefire and worry an expanded assault could imperil the return home of the 50 hostages still in Gaza. Israel believes 20 are still alive.",
      "The former chiefs are skeptical the goal of completely destroying Hamas is attainable. The former head of Shin Bet, Israel's internal security agency, Yoram Cohen called it a \"fantasy,\" saying that \"if anyone imagines that we can reach every terrorist and every pit and every weapon, and in parallel bring our hostages home - I think it is impossible.\"",
      "The war began when Hamas carried out a terror attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting 251. Most of the hostages have been released in ceasefires or other deals. Hamas says it will only free the rest in exchange for a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli withdrawal.",
      "Mediators and Hamas both said this week that Hamas leaders had agreed to cease-fire terms, though similar announcements have been made in the past that did not lead to ceasefires.",
      "An Israeli official who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media said Israel is in constant contact with the mediators in an effort to secure the release of the hostages.",
      "Netanyahu has repeatedly said he will oppose a deal that doesn't include the \"complete defeat of Hamas.\"",
      "More than 62,000 people have been killed during Israel's 22-month offensive, Gaza's Health Ministry said on Monday. The ministry is part of the Hamas-run government and staffed by medical professionals. The ministry does not say how many of the dead were civilians or combatants, but says women and children make up around half of them.",

      "Asked about arranging the meeting on Tuesday, Mr. Trump said on Fox & Friends that he would let Putin and Zelenskyy meet first before getting involved himself, saying \"they haven't been exactly best friends.\"",
      "\"I hope President Putin is going to be good, and if he's not, that's going to be a rough situation,\" Mr. Trump said. He noted that he's hopeful Zelenskyy will \"do what he has to do,\" saying he has to \"show some flexibility also.\"",
      "Budapest, Hungary, is among the locations being considered for possible meeting between Zelenskyy and Putin, a source with knowledge of the planning told CBS News. Hungary has \"expressed its openness and willingness to host the talks,\" as have a handful of other countries, the source said. Politico first reported that Budapest was under consideration to host the talks.",
      "The White House hopes to settle on a date and location for the meeting by the end of this week. German Chancellor Merz said Monday that the goal is for the meeting to take place within the next two weeks.",
      "Mr. Trump told talk radio host Mark Levin on Tuesday that he's aiming for direct Putin-Zelenskyy talks because he believes it would be better for the two leaders to start by meeting one-on-one, \"just to see\" what happens. After that, the U.S. president said he will meet with the Ukrainian and Russian leaders to \"get it closed\" if necessary, which he noted it \"probably will be.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's efforts come one day after an extraordinary series of meetings at the White House between the U.S. president, Zelenskyy and European leaders. In a display of unity, Zelenskyy and the European leaders stressed the importance of security guarantees in a peace deal, which Mr. Trump said could come with U.S. coordination. He said Tuesday that no U.S. troops would be on the ground as part of a security guarantee, but has left the door open to U.S. air support.",
      "Attention has now turned to a possible summit between Putin and Zelenskyy. After Monday's meetings, Mr. Trump said he placed a call to Putin to set up the meeting, and he \"picked it up very happily,\" despite the late hour in Russia. Mr. Trump called it a \"very good call.\"",
      "\"I told him that we're going to set up a meeting with President Zelenskyy, and you and he will meet, and then after that meeting, if everything works out OK, I'll meet and we'll wrap it up,\" Mr. Trump said. He added that it takes \"two to tango,\" and that \"they have to have somewhat of a relationship, otherwise, we're just wasting a lot of time.\"",
      "It is still unclear whether the bilateral meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy would be immediately followed by trilateral talks in the same location, or if Mr. Trump would make arrangements to participate in trilateral talks in a different city on another date after Putin and Zelenskyy have met.",

      "A Russian spokesperson would only say that high-level talks would take place, but would not confirm that Putin would be involved.",
      "Mr. Trump, who met with Putin in Alaska last week, expressed urgency around the timing of the next meeting, suggesting that waiting too long would result in thousands of deaths. In what appeared to be a hot mic moment Monday, Mr. Trump told French President Emmanuel Macron that Putin \"wants to make a deal for me.\"",
      "The president outlined on Fox that he has been surprised that Zelenskyy and Putin are \"getting along a little bit better than I thought,\" adding that \"they're the ones that have to call the shots.\"",
      "\"We're going to find out about President Putin in the next couple of weeks, that I can tell you, and we're going to see where it all goes,\" Mr. Trump said. \"It's possible that he doesn't want to make a deal.\"",
      "At the White House press briefing, press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that Putin and Zelenskyy have \"expressed a willingness to sit down with each other,\" and that \"accommodations for that meeting are underway.\"",
      "Meanwhile, security guarantees for Ukraine emerged as a key issue during Monday's meetings, with Zelenskyy calling them a \"starting point towards ending the war.\"",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Monday that the U.S. will work with European and other allies to provide security guarantees for Ukraine after the war, although he did not provide specifics. And Macron said discussions on what the U.S. is willing to provide could begin as soon as Tuesday.",
      "On the security guarantees, Mr. Trump said the European leaders are \"willing to put people on the ground,\" and that \"we're willing to help them with things, especially, probably if you could talk about by air because there's nobody has the kind of stuff we have.\" But the president added that \"I don't think it's going to be a problem.\"",
      "\"There will be some form of security,\" Mr. Trump said. \"It can't be NATO, because that was a \u2014 that's just not something that would ever, ever happen.\"",

      "Mark Hancock, president of the Canadian Union of Public Employees, said in a news conference in Montreal on Monday that the union will remain on strike.",
      "\"We're telling our flight attendants we're going to support them,\" Hancock said.",
      "CIRB declared a strike by 10,000 Air Canada and Air Canada Rouge flight attendants illegal Monday and ordered them back on the job after they ignored an earlier order to return to work and submit to arbitration.",
      "The strike at Canada's largest airline entered its third day on Monday and is affecting about 130,000 travelers per day during the peak summer travel season, and the two sides remain far apart on pay and other issues. Air Canada suspended plans to restart operations Sunday after the union defied an earlier return-to-work order.",
      "\"The members of the union's bargaining unit are directed to resume the performance of their duties immediately and to refrain from engaging in unlawful strike activities,\" the Canada Industrial Relations Board board, or CIRB, said in a written decision.",
      "The board, an independent administrative tribunal that interprets and applies Canada's labor laws, said the union needs to provide written notice to all of its members by noon Monday that they must resume their duties.",
      "It was not immediately clear what recourse the board or the Canadian government has in the face of the union's continued refusal.",
      "\"We are in a situation where literally hundreds of thousands of Canadians and visitors to our country are being disrupted by this action,\" Prime Minister Mark Carney said. \"I urge both parties to resolve this as quickly as possible.\"",
      "Asked on Monday what kind of repercussions the union was willing to face for its defiance of the labor board's return to works orders, Hancock said, \"There's no limit. We're going to stay strong.\"",
      "\"If it means folks like me going to jail, then so be it,\" he added.",
      "Despite refusing to comply with the back-to-work order, Hancock also said the union is committed to reaching a deal.",
      "Air Canada had canceled 600 flights as of 4:03 p.m. Eastern Time on Monday, according to FlightAware.com. Air Canada Rouge had 131 flight cancellations, the flight tracking and data provider showed.",
      "Second return-to-work order",
      "Air Canada's plans to restart operations were first suspended on Sunday after the union said it would defy a return to work order. The strike was already affecting about 130,000 travelers per day during the peak summer travel season.",
      "CIRB had first ordered airline staff back to work by 2 p.m. Sunday after the government intervened and Air Canada said it planned to resume flights Sunday evening.",
      "Canada's largest airline initially said early on Monday that it would resume flights that evening, adding in a statement that the union \"illegally directed its flight attendant members to defy a direction from the Canadian Industrial Relations Board.\"",
      "After the Canadian union's second refusal to end its work stoppage, the airline updated its website Monday afternoon to say that Air Canada and Air Canada Rouge operations remain suspended.",
      "\"Rolling cancellations now extend until 16:00 EDT of August 19, 2025,\" a statement on Air Canada's site read.",
      "\"Over half a million customers have been impacted by this illegal strike, and we want to see an end to it,\" Air Canada CEO Michael Rousseau told BNN Bloomberg on Monday.",
      "The labor board first ordered airline staff back to work by 2 p.m. Sunday and for the union to enter arbitration, after the government intervened. Air Canada then said it planned to resume flights Sunday evening. But when the workers refused, the airline said it would resume flights Monday evening instead. However, there was no sign that the Canadian Union of Public Employees, or CUPE, would relent.",
      "Air Canada operates around 700 flights per day.",
      "What Air Canada is offering",
      "Union leader Hancock on Sunday had ripped up a copy of the initial back-to-work order outside Toronto's Pearson International Airport, and said members wouldn't go back to work this week, to the cheers of picketing flight attendants.",
      "Flight attendants walked off the job around 1 a.m. Eastern Time on Saturday after turning down the airline's request to enter into government-directed arbitration, which allows a third-party mediator to decide the terms of a new contract.",
      "Air Canada and CUPE have been in contract talks for about eight months, but remain far apart on the issue of pay and the unpaid work that flight attendants do when planes aren't in the air.",
      "The airline's latest offer included a 38% increase in total compensation, including benefits and pensions, over four years. That deal \"would have made our flight attendants the best compensated in Canada,\" according to the carrier.",
      "But the union pushed back, saying the proposed 8% raise in the first year didn't go far enough because of inflation.",
      "\"Air Canada's intended restart of Air Canada and Air Canada Rouge, which have been grounded since Aug. 16 by CUPE's labour disruption, was prevented on Aug. 17 by the CUPE leadership's unlawful strike activities,\" Air Canada said in a statement on Monday. \"Air Canada regrets this impact on its customers and is fully committed to returning to service as soon as possible.\"",
      "The airline now estimates 500,000 customers' flights have been canceled as a result. Passengers whose flights are impacted will be eligible to request a full refund on the airline's website or mobile app, according to Air Canada.",
      "Last year, the government forced the country's two major railroads into arbitration with their labor union during a work stoppage. The union for the rail workers is suing, arguing the government is removing a union's leverage in negotiations.",

      "Mangual went on to explain that the reason NYPD officers are leaving the force has a \"hell of a lot more to do with the fact that\" there are currently only 33,000 officers compared to the 40,000 the force used to be staffed with.",
      "\"There\u2019s no question that a larger force would be able to handle the NYPD\u2019s current set of responsibilities were it adequately staffed,\" Mangual\u2019s thread added.",
      "Mangual acknowledged that forced overtime is \"certainly an issue\" but that the solution to that problem is to hire more police officers rather than to \"shrink the scope\" of what they do, as the Mamdani campaign has suggested.",
      "\"So why not commit to getting 7,000 more of them into the department?\" Mangual asked. \"Answer: Because Mamdani doesn\u2019t want more cops.\"",
      "Mamdani\u00a0tempered his past support of defunding the police department in July after an NYPD officer was shot and killed in the\u00a0worst mass shooting in the city in a quarter-century, but has expressed his desire to keep staffing at its current level.",

      "Social workers and other non-police professionals like \"transit ambassadors\" should handle certain 911 calls to ease NYPD workloads and improve officer retention, Mamdani has argued on the campaign trail.",
      "\"I've said time and time again that every decision I make with regards to the NYPD will work backwards from an outcome of public safety and that public safety, we know, it is one that also comes from listening to officers themselves,\" Mamdani said earlier this month.",
      "Mamdani has cited \"forced overtime\" as a leading cause for many New York City police officers' decision to leave their jobs, noting that NYPD officers receive around 200,000 emergency calls pertaining to a mental health crisis every year.",
      "\"The fact that every year we ask them to take on additional responsibilities \u2013 we are making it more and more difficult for them to respond to the very responsibilities that drew them to the job in the first place,\" Mamdani argued. \"New Yorkers rightfully have concerns around public safety, and I want to empower police officers to respond to serious crime and hire the mental health professionals to respond to mental health calls.\"",
      "In his thread on X, Mangual also took issue with what he says is Mamdani's assertion that gun violence is part of the failure of the \"social safety net.\"",
      "\"So, there\u2019s a massive problem with Mamdani\u2019s premise, which is this: GUN VIOLENCE IS NOT A BYPRODUCT OF THE SAFETY NET\u2019S FAILURE,\" Mangual said. \"Neither is \u2018hate violence,\u2019 or any other kind of violence, for that matter.\"",
      "\"The idea that people hurt others because they lack material resources is one that goes against the weight of a ton of social science evidence to the contrary.

      "Education Secretary Linda McMahon discusses boys suspended over an incident involving a transgender student in a locker room on 'The Faulkner Focus.'",
      "FIRST ON FOX \u2013 The Trump administration is rolling out what will be the fourth legal pathway for bolstering school choice nationwide as the U.S. Department of Education aims to hand back powers to the states \u2013 before ultimately dismantling itself.",
      "The department on Thursday issued what is referred to as a \"Dear Colleague Letter to State and Local Education Agencies,\" providing additional guidance to help state and local school districts better serve students who attend private schools but who are still eligible for federally funded academic support. The letters aim to explain \"more efficient and effective ways to best meet students\u2019 needs.\"",
      "Under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), eligible private school students are entitled to Title I-A funded equitable services, which can include one-on-one tutoring, summer school programs or counseling programs.",
      "Since its passage in 1965, private school students and teachers have been eligible to participate in federal education programs sponsored under the law. The department said lawmakers determined that ESEA programs benefit children \u2013 as opposed to schools \u2013 and if a child is eligible, he or she may receive program services. Though Title I-A funds don't go to private schools, their students and teachers may still receive services provided or facilitated through the local educational agency (LEA).",

      "Education Secretary Linda McMahon outside the White House on July 15, 2025. (Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "The department notes that private school families are federal taxpayers and their students, therefore, are eligible recipients of services similar to their public school peers using federal funding. The letters also point out that private school students generate a proportion of the Title I-A federal funding that local education agencies receive. The Department of Education said those agencies are encouraged to work with private school officials to identify ways to best support eligible students.",
      "\"It has been a banner year for school choice \u2013 from President Trump\u2019s One Big Beautiful Bill federal school choice tax credit to the Department\u2019s guidance to states on how to expand choice under existing law, the Trump Administration is using all available tools to expand school options for students and parents,\" Department of Education deputy press secretary Ellen Keast said in a statement to Fox News Digital. \u00a0\"President Trump and Secretary McMahon are working to ensure every child has access to an excellent education that best fits their unique learning needs.\"",
      "\"Federal taxpayer dollars should support the best education outcomes for students regardless of where they attend school,\" Hayley Sanon, acting assistant secretary for the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education, said in a statement. \"The Trump Administration is committed to expanding education choice and ensuring parents can choose an education option that is best for their child.\"",
      "\"Improving how equitable services are provided means students in private school can have access to services and supports that best meet their unique learning needs,\" Sanon added.",

      "In late March, the Department of Education issued guidance encouraging states to use federal Title I funds to expand school choice options for families. That letter highlighted ways states and local districts can reserve funds for direct student services such as advanced coursework, tutoring, dual enrollment and career training, giving parents more say in their children\u2019s education.",
      "Department officials said the move was part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to increase flexibility and support for families seeking personalized learning opportunities.",
      "Sanon sent another letter in May urging states to strengthen how they identify and respond to unsafe schools, highlighting provisions in federal law that require students in persistently dangerous schools \u2013 or those who are victims of violent crimes at school \u2013 to be offered safer alternatives. The department noted that very few schools are formally designated as unsafe despite widespread reports of violent incidents, and Sanon urged states to adopt stronger definitions, improve data collection, and expand school choice options, including transfers and charter schools. The guidance was billed as part of the Trump administration\u2019s broader effort to ensure parents can choose safe learning environments for their children.",
      "The Department of Education is handing powers back to state and local school districts. (iStock)",
      "In June, the Department of Education also encouraged states and districts to expand school choice options for families in schools identified as low-performing under federal law. The guidance outlines how local education agencies can use federal Title I funds to support improvement plans that include parent-selected options such as tutoring, dual enrollment or career training \u2013 and even allow transfers from chronically struggling schools. Again, the Trump administration billed the initiative as part of a broader effort to give parents more meaningful input in their children\u2019s education and ensure access to higher-quality learning opportunities.",

      "That, according to Oversight Project vice president Kyle Brosnan, shows DOJ was concerned about the \"vague\" construct of Biden\u2019s pardons and how they appeared to be \"illegally delegated\" to staff. They also left the DOJ wondering at times which offenses, for people with multiple convictions, were specifically being expunged.",
      "\"Later in the email, he was like, \u2018Look, I read the statement you put out in the president's name, saying you've released a bunch of non-violent drug offenders. You've got murderers on your list today. So I'm trying to figure out what the president wants here for this funky warrant.\u2019\"",

      "\"High-profile\" pardon recipients like retired Gen. Mark Milley were discussed directly with aides.",

      "\"If the pardon is invalid, it falls, and then you proceed as if there was no pardon.\"",
      "Biden previously defended his pardons, saying that he wanted to undo \"disproportionately long sentences compared to the sentences they would receive today under current law, policy, and practice.\"",
      "\"[This] clemency action provides relief for individuals who received lengthy sentences based on discredited distinctions between crack and powder cocaine, as well as outdated sentencing enhancements for drug crimes,\" Biden said in a statement.",

      "\"His accomplishments, in the face of distortions and threats from extremists, will be lauded well into the future,\" he continued. In a long 2023 X thread, Gaspard also attempted to deflect blame away from Soros amid reports that Soros and his network were pouring millions of dollars into the campaign coffers of radical DAs and far-left groups that emphasized social justice programs and gave lenient sentences to violent criminals.",

      "FIRST ON FOX: An office within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) terminated a federal grant funding California's sex education program aimed at preventing teen pregnancy and the spread of sexually transmitted diseases after the West Coast state reportedly refused to remove \"radical gender ideology\" from its curriculum, Fox News Digital exclusively learned Thursday.",
      "\"California\u2019s refusal to comply with federal law and remove egregious gender ideology from federally funded sex-ed materials is unacceptable,\" Andrew Gradison, acting assistant secretary at the Administration for Children and Families, said in comment provided to Fox News Digital Thursday. \"The Trump Administration will not allow taxpayer dollars to be used to indoctrinate children. Accountability is coming for every state that uses federal funds to teach children delusional gender ideology.\"",
      "The Administration for Children and Families, an office under HHS' umbrella that funds state, local and tribal organizations to provide support for families such as child care, announced Thursday morning that it was terminating the funding to California's Personal Responsibility Education Program (PREP) grant.",
      "The PREP program aims to educate California's youth, ages 10\u201319, on preventing teen pregnancy and the spread of sexually transmitted infections, which the state says has led to students in the program \"delaying sexual activity, increasing condom or contraceptive use for sexually active youth, or reducing number of sexual partners.\"",

      "\"Program services are engaging, nonjudgmental, medically accurate and tailored to the unique needs of youth participants and their communities,\" the PREP website states. \"Services are offered in a range of settings, including schools, juvenile justice facilities, homeless shelters and foster care group homes. CA PREP activities also include community engagement and promotion of clinical linkages to youth-friendly reproductive health services.\"",
      "PREP specifically aims to assist those who \"reside, attend school or receive reproductive health services in a high-need geographic area; are homeless and/or runaway; attend an alternative or continuation school; are in or emancipated from foster care; are in the juvenile justice or probation system; identify as LGBTQ; are receiving treatment for mental health or substance abuse issues; have special needs; live in migrant farmworker families or are expectant/parenting female youth up to age 21.\"",
      "GOP LAWMAKERS RIP NEWSOM, CALIFORNIA OFFICIALS FOR ALLOWING TRANS ATHLETES TO COMPETE IN GIRLS' SPORTS",
      "The PREP grant has been under scrutiny by the Trump administration since at least March, when the Administration for Children and Families requested program leaders send copies of its curriculum and other relevant course materials to them for review. The probe was initially launched to ensure the state's sexual education programming is medically accurate and age-appropriate.",
      "Previous grant funding shows California's PREP program received just under $6 million from the federal government in fiscal year 2022. All in, California could lose\u00a0$12.3 million in funding that it has not yet received, covering multiple years, according to HHS.",
      "The Administration for Children and Families reviewed the program's curriculum and other teaching materials, and found a lengthy list of subjects and language deemed to fall outside the program's \"authorizing statute,\" in particular references to \"gender ideology.\" In June, Fox News Digital reported Administration for Children and Families gave the sex education program a 60-day deadline to remove all references to gender identity or face potential termination of its funding.",

      "The 60-day deadline just ran dry, with the Administration for Children and Families subsequently terminating the funding and sending a letter to Sydney Armendariz, the division chief of Maternal Child, and Adolescent Health Division at the California Department of Public Health (CDPH), and Matthew Green, the deputy director of the Center for Family Health at CDPH, declaring it was \"terminating all California State Personal Responsibility Education Program (PREP) awards and suspending the funding effective August 21, 2025.\"",

      "\"CDPH will not make any such modifications at this time for several reasons,\" the California Department of Public Health said in a letter to ACF earlier this week, according to HHS. \"The listed reasons were: 1) PREP materials had already been reviewed and approved by ACF; 2) the materials are medically accurate; 3) the gender ideology content is relevant to purposes identified in the authorizing statute, specifically the adult preparation subjects listed at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 713(b)(2)(C); and 4) ACF does not have authority to take an enforcement action.\"",
      "Among the materials Administration for Children and Families found amid its review of the curriculum was a lesson for middle school-aged students that sought to introduce them to the concepts of transgenderism, Fox News Digital previously reported.",
      "\"We\u2019ve been talking during class about messages people get on how they should act as boys and girls\u2014but as many of you know, there are also people who don\u2019t identify as boys or girls, but rather as transgender or gender queer,\" the lesson states to students. \"This means that even if they were called a boy or a girl at birth and may have body parts that are typically associated with being a boy or a girl, on the inside, they feel differently.\"",

      "Other flagged lessons in the materials included curriculum for high school-aged students with instructions on what it means to be \"nonbinary\" and language that informed students \"gender-identity\" is \"essentially a social status.\"",

      "\"All people have a gender identity,\" the teacher training materials stated, Fox Digital previously reported. It also instructed educators to refer to people who identify with their sex \"assigned at birth\" as \"cisgender,\" and added that those who are not \"cisgender\" may identify as \"non-binary, agender, bigender, genderfluid, (or) genderqueer.\"",

      "A new report by The Wall Street Journal is warning people to think twice before trusting the 'unsubscribe' option at the bottom of promotional emails.",
      "Over the past year, more people have reported receiving order shipment emails for purchases they never made. These messages usually come from legitimate retailers, often sportswear brands or electronics stores, and contain real tracking numbers and delivery details. The products are being shipped to different names at different addresses, but for some reason, the buyer's contact email is yours.",
      "It might seem like a harmless clerical error or someone accidentally typing the wrong email address. But when it happens repeatedly, and across multiple unrelated orders, it starts to look less like a coincidence and more like a tactic.",

      "HOW TO DETECT FAKE AMAZON EMAILS AND AVOID IMPERSONATION SCAMS",
      "Arthur is right to question what's happening. Scammers are deliberately using real email addresses to push fraudulent purchases through retailer systems with fewer checks. They rely on your email to carry out the scam, even if they have not stolen your payment details.",

      "Some scammers use valid, active email addresses to bypass retailer fraud filters. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What's likely happening with those shipment emails in your inbox",
      "It is unlikely that someone is accidentally typing your email address every single time. Rather, scammers are deliberately using valid, active email addresses like yours to bypass retailer fraud filters. Numerous sources confirm that fake order and shipping confirmation emails are a common tactic in fraud operations, with criminals exploiting the trust systems placed in legitimate email addresses.",
      "When a stolen credit card is used, pairing it with a real email that has not triggered spam alerts increases the chance the transaction will go unnoticed by anti-fraud systems. Retailers often check whether an email address is active or bounces. If the system sees a functioning address, it may be less suspicious than an obviously fake one.",
      "Once the order is placed, products are frequently sent to drop addresses or freight-forwarding services, as confirmed by official investigations into brushing scams. These services act as intermediaries, making the scam harder to trace. In that context, your email is simply a means to an end, a validated contact point that helps the operation move forward smoothly.",
      "Scammers can obtain email addresses when reputable companies experience data breaches. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How bad actors are able to get your email",
      "Your email address may have ended up in the hands of scammers through several common methods. The most likely cause is a data breach. Many well-known companies have\u00a0experienced leaks in which customer emails and other information were exposed.",
      "Once your email is part of a leaked database, it often circulates on the dark web or in underground forums, where it is freely traded and reused. Even if you were not part of a breach, scammers often use a technique called credential stuffing. This involves testing stolen login details across different websites to confirm which email addresses are active.",
      "REMOVE YOUR DATA TO PROTECT YOUR RETIREMENT FROM SCAMMERS",
      "The best thing you can do to prevent this from happening is to invest in a data removal service. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.",

If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Scan your inbox regularly for order confirmations, shipping notices or account sign-ups you don't recognize. If something looks off, report it directly to the retailer or platform; it could be part of a larger scam using your email address. Never click on suspicious links, even if the message looks legitimate, and protect your devices with strong antivirus software to catch threats before they spread.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "Avoid entering your email on shady giveaway sites or sketchy online forms. When in doubt, skip the sign-up or use a throwaway email. The fewer places your email lives, the harder it is for scammers to get hold of it.",
      "Set up a dedicated email for online purchases, newsletters and subscriptions. This helps keep your main inbox clean and makes it easier to spot strange activity. Sometimes, it's best to create various email aliases so that you don't have to worry about all your info getting taken in a data breach.\u00a0 An email alias address is a great way for you to stop receiving constant spam mail by simply deleting the email alias address.

      "If this email misuse leads to fraudulent financial activity, users should file a report with the FTC at IdentityTheft.gov or their local authorities.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "If you are receiving order confirmations for things you never bought, do not shrug it off. Your email is likely being misused as part of a larger fraud operation, not by accident but intentionally. Scammers are taking advantage of active, trustworthy email addresses to slip past retailer defenses and carry out unauthorized purchases. The repeated use of your email shows that fraud networks are already circulating it, even if your financial information remains untouched.",

      "A new brain implant now lets people control Apple devices, such as iPads, iPhones and the Vision Pro, using only their thoughts. Synchron, an endovascular brain-computer interface (BCI) company based in New York, demonstrated the first wireless BCI that works with Apple's official protocol.",
      "Ten patients have received the implant: six in the U.S. and four in Australia. With this technology, users living with severe paralysis can navigate apps, send messages and operate devices hands-free. This breakthrough greatly expands independence, as it enables patients to manage their environment, stream shows and control smart home devices, all using only their minds.",

      "A first for brain-tech and Apple",
      "Synchron is the first company to connect a brain implant directly to Apple devices using Apple's official BCI Human Interface Device (HID) protocol. This means no custom hacks or workarounds. The system simply connects over Bluetooth, just like a keyboard or a mouse, and works with iPhones, iPads, and even the Apple Vision Pro. In a powerful video shared by Synchron, ALS patient Mark Jackson demonstrates the tech in action. After losing the use of his hands, he's now able to navigate his iPad entirely with thought. That includes opening apps, composing messages, and staying connected with the people he loves-all without moving a muscle.",
      "Behind the scenes, Synchron's system uses artificial intelligence to decode brain signals and turn them into real-time digital commands. Machine learning models interpret motor intent, such as thinking about tapping your finger, and translate that into actions on the iPad. This AI-powered decoding helps the system feel smooth and responsive as users learn to control it with focus alone.",
      "Synchron's brain-computer interface is seen up close. (Synchron)",
      "The game-changing signal strength meter",
      "One surprising new feature is the built-in signal strength meter. This visual cue shows patients how strong their brain signal is in real time. A blue box appears over an icon or app and fills up based on how clearly the system reads the user's intent. It may sound simple, but this is a huge deal. It helps users like Mark fine-tune their mental focus, adjust their posture, and improve their interaction without outside help. It's like seeing your brain in action and learning to drive it better.\u00a0\"When I lost the use of my hands, I thought I had lost my independence,\" Mark says in the video.\u00a0\"Now, with my iPad, I can message my loved ones, read the news, and stay connected with the world, just by thinking.\"",

      "What sets Synchron apart",
      "BCIs like Synchron's Stentrode and Elon Musk's\u00a0Neuralink have connected to devices before, but never like this. Previous setups required custom software or physical adapters. Now, thanks to Apple's new BCI HID protocol, brain-computer interfaces can plug right into the Apple ecosystem like any other accessory. That official integration opens the door to more features, better performance, and fewer setup hurdles. Synchron's COO, Kurt Haggstrom, calls it a\u00a0\"game changer\" for both patients and the entire BCI industry.",
      "What this means for you",
      "This tech isn't just for people with paralysis, at least, not forever. Today, it's a medical tool undergoing trials. Tomorrow, it could become a consumer product you buy at your local Apple Store. With Apple embracing BCI as a legitimate input method, everything from your phone to your smart home could one day be controllable by thought.

    "story": [
      "Murdoch Children's Institute clinical science research director Dr. Vicki Anderson explains how the app will help parents and coaches rapidly assess injuries and determine how to treat them on 'Varney & Co.'",
      "Falls are the number one cause of injury among adults 65 and older. But the truth is, your risk doesn't suddenly appear the day you turn 65. It increases gradually over time, especially if you're dealing with weak muscles, balance issues, side effects from medication, or even just forgetting a pill. Experts recommend that everyone get screened for fall risk at age 65. But you don't have to wait for a doctor's visit to take action. A new wave of technology is giving older adults the power to track, prevent, and respond to fall risks, all from home. Here are 10 smart tools that can help.",

      "New technology can help track and prevent falls. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "1) Gait sensors track how your balance changes over time",
      "Your walking pattern can reveal subtle issues that increase your risk of falling. If you use an iPhone with iOS 15 or newer, the built-in walking steadiness feature in the Health app can rate your balance as OK, low, or very low over time. Android users can use wearable fitness trackers like\u00a0Fitbit, or Samsung Galaxy Watch to gather similar data. These tools track stride, stability, and pressure patterns that help identify balance changes before you feel unsteady.",
      "FORGET 10,000 STEPS \u2014 RESEARCH REVEALS THE REAL NUMBER YOU NEED FOR BETTER HEALTH",
      "What to check:\u00a0On iPhone, open the Health app and review your walking steadiness trends. Android users can check their wearable app dashboards, like Samsung Health or Fitbit, to view step symmetry, cadence, and gait-related data. Look for any changes over weeks or months and take advantage of in-app exercise suggestions to improve balance and strength.",
      "Apps that track physical activity and walking patterns can help users improve their balance and strength, or even detect a change in gait before it becomes an issue. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "2) Smart pill dispensers prevent risky mistakes",
      "Forgetting to take medication, or taking too much, can cause grogginess or dizziness that increases fall risk. A smart pill dispenser helps make sure you take the right dose at the right time.",
      "What to look for: Look for dispensers with reminders, dose tracking, and alerts for missed meds.",
      "Smart pill dispensers can assist patients in making sure they take the correct dose of the desired medication at the right time. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "3) Fitness trackers keep you motivated to move",
      "Building strength, especially in your legs and core, is one of the best ways to prevent falls. Whether you use an\u00a0Apple Watch, Fitbit or another device, fitness trackers can nudge you toward daily movement goals.",
      "What to check:\u00a0Track your cardio fitness levels, not just step counts. It's a good indicator of your overall strength and endurance.",
      "Fitness tracking devices can help users build strength and resilience. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "4) Vital-sign monitors help detect lightheaded spells",
      "Dips in blood pressure or oxygen levels can make you feel woozy, which increases your fall risk.\u00a0Smartwatches and fingertip pulse oximeters help you monitor these changes in real time.",
      "What to check:\u00a0If you're not using a wearable, jot down your daily readings with a standard cuff or oximeter to spot any unusual trends.",
      "5) Motion-activated lighting lights the way",
      "Getting up in the middle of the night without enough light is a common recipe for a fall. Motion-activated lights can illuminate your path without you needing to touch a switch.",
      "What to look for: Try plug-in nightlights that turn on when they sense motion, or during a power outage. Some even double as portable flashlights.",
      "NEW MOBILE ROBOT HELPS SENIORS WALK SAFELY AND PREVENT FALLS",
      "6) Leak sensors help prevent unexpected slips",

      "What to look for:\u00a0Choose ones that send alerts to your phone. You'll avoid a fall and possibly a pricey repair bill.",
      "7) Doorbell cameras keep you from rushing",
      "One overlooked fall trigger is rushing to answer the door. A\u00a0doorbell camera lets you see who's there and speak to them, so you can take your time or decide not to answer at all.",
      "What to look for: A model with two-way audio gives you the freedom to communicate from wherever you are in your home.",
      "While we're on the topic of security cameras, be sure to check out\u00a010 things you must consider when choosing any security camera.",
      "Doorbell cameras enable users to communicate with visitors without rushing to answer the door. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "8) Fall-detection devices can call for help",
      "Even the most independent older adults face higher fall risks, and family members who live far away may worry more than they let on. If a fall happens and you're alone, getting help quickly is essential. Wearables like the\u00a0Apple Watch can detect a hard fall and automatically alert emergency services or your emergency contacts.\u00a0Apple Watch SE, Series 4 or later, and Apple Watch Ultra include fall detection. If a hard fall is detected, the watch vibrates, sounds an alarm, and gives the option to call emergency services.",

      "Many smartwatches and medical alert devices can detect when a user falls and offer the option to call for help. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",

      "What to look for: Set up voice shortcuts and routines for common tasks. If you're unsteady, saying \"Call my daughter\" is a lot safer than walking to your phone.",

      "10) Balance-training apps keep your brain and body in sync",
      "Apps like Nymbl for iPhone or Android, or KOKU for iPhone and Android, offer fun daily balance and cognitive exercises that take just a few minutes. The goal? Keep your body strong and your reflexes sharp.",
      "What to check: Use an app that tracks progress and gives feedback. Some are backed by health researchers or physical therapists.",
      "Using apps to perform balance exercises and cognitive challenges can help keep reflexes honed. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What this means for you",
      "Falls aren't only about tripping on a rug or losing your footing. They often involve deeper issues like poor sleep, medication interactions, or delayed reflexes. By using smart tech, you can spot early warning signs, make smarter choices, and stay in control of your health, on your own terms.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Getting older doesn't mean giving up your independence. In fact, the right technology can help extend it. Whether it's a\u00a0smartwatch that alerts family during a fall or a simple nightlight that turns on automatically, every tool you use can add peace of mind.

Even worse, the guidelines gave room for chatbots to demean people by race and spread false medical claims. This was not a bug. These were approved rules until Meta faced questions.

Not even on the radar until someone blows the whistle. Meta has repeatedly shown it couldn't care less about your children's well-being. It's about maximizing time online, pulling in younger users, and monetizing every click. This latest scandal proves once again that parents cannot rely on tech companies to protect kids.",

      "To address growing concerns, OpenAI has introduced new safety measures for ChatGPT. These updates will limit how the chatbot responds to mental health-related queries. The goal is to prevent users from becoming overly dependent and to encourage them to seek proper care. OpenAI also hopes to reduce the risk of harmful or misleading responses through these changes.",

      "Stronger roads and a cleaner planet thanks to cigarette butt recycling",
      "Recycled cigarette butts make asphalt stronger, more flexible and longer-lasting. The fibers released during mixing act as micro reinforcement, improving fatigue resistance and helping roads withstand heavy traffic and temperature changes. The wax in the pellets lowers the temperature needed to mix asphalt, reducing both energy use and emissions during production. Beyond performance, this method gives cigarette waste a second life. By repurposing billions of discarded filters, cities can reduce litter and pollution while building more sustainable infrastructure.",

The issue, demonstrated by Marco Figueroa, shows how generative AI tools can be misled through indirect prompt injection. This technique embeds invisible commands inside the body of an email. When Gemini summarizes the message, it interprets and acts on those hidden prompts.",

These commands remain invisible in Gmail's standard view but are still accessible to Gemini. Once you request a summary, the AI can be tricked into presenting fake security alerts or urgent instructions that appear to come from Google.",

      "So, how can you protect yourself from phishing scams that exploit AI tools like Gemini? Here are six essential steps you can take right now to stay safe:",
      "Just because a summary appears in Gmail or Docs does not mean it is automatically safe. Treat AI-generated suggestions, alerts or links with the same caution you would any unsolicited message. Always verify critical information, such as security alerts or phone numbers, through official sources.",
      "If an email seems unusual, especially if it is unexpected or from someone you do not recognize, avoid using the AI summary feature. Instead, read the full email as it was originally written. This lowers the chance of falling for misleading summaries.",
      "Watch for emails or messages that create a sense of urgency, ask you to verify account details or provide unexpected links or contact information, even if they appear trustworthy or come from familiar sources. Attackers can use AI to craft realistic-looking alerts or requests for sensitive information, sometimes concealed within automatically generated summaries. So, always pause and scrutinize suspicious prompts before responding.",

      "At Woohoo, your waiter might be human, but the creative mind behind your dish is not. That job belongs to Chef Aiman, a large language model trained on food science, global culinary traditions and molecular gastronomy. The name Aiman blends \"AI\" and \"man,\" reflecting the partnership between technology and human creativity. Aiman doesn't taste or smell. Instead, it analyzes ingredients by texture, acidity, umami and dozens of other variables to invent dishes that push boundaries.",

They taste, adjust and perfect the AI-created ideas to ensure the flavors and presentation meet high culinary standards. This collaboration blends the precision and innovation of AI with the experience and intuition of skilled chefs. Rather than replacing human creativity, Chef Aiman enhances it by opening new possibilities and inspiring chefs to explore unique flavor combinations.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "How Woohoo uses AI to cut kitchen waste and boost sustainability",

They express sincere remorse to our family to this day and have built a meaningful life defined by purpose and service. Something that has really stayed with us, especially as we near the parole hearings, is what Judge Jesic said during resentencing: that while Erik and Lyle have a stellar record, it was the letters of support from individuals who had never spoken up for an incarcerated person before that impacted him most. It\u2019s a reminder that no paper file can fully capture a person\u2019s character. But we see it. Correctional staff see it. Now, we hope the parole commissioners will see the same. We know that Erik and Lyle will come home, that is no longer a doubt. We just hope that they are granted this second chance in time to hug their Aunt Joan and Aunt Terry.\"",

Theft and looting have not been an issue for the GHF, which continues to provide between one and two million meals per day through distribution sites secured by armed guards. GHF has provided over 130 million meals since the start of its operations on May 27.",
      "\"The presence of armed security is one of the reasons why GHF has been able to deliver aid successfully without a single truck being looted,\" noting that \"in one of the most volatile and complex operating environments in the world, that security is the only reason food consistently reaches civilians without interference from Hamas.\"",
      "Though a group of about 230 NGOs initially rejected the organization on account of what they called \"militarized distribution sites,\" Chapin Fay, Gaza Humanitarian Foundation spokesperson, said things might be changing as over 200 international organizations, \"sent a letter calling on the U.N. to collaborate with us.\"",
      "\"This is not the militarization of aid\u2026 It is the only way to make sure food actually reaches civilians. Every decision we make is guided by protecting lives.\"",

We have consistently called for civilians to always be protected and for us to be enabled to reach people in need.",
      "\"In order to reach people in Gaza facing starvation, we need a predictable lifeline of aid via all available crossings and through all available corridors.

      "Newsom has put California at the center of Democrats\u2019 campaign against a Trump-backed effort in Texas to pad the GOP\u2019s U.S. House majority, countering with a rare, mid-decade redistricting proposal of his own. All the while, he\u2019s flooded social media with a steady stream of all-caps screeds mocking the president\u2019s signature style.",
      "It\u2019s commanded a whirlwind of national attention, from Democrats and Republicans alike, that few in Newsom\u2019s party have been able to manage during Trump\u2019s second term.",
      "Over the past 48 hours alone, Newsom was singled out by former President Barack Obama for his \u201cresponsible approach\u201d to redrawing California\u2019s congressional maps; by Vice President JD Vance, who slammed him in a Fox News interview for trying to mimic Trump; and by Trump himself on Truth Social.",
      "\u201cTriggered?\u201d Newsom responded to Trump.",
      "For Newsom, who is on the short list of potential 2028 White House hopefuls, it all comes as the Democratic Party\u2019s base above all else is itching for a fighter to take on Trump and the GOP.",
      "\u201cHe would like to be the nominee in \u201928. Is he succeeding on getting that kind of attention? Yes, he is,\u201d said Willie Brown, the former San Francisco mayor and state House speaker who's a longtime friend and political mentor to Newsom.",
      "\u201cIn this political business, that\u2019s what you live on and live by and hope for.

      "Beyond the all-caps tactic, memes like that of a shirtless Newsom wearing Calvin Klein underwear with the American flag waving in the background have proliferated on social media, as have TikTok videos of the governor going after Trump. Since the start of August, the governor\u2019s press account on X has added 250,000 followers and racked up more than 225 million impressions, according to Newsom\u2019s team.",

      "The post garnered 5.2 million views.",
      "\u201cIf nothing else, we\u2019ve called out the absurdity of the normalization of Donald Trump,\u201d Newsom said Wednesday on a call held by the Democratic National Committee. \u201cYou can\u2019t make it up. I mean, when Fox is sitting there, oh so, so concerned about these tweets in all caps, they\u2019ve missed the entire point, haven\u2019t they, of what we\u2019re pushing back and what we\u2019re doing?\u201d",
      "\u201cMaybe they should pay attention [to] what the president of the United States of America is modeling every single day,\u201d Newsom continued. \u201cNothing about this is normal. And it needs to be called out.\u201d",
      "This week, X added a gray checkmark to Newsom\u2019s @GovPressOffice count to distinguish it as a government organization, a Newsom spokesman said, adding it was not at their request but happened after fake accounts popped up.",
      "Newsom\u2019s aides say since he was mayor of San Francisco, he has put a premium on his staffers taking risks, handing out awards for the biggest failures to celebrate creative gambits. That atmosphere has spawned the latest social media approach from the governor\u2019s team, which they say holds a mirror to Trump.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s working.

      "\u201cNothing about Newscum is authentic \u2014 from his rehearsed answers to his flip-flopping policy positions \u2014 he goes whatever way the wind blows\u2026 so it makes sense that he would try to mimic the President\u2019s wildly successful communication strategy. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, but Gavin\u2019s behavior is just getting weird at this point,\u201d Jackson said in a statement.",
      "\u2018Something that no other Democrat has done\u2019",
      "Since January, the battles Newsom has waged against Trump and his allies have been big and small, ranging from a $787 million defamation lawsuit against Fox News to countering the president\u2019s troop deployment in Los Angeles following immigration raids. Newsom held a nationally televised speech that panned Trump\u2019s actions as akin to a dictator. According to Newsom\u2019s office, the remarks, shared on social media, were viewed more than 40 million times.",
      "In California, Newsom\u2019s favorability ratings have notched up in the polls as he\u2019s more prominently stood up to Trump. It\u2019s unclear how long Newsom can sustain the spotlight, but for now, even some of Trump\u2019s closest allies say he has caught lightning in a bottle.",
      "Steve Bannon, the conservative architect of Trump\u2019s first presidential campaign who was instrumental in shaping his early messaging and policy, offered praise for Newsom\u2019s \u201cbrilliant\u201d political gambit.",
      "\u201cThis really shows how much Trump has changed modern politics. You have to be on offense, and you have to break through the media white noise, and it\u2019s not as much policy-driven as attitude- and style-driven,\u201d Bannon told NBC News. \u201cHe\u2019s done something that no other Democrat has done. He\u2019s energized these guys. He\u2019s trying to instill the fighting spirit in a very dispirited party that has lost 4 million people. You have to put the guidon on a hill, and you have to rally the troops around something.\u201d",
      "Newsom called on California lawmakers last week to set a special election for November to ask voters whether the state should redraw its congressional districts ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. The ballot measure, which came in response to Texas\u2019 proposed new map, is necessary in California to circumvent the independent redistricting commission that usually controls the process.",
      "Since Newsom announced the initiative last week, small-dollar donations have flooded in online.",
      "In conversations with donors and supporters, Newsom has made clear that Democrats are embarking on an all-out war with a heavy ad campaign after Labor Day. One Newsom aide expressed confidence in the outcome, saying, \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t do this if we didn\u2019t see a path.\u201d",
      "In pursuing the redistricting fight, Newsom has been in regular contact with House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., and former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., according to three people with knowledge of the conversations.",
      "Pelosi \u201chas been in touch with him from the beginning\u201d on the maps and strategy, one of the sources said, adding that she\u2019s not the \u201cring leader\u201d of the effort but rather a resource for the delegation who is helping raise funds for the project.",
      "2028 groundwork",
      "Newsom\u2019s ability to drive his message comes as a soul-searching Democratic Party has craved a counterweight to Trump.",
      "\u201cFinally we got a fighter to stand up for our democracy!!!!\u201d prominent Democratic donor Susie Buell wrote in a message to NBC News. Buell, who co-founded the Esprit and North Face clothing brands, said she is \u201cwaiting and willing\u201d to invest in the redistricting fight. \u201cFighting fire with fire is our only way.\u201d",
      "Adam Bozzi, a consultant and liberal activist who fought to pass a nationwide anti-gerrymandering bill during the Biden administration, said he still believes that law would have been \u201cbetter for voters in Texas and California\u201d and \u201cavoided this political mess.\u201d",
      "But even he backs what Newsom is doing now.",
      "\u201cYou cannot expect anything other than this race to the bottom if this is the system that we have,\u201d Bozzi said. \u201cThis is the system they created. ... Hard to criticize someone for working within the system.\u201d",
      "Aaron Bennett, a Democratic strategist and former top speechwriter for Pelosi, said Newsom\u2019s \u201cfighting attitude\u201d could help him in a 2028 contest.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the territory the primary\u2019s going to be fought on,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cThose articulating it now are going to be a step ahead. So it\u2019s the twin pieces. It\u2019s showing the grit and willingness to do what it takes to achieve it.\u201d",
      "Not all Democrats are exactly smitten, however.",
      "\u201cGrandstanding phony\u201d was how billionaire Democratic donor John Morgan described Newsom. \u201cTrying to use many Americans\u2019 fears to promote himself. What he doesn\u2019t understand [is] the more we see, the less we like.\u201d",
      "Another longtime California political ally to Newsom was clear-eyed about perceptions of him as he moved into the national stage. A lengthy political r\u00e9sum\u00e9 alone is not enough to overcome the Golden State\u2019s reputation for lurching too far to the left, the person said.",
      "\u201cThe idea of a liberal California guy running for president of the United States, with slicked back hair, a perfect wife and four children, the judgment with the French Laundry, going anywhere nationwide, I just think the odds are against him,\u201d said the Democratic ally, who was granted anonymity to speak candidly. \u201cHe has to find some way to break through and become the hero of the country.\u201d"

He said that years ago he wanted to operate a business on the property where Monkeys Garage is, but was told by previous town officials he couldn\u2019t do so because it\u2019s in a residential neighborhood.",
      "The dispute has led to conflicting comments on social media as community members have weighed in. Dietrich said the social media attention leads him to want to keep the sign in place.",
      "There were questions raised over whether Dietrich\u2019s sign was in compliance with local regulations in Grifton and its extraterritorial jurisdiction, which is where Dietrich lives.",
      "\u201cEveryone has the right to freedom of speech,\u201d Dylan Haman, town manager of Grifton, told NBC News. \u201cWhether anyone agrees with what the sign says or not that\u2019s up to the public and whether or not they think it\u2019s a neighborly thing to do is another question.\u201d",
      "While the town of less than 3,000 has to respect Dietrich\u2019s right to freedom of speech, the town does have zoning rules about permit requirements, where signs can be located, their size and height, etc., Haman said.",
      "\u201cHe can say anything from, \u2018I love Jesus\u2019 to political. We don\u2019t get into that because that\u2019s a First Amendment issue,\u201d he said.",
      "A permit application for the sign was submitted Wednesday, Haman said. A determination on whether the sign complies with the local sign ordinance might come at the end of the week, the town manager said, adding that and \u201cthere are some regulations about what\u2019s allowed in residential districts\u201d that have to be considered too.",
      "Haman said there had not been considerations yet on whether the sign could lead to people targeting Garfias and his business or some kind of violence.",
      "\u201cWe are not pro or against any political party ... We are just a town trying to provide service,\u201d Haman said, who noted that the town board is elected in unaffiliated elections. \u201cWe just encourage everybody to be more neighborly.\u201d"

      "Since its debut on the cover of Time magazine on Nov. 20, 1964, the \u201cFighting Irish\u201d logo had become synonymous with Notre Dame football as the school built one of the most successful programs in the sport\u2019s history. Featuring a hostile-looking leprechaun with both fists up, as if prepared to spar, the logo was associated with the South Bend, Indiana, school as Notre Dame claimed football national championships in 1966, 1973, 1977 and 1988, and played in national-title games in 2012 and again last season.",
      "\u201cIts long-standing history represents the tenacious spirit of the Fighting Irish and their determination,\u201d the school said in a news release.",
      "In the new logo, which the university said was designed in-house, the mascot's grimacing expression is the same, but his fists are down. Now, they're holding onto a football as he runs forward.",
      "University spokespeople did not immediately respond to comment. A Notre Dame press release noted the new logo's creation was \"inspired by photo, fundamentals and running styles from former and current student-athletes.\" It is part of a rollout that will see other Notre Dame sports debut their own sport-specific logos.",

    "story": [
      "The head of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has threatened to \u201cflood\u201d Boston with immigration agents following Mayor Michelle Wu\u2019s refusal to drop the city\u2019s sanctuary policies.",
      "Todd Lyons, the acting director of ICE, said during a Wednesday interview on \"The Howie Carr Show,\" a conservative radio program, that the agency would expand its presence in the area. His comments followed a news conference on Tuesday at which Wu said that Boston would \u201cnot back down\u201d from its policy of limiting police from cooperating with ICE on civil immigration enforcement efforts.",
      "Lyons said that sanctuary policies like Boston's are detrimental to safety.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re definitely going to, as you\u2019ve heard the saying, flood the zone, especially in sanctuary jurisdictions,\u201d Lyons said on the radio show. \u201cObviously Boston and Massachusetts decided that they wanted to stay sanctuary. \u2026 So 100%, you\u2019re going to see more ICE presence.\u201d",
      "When asked about Lyons\u2019 interview, Wu\u2019s office directed NBC News to the mayor\u2019s comments to reporters on the topic at an unrelated Thursday event.",
      "\u201cThis is a beautiful, diverse, incredible city, and I have said it now very directly: This administration needs to stop attacking cities to hide their own failures,\u201d Wu said.",
      "Boston has a robust immigrant population, with more than 28% of its residents being foreign-born as of 2021. China, the Dominican Republic, Haiti and Vietnam make up the top countries of origin. In recent years, crime has continued to drop steadily, with homicides reaching a historic low by the end of 2024. Robberies, aggravated assaults and motor vehicle thefts and fraud related offenses have also dropped across Massachusetts, according to data released by the state.",
      "Tensions between Wu and the Trump administration came to a head last week, when the Justice Department sent letters to 35 sanctuary jurisdictions demanding they end the immigration protections. The DOJ ordered the jurisdictions to submit plans by early this week to show that they are taking steps to ditch the policies, threatening to cut off federal funding and prosecute officials if the cities didn\u2019t comply.",
      "\u201cYou are hereby notified that your jurisdiction has been identified as one that engages in sanctuary policies and practices that thwart federal immigration enforcement to the detriment of the interests of the United States,\u201d the letter, signed by Attorney General Pam Bondi, said. \u201cThis ends now.\u201d",
      "Wu hit back in a heated letter to Bondi on Tuesday, calling the attorney general\u2019s demands an \u201cattack\u201d on U.S. cities and a tactic to \u201cmake Americans fearful of one another.\u201d",
      "\u201cOn behalf of the people of Boston, and in solidarity with the cities and communities targeted by this federal administration for our refusal to bow down to unconstitutional threats and unlawful coercion, we affirm our support for each other and for our democracy,\u201d Wu wrote. \u201cBoston will never back down from being a beacon of freedom, and a home for everyone.\u201d",
      "The Boston mayor further slammed the DOJ\u2019s demands during a news conference outside City Hall that same day.",
      "\u201cYou are wrong on the law and you are wrong on safety,\u201d Wu said. \u201cMost of all, you are wrong on cities.\u201d",
      "Boston\u2019s immigration protections stretch back to 2014, when the city enacted the Boston Trust Act aimed at promoting trust between immigrant communities and local law enforcement. The legislation, which was amended in 2019, allows the Boston Police Department to collaborate with ICE on issues of \u201csignificant public safety\u201d \u2014 including human trafficking, child exploitation, drug and weapons trafficking and cybercrimes \u2014 but keeps the department out of civil immigration enforcement. Most recently, at the end of 2024, the City Council adopted a resolution that reaffirmed the act.",
      "\u201cThe Trust Act\u2019s provisions have been instrumental in fostering a safe and welcoming environment for all residents, ensuring that immigrants can engage with local law enforcement without fear of deportation,\u201d the resolution said."

      "LONDON \u2014 Fifty-five years after rock \u2019n\u2019 roll\u2019s most important and influential band split up, The Beatles are to release a new collection of unheard outtakes, as well as a remastered and expanded classic documentary series as part of a reboot of a 1990s \"Anthology\" project.",
      "Paul McCartney, 83, one of the two surviving members of the band alongside Ringo Starr, 85, teased the announcement in an Instagram post on Tuesday, and the band\u2019s official website confirmed on Thursday.",
      "The \"Anthology\" series was a mid-'90s multimedia project that reunited McCartney, Starr and George Harrison and included three double CD albums, a TV documentary and two new songs, \"Free as a Bird\" and \"Real Love.\"",
      "The TV series chronicled the band's meteoric rise from the clubs of Liverpool, England, and Hamburg, Germany, to global fame \u2014 and the acrimonious split in 1970.",
      "It has been restored by teams led by \"Lord of the Rings\" director Peter Jackson and will stream on Disney+ from Nov. 21. There will be a new episode, titled \"Episode Nine,\" that shows behind-the-scenes footage from the \"Anthology\" reunion in 1994-95.",
      "The three \"Anthology\" albums are also to be remastered and re-released alongside a new fourth volume featuring unheard tracks from the '94-95 sessions.",
      "Beatles aficionados eagerly consumed the three \"Anthology\" albums' studio outtakes and alternate versions in the 1990s, which captured the exuberant humor of the band in its early days and the creative mastery they showed later on. The band's music inspired countless younger acts who were making their strides to stardom at the time, including Oasis.",
      "\"Free as a Bird\" and \"Real Love\" were the first new songs from the band in more than 30 years, and both were made possible thanks to a shaky, low-quality demo tape recorded by John Lennon in his New York apartment in 1977.",
      "After Lennon died in 1980, the tape was eventually passed to McCartney by Lennon's widow, Yoko Ono, and some creative studio trickery from co-producer Jeff Lynne allowed the other Beatles to play along with the faint, ghostly vocals and piano, recorded on a simple four-track tape recorder.",
      "The same tape formed the basis of the Grammy-winning \"Now and Then,\" the final track to feature all the Fab Four, released in 2023.",
      "The 2020s have been a rich time for celebration of The Beatles' legacy. Peter Jackson's \"Get Back\" documentary showed the making of their final album; the \"Beatles '64\" documentary, produced by Martin Scorsese, chronicled the effects of Beatlemania after their whirlwind first visit to the U.S., and McCartney continues to tour and play Beatles classics across the world. His U.S. tour kicks off in Palm Springs, California, on Sept. 27.",
      "However, one question still unanswered for Beatles obsessives is whether the elusive \"Carnival of Light\" will ever be released. Made at the start of the \"Sgt. Pepper\" sessions in 1967, the 14-minute avant-garde oddity was made for an event in London. It was driven principally by McCartney but featured all the Beatles, who later reportedly vetoed its inclusion on \"Anthology 2\" in 1996."

      "In California, Newsom\u2019s favorability ratings have notched up in the polls as he\u2019s more prominently stood up to Trump. It\u2019s unclear how long Newsom can sustain the spotlight, but for now, even some of Trump\u2019s closest allies say he has caught lightning in a bottle.",
      "Steve Bannon, the conservative architect of Trump\u2019s first presidential campaign who was instrumental in shaping his early messaging and policy, offered praise for Newsom\u2019s \u201cbrilliant\u201d political gambit.",
      "\u201cThis really shows how much Trump has changed modern politics. You have to be on offense, and you have to break through the media white noise, and it\u2019s not as much policy-driven as attitude- and style-driven,\u201d Bannon told NBC News. \u201cHe\u2019s done something that no other Democrat has done. He\u2019s energized these guys. He\u2019s trying to instill the fighting spirit in a very dispirited party that has lost 4 million people. You have to put the guidon on a hill, and you have to rally the troops around something.\u201d",
      "Newsom called on California lawmakers last week to set a special election for November to ask voters whether the state should redraw its congressional districts ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. The ballot measure, which came in response to Texas\u2019 proposed new map, is necessary in California to circumvent the independent redistricting commission that usually controls the process.",
      "Since Newsom announced the initiative last week, small-dollar donations have flooded in online.",
      "In conversations with donors and supporters, Newsom has made clear that Democrats are embarking on an all-out war with a heavy ad campaign after Labor Day. One Newsom aide expressed confidence in the outcome, saying, \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t do this if we didn\u2019t see a path.\u201d",
      "In pursuing the redistricting fight, Newsom has been in regular contact with House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., and former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., according to three people with knowledge of the conversations.",
      "Pelosi \u201chas been in touch with him from the beginning\u201d on the maps and strategy, one of the sources said, adding that she\u2019s not the \u201cring leader\u201d of the effort but rather a resource for the delegation who is helping raise funds for the project.",
      "2028 groundwork",
      "Newsom\u2019s ability to drive his message comes as a soul-searching Democratic Party has craved a counterweight to Trump.",
      "\u201cFinally we got a fighter to stand up for our democracy!!!!\u201d prominent Democratic donor Susie Buell wrote in a message to NBC News. Buell, who co-founded the Esprit and North Face clothing brands, said she is \u201cwaiting and willing\u201d to invest in the redistricting fight. \u201cFighting fire with fire is our only way.\u201d",
      "Adam Bozzi, a consultant and liberal activist who fought to pass a nationwide anti-gerrymandering bill during the Biden administration, said he still believes that law would have been \u201cbetter for voters in Texas and California\u201d and \u201cavoided this political mess.\u201d",
      "But even he backs what Newsom is doing now.",
      "\u201cYou cannot expect anything other than this race to the bottom if this is the system that we have,\u201d Bozzi said. \u201cThis is the system they created. ... Hard to criticize someone for working within the system.\u201d",
      "Aaron Bennett, a Democratic strategist and former top speechwriter for Pelosi, said Newsom\u2019s \u201cfighting attitude\u201d could help him in a 2028 contest.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the territory the primary\u2019s going to be fought on,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cThose articulating it now are going to be a step ahead. So it\u2019s the twin pieces. It\u2019s showing the grit and willingness to do what it takes to achieve it.\u201d",
      "Not all Democrats are exactly smitten, however.",
      "\u201cGrandstanding phony\u201d was how billionaire Democratic donor John Morgan described Newsom. \u201cTrying to use many Americans\u2019 fears to promote himself. What he doesn\u2019t understand [is] the more we see, the less we like.\u201d",
      "Another longtime California political ally to Newsom was clear-eyed about perceptions of him as he moved into the national stage. A lengthy political r\u00e9sum\u00e9 alone is not enough to overcome the Golden State\u2019s reputation for lurching too far to the left, the person said.",
      "\u201cThe idea of a liberal California guy running for president of the United States, with slicked back hair, a perfect wife and four children, the judgment with the French Laundry, going anywhere nationwide, I just think the odds are against him,\u201d said the Democratic ally, who was granted anonymity to speak candidly. \u201cHe has to find some way to break through and become the hero of the country.\u201d"

      "Gray was charged with first-degree murder in Vega\u2019s killing on June 20, two days after he was arrested on the probation violation.

      "Some judges of the state Appellate Division's First Department agreed that Trump and his companies had engaged in fraud, but agreed with their colleagues that the award was an \"excessive fine.\"",
      "\"[W]hile harm certainly occurred, it was not the cataclysmic harm that can justify a nearly half billion-dollar award to the State,\" two of the judges wrote.",
      "Trump praised the ruling as a \"total victory\" in a post on Truth Social.",
      "\"I greatly respect the fact that the Court had the Courage to throw out this unlawful and disgraceful Decision that was hurting Business all throughout New York State,\" he wrote.",
      "\"Every single Dollar was thrown out, even the penalties imposed on us by the Corrupt Judge, one of the most overturned in History, Arthur Engoron,\" Trump added in his lengthy post. He also called New York Attorney General Letitia James, who'd brought the case against him, a \"political hack\" and \"Incompetent.\"",
      "Eric Trump celebrated the ruling in a phone interview with NBC News.",
      "\"This is the biggest victory in the world,\" said the president\u2019s son, who\u2019s the executive vice president of the Trump Organization. \"We always knew this was going to happen. The case is totally won, and it\u2019s a big day for us.\u201d",
      "His brother, fellow executive vice president Donald Trump Jr., called the ruling a \"massive win\" in a post on X.",
      "\"It was always a witch hunt, election interference, and a total miscarriage of justice \u2026 and even a left leaning NY appeals court agrees!\" he wrote.",
      "James said in a statement that ruling \"affirmed the well-supported finding of the trial court: Donald Trump, his company, and two of his children are liable for fraud.\"",
      "\"It should not be lost to history: yet another court has ruled that the president violated the law, and that our case has merit,\" the statement said. James said she plans to appeal the decision to the state's highest court, the Court of Appeals.",
      "The 323-page ruling by the midlevel appeals court contains three separate opinions from the five judges on the panel and shows they were deeply divided. Two of the judges were in favor of upholding the fraud finding but dismissing the financial penalties, two of the judges were in favor of ordering a new trial, and one of the judges would have dismissed the case.",
      "In a highly unusual move, the two judges who had wanted a new trial, John Higgitt and Llin\u00e9t Rosado, signed off on the opinion by the judges who upheld the fraud finding in order to end the stalemate on the court and allow the parties to take their case to the Court of Appeals.",
      "\"Under the truly extraordinary circumstances here, where none of the writings enjoys the support of a majority, we are moved to take this action to permit this panel to arrive at a decision,\" Higgitt wrote, explaining why he and Rosado effectively sided with Justices Peter Moulton and Dianne Renwick even though they disagreed with much of their decision.",
      "\u201c[A] remarkable situation has necessitated a remarkable solution,\u201d Higgitt wrote.",
      "The appeal had been fully submitted for almost a year.",
      "Some members of the panel had expressed concern with the size of the judgment at a hearing on the appeal last September, with one calling it \u201ctroubling.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s attorneys had contended that he shouldn\u2019t have to pay anything in damages and that the businesses he was accused of defrauding were \u201cdelighted with these transactions\u201d and \u201cbenefited enormously\u201d from them. They faulted the judge for not relying on their client's expertise in valuing properties and alleged that some of the discrepancies the judge pointed to were outside of the statute of limitations for the case and should not be used.",
      "Engoron handed down his judgment against Trump in early 2024 after finding he and his companies had engaged in \u201crepeated and persistent fraud.\u201d",
      "The award came after a monthslong trial that included testimony from the then-former and now current president.",
      "The case centered on allegations from James\u2019 office that Trump lied to banks and insurers by both overvaluing and undervaluing his assets when it was to his benefit, exaggerating his net worth to the tune of billions of dollars.",
      "The scheme enabled Trump to obtain bank loans and insurance policies at rates that he otherwise wouldn\u2019t have been entitled to, and as a result he \u201creaped hundreds of millions of dollars in ill-gotten gains,\u201d James' office said.",
      "Trump maintained his financial statements were conservative, and he repeatedly alleged that the Democratic attorney general's case was politically motivated.",
      "Engoron summarized Trump\u2019s defense as claiming that \u201cthe documents do not say what they say; that there is no such thing as \u2018objective\u2019 value; and that, essentially, the Court should not believe its own eyes.\u201d",
      "He also chided Trump and his companies for not taking any responsibility for their actions.",
      "\u201cTheir complete lack of contrition and remorse borders on pathological,\" Engoron wrote in his decision on the case. \"They are accused only of inflating asset values to make more money. The documents prove this over and over again. This is a venial sin, not a mortal sin. Defendants did not commit murder or arson. They did not rob a bank at gunpoint. Donald Trump is not Bernard Madoff. Yet, defendants are incapable of admitting the error of their ways.\u201d",
      "The award was initially entered as a $464 million judgment, but it has continued to grow in the months since because of interest. Trump was responsible for the vast majority of the judgment, and the amount he\u2019d been ordered to pay had been increasing by over $100,000 a day.",
      "By mid-June, Trump was on the hook for $507 million while his co-defendants owed over $11 million.",
      "To secure the judgment while he appealed, Trump had been expected to have to post a bond for about $550 million \u2014 the full amount of the judgment plus interest. Trump\u2019s attorneys argued that coming up with that much cash was a \u201cpractical impossibility,\u201d and the Appellate Division reduced the size of the bond to $175 million. Trump posted the bond in March of last year.",
      "Trump is also appealing two other judgments totaling about $90 million after writer E. Jean Carroll successfully sued him for allegedly sexually abusing and defaming her. Trump has denied the allegations in both of her lawsuits.",
      "\"That Case, also on Appeal, should also never have been brought,\" Trump wrote in his social media post on the fraud ruling. He added that the judge in the Carroll case \"should be admonished for Abuse.\""

      "Constituents can typically request White House tours through their members of Congress, and several members stated on their websites that White House tours were paused.",
      "The pause, first reported by Fox News, marks the largest public impact so far from the construction project, which the White House announced last month. The suspension comes just months after tours resumed during the Trump administration in late February. Thousands of people visit the White House each year, according to the White House Historical Association.",
      "The office of Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, said on his website that it could not submit tour requests starting in September \"due to ongoing construction at the White House.\"",
      "Similarly, the office of Rep. Eugene Vindman, D-Va., said on its site that starting in September, \"the White House will be undergoing extensive renovations. As a result, all tours of the White House are postponed indefinitely.\"",
      "Other offices, including those of Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va.; Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md.; Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C.; and Rep. Sean Casten, D-Ill., say on their websites that the White House is pausing tours starting in September but do not provide a reason.",
      "\"Seriously?\" Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., said in a post to X. \"School trips. Families. All shut out indefinitely for the building of a ballroom?\"",
      "The White House announced in July that it would start construction on the ballroom in September. Press secretary Karoline Leavitt said at the time that prior administrations also wanted a large event space, and that \"President Trump has expressed his commitment to solving this problem on behalf of future administrations and the American people.\"",
      "Trump has reshaped the White House decor in his first several months back in office, adorning the Oval Office in gold decor and installing a patio in the Rose Garden. But the ballroom expansion marks the biggest change to the historic building.",
      "Trump has said that the ballroom \u2014 which Leavitt said will cost $200 million \u2014 would be funded by himself and other donors."

      "Tony Weaver Jr. thinks everyone should be a weirdo.",
      "\u201cA weirdo is a person with the ability to make the ordinary extraordinary. What a world would we have if all of us stepped out every day with the goal of really living and embodying that,\u201d he tells TODAY.com.",
      "Weaver is a multi-hyphenate author who believes that \u201cstories are the most positive tool for social change in the history of mankind.\u201d And with a platform that draws attention to conversations about diversity in the nerd community, initiatives that serve to promote literacy and his debut graphic novel \u201cWeirdo,\u201d he\u2019s doing just that.",
      "\u201cWhen people read \u2018Weirdo,' I want them to feel seen, nurtured and inspired. The idea is that you should open (it) and immediately go, \u2018Oh, I belong in this world. I belong with these characters. These characters are like me. These characters are like my friends,\u2019\u201d Weaver says. \"'They feel the same way that I felt.'\"",
      "'A Deep Responsibility'",
      "This section discusses suicide. If you or someone you know is struggling or in crisis, help is available. Call or text 988 or chat at 988lifeline.org.",
      "\u201cWeirdo\u201d is an Eisner Award-nominated, semi-autobiographical graphic novel memoir that combines nerd culture and magical realism to tell Weaver\u2019s personal story of navigating bullying and self-doubt \"but ultimately finding light on the other side.\"",
      "Weaver, who has been open about previously attempting suicide, says he felt a \u201cdeep responsibility\u201d to help kids navigate their darkest moments when he decided to write \u201cWeirdo.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat I like to say is that stories saved my life, so I like using stories to help other people,\" he says.",
      "According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's 2023 Youth Risk Behavior Survey, 20.4% of high school students seriously considered attempting suicide, while 9.5% had attempted suicide.",
      "\u201cLooking at those staggering rates and having first-hand experience of how it feels to have to navigate those negative emotions, I felt like it was my responsibility to do something,\u201d Weaver says.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s something very humbling about the idea that there\u2019s a parent who loves their child more than anything in the world, and when that child, that person that they care about more than words can describe, needs help, they reach for something that has my name on it,\u201d he adds.",
      "Weaver also believes that using a visual medium, like a graphic novel, can help readers understand feelings that they may not be able to express with words.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a moment in \u2018Weirdo\u2019 where so much is going wrong in my life that it feels like I\u2019m losing all of the color in the world around me,\" he explains. \"So visually, we demonstrate that motif by literally having the colors drain from the pages until the comic is black and white.\u201d",
      "Weaver also uses his extensive knowledge of manga and anime within the world of \u201cWeirdo.\u201d From \"Pok\u00e9mon\" to \"Ace Attorney\" and \"JoJo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure,\" there are at least 50 references in the novel \u2014 with the first three pages having 12 alone. He calls the references the novel\u2019s \u201cstrongest advantage\u201d as it helps create a fantastical mirror of readers' own world.",
      "\u201cI want kids of a variety of fandoms to look at what we\u2019re making and say, \u2018Oh, I belong here. This guy gets it. These people understand me. I can be safe here,\u2019\u201d he says.",
      "But it\u2019s not just kids who feel seen while reading Weaver\u2019s work. Though \u201cWeirdo\u201d is marketed as a middle grade novel, it has managed to strike a chord with adults as well.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve had the privilege to speak to a lot of adult readers of \u2018Weirdo\u2019 and normally the story goes something like this: \u2018I got it for my son, I got it for my nephew, I got it for my niece, and I sat down and read it before I gave it to them, because I wanted to vet it. And, man, I wish I had this book when I was younger.\u2019 I think that\u2019s the highest praise that a person can receive,\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cI think that motivates me a lot as I create. What I say is that \u2018Weirdo\u2019 is for every person on their journey to self-love. Some of us take that journey when we\u2019re kids. Others of us end up very far into adulthood before we\u2019re able to take those steps. But it\u2019s my goal that it\u2019ll be there as a support for everybody,\" he adds.",
      "In addition to being an author, Weaver is the founder and CEO of Weird Enough Productions, a media company dedicated to using anime to create positive representations of Black men and other minority groups. Through Weird Enough Productions, Weaver and his team, along with collaborators like anime distributor Crunchyroll, aim to boost reading proficiency among marginalized readers by helping them connect with characters in manga and comics.",
      "According to the 2024 National Assessment of Educational Progress, 33% of 8th graders are not reading at the NAEP Basic level, meaning \"a third of 8th graders likely could not identify basic literary elements in a text.\"",
      "Literacy experts say that graphic novels can help promote reading comprehension among younger readers, as the combination of pictures and text can keep them engaged with the material. According to a survey conducted by School Library Journal in May 2023, out of the respondents, 90% of public librarians and 83% of school librarians say they suggested graphic novels to students who struggle with reading.",
      "But there is the persisting belief that graphic novels don\u2019t count as \"real reading,\" and 59% of the school librarians surveyed said they've received opposition to graphic novels from teachers, parents and more.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s this idea that if I can read a classic piece of literature, that I\u2019m smart. Whereas, if I read 1,000 chapters of \u2018One Piece\u2019 and I understand the themes and what\u2019s being communicated, that that\u2019s low brow, and that\u2019s not as important,\u201d Weaver says.",
      "\u201cThe data is very clear about what graphic novels do to positively benefit literacy and get kids reading, and I think it\u2019s a no-brainer why graphic novels are a great way to get kids excited about literacy and about storytelling,\" he adds.",
      "This back to school season, Weaver is raising money to purchase books for underresourced schools across the country. Weaver is hosting the fundraising campaign, titled Nerds for Literacy, on the Weird Enough website. After raising funds, Weaver will purchase a list of books \u2014 selected by donors, literacy education specialists and young readers \u2014 from independent bookstores and distribute them to schools.",
      "\"WHO WOULD WIN IN A FIGHT. EVERY NERD IN THE UNITED STATES OR THE YOUTH LITERACY CRISIS?!\" states the donation page, which so far, has raised $25,000 in 48 hours.",
      "In addition to producing his own graphic novel and running Weird Enough Productions, Weaver also uses social media to discuss hard topics in the nerd community, such as racism, bullying and mental health. However, he takes a unique approach.",
      "\u201cWhen I started creating content online, one of my largest gripes was that it felt like everybody was reading off of a cue card. The information wasn\u2019t being presented in an engaging way, in a particularly intuitive way, or in an easy to understand way,\u201d he says. \u201cA lot of it was super long winded. This video took 60 seconds, you could\u2019ve explained this to me in 10.\u201d",
      "With that, he decided to challenge himself. And what did he decide to do? Well, rhyme.",
      "He calls himself, \"Dr. Seuss without the racism,\" as the children's author's legacy faced a reckoning in 2021 over the racist imagery in his books. In March of that year, Dr. Seuss Enterprises stopped publishing and licensing six of his children's books and said in a statement they \"portray people in ways that are hurtful and wrong.\"",
      "Weaver says he can\u2019t stop rhyming \u2014 no matter how hard he tries.",
      "\u201cAt the beginning, the idea was supposed to be, I have such mastery over the information that I\u2019m trying to present to you that I can do it in a whimsical and rhyme scheme type way, and you still understand exactly what\u2019s going on. That was my goal,\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cUltimately, it reached a point where I actually can\u2019t stop rhyming,\" he adds. \"I write stuff and my brain immediately is like, \u2018Cool, so we\u2019ll rhyme it like this,\u2019 and I\u2019m like, no one said this had to rhyme. What are you doing?\u201d",
      "And yes, he did try pausing this approach as an experiment. Let\u2019s just say, people were not supportive.",
      "\u201cWe stopped rhyming for a couple of videos, and the people were like, \u2018Where are the rhymes?\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cThe people have spoken. They want the bars.\u201d",
      "\u201cWeirdo's\" sequel is currently in the process of being illustrated and will be released in early 2027, he says. The sequel will follow Weaver and his friends (and some new faces!) and connect to the events that occur at the end of the first book.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s intended to grapple with some of these negative feelings that kids have around standardized tests and around the ways that institutions measure intelligence inaccurately,\" he says.",
      "While most of the experiences in \u201cWeirdo\u201d were lifted right from Weaver\u2019s life, he\u2019s having a bit more \"fun\" with its sequel.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a bit more of a divergence between what real life Tony experienced and what\u2019s going on in the world of \u2018Weirdo,\u2019 which lets us play around a lot,\" he says.",
      "Weaver is also trying to find new ways to add more \"updated\" references, but he's admittedly finding it a bit tricky.",
      "\u201cIf you reference it in the last book, are you allowed to reference it this time?\" he poses. \"If you do reference it, do you reference it differently? How do you do it?... Are we talking about Fortnite in \u2018Weirdo 2\u2019? Are there Battle Buses? Are they dropping on Tomato Town? I don\u2019t know!\u201d",
      "While we wait for the sequel, Weaver is keeping his cards close to his chest about what is happening between now and then.",
      "\u201c\u2018Weirdo 2\u2019 is going to be exciting, but you got to keep your eyes peeled. Sequels are always cool things to continue projects, but there are other ways that projects can continue to live on, you know?\u201d he says. \u201cAdaptations are a thing, and that\u2019s all I can really say.\u201d",
      "If you or someone you know is in crisis, call or text 988, or go to 988lifeline.org to reach the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline. You can also call the network, previously known as the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, at 800-273-8255 or visit SpeakingOfSuicide.com/resources."

      "Warning: Spoilers ahead for \u201cHostage.\u201d",
      "The \u201cHostage\u201d crisis has ended, and so has UK Prime Minister Abigail Dalton\u2019s (Suranne Jones) no-good, terrible, very very bad week.",
      "The Netflix limited series, which stars the \u201cGentleman Jack\u201d actor alongside Oscar nominee Julie Delpy (the \u201cBefore\u201d movie trilogy) as French President Vivienne Toussaint, has been a thrill ride of twists, turns and upending conventions.",
      "The limited series was a breathless roller coaster of a ride for PM Dalton and her family. First her husband Alex (Ashley Thomas), a worker with M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (Doctors without Borders), and his team were taken captive in French Guiana \u2014 just as President Toussaint was in London for a summit to discuss much-needed medicines being sent to the British people.",
      "Vivienne was a challenge to get on board with helping the hostages \u2014 especially after she was blackmailed over her fling with stepson Matheo (Corey Mylchreest). But once Abigail and Vivienne became a team and the hostage crisis ended, it was hard to know what the series would do with the rest of its episodes.",
      "Not to worry: There was still a bombing, political intrigue, Abigail\u2019s being removed from office, a secret investigation with loyalties tested, the demise of Vivienne in a heroic move, and yet another hostage-taking.",
      "So how did it all wrap up? Not quite in a happy, neat bow \u2014 there were casualties of more than one kind in the fifth and final episode. Let\u2019s see who lived, who died, and who will bear the scars.",
      "Do Abigail, Alex and their daughter Sylvie survive on \u2018Hostage\u2019?",
      "Good news: Yes. Bad news: not without some damage.",
      "The episode begins in the immediate aftermath of the 10 Downing Street explosion. The culprit? Saskia\u2019s (Sophie Robertson) conveniently \u201cleft behind\u201d laptop, brought helpfully to the building by Matheo. Angry ex-military man John Shagan (Martin McCann) detonates the laptop.",
      "What does Saskia have to do with this? Turns out Saskia \u2014 posing as Matheo's girlfriend \u2014 was formerly a corporal in the Highland Guards. Her battalion was shut down by Abigail Dalton in an initiative to fund health-related initiatives. John is a retired Highland Guard captain who decided to plan a coup against the prime minister and recruited the likes of Saskia to carry it out (more on that later).",
      "In the blast, Vivienne perishes while alerting the room to the peril.",
      "Alex races in to help his wife, pulling her from the rubble. The Daltons (along with teen daughter Sylvie, played by Isobel Akuwudike) embrace and phew, that might seem to be the end of it. Dalton has been voted out of office by her ministers in a no-confidence vote, and now perhaps she\u2019ll be able to rest easy and leave politics behind.",
      "Er, no. There\u2019s still much of the episode to go! So with John and Saskia on the loose, Dalton sends her family to a safe house Matheo recommends, and all three (plus security) head out to the countryside and a beautiful mansion to rest and recover.",
      "Who dies at the safe house?",
      "Almost immediately, Saskia and John figure out where they believe the Daltons have holed up. Saskia pins down Matheo and Sylvie with a gun, while John scuffles with Alex, slashing his stomach with a knife. John forces the disabled Alex to call Abigail and get her to the house \u2014 without backup.",
      "Abigail arrives downstairs as Matheo, upstairs, dials the equivalent of a 999 call in secret. When Saskia finds out what he\u2019s doing, they struggle and she loses her weapon. He lets her escape (well, they were once lovers) while Sylvie picks up Saskia\u2019s discarded gun.",
      "The teenager goes to find her parents, hearing them in a heated moment with John. Trembling, she turns the gun on John. But her parents urge her not to fire \u2014 they seem to be well aware that if she kills John, she\u2019ll have to live with it for the rest of her life. John, clearly knowing this is his endgame, lets Sylvie know he\u2019s responsible for her beloved grandfather\u2019s murder and \u2014 blam. John goes down. Sylvie, it seems, is a very good shot.",
      "Who\u2019s behind John\u2019s plot, and why was he so focused on Abigail?",
      "We\u2019ve been getting bits of information about John throughout the series. Early on, he tells Alex that he once had a daughter himself.",
      "As we learn, an invasion years ago by Guatemala into Belize (a former Crown colony, now independent) led to Abigail (then a governmental minister) to make a heartbreaking choice between getting British citizens and troops out of the country, or saving locals.",
      "(The invasion is fictional, but the story echoes recent American policy during the Afghanistan evacuation.)",
      "But John had been in love with one of those locals left behind \u2014 and she was pregnant when the invaders shot her.",
      "He wasn\u2019t alone in being furious with Abigail, though.",
      "In yet another betrayal, John is linked to General Livingston (Mark Lewis Jones), who\u2019s got his own bone to pick with the PM over her military spending cuts. He never wanted her dead, just \u201cout of the way,\u201d but John had his own plans.",
      "Abigail and her team figure out that Livingston and John served together, and after some ranting and raving in the war room he\u2019s set up, the general is arrested and marched out.",
      "Does Abigail retire from politics in the end?",
      "In the final scenes, the Daltons are gathered at 10 Downing Street as Abigail prepares for a press briefing outside. Sylvie looks chastened, cuddling a cat. They all agree with Abigail\u2019s plan, whatever it is \u2014 and she pauses on her way out to gaze at a portrait of the late Vivienne.",
      "Outside, we learn that Abigail is now back in power. Her speech underscores that she plans to be truthful and honest with the press and the public going forward.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the least you deserve,\u201d she says."

    "story": [
      "A viral internet song \"I Have One Daughter\" originated from a Tinder conversation.",
      "The audio, which has over 120,000 uses on TikTok, follows a dialogue between two dating app users.",
      "\u201cYou have any kids?\u201d one Tinder user asks the other in the song.",
      "\u201cYes, I have one daughter. How about you?\u201d the other responds.",
      "\u201cHow many baby daddies do you have? If you don\u2019t mind me asking,\u201d the first speaker returns, seemingly not realizing that one child can only have one biological father.",
      "The miscommunication evolves throughout the pop song. Inspired by the track, creators are putting their own spin on the tune to depict strange dialogues.",
      "For example, a paleontology volunteer posted a parody video of conversations she has with people who don\u2019t think fossils are proof dinosaurs exist. Another creator shared a video reenacting questions she is commonly asked as a female engineer. Internet personality Trisha Paytas even stepped in with her version of the trend to explain why she doesn\u2019t plan to have more kids.",
      "Other creators have posted skits based on questions they are frequently asked to spread awareness on gaps in public information or missed social queues.",

      "Holloway tells TODAY.com that he has over a decade of experience producing music and wanted to create a presence for himself on social media. The inspiration for his Tinder videos came from Gabriel Kahane, a composer who used to turn Craigslist posts into songs.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d been trying on and off for years to put some funny stuff out on the internet,\u201d Holloway says. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to actually stick to it, but last year, I thought \u2018Okay, I\u2019m actually going to do it.\u2019\u201d",
      "The videos, such as his songs \"Say Potato!\" and \"Do You Do Cocaine?\" started to take off online. Many of his songs have gained millions of views, but his most popular track so far is \u201cI Have One Daughter.\" The original video, which is number 25 in his series of Tinder parodies, has over 31 million views on Instagram and over 17 million views on TikTok.",
      "Holloway says he based the tune off a Tinder conversation sent to him by one of his followers. While some of his past videos have views in the millions, he did not expect that \"I Have One Daughter\" would go so viral.",
      "\u201cIt was just one of them on my list,\u201d Holloway says. \u201cI just really didn\u2019t think it would blow up the way it did.\u201d",
      "The musician adds that watching other users relate the song to their own personal experiences has been rewarding.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been fun to see people take it and use it for their own personal issues, their own things, where they feel like they say something to somebody, but the other person is not understanding them,\" Holloway says. \u201cThat seems to be sort of the universal usage of it.\u201d",
      "When it comes to his production process, Holloway says he aims to create a new Tinder song once a week.",
      "He says the creation of \u201cI Have One Daughter\u201d started with a beat that felt \"right for the conversation.\" From there, he found a chord progression he liked and came up with the song's first line, then began \"riffing\" and eventually landed on the song's melody. In the video, Holloway sings the lyrics and dresses up in costume.",
      "For the song, which he says only took around two hours to write, Holloway took some inspiration from Adele\u2019s \u201cSend My Love (To Your New Lover).\u201d",
      "Holloway adds his songs are influenced by his theatrical background and that the \"bones\" of his internet songs are musical theater.",
      "One day, Holloway says he would like to turn all his Tinder conversations into a live musical.",
      "\u201cTheater is dialogue,\u201d Holloway says. \u201cThe songs are supposed to be, generally speaking, literal dialogue set to music. So that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m doing in my songs.\u201d"

      "\u201cMy sister\u2019s one of the fans, and she won\u2019t stop talking about it,\u201d Bassett tells TODAY.com.",
      "Bassett has starred as Los Angeles Police Department Sgt. Athena Grant since Season 1 of the first responder procedural. The show opens with Athena\u2019s first marriage headed for divorce, but by the end of Season 1, she finds love with Fire Department Chief Bobby Nash, played by Peter Krause. The two marry in the Season 2 finale.",
      "That relationship, known to fans as \u201cBathena,\u201d became one of the emotional centers of the high-stakes show, and together, they survived a tsunami, a sinking cruise ship and a plane crash. But in Season 8, Episode 15, Bobby died after he was exposed to a deadly virus in a lab accident. The plot twist marked the first major character death throughout the show\u2019s eight season run and sparked an outpouring of emotions from fans, from grief to anger.",
      "\u201cShe is mad,\u201d Bassett says now of her sister, about four months after the episode aired. (Season 8 ended May 15. Season 9, which was officially renewed in April, is currently in production.)",
      "She says her sister, like many fans, still asks her: \u201cIt don\u2019t make sense \u2026 Is he coming back?\u201d",

      "In the aftermath of Bobby\u2019s death, some fans theorized it wasn\u2019t the end of the road for Krause\u2019s character. Season 8, Episode 15, ended with a body bag being removed from the lab with Bobby\u2019s helmet abandoned on the ground. In the next episode, Krause returns for flashback scenes and as a figment of Athena\u2019s imagination as she struggles to cope with the loss and make funeral arrangements for her husband.",
      "In the end, she decides to bury her husband back in Minnesota, beside his first wife and two children, who died in a fire before the events of Season 1.",
      "But many fans cling to the fact that technically, audiences didn\u2019t see Bobby\u2019s body \u2014 though \u201c9-1-1\u201d showrunner Tim Minear has said in multiple interviews that Bobby is really dead.",
      "Plans for Season 9 remain a mystery, but we know actors Corinne Massiah and Elijah M. Cooper, who play Athena\u2019s two children, May and Harry, will serve as series regulars for Season 9, putting a spotlight on Athena\u2019s family life in the wake of her husband\u2019s death.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s interesting how sometimes, a lot of times it seems, storylines in the show will mirror in a way what\u2019s going on in real life,\u201d says Bassett, who shares twins Bronwyn Golden and Slater Josiah with husband Courtney B. Vance. \u201cYoung boys, just thinking they know it all and they\u2019re grown and making their own decisions, which is not quite what mom had in mind.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey still need mom, but they don\u2019t think they do,\u201d she adds.",
      "So while Harry has \"growing pains, becoming a man,\" she describes Massiah\u2019s character, May, as being stuck in the middle.",
      "\u201cEither she\u2019s on my side or his side. She is his sister, so, help me out girl,\u201d Bassett jokes.",
      "Bassett also confirms, \u201cOf course they\u2019ve got to put me in some sort of life-threatening dangerous situation.\u201d After all, fans may recall Season 8 opened with a \u201cbee-nado,\u201d or bee tornado, that caused a midair crash and left Athena to land a plane on the L.A. highway.",
      "Reflecting on that dramatic Season 8 plot point, the Oscar nominee lightheartedly jokes, \u201cYou don\u2019t know how I shake and grab onto seat mates in a plane when I feel a little bit of turbulence... OK, so now I\u2019m landing a plane?\u201d",
      "As for how she finds out about the shocking circumstances ahead for her character, Bassett says she usually gets wind of what\u2019s coming not from scripts, but from the crew behind-the-scenes.",
      "\u201cMaybe I have to go in for a fitting, so maybe I\u2019ll hear, \u2018Oh, you\u2019re going to be doing something crazy,\u2019 because a lot times the heads of the department will get, if not the script, the idea of what it\u2019s going to be about before we do so they can get a little head start. And then sometimes they can\u2019t help but share,\u201d Bassett says.",
      "\u201cAnd then the script comes,\u201d she continues, \u201cand I\u2019ve always made it out to be crazier in my head, just hearing about it, then when I read it, it\u2019s like, \u2018OK, this is doable. I guess.\u2019\u201d"

      "Joe Manganiello's interests are far and wide \u2014 and a glimpse at his   resume is testimony to that.",
      "The 48-year-old's star began rising in 2009 after he landed his breakout role as werewolf Alcide Herveaux in the supernatural series \"True Blood.\" He then entered the \"Magic Mike\" universe as Big Dick Richie when the first film was released in 2012, and he most recently starred alongside Vince Vaughn in the 2025 Netflix comedy \"Nonnas.\"",

      "So, you\u2019re here filming the Epic Universe TV special. Tell me about your involvement in it.",
      "Well, I'm assuming because I'm an NBCUniversal employee that I got asked to host and launch the special for the park, which is super cool, so I get to see it first. And then, you know, hanging out with some of the actors, some of the projects, Warwick Davis from \"Harry Potter,\" the two stars of \"How to Train Your Dragon\" came by.",
      "Toothless?",
      "The actors. Well, no, then we get to go see Toothless, which is nuts. That animatronic dragon, it's crazy. And you scratch his chin and he starts, like, kind of purring and growling.",
      "We're not used to being able to engage in technology like that on our own.",
      "It was like those robots in, like, the Hall of Presidents (at Disney World). And now it's like, yeah, it's pretty amazing. And even in the Dark Universe ride (Monsters Unchained), all those animatronic creatures were incredible. Frankenstein, it's nuts.",
      "So yeah, it's been super fun to get to do all of that. You revert (back to) childhood when you do it, you do start thinking what you would think as a kid. And yeah, kind of having your mind blown and seeing all this stuff for real, and being able to walk around inside of it. It's pretty incredible.",
      "What childhood memories have been coming back to you?",
      "I was on \"True Blood\" for so many years as a werewolf. And I do think the kid that I was manifested that for me as an adult, because Halloween was always the big holiday for me, and my mom would make me costumes and things. So, you know, I dressed up like Dracula as a kid and in your mind, when you're a little kid, you're pretending that you're a vampire. And I remember my parents taking me to a haunted house when I was little, and I guess there was a Dracula that popped out of a coffin, and I was dressed as Dracula, so I walked up to the coffin and put my hands up, and he picked me up and put me in the coffin and closed it with me in it.",
      "What?! Were you freaked out?",
      "No, I'm a vampire, this is a vampire! So you're like, \"This is what I'm supposed to do,\" yeah, like, I was in character as a little kid, I knew, like, \"Why am I afraid? I'm going to go live with the vampires.\"",
      "That's very brave for a kid.",
      "You're being very diplomatic. But that's the thing: I think as a kid, you know ... I think it was a Val Kilmer quote where he said, \"Kids dream of being Batman, not the guy in the Batman suit, not the actor in the Batman suit.\" And so there's a bit of, you know, I never dreamed of being an actor playing a werewolf. I dreamed of being a werewolf. So here, you get to walk around and pretend that maybe you are in that medieval village, this Gothic, Romanian village.",
      "You brought your dog, Bubbles, through Dark Universe last night. Do you dress your dog up for Halloween?",
      "This past year, I dressed her up for Cinco de Mayo. OK, she's a Chihuahua, so we celebrate Cinco de Mayo. ... The year before, we were actually in Firenze, Italy, for Halloween, and we had a little dragon costume that we put on her with little flappy wings. ... People send me all kinds of things. I think there's, like, an avocado costume in the closet. She was a bat one year \u2014 cool, flappy wings.",
      "Another thing that I know that is important to you is your ancestry. You were on \u201cFinding Your Roots\u201d in 2023.",
      "I actually got the results the year before that. It took them a year because I made some discoveries during that year that then pushed the episode to the following season.",
      "I want to be clear also that, because of my mother\u2019s side of the family, I\u2019ve been interested in genealogy from a young age because of the Armenian German component that I knew about. I grew up knowing I was Armenian, I knew that I was German, but didn\u2019t know how or from who, and that\u2019s what led me to apply (to \u201cFinding Your Roots\u201d) and it took 10 years. And finally, they got to the point where they thought, \u201cYeah, it was going to work.\u201d The technology just wasn\u2019t there, and they thought they were going to run into roadblocks because the Armenian genocide. ... And then finally, after 10 years, their team thought, \u201cOK, I think science is at the place where we have access to enough databases that we think we could do something. So let\u2019s try.\u201d And so they actually came back after about six months and said, \u201cWe don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to be able to do it,\u201d but then a month later, they made a breakthrough and then they said it\u2019s on.",
      "Wow.",
      "And then they called me back about a month after that, and gave me the option of ducking out of the episode, of opting out of the episode because of the paternity issue involving my father\u2019s side. They can\u2019t reveal paternity issues unless there\u2019s consent and knowledge by all parties involved, and because my father\u2019s still alive and he needed to be informed if we were going to move forward to reveal potentially who his father was. So then that blew open, that was the big discovery that then blew open my father\u2019s side of the family tree.",
      "It\u2019s been three years since I got those results, and I\u2019ve had multiple historians on payroll running down loose ends. I found my German family members, there was part of the German family living in Canada, and I got in contact with them and they had a handwritten German family tree that went back to the 1400s. I got hooked up with a historian in Germany, went and ran all of it down, and I found my ancestors that fought in the Napoleonic wars. There\u2019s a famous architect, a mayor in the town where they all came from. Then I have another historian that specializes in New England and Virginia, and he\u2019s been working for the past two years, unraveling all of that, and dipped into my Irish ancestry. My great-great-grandfather came over during the potato famine, joined the Union Army and fought in the American Civil War and disappeared somewhere out West shortly thereafter. I\u2019m actually going to go from here to New England for my cousin\u2019s wedding, and I\u2019m going to go to the memorial and grave marker of my fifth great-grandfather (Plato Turner), an African slave who fought in the American Revolution against the British.",
      "And then, about a year and a half ago, I got a ping on 23andMe that my father has a half sister living in Ohio. That same biological grandfather had another child eight years later, so I got to meet her and I have a half aunt living in Ohio.",
      "It keeps going.",
      "So the talk with \u201cFinding Your Roots\u201d is about doing their first-ever sequel episode, because also finding her then proved without a shadow of a doubt who my biological grandfather was. I left \u201cFinding Your Roots\u201d not knowing definitely who my biological grandfather was, but her DNA proved it, so we know it was this man. Then I did some digging and found a marriage certificate from the 1800s that proves where my European Y chromosome cut ... which also proves what I think my last name is because there were multiple, but I need to go on the show (again) to test some people genetically. We\u2019re putting together a kind of rogues\u2019 gallery of people\u2019s genes we want to test to see if I match their Y chromosome, and then there\u2019s a village on the border of Wales and England where I think my last name comes from ... anyway.",
      "I struck a chord. Thank you for sharing all that.",
      "Don\u2019t get me started, I know."

But amid an international backlash and accusations of using starvation as a weapon of war, it eventually increased the amount allowed in.",

      "The plan, however, is tangled from the start.",
      "Some European leaders maintain that no such meeting should take place before Russia agrees to a ceasefire. Many analysts doubt that Putin will actually agree to meet with Zelenskyy. And even if he does, there's the fraught subject of where to hold the negotiations, given that Putin faces an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court (ICC).",
      "Kremlin plays it cool",
      "Trump revealed Monday that he called the Russian leader \u201cto begin the arrangements\u201d during his White House meeting with Zelenskyy and a posse of European leaders.",
      "The president doubled down Tuesday, telling \"Fox & Friends\" that he hoped \u201cPutin is going to be good,\u201d adding: \u201cI sort of set it up with Putin and Zelenskyy, and you know, they\u2019re the ones that have to call the shots. We\u2019re 7,000 miles away.\u201d",
      "Trump seemed eager to accelerate the timeline of the mooted talks. \"I think it will be fairly soon,\" Finnish President Alexander Stubb told NBC News, adding that he hoped it could happen \"within the next two weeks.\"",
      "Moscow, however, poured its customary cold water on the excitement.",
      "\"We do not reject any formats: neither bilateral nor trilateral,\" said Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. But he warned that any summit would have to be prepared \"step by step, gradually, starting with the expert level and then going through all the necessary steps.\"",
      "Lavrov, speaking to State TV channel Rossiya-24, added that \"contacts involving top officials must be prepared with the utmost care.\"",
      "Location TBD",
      "Zelenskyy said he is \"ready\" to meet Putin, but it's unclear where such a meeting would take place.",
      "Putin faces an arrest warrant, issued by the ICC in 2023, over the alleged war crime of illegally deporting Ukrainian children. That obligates the 125 countries that are party to the court under the Rome Statute to arrest the Russian leader and transfer him to The Hague for trial if he sets foot on their territory.",
      "Moscow has repeatedly denied accusations that its forces have committed atrocities in Ukraine, and the Kremlin branded the court decision \"null and void.\"",
      "Trump said Monday the location was \u201cto be determined,\u201d and the search for a neutral venue has already turned into its own diplomatic guessing game.",
      "The White House is actively looking to secure a meeting location and date, a senior administration official told NBC News.",
      "Hungarian capital Budapest and Geneva in Switzerland have been among the sites discussed, the official said.  In addition, various nations have offered to host.",
      "Switzerland, already floated by Stubb and French President Emmanuel Macron as a potential venue, raised its hand.",
      "Despite being an ICC signatory, the country could welcome Putin for a summit given that he would be coming for peace purposes, said Foreign Minister Ignazio Cassis.",
      "\u201cThe goal of receiving Mr. Putin in Switzerland without him being arrested is one hundred percent achievable,\u201d Cassis told Swiss national broadcaster SRF.",
      "Austria's leader also offered his country, which stood at the divide of communist Eastern Europe and the capitalist West during the Cold War.",
      "\"We stand ready to offer our good services,\" Chancellor Christian Stocker posted on X.",
      "Hungary may also be in play.",
      "Its parliament voted to quit the ICC in April, which could allow Putin to attend without risk of arrest. Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n has also remained one of the Kremlin's few friends in Europe amid the war, though that may make it less appealing to Kyiv.",
      "The senior administration official said both Trump and Putin have a good relationship with Orb\u00e1n, which could be a factor in finding a site. Trump spoke on the phone with Orb\u00e1n on Tuesday, a White House official told NBC News.",
      "But obstacles remain: Any Putin flight to Switzerland or Hungary risks passing over countries that might not be so forgiving if his plane had to make an emergency landing.",
      "Safer bets could be Turkey, which has hosted past summits between Ukraine and Russia, or Qatar, which is already used to hosting fraught negotiations between warring parties as the venue for talks between Israel and Hamas. Turkey and Qatar are not members of the ICC.",
      "Sergei Markov, a former Kremlin adviser, suggested that a summit could take place at the end of August and that Saudi Arabia could play host.",
      "The U.S. is also not an ICC signatory, and Putin and Zelenskyy have traveled there in recent days.",
      "Whether a venue will even need to be chosen is another matter.",
      "While not \u201cimpossible,\u201d a meeting between the two leaders would be \u201ca big surprise,\u201d Keir Giles, a senior fellow at the London-based think tank Chatham House, told NBC News.",
      "Putin has \u201ccarefully avoided\u201d meeting Zelensky until now, he said in a phone interview, \u201cbecause doing so conflicts with his narrative of Ukraine not being a proper country and Zelenskyy not being a legitimate leader.\"",
      "Tatiana Stanovaya, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, a Berlin-based think tank, echoed those doubts. A meeting would be \u201cpointless\u201d for Putin and will not happen \u201cunder the current circumstances,\u201d she wrote on X.",
      "Putin \u201chas repeatedly stated that such a meeting would only be possible if there were well-prepared grounds, which in practice means Zelenskyy\u2019s acceptance of Russia\u2019s terms for ending the war,\u201d she said."

      "From Friday to Sunday, human handlers from 16 countries put about 500 bipedal robots through various motions to showcase the promise and limits of embodied artificial intelligence at what was billed as the first World Humanoid Robot Games in Beijing.",
      "The robotic participants came in all shapes, sizes and structures and competed in 26 different sports events, from running to kickboxing to soccer. The unusual state-backed sports tournament at the National Speed Skating Oval, a Beijing Olympic venue, came as the United States and China race each other to shape the future of AI.",
      "No speed records were being set, and many of the athletes were prone to fizzling and face plants. Some robots broke down unexpectedly while they were competing, while others didn\u2019t complete their tasks as planned. A viral video showed a running robot veering off course and accidentally knocking over a person on the track.",
      "But for the robots\u2019 developers, the games were less about winning or losing and more about testing their agility, endurance and battery life, all of which have made great advances in recent years.",
      "Some humanoids were also competing in more practical job skills, such as sorting medicine and hotel concierge duties.",
      "A team from StarBot, a California-based tech company that specializes in developing robots skilled in customer service, said they were \u201creally excited\u201d to be part of the games.",
      "\u201cWe thought it was a really good opportunity to come to China and be in an environment where everything is so modern and up to date,\u201d company representative Gregorio Velasco told NBC News.",
      "StarBot\u2019s machines, developed based on the Chinese-made Unitree model, competed in service-related races, as they excel at restaurant scenarios such as taking orders and delivering food to tables, he said.",
      "Going forward, Velasco said, \u201cwe hope to be in people\u2019s homes and restaurants, hotels, and I think in the future, many people will have robots involved in their life.\u201d",
      "The venue was packed with spectators who laughed, clapped and rooted for the robot athletes as the games kicked off Friday.",
      "During the tai chi event, a group of judges watched carefully as the robot competitors moved gracefully to the rhythm of soft music in the background, jotting down notes and scoring the performances with the seriousness of an Olympic panel.",
      "\u201cFor robots, a single movement needs to be repeated many times before they can perform it with stability,\u201d martial arts judge Zhang Jidong told Chinese state newspaper The Beijing News. \u201cConsidering the very short preparation time, the robots\u2019 upper-body movements were impressively smooth.\u201d",
      "The games didn\u2019t just showcase how far robotics have come and how humanoids might one day be integrated into daily life. They also revealed how heavily China\u2019s government has been backing the development of such technologies, to close the artificial intelligence gap with the United States.",
      "In July, China announced its global action plan for AI just days after the Trump administration released the U.S. version, which experts note is \u201cno coincidence\u201d as the two countries race to win others over to their respective visions for AI governance. Both countries consider AI a national security issue, and the United States has sought to restrict China\u2019s access to the advanced semiconductor chips needed to train AI models.",
      "While the United States backs market-driven AI in alignment with liberal norms, China promises to help developing countries with AI as a means to promote state control, according to the Atlantic Council, a think tank based in Washington.",
      "Videos of robots dancing, punching and performing have been all over Chinese social media and state TV as Beijing has deepened its AI investment and promotion. In April, the Chinese government organized a half-marathon in Beijing in which robots and human runners raced one another.",
      "For years, Beijing has been funneling tens of billions of dollars into AI research and state subsidies, just as it did with the electric vehicle industry, drawing accusations of unfair competition from Western critics.",
      "While American robot developers such as Boston Dynamics still dominate high-end research and innovation, Chinese companies, spurred by government policy, are focused on mass-producing affordable robots, according to the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a think tank based in Washington.",
      "Research published by Morgan Stanley predicts that by 2050, China will have 302.3 million humanoid robots in use, well ahead of the U.S. projection of just 77.7 million.",
      "Although the production disparity between the two countries may grow larger, experts said the United States will maintain its advantage in total compute capacity, a metric more likely to be the key in deploying and integrating AI systems at scale.",
      "Wang Xiaoyin, a representative from the China-based robot developer NexAurora, said robots today still lack a \u201crobust AI brain.\u201d",
      "The \u201creal AI age,\u201d he said, will begin only when robots like the ones competing in Beijing can think and behave independently after training.",
      "While the robots\u2019 performance over the weekend showed that day is still a long way off, the games were part of China\u2019s larger goal: getting ahead in the global race for AI domination, one clunky step at a time.",

      "WASHINGTON \u2014\u00a0Seven European leaders joined Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Washington on Monday in a rare display of trans-Atlantic unity. The gathering marked the first time in decades that such a broad delegation of allies had assembled at the White House under such pressing circumstances.",
      "Shortly after noon, one by one, the heads of state and NATO partners passed the White House gates, where they were met by President Donald Trump\u2019s chief of protocol, and in Zelenskyy\u2019s case, by Trump himself.",
      "Some met with Trump\u2019s special envoy for Ukraine and other officials that morning. Others made their way to the White House directly from Dulles and other airports. They were there to bolster Zelenskyy after a disastrous White House visit in February, when he clashed with Trump and Vice President JD Vance \u2014 and after Trump held a nearly three-hour one-on-one with Russian President Vladimir Putin last week.",
      "The show of support for Zelenskyy involved French President Emmanuel Macron, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Finnish President Alexander Stubb, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who pivoted from their own national agendas to present a united front as Trump seeks an urgent end to Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine.",
      "The display took place within days of Trump\u2019s meeting with Putin in Alaska and ahead of a possible Trump-brokered meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy as Trump casts himself as a potential peace broker.",
      "Inside the Oval Office on Monday, evoking a boardroom scene, Trump sat behind the Resolute desk, military flags at his back, as Zelenskyy and the European delegation faced him, as reflected in a photo shared by the White House. Made of oak timbers taken from a British ship, the desk is a hulking 19th century reminder of goodwill between important allies, a gift from Britain's Queen Victoria to the United States. Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent are seen orbiting in the background, along with senior White House staff members.",
      "There are few precedents for the gathering, which merged diplomacy with Trump\u2019s usual verve.",
      "In 1941, Franklin Roosevelt hosted Winston Churchill off the coast of Newfoundland to sign the Atlantic Charter, laying out the Allied aims for the end of World War II and meetings that would decide the fate of Europe and Asia. During the Cold War, summits in Washington helped decide the terms of German reunification. They included meetings with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev amid a key question over whether Germany would join NATO. And in 1950, the British prime minister rushed to Washington to consult Harry Truman over fears of the possible use of nuclear weapons during the Korean War.",
      "\u201cWashington has often been the scene of these great moments of diplomacy. But it was the speed with which this came together that was so striking and sets this apart,\u201d said Marc Selverstone, director of presidential studies at the University of Virginia\u2019s Miller Center of Public Affairs. \u201cEveryone realized this was a crisis moment.\u201d",
      "The urgency was reflected in how quickly the past few days' events came together: Trump\u2019s talks with Putin on Friday were followed by the leaders\u2019 arrival in Washington on Monday morning. \u201cEvery single one of them got on a plane 48 hours later and flew to the United States of America,\u201d said White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, rushing to Washington in a bid to keep momentum toward peace in Ukraine alive.",
      "The day also offered other made-for-TV moments, as Trump escorted the leaders to a gift shop of sorts, which he dubbed the \u201cMonica Lewinsky room\u201d in reference to a former president\u2019s trysts, where he showed off rows of fire engine red hats emblazoned with his campaign slogans, including one for 2028. At another point, Trump deflected a question to Zelenskyy about Ukraine\u2019s elections to joke about serving a third term himself.",
      "Told through photos shared online by his team, Trump presented a towering figure in Monday's meetings. In a picture posted by deputy chief of staff Dan Scavino, Zelenskyy stood before a map of Ukraine as Trump looked down at him. Another image posted by the White House showed Trump seated behind his historic desk, this time with Vance and Rubio before him, the phone handset resting on the desk as he talked with Putin.",
      "For Zelenskyy, Monday also offered a reset. After a tense Oval Office meeting this year, he struck a more diplomatic tone Monday, offering Trump and others his thanks more than a dozen times, including for the invitation, for Trump\u2019s efforts \u201cto stop killings and stop this war,\u201d for Melania Trump\u2019s letter to Putin asking him to protect children, for a program to purchase American weapons and to the European partners for their support. On his X account, he offered profuse, continued thanks well into Tuesday.",
      "Wearing a suit instead of his usual military fatigues, he told Trump as he greeted him that the attire was \u201cthe best I had.\u201d",
      "\u201cI love it,\u201d Trump said, ultimately sharing a video of the warm exchange on his social media platform, Truth Social.",
      "Asked what his message to the people of Ukraine was, Trump told a reporter, \u201cWe love them.\u201d",
      "Vance, who had publicly clashed with Zelenskyy in their last White House meeting, also sought to smooth relations, posting a photo of their handshake.",
      "Finland\u2019s participation carried its own symbolic weight, with one reminder of a path out of a seemingly intractable conflict with a nuclear-powered Soviet Union, which Stubb referred to directly.",
      "\u201cWe, of course, have our own historical experience with Russia from World War II, the Winter War and the War of Continuation,\u201d Stubb said. \u201cAnd if I look at the silver lining of where we stand right now, we found a solution in 1944, and I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be able to find a solution in 2025.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Finnish President Alexander Stubb has proved pivotal in the efforts to end the war between Russia and Ukraine, taking on new importance after he bonded with President Donald Trump over their mutual love of golf.",
      "Minutes after emerging from a four-hour meeting with Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and several other European leaders at the White House on Monday, Stubb described the results to NBC News.",
      "\u201cWhat we have agreed on is to work on European and American security guarantees, essentially, which will be secure from the European perspective, coordinated with the Americans,\u201d Stubb said. \u201cIt\u2019s us who decide what kind of security guarantees we put up for Ukraine, not the Russians.\u201d",
      "He responded sharply to Russia\u2019s immediate rejection of the idea that those security guarantees would potentially include a NATO presence.",
      "\u201cRussia doesn\u2019t decide on that,\u201d Stubb said. \u201cIt\u2019s as simple as that.\u201d",
      "Stubb, whose country joined NATO in 2023 in response to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine the year before, said the leaders agreed Monday that security guarantees for Ukraine were among their top priorities, along with a bilateral meeting between Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin, followed by a trilateral meeting including Zelenskyy, Putin and Trump.",
      "For Stubb, Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine is personal. Both his father and grandfather were born in cities that were ceded to Russia following Soviet leader Joseph Stalin\u2019s 1939 invasion of Finland and that remain part of Russia today. That history informs his commitment to Ukraine. Until Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, Finland, which shares more than 800 miles of border with Russia, had remained steadfastly neutral for decades, including during the Cold War.",
      "Stubb described his country as a regional \u201csecurity provider,\u201d pointing to its mandatory military service, large reserve forces and arsenal of weapons. \u201cWe have over 60 F-18s. We just bought 64 F-35s. We have long-range missiles, air, land and sea, and we have the largest artillery in Europe, together with Poland,\u201d he said.",
      "Finland and other European countries represented at the White House on Monday \u2014 Britain, France, Germany and Italy, as well as the heads of the European Commission and NATO \u2014 are part of a group known as the Coalition of the Willing, which also met virtually on Tuesday. Stubb said they have been working on how to help secure Ukraine for some time, and decided at the White House meeting to order their militaries and civil servants to come up with a plan as soon as next week.",
      "A location for a meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy has not yet been determined, but Stubb suggested Switzerland as a possibility. \u201cGeneva could work actually,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that would be neutral territory for it.\u201d",
      "Stubb said the goal is for the meeting to happen as soon as possible, hopefully \u201cwithin the next two weeks.\u201d",
      "Switzerland\u2019s foreign minister, Ignazio Cassis, said Tuesday morning that the country would grant Putin immunity to enter the country for such a meeting, despite an arrest warrant for him for war crimes by the International Criminal Court of Justice. Putin would be at risk of arrest in most other countries in Europe, among a total of 125 nations that observe the ICC\u2019s jurisdiction. The U.S. does not.",
      "18 holes and diplomacy",
      "Stubb gained Trump\u2019s ear over a round of golf in West Palm Beach, Florida, in March, when they competed together in a member-guest tournament at one of Trump\u2019s courses and Trump gifted Stubb a new set of clubs to replace the set Stubb had brought with him.",
      "According to the Wall Street Journal, Trump asked Stubb over lunch if he could trust Putin, and Stubb told him \u201cyou cannot.\u201d Hours later, the Journal noted, Trump publicly criticized Putin for the first time over his refusal to agree to a cease-fire with Ukraine.",
      "The Journal also reported on informal calls and texts between the two leaders since then, including Trump sometimes consulting Stubb before speaking with Putin. Zelenskyy has also publicly thanked Stubb for helping him build a connection with Trump in the aftermath of Trump and Zelenskyy\u2019s infamously heated Oval Office meeting in February.",
      "Stubb also seems to have sensed how to communicate to Trump the extent of Putin\u2019s prospective land grab of Ukraine\u2019s territory.",
      "\u201cFor an American audience,\u201d he told NBC News, \u201cthe best way to explain it is that if you take the relative land mass of what Russia wants right now from Ukraine, it would be a little bit like you giving up Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, even Virginia, and then bumping into Maryland.\u201d"

      "After his February fiasco in the Oval Office, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's \"fabulous\" fashion decision \u2014 as well as the golf club, personal letter and supportive European leaders he brought with him \u2014 appear to have helped shift the mood of his high-level White House talks on peace with Russia.",
      "While the Kremlin publicly smarted, a sense of relief swept through Ukraine and across Europe after the summit Monday with President Donald Trump.",
      "Zelenskyy hailed it Tuesday as \u201ca truly significant step\u201d toward ending the war.",
      "His team came away from the talks relieved that worst case scenarios were avoided and pleased that Trump now appears to recognize the crucial importance of security guarantees for Kyiv to secure any peace agreement \u2014 and the need for the U.S. to play a role in those arrangements, a source familiar with the Ukrainian government\u2019s thinking told NBC News.",
      "Russia may never agree to such a concept and Trump may yet change his mind, but for the moment, they were satisfied with the day\u2019s conversations, the source said.",
      "Trump told \"Fox & Friends\" that the U.S. could provide air support as part of such an arrangement, but ruled out American troops on the ground.",
      "Changing outfits \u2014 and mood",
      "That optimism was thanks at least in part to the tone set by the Ukrainian leader's arrival in a blazer-style jacket and collared shirt, a departure from his trademark military garb.",
      "A fixation on attire might seem trivial given the stakes as the world leaders gathered to discuss ending the brutal conflict, but style mattered here.",
      "For Europe\u2019s leaders, the meeting was about optics as much as substance: A chance to undo any ground Russian President Vladimir Putin may have gained with Trump in Alaska last week.",
      "\u201cI love it,\u201d Trump said as he greeted Zelenskyy, no doubt sparking a sigh of relief from the suited gaggle of European heads of state who had flown in determined to avoid a repeat of February's bust-up, when Zelenskyy was lambasted for not wearing a suit and accused of disrespecting the White House.",
      "Zelenskyy had clearly adjusted his approach to diplomacy beyond his outfit, opening with a flurry of 11 \u201cthank yous\u201d in four and a half minutes, a striking contrast with February when he was branded ungrateful.",
      "The Ukrainian leader forged family ties, handing his host a letter from Ukrainian first lady Olena Zelenska to be delivered to American first lady Melania Trump. Zelenskyy also presented Trump with a golf club, a gift passed on to him by a wounded Ukrainian soldier.",
      "\"You look fabulous in that suit,\" said the reporter who took Zelenskyy to task about his outfit in February.",
      "Zelenskyy himself didn\u2019t leave empty handed. Trump handed him \u201csymbolic keys to the White House,\u201d the Ukrainian president\u2019s office said in a statement Tuesday.",
      "He was not alone in working to woo the American leader even as the discussion turned to the knotty details of ceasefires and security guarantees.",
      "It was no accident the European contingent included figures with reputations for charming Trump, a delegation curated to curry favor who took every opportunity to shower Trump with praise for his efforts to break the deadlock with Moscow.",
      "\u201cSomething has changed, thanks to you,\u201d said Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni.",
      "\u201cI really want to thank you for your leadership,\u201d opined NATO chief Mark Rutte.",
      "The substance of the talks remains murky, but Trump refrained from blaming Europe and appeared to enjoy the onslaught of flattery while even offering some in return.",
      "He complimented German Chancellor Friedrich Merz on his tan and showed off a shelf of MAGA hats to Zelenskyy and French President Emmanuel Macron.",
      "And the spectacle did not go unnoticed in Moscow.",
      "The newspaper Moskovskij Komsomolets said European leaders had begun negotiations with \u201coutright bootlicking,\u201d while outlet Argumenty said Zelenskyy had \u201chumiliated\u201d himself in the White House.",
      "Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev scoffed that Europe had \u201cthanked and sucked up\u201d to Trump, while sneering at Zelenskyy's sartorial choice. \"The question is which tune the Kiev clown will play about guarantees & territories back home, once he\u2019s put on his green military uniform again,\" he said.",
      "In his own apparent attempt at flattery, Medvedev opined that Europe\u2019s leaders had \u201cfailed to outplay\u201d Trump.",
      "In Ukraine, however, the mood was positive.",
      "\u201cThis round of talks was won by Ukraine and its allies outright,\u201d Serhii Kosiianchuk, a 39-year-old account manager from Kyiv, told NBC News. He said he was \u201cimpressed\u201d by the meeting, adding that \u201cprevious mistakes\u201d had been taken into account.",
      "But the theater may have overshadowed the thinness of concrete results.",
      "Welcoming the contrast to the \"fiasco\" of February, graphic designer Kateryna Gonchar, 38, was nonetheless cautious about the path forward. Zelenskyy had clearly worked with a large team \"so as not to annoy Trump even more, and to show that we are ready to make certain concessions,\" she said.",
      "Many analysts agreed.",
      "Europe's leaders had \"bent over backwards to butter up Trump,\" but the war \"doesn't look any closer to resolution,\" said Michael Bociurkiw, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council think tank.",
      "\"It\u2019s very, very important to separate spectacles from facts and what\u2019s really going on on the ground,\" he said in a phone interview, citing Russian attacks that killed 10 people in Ukraine just hours before the Washington meeting and new attacks early Tuesday.",
      "Trump said he intended the next step to be a direct meeting between Zelenskyy and Putin, while European leaders reconvened later Tuesday.",
      "They focused on the issue of security guarantees, after Trump's more positive tone offered cause for optimism but also questions about the sacrifices Ukraine may have to make in order to secure them.",

      "Ukraine must be given security guarantees to prevent any future Russian attacks that could prolong the conflict or start a new war, Macron said after his meeting with Trump, Zelenskyy and top European leaders.",
      "\u201cIf you make any peace deal without security guarantees, Russia will never respect its words, will never comply with its own commitments,\u201d Macron said.",
      "He said it was promising that Trump noted that one of the key points from his meeting Friday with Putin was that he had accepted security guarantees for Ukraine.",
      "Asked about the possibility of a ceasefire, Macron said, \u201cI do hope,\u201d noting that Russia carried out strikes in Ukraine even as the delegation of world leaders was in the United States.",

      "Trump met with Zelenskyy at the White House for about an hour in an accelerated effort to end the war on terms acceptable to both sides. The pair then met with European leaders to work toward a breakthrough in a conflict that Trump himself has cautioned could erupt in a third world war if it were allowed to persist.",

      "Asked whether U.S. troops would help secure a peace deal, Trump did not rule out the possibility.",
      "As a condition of ending the war, Putin has insisted that his country retain about 20% of Ukrainian territory that it now controls. Zelenskyy has said Ukraine's constitution forbids him to cede any land.",
      "Trump and Zelenskyy spoke to the news media in the Oval Office before they went behind closed doors. Trump suggested he will not abandon efforts to forge a peace deal, though he conceded the Russia-Ukraine conflict has proved particularly stubborn.",
      "\"It's never the end of the road,\" Trump said. \"People are being killed, and we want to stop that. So I would say it's not the end of the road. I think we have a good chance of doing it.\"",

      "\"We will come to a resolution today I think on almost everything, including probably the security,\" Trump said before the start of that meeting.",
      "After they finished the talks, Trump and the European leaders moved into the Oval Office for further discussions, according to a White House official.",
      "Europe looms large in any accord between the combatants. Looking to prevent future Russian attacks, European nations would be an important part of any security guarantees that Ukraine has requested as part of any peace deal.",
      "But the United States also may play a part, Trump said \u2014 a surprising admission from the \"America First\" president. If there is a Trump foreign policy doctrine, it is that he wants to extricate the United States from foreign wars and shift some of the peacekeeping burden from the United States to other countries.",
      "Yet when he was asked whether he would deploy Americans to Ukraine to help preserve a peace deal, Trump did not dismiss the idea out of hand.",
      "\"We're going to work with Ukraine, we're going to work with everybody, and we're going to make sure that if there is peace, the peace is going to stay long-term,\" he said.",
      "With the TV cameras present, the tone was far more cordial than in Zelenskyy's last visit. In that February meeting, Vice President JD Vance sat beside Trump and berated Zelenskyy for not showing enough gratitude to Trump. This time, Vance sat in the same place but stayed silent.",

He and Putin strode down a red carpet together before a private meeting that lasted nearly three hours.",
      "Though he said beforehand that  he wanted a ceasefire, Trump left the summit without one and said he was shifting his aim, instead, toward a full-fledged \"peace agreement.\"",

      "Rubio said in the interview that \u201cno one is pushing Ukraine to give that up,\u201d referring to land occupied by Russia. Later in the day, Trump appeared to undercut Rubio when he reposted a Truth Social user who declared, \u201cUkraine must be willing to lose some territory to Russia otherwise the longer the war goes on they will keep losing even more land!!\u201d",
      "Sunday night on Truth Social, Trump seemed to place the onus of ending the war on Zelenskyy, as opposed to Putin, who sent tanks rolling into Ukraine in February 2022.",

      "The meetings Monday give the leaders a forum to discuss future security guarantees for Ukraine, which U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff floated as potentially looking similar to NATO\u2019s Article 5.",
      "Ukraine hopes to negotiate an ironclad security guarantee, similar to Article 5's all-for-one provision, and convince Trump that a temporary ceasefire is necessary to begin real peace talks, according to a Ukrainian source familiar with the goals. The security guarantees should be a treaty-level obligation, the source said, which require Senate approval.",
      "A challenge for Zelenskyy is to persuade Trump that Russia should give up the territory it seized by force. A European official said it was their belief that Ukraine would never give up all of its eastern Donbas region, much of which Russia controls.",

    "story": [
      "KRAMATORSK, Ukraine \u2014 As Ukraine's leader headed to the White House, civilians in the country\u2019s east were streaming out of front-line towns under mounting threat from Russian forces.",
      "At the main station in the stronghold city of Kramatorsk, sisters Valentina and Nadia, both in their 70s, wait for a train to escape Russian troops approaching their home in a surrounding area. Neither trusts President Donald Trump or Russia's Vladimir Putin to shape Ukraine\u2019s future.",
      "\u201cWe do not believe Trump,\u201d Valentina told NBC News last week. \u201cHe says one thing and does another.\u201d",
      "Now the home they have had to flee may be at the heart of Trump's push to end the conflict.",
      "For more than a decade, the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine \u2014 of which Kramatorsk is one of the largest cities still holding out \u2014 has been the focal point of intense battles and diplomatic disputes.",
      "For Kyiv, the Donbas is a vital industrial hub and defensive buffer, a resource-rich region that Ukraine fiercely claims as its sovereign territory with deep cultural roots.",
      "For the Kremlin, it is both a tactical target and a political lever, with Putin framing the region as historically linked to Russia while placing it at the heart of the territorial ambitions he has pursued with military force.",
      "Its fate may now be decided in the Oval Office rather than on the battlefield.",
      "What is the Donbas?",
      "Made up of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, the Donbas is an industrial powerhouse spanning roughly 20,000 square miles, making it roughly the size of West Virginia. It is rich in coal and metal deposits, and shaped by industrial towns and strategically important ports on the Sea of Azov.",
      "After Russia\u2019s illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014, Moscow-backed separatists fought Ukrainian forces in the Donbas, a conflict that lasted eight years and killed an estimated 14,000 people, according to the United Nations.",
      "In 2022, Putin recognized two breakaway territories \u2014 the self-declared \u201cDonetsk People\u2019s Republic\u201d and \u201cLuhansk People\u2019s Republic\u201d \u2014 before launching his full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",
      "Three years later, Russia controls roughly 88% of the Donbas region, including all of Luhansk and 75% of Donetsk, according to open source maps of the battlefield. Russia claims sovereignty over both, in addition to the southern Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions, as well as Crimea.",
      "Russia\u2019s conditions to end the war include Ukraine ceding the territories Putin claims \u2014 roughly 20% of the country \u2014 and agreeing to permanent neutrality, including a ban on joining NATO.",
      "Kyiv has vowed never to recognize the annexations, and its European allies have insisted Russia cannot veto Ukraine\u2019s path to NATO.",
      "Why is Ukraine determined to keep the Donbas?",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has vowed that Ukraine will not hand over the Donbas in exchange for peace. The region serves as a defensive buffer and a center of industry, and giving it up would weaken the country military and economically.",
      "While Ukraine is deeply fatigued by the war, about 75% of Ukrainians also object to formally ceding any land to Russia, according to polling by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology."

      "Ukraine hoped to use the meeting to negotiate an ironclad security guarantee and convince Trump that a temporary ceasefire is necessary to begin real peace talks, a Ukrainian source familiar with the goals told NBC News. The security guarantees should be treaty-level obligations, the source said, which require Senate approval.",
      "Rahman said the nature of the security guarantees was \"absolutely key to prevent Russian aggression in the future,\" saying the Europeans would travel to Washington hoping to \"pin down the detail of what U.S. involvement in Ukraine\u2019s future security will be.\"",
      "Citing a deadly strikes in Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia, Zelenskyy said Monday that Russia was continuing its attacks on his country even as talks were ongoing in order \u201cto maintain pressure on Ukraine and Europe, as well as to humiliate diplomatic efforts.\u201d",
      "And in Kyiv, many feel that conceding territory as part of the broader peace deal Trump is now pursuing wouldn\u2019t end the war at all \u2014 it would only embolden Moscow to push further.",
      "\"It is precisely this so-called long-term peace of Putin\u2019s that would allow him to continue waging war,\" said Oleksiy Goncharenko, a lawmaker for Ukrainian opposition party European Solidarity.  \"The quickest step is to establish a ceasefire first, and only then begin negotiations.\"",
