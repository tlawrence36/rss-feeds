      "Who killed Donald Goines",
      "DETROIT -- Who killed Donald Goines?",
      "Producers of a documentary on the life of the prisoner-turned urban fiction writer of novels about the violence, drugs and prostitution that he surrounded himself with in Detroit are hoping the answer hasn't been lost to time \u2014 or the streets.",
      "It's been more than 50 years since Goines and his common-law wife, Shirley Sailor, were found shot to death on Oct. 21, 1974 in their flat in Highland Park, a small enclave of Detroit. Each had been shot five times. Their two young children were home at the time of the killings.",
      "Goines was 37.",
      "No arrests were made and rumors swelled. Some speculated the killings had something to do with Goines' heroin addiction. Others nodded to the theory that the fictional subjects of his novels appeared a bit too much like the real-life hustlers, pimps, drug dealers and stickup men who prowled the city's streets.",
      "\u201cThere have been at least a half-dozen, quite possibly a dozen, elements of speculation as to how Mr. Goines and the mother of his children were murdered,\u201d said Bill Proctor, a private investigator hired to find the killer or killers. \u201cBut no one has come forward with enough information to charge the persons responsible.\u201d",
      "Proctor said a $5,000 reward being offered by the producers of the documentary might help \u201cshake the trees\u201d and find \u201csomeone who might still be alive or have an understanding\u201d of the facts of the case.",
      "Goines wrote 16 books over a span of several short years. His raw, stark and undiluted writings are filled with the urban street life imagery of the late 1960s and early 1970s.",
      "\u201cDopefiend,\u201d was published in 1971. Fifteen more including \u201cStreet Players,\u201d \u201cDaddy Cool\u201d and \u201cKenyatta's Last Hit,\u201d would follow over the next three years. The titles and the content resonated with many Black readers, especially in Detroit where Goines' books often held prominence on living room coffee tables and bookshelves.",
      "\u201cWhen I read his books, I can visualize \u2014 I can picture what he\u2019s writing about,\u201d said his daughter, Donna Sailor. \u201cHe was so descriptive about what he wrote. That\u2019s kind of like how it was back then.\u201d",
      "Donna Sailor was 2 when her parents were killed. She doesn\u2019t remember anything about the shooting or her parents.",
      "\u201cWe would see friends of the family that knew my dad and my mom,\u201d Sailor, 52, told The Associated Press Thursday. \u201cThey would say she was a sweetheart, and she was funny and had a great smile.\u201d",
      "Less information about Goines was volunteered, though, she added.",
      "\u201cNo one ever went into great detail about him. They would say he was a nice guy,\u201d said Sailor.",
      "The urban lit genre dates back at least to 1967, and the release of the memoir \u201cPimp,\u201d written by Robert Maupin, who also was in jail when he began writing under the name Iceberg Slim. Maupin built a large word-of-mouth following and one of his readers was Goines. Generations later, hip-hop stars like Tupac Shakur were also inspired by the books and have referenced Goines and Iceberg Slim in their recordings. Shakur even once declared: \u201cMachiavelli was my tutor, Donald Goines my father figure.\u201d",
      "Goines' parents owned a clothes-cleaning and other businesses in Detroit and were part of the city's Black middle class. He enlisted in the Air Force and spent time in Korea and Japan during the Korean War. It was there Goines became addicted to heroin, according to various reports on his life.",
      "After his time in the military, Goines returned to Detroit in the mid-1950s. He drifted into the city's criminal underbelly, finding himself jailed for various crimes.",
      "Holloway House published Goines' novels from 1971 to 2008, according to current publisher Kensington.",
      "Under Kensington, Goines books have sold about 500,000 copies in print, alone. He consistently is one of Kensington's top reordered authors and his books have been \u201cselling at a stronger pace\u201d since it launched a reissue program in 2020, according to the company.",
      "Robert (Tape) Bailey and Craig Gore are the driving forces behind the documentary which is expected to be released by the end of the year. Both read Goines\u2019 books while incarcerated, separately.",
      "Bailey, 49, was born in Detroit and now lives in Los Angeles. He spent time in federal prison as young man for possession with intent to deliver drugs in Ohio.",
      "Goines wrote in detail about things he had witnessed firsthand, Bailey said.",
      "Gore, 51, of Los Angeles, stumbled onto Goines while serving time for burglary and theft. He says that through the $5,000 reward, they hope to bring more accuracy to the documentary.",
      "\u201cWe might find nothing. We might solve the murder,\u201d he said."

      "Since breaking out as rapper Paper Boi in the FX series \u201cAtlanta,\u201d Brian Tyree Henry's become one of the busiest actors in Hollywood",
      "If you ask Brian Tyree Henry about taking time off, he bursts out laughing.",
      "Since breaking out as rapper Paper Boi in the FX series \u201cAtlanta,\u201d he's become one of the busiest actors in Hollywood. He's worked consistently \u2014 with directors including Barry Jenkins, Steve McQueen and Chloe Zhao and big-name actors like Brad Pitt, Jennifer Lawrence, Chris Hemsworth and Melissa McCarthy. Henry's been nominated for two Primetime Emmy Awards, a Tony Award and an Oscar.",
      "His latest role is in the limited series \u201cDope Thief\" for Apple TV+ premiering Friday. Henry and Wagner Moura play Ray and Manny, two longtime friends in Philadelphia who pose as federal agents, conducting fake raids to steal drugs and money. It's a series of easy scores until they rob the wrong people and become targets themselves. Soon they're hiding out from the real DEA and a drug kingpin while trying to keep their family safe.",
      "\u201cThe minute that Wagner and I met each other, it was an instant electricity... We just felt like we knew each other all our lives,\" said Henry. \"That is exactly what you needed for Ray and Manny.\u201d",
      "The first episode was directed by Ridley Scott, and the series was created and written by Peter Craig, adapted from a novel by Dennis Tafoya.",
      "Craig describes Henry's versatility as an actor as \"like a jazz musician... It\u2019s fantastic for a writer, because you can throw him all kinds of added moments, and he\u2019ll incorporate and use them all.\u201d",
      "When the opportunity to star in \u201cDope Thief\u201d came about, Henry was ready for that long-awaited break \u2014 from TV. He wrapped \u201cAtlanta\u201d and had \u201cabout two days off\u201d before going into another FX show, \u201cClass of \u201809,\u201d where he played a character\u2019s past, present and future, and he was exhausted.",
      "\u201cTelevision is hard, you know? Like, I hear myself complaining about it; I know it\u2019s a first world problem, but you get very attached when you\u2019re doing a series. You're living with the character for quite a long time.\"",
      "So, there Henry was at 3 a.m. on a night shoot of \u201cClass of \u201809,\" wearing prosthetics as his character\u2019s future self, when his manager presented him with the script for \u201cDope Thief.\u201d \u201cWithin the first 10 pages I was incredibly attracted to Ray and also the bond he has with Manny.\u201d",
      "Time off otherwise really hasn't been his thing (hence the laughter), but Henry is quick to remind that he\u2019s had two long breaks from acting. One was during the lockdown phase of the pandemic, and the other was during the Hollywood strikes.",
      "\u201cWhen you\u2019re a person that\u2019s constantly on the move and the universe tells you to sit your (expletive) down, you kind of have to listen,\u201d said Henry. \u201cI don\u2019t think I would have stopped had the universe not said stop.\u201d",
      "Production was underway on \u201cDope Thief\u201d when the Hollywood guild strikes were called in 2023. Henry opted to stay in Philadelphia.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t go anywhere. I made sure to be there just in case,\" said Henry, who for the first time was an executive producer on the project. He wanted to be close in proximity to his local crew. They had a cookout with bouncy castles. \u201cI would explore, or we'd go tubing and I would drive to this little town called New Hope that has a wonderful ice cream shop called Moo Hope. It was truly amazing to be present and experience that part of life for myself.\u201d",
      "Henry doesn't just bond with the crew on his sets but actors too, often walking away with new friends who happen to be very famous, like, say, Julia Roberts \u2014 whom he's currently filming a movie with in London. \u201cShe's somebody I truly cherish,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s never going to stop being weird to me,\" Henry admits. \u201cThe part that is really hard for me \u2014 that I\u2019m still fighting with \u2014 is when they tell me they\u2019re fans of my stuff and I\u2019m just like, \u2018Shut up!\u2019 I literally say it to their face.\u201d",
      "The biggest revelation about working alongside these accomplished actors is that Henry is now one of them.",
      "\u201cAt the end of the day, now, these are my peers, these are my contemporaries, and I can\u2019t continue to act like they\u2019re not. I can\u2019t continue to act like I have to shrink myself to fit in these spaces. I no longer have to do that. And what I also love is that they\u2019ll reaffirm that for me, too ... and that's the great part.\u201d"

      "Harvey Weinstein\u2019s #MeToo retrial next month will largely be an abridged version of the original, with one big addition: a charge based on an allegation from a woman who wasn\u2019t a part of the first case",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Harvey Weinstein 's #MeToo retrial next month will largely be an abridged version of the original, with one big addition: a charge based on an allegation from a woman who was not a part of the first case.",
      "But at a key pretrial hearing Wednesday, the disgraced movie mogul\u2019s lawyers cautioned that because Weinstein\u2019s 2020 rape and sexual assault conviction was overturned, the past isn't prologue \u2014 it's almost entirely irrelevant.",
      "\u201cWe can take that transcript and all the judge\u2019s rulings and throw them in the garbage,\" Weinstein\u2019s lawyer, Arthur Aidala, argued. \u201cThat trial was declared illegal by the highest court in this state.\"",
      "New York\u2019s Court of Appeals threw out Weinstein\u2019s conviction last year, setting the stage for a retrial starting April 15 in state court in Manhattan. Prosecutors say it could take about five weeks.",
      "How the retrial will play out began to take shape Wednesday as Judge Curtis Farber ruled on a number of outstanding issues, including expert testimony and the language used to describe the accusers.",
      "Farber granted a prosecution request to call a psychologist, Dawn Hughes, as an expert witness on the psychological and traumatic effects of rape and sexual assault. Hughes previously testified for actor Amber Heard at Johnny Depp\u2019s libel trial against Heard in 2022 and as a prosecution witness in singer R. Kelly\u2019s federal sex trafficking trial in Brooklyn in 2021.",
      "The judge also granted a defense request to preclude the term \u201csurvivor\u201d from being used to describe Weinstein\u2019s accusers. He told prosecutors to instruct any police officers who testify to refer to the women as \u201ccomplaining witnesses\" instead.",
      "While Weinstein\u2019s convictions from the first trial were thrown out, his acquittals on the most serious charges \u2014 two counts of predatory sexual assault and first-degree, or forcible, rape \u2014 still stand.",
      "Given that, Farber ordered prosecutors to instruct one of the accusers testifying at the retrial not to used the word \u201cforce\u201d when describing her alleged assault.",
      "The Manhattan district attorney's office had wanted to exclude any mention of Weinstein\u2019s acquittals and vacated conviction, but Farber said he could be obligated to clue them in depending on how the accuser testifies.",
      "\u201cDoes she have to use the word force? She can describe what happened and let the jury draw its own conclusions?\u201d the judge asked. \u201cI am not asking her to change her testimony from the first trial. I am asking her to refrain from using the word force.\"",
      "Other decisions were made behind closed doors as Farber met with the prosecution and defense for more than an hour in his chambers to discuss matters still under seal.",
      "They included a prosecution request that two of the three accusers in the case be allowed to testify about other alleged encounters with Weinstein. They also discussed evidence of the accusers' sexual history, which prosecutors say should be barred under New York's Rape Shield Law.",
      "Weinstein, 72, was in court for Wednesday\u2019s proceedings, arriving from jail in a wheelchair and suit and holding a stack of documents. Before the public portion of his hearing began, the ex-studio boss watched as Farber spent a few minutes resolving another matter that had been delayed by their closed-door discussions.",
      "At his last court appearance in January, Weinstein had implored Farber to start the retrial sooner.",
      "He told the judge \u201cI don\u2019t know how much longer I can hold on\u201d with cancer, heart issues and harsh conditions at New York City\u2019s Rikers Island jail complex, where he is locked up. Farber said he may hold jury selection a few days sooner if a murder trial he's overseeing wraps up ahead of schedule.",
      "Weinstein is being retried on charges that he forcibly performed oral sex on a movie and TV production assistant in 2006 and raped an aspiring actor in 2013. The additional charge, filed last September, alleges he forced oral sex on a different woman at a Manhattan hotel in 2006.",
      "Prosecutors said in court papers that the woman, who has not been identified publicly, came forward to them just days before the start of Weinstein\u2019s first trial but was not part of that case. They said they did not pursue the women\u2019s allegations after Weinstein was convicted and sentenced to 23 years in prison, but they revisited them and secured a new indictment after his conviction was thrown out.",
      "Farber ruled in October to combine the new indictment and existing charges into one trial.",
      "Weinstein\u2019s lawyers contend that prosecutors prejudiced him by waiting nearly five years to bring the additional charge, suggesting they had elected not to include the allegation in his first trial so they could use it later if his conviction were reversed.",
      "Weinstein has denied that he raped or sexually assaulted anyone.",
      "In vacating Weinstein\u2019s conviction, the Court of Appeals ruled that the trial judge, James M. Burke, unfairly allowed testimony against him based on allegations from other women that were not part of the case. Burke is no longer on the bench and such testimony won't be part of the retrial.",
      "Weinstein was convicted in Los Angeles in 2022 of another rape. His 16-year prison sentence in that case still stands, but his lawyers appealed in June, arguing he did not get a fair trial.",

      "If an algorithm designed a classic, big-screen spectacle for the small-screen age, \u201cThe Electric State\u201d probably wouldn\u2019t be too far off the mark.",
      "This is an Amblin-inspired, big-budget adventure with dystopian, science-fiction wonder, nostalgic callbacks, well-liked stars (Chris Pratt! Millie Bobby Brown! Stanley Tucci! Giancarlo Esposito! Ke Huy Quan!) and the directors ( Joe and Anthony Russo ) behind some of the highest-earning movies of all time.",
      "In theory, it should work. A kid on a dangerous, cross-country journey with a robot that may or may not be her brother whom she thought was dead? A reluctant, jaded adult companion who\u2019s quick with a one-liner? \u201cThe Electric State\u201d should be some future Spielberg\u2019s new favorite movie, the one that they\u2019ll reference in their Oscars speech as the thing that made them want to make movies. And yet it\u2019s lacking a spark and a soul that might distinguish it as memorable or special. Worse, considering everything it has going for it (including a reported budget that may have exceeded $300 million), \u201cThe Electric State\u201d is kind of dull.",
      "\u201cThe Electric State\u201d was loosely based on an illustrated novel by Simon St\u00e5lenhag that was released in 2018 and quickly scooped up for movie adaptation purposes with Marvel veterans Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely writing the script. Set in the early 1990s, this is a world in which service robots have risen up and demanded rights and freedom. The humans respond by going to war.",
      "This four-year war is skimmed over in a montage at the start of the film and, by 1994, Mr. Peanut (Woody Harrelson) is signing a peace treaty with Bill Clinton and the remaining robots are exiled to rot in the desert. The human victory was attributed to the drone creations of a Steve Jobs-ian tech billionaire Ethan Skate (Tucci), who is soon hawking his \u201cNeurocasters\u201d to the public. They scoop it up and soon society is just a bleak wasteland of screen zombies content to let their avatars work while they relax and fantasize a way out of their downtrodden existence.",
      "There are shades of \u201cThe Creator,\u201d \u201cWALL-E,\u201d \u201cReady Player One\u201d and many, many more films in here. But no one gets mad that something is derivative if it\u2019s also good. It\u2019s only when the kitchen sink references are so clear and come up so short that it becomes a real problem.",
      "Brown plays Michelle, an angry, orphaned teenager who lost her entire family not in the war, but in a car wreck. The one she misses the most is her little brother Christopher (Woody Norman, giving the best, most emotionally authentic performance in the film), a reluctant child prodigy. One day, a robot of a cartoon character they used to watch together turns up at her foster home, speaking only in the character\u2019s catchphrases. But after some gestures toward a photograph, she starts to believe that this robot is, somehow, Christopher, or at least someone who can lead her to the real Christopher. And thus starts their journey across America, and into the robot \u201cexclusion zone\u201d to figure out this puzzle. They soon team up with a war veteran/smuggler Keats (Pratt) and his snarky robot sidekick (Anthony Mackie, for your Marvel bingo card) and try to evade Esposito\u2019s robot bounty hunter.",
      "The robots they find in the exclusion zone are voiced by an army of celebrities you\u2019ll go insane trying to place before angrily resorting to IMDb, including Harrelson, Hank Azaria, Brian Cox and Jenny Slate. Their designs are thoughtful and remarkable and should evoke a sense of awe in the viewer at the sheer ingenuity behind this film, where many of the most impressive shots seem to be the recreations of St\u00e5lenhag\u2019s illustrations of dismantled, decaying robots. The action, however, gets mind-numbingly repetitive by the end of the bloated runtime.",
      "Pratt and Brown, while fine individually, don\u2019t really find their groove as partners on this journey either. Pratt is kind of just doing his thing and gets the few clever one-liners in the script. Brown, meanwhile, seems a little bored by yet another teen adventure role. And both ultimately look like movie stars in '90s cosplay, which might be a metaphor for the larger failure of the movie.",
      "\u201cThe Electric State\u201d was, of course, not made by algorithm, which is an admittedly cheap shot for a Netflix original. Unfortunately, it just feels that way.",
      "\u201cThe Electric State,\u201d a Netflix release streaming Friday, is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association for \u201csci-fi violence/action, language and some thematic material.\u201d Running time: 128 minutes. One and a half stars out of four."

      "President Donald Trump's team is looking at locations for a post-administration presidential library, and Florida may take that spot",
      "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- President Donald Trump's team is already looking for locations for his presidential library, and Florida may be a top contender.",
      "A Florida legislator said Monday that the state has a \u201chigh likelihood\u201d of getting its first presidential library.",
      "Presidential libraries are significant for post-administration historical archives depicting materials from a former president's term. They require years of planning and don't use federal funding.",
      "Here are a few things to know about a potential Trump presidential library:",
      "The state Senate Rules Committee on Wednesday unanimously backed Sen. Jason Brodeur's bill that he said would \u201cprevent any municipality or county from imposing frivolous obstacles to the establishment of a presidential library within the state.\u201d",
      "Brodeur said other states that built presidential libraries had construction roadmaps created to follow state and local laws, and Florida would need the same. He also said all former presidents are welcome to put a presidential library in Florida, not just Trump.",
      "\u201cI anticipate that this will be a pretty popular attraction. It is somebody who\u2019s likely even the most famous developer in the world right now,\u201d he said.",
      "Brodeur's bill comes as Trump's team is looking at several South Florida universities \u2014 including Florida Atlantic University and Florida International University \u2014 as potential spots for a presidential library.",
      "A secretary at the FAU president\u2019s office said she had not heard of any plans for a presidential library and declined to comment further. Spokespeople for FAU and FIU, and the White House press office didn't immediately respond to messages about possible plans for a presidential library.",
      "Traditionally, such libraries are built in the state where a president was born or grew up. Trump, though, was born in New York, which voted against him in three straight presidential elections and which made him the first former president to be convicted of felonies last year.",
      "Trump now primarily lives in Florida, and he's filled his administration's ranks with politicians and others from the Sunshine State.",
      "Democrats raised concerns in committee hearings about whether local residents would bear the costs of the library's construction. Brodeur said all costs of building the library, including the planning costs, would fall to the president and library archives.",
      "In December, ABC News agreed to pay $15 million toward a Trump presidential library to settle a defamation lawsuit. In the agreement, ABC News described the payment as a \u201ccharitable contribution\u201d to an escrow account being managed by Trump's attorney.",
      "That's would amount to a small fraction of the overall cost of building the library. For example, former President Barack Obama\u2019s library in Chicago was estimated to cost $830 million as of 2021.",
      "Little is known about what would be in a Trump presidential library, but materials in these libraries usually include documents, artifacts or items significant to a president\u2019s administration.",
      "Earlier this month the Justice Department returned the boxes coming from the FBI search of his Mar-a-Lago home in 2022 for classified documents. Trump said in a Truth Social post that these boxes were being sent to Florida, where they \u201cwill someday be part of the Trump Presidential Library.\u201d"

      "For George Woodhouse (Michael Fassbender), who's preparing for four colleagues, plus himself and his wife, Kathryn St. Jean (Cate Blanchett), who, like him, is a high-level operative, it\u2019s chana masala with a few drops of truth serum.",
      "\u201cWill there be any mess to clean up?\u201d Kathryn asks her husband as they\u2019re getting ready.",
      "\u201cWith any luck,\u201d he responds.",
      "So goes much of the crackling patter of \u201cBlack Bag,\u201d Steven Soderbergh\u2019s delicious marital drama cloaked as a sleek spy thriller. Lean and taut, the 93-minute \u201cBlack Bag\u201d is more a sizzling amuse-bouche than full-course meal, but it\u2019s simmered to perfection.",
      "George and Kathryn, as fellow agents at London\u2019s National Cyber Security Centre, don\u2019t seemingly have what you might call a traditional marriage. Each has their own secret ops, leaving large swaths of their lives off limits to the other. When George asks where Kathryn is flying off to on Wednesday, she shrugs with a smile, \u201cBlack bag.\u201d",
      "In the movie\u2019s opening scene \u2013 a slinky tracking shot that trails George into and out of a nightclub \u2013 an agent named Meacham (Gustaf Skarsgard) gives him the assignment to track down the mole, with the added wrinkle that Kathryn can\u2019t be dismissed as a possible suspect. A cyber-worm device called Severus that\u2019s capable of hacking into nuclear facilities has gone missing. The fate of the world, as it so often is, is said to be at stake.",
      "But, really, the state of George and Kathryn\u2019s marriage is what interests us. Extreme though their situation is, their union is one that, like any couple, is built on trust and devotion, even if their professional lives demand the inverse. When George, lying on top of Kathryn tells her he\u2019d do anything for her, she coos, \u201cWould you kill?\u201d It's a fair-enough test to the bounds of wedded bliss, sure, but her second question matters even more. \u201cWould you lie?\u201d",
      "Over that dinner \u2013 a scintillating set piece around a darkened dinner table inside their London town house \u2013 we can quickly gather just how much the truth means to George. He\u2019s renown for his powers with a polygraph. As a youngster, he even brought down his own father, uncovering his affair. \u201cI don\u2019t like liars,\u201d George says through clenched teeth.",
      "They\u2019re joined by Colonel James Stokes (Reg\u00e9-Jean Page); the in-house psychologist Dr. Zoe Vaughan (Naomie Harris); the carousing spy Freddie Smalls (Tom Burke); and the newest NCSC recruit, cyber specialist Clarissa (Marisa Abela). Both are paired off in clandestine relationships that quickly emerge, among other secrets. More than state secrets, infidelity dominates the conversation.",
      "Fassbender\u2019s spook is an agent of precision. He wears gleaming black-framed glasses. When only a few drops of sauce land on his cuff, he immediately withdraws to change his shirt. Hard as it would seem, Fassbender has found a character almost as dispassionate and monotone as his methodical assassin in David Fincher\u2019s \u201cThe Killer.\u201d",
      "This time, though, he's not a loner. Blanchett\u2019s Kathryn is kept more at a remove from us. She\u2019s mysterious and aloof \u2013 a femme fatale, maybe, we\u2019re led to wonder. An \u201caroma of hostility\u201d accompanies her, Zoe tells her in a psych evaluation. Is she the mole?",
      "This is an insular film, taking place mainly in crisply composed interiors, aside from the lake George occasionally fishes for bass in. There, in a fitting encapsulation of a movie full of smooth surfaces with currents twisting underneath, the camera gently rests on the water's surface.",
      "\u201cBlack Bag\u201d follows a run of agilely directed thrillers by Soderbergh made with screenwriter David Koepp ( \u201cPresence,\u201d \u201cKimi\u201d). They are both at the height of their almost-too-easy powers; the script, especially, is peppered with delectable dialogue. Their movie adopts the air of menace and suspicion of a John Le Carr\u00e9 novel, yet hinges on the sturdiness of its married couple, like a super spy version of Nick and Nora from \u201cThe Thin Man\" or a more cerebral \u201cMr. & Mrs. Smith.\u201d",
      "All of the supporting players \u2013 while they make up a fine ensemble \u2013 are ultimately playthings in their game of love. In a casting coup, a former James Bond \u2013 Pierce Brosnan \u2013 drops in late in the film as Arthur Stheiglitz, the head of NCSC. In his handful of scenes, Brosnan is rageful and ferocious, chomping into both Ikizukuri (prepared live fish) and the scenery.",
      "His presence both enlivens a movie already humming with the uber-cool chemistry of Blanchett and Fassbender while transforming \u201cBlack Bag\u201d into a twisty rejoinder to that notoriously skirt-chasing spy. Here, Mr. Bond, is how sexy monogamy can be.",
      "While directing a satellite to peer down upon his wife on some unknown mission in Europe, George explains their mystifying dynamic to Clarissa: \u201cI watch her, and she watches me. If she gets into trouble, I will do everything in my power to extricate her.\u201d",
      "In her response, Clarissa speaks for everyone: \u201cThat\u2019s so hot.\u201d",
      "\u201cBlack Bag,\u201d a Focus Features release is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for language including some sexual references, and some violence. Running time: 93 minutes. Three and a half stars out of four."

      "Dick Clark Productions, the producer of the award show, announced Thursday that Glaser will return for the 83rd Globes next January. Glaser, the first woman to host the show solo, successfully shepherded a ceremony she called \u201cOzempic\u2019s biggest night.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The hero at the heart of \u201cNovocaine\u201d can't feel pain",
      "Nathan Caine may not be able to feel pain, as the tagline for the new action-comedy \u201cNovocaine\u201d reads, but the same does not apply to audiences.",
      "Although he doesn\u2019t scream when his leg is impaled with an arrow or when he sticks his hand in a vat of frying oil, you might. I certainly did. Out loud. In a theater. With other people. There may have been some phrases uttered entirely involuntarily too. Were other people reacting in the same way, I wonder? I couldn\u2019t hear them over my own groans. Hooray for the communal experience, I guess?",
      "This is, in some ways, a film for people who thought John Wick wasn\u2019t stabby enough. It delights in the relentless mutilation of its hero, a regular guy (played by Jack Quaid ) with a rare condition that has rendered him immune from feeling any sort of discomfort to bodily harm. Unlike such high concept premises as \u201cCrank,\u201d congenital insensitivity to pain analgesia (or CIPA) is actually real. But it\u2019s not exactly a superpower, Nate explains. He can still die; it just might be because he hasn\u2019t emptied his bladder in many hours. Or because he's accidentally bitten his tongue off eating a sandwich. These are real concerns of his.",
      "His entire existence is devoted to preventing these kinds of crises, mostly through tried-and-true baby proofing techniques like using tennis balls on sharp corners. Like Kelly Ripa before a show, he only consumes \u201cnon-chewing food.\u201d",
      "Work is stable and dull as an assistant manager at a bank. And dating is out of the question; He spends most of his free time playing online video games. Quaid, even with his two movie star parents, is somehow believable as this cautious introvert, though everything is played with a light touch and a wink. The movie, written by Lars Jacobson and directed by Dan Berk and Robert Olsen, even begins with the mournful R.E.M. anthem \u201cEverybody Hurts.\u201d",
      "Then Nate\u2019s life is changed one day when a pretty teller at the bank, Sherry (Amber Midthunder), asks him out to lunch, then to drinks and even spends the night. The next morning, things get even crazier: Sherry is taken hostage after a violent robbery at the bank. These guys are capital B bad (led by fellow nepo spawn Ray Nicholson) killing both the bank manager the cops outside. So what does Nate do? He steals a cop car and attempts to save her himself.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t do it,\u201d pleads an injured cop as Nate hesitates before apprehending the car. It\u2019s hard to argue with the cop: Why not just let the professionals handle it, understaffed though they may be over the Christmas holiday? It would be a rather short and pointless movie if he did just leave it to the cops, but the impetus for this quest is a stretch to say the least. The conceit is missing some extra justification of why he felt like he was the only one who could do it, especially once he actually talks to said cops (Betty Gabriel and Matt Walsh).",
      "Like many things in \u201cNovocaine,\u201d it simply exists to open more avenues for his torture. This involves a fight in a restaurant kitchen, a visit to a tattoo parlor to get more information on one of the robbers, and a stop by a booby-trapped house. The script is self-aware enough to throw in a \u201cHome Alone\u201d reference, though not before you\u2019ve made one in your head.",
      "On the heels of some bad action comedies like \u201cLove Hurts,\u201d \u201cNovocaine\u201d is pretty enjoyable. It might have been born in the same elevator pitch incubator (what if non-stop violence!), but it\u2019s executed with some style and understanding of comedic timing. In one clever sequence, Nate persuades his psychotic captor to torture him as slowly as possible, buying time until his friend gets there as he pretends to feel the pain. \u201cNovocaine\u201d also kind of overstays its welcome, stretching on too long with too many endings. Still, it\u2019s an easy, if not entirely painless, watch.",
      "\u201cNovocaine,\u201d a Paramount Pictures release in theaters Friday, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for \u201cstrong, bloody violence, language throughout, grisly images). Running time: 110 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four."

Those include \u201cThe First Time Ever I Saw Your Face,\" her dreamy cover of \u201cThe First Time Ever I Saw Your Face,\u201d written by English folk artist Ewan MacColl for his wife Peggy Seeger. It marked the beginning of Flack's mainstream success when it was used in a love scene between Clint Eastwood and Donna Mills in his 1971 film \u201cPlay Misty for Me.\u201d",
      "But most will think of \u201cKilling Me Softly with His Song\" when Flack's name comes up in conversation. She first heard Lori Lieberman\u2019s \u201cKilling Me Softly with His Song\u201d while on a plane and immediately fell in love with it. While on tour with Quincy Jones, she covered the song, and the audience feel in love with it, too, as they\u2019d continue to for decades.",

      "LONDON -- Manchester United unveiled plans on Tuesday to build the \u201cworld\u2019s greatest\" soccer stadium.",
      "A proposed 100,000-seater arena would surpass Wembley as the biggest in the United Kingdom.",
      "Under the plans, the 20-time English champion said it would build next to its iconic Old Trafford ground, likely meaning it would not need to relocate during the construction process.",
      "\u201cOur current stadium has served us brilliantly for the past 115 years, but it has fallen behind the best arenas in world sport,\u201d part owner Jim Ratcliffe said. \u201cBy building next to the existing site, we will be able to preserve the essence of Old Trafford, while creating a truly state-of-the-art stadium that transforms the fan experience only footsteps from our historic home.\u201d",
      "United did not say how much the stadium would cost or reveal a timeline for its completion, but architect Norman Foster said building work would take five years.",
      "British billionaire Ratcliffe paid $1.3 billion for an initial 25% stake in United last year and made a new stadium one of his priorities.",
      "The possibility of redeveloping Old Trafford, one of the most iconic stadiums in soccer, was considered but an entirely new construction was the preferred option.",
      "\u201cToday marks the start of an incredibly exciting journey to the delivery of what will be the world\u2019s greatest football stadium,\u201d Ratcliffe said.",
      "United wants the venue to be part of a wider project to regenerate the surrounding Old Trafford area, which it said would be worth 7.3 billion pounds ($9.4 billion) to the U.K. economy. The U.K. government has already voiced its support for the project, although the specifics of how it would be funded are not known.",
      "Wembley is currently the biggest stadium in the U.K., with a capacity of 90,000, and is home to England\u2019s national soccer team.",
      "Twickenham, which is home to the national rugby team, holds 82,500.",
      "Old Trafford is the country\u2019s biggest dedicated soccer stadium with a capacity of just over 74,000, but is dated in comparison to the likes of the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in London, which regularly hosts NFL games.",
      "\u201cOur long-term objective as a club is to have the world\u2019s best football team playing in the world\u2019s best stadium,\" United chief executive Omar Berrada said.",
      "Managerial great Alex Ferguson said the club \"must be brave and seize this opportunity to build a new home, fit for the future, where new history can be made.\"",
      "The announcement came days after thousands of United fans marched in protest against the club's ownership in the face of cost cuts, ticket price rises and ongoing failure on the field.",
      "United is majority owned by the American Glazer family, which also owns the NFL\u2019s Tampa Bay Buccaneers.",
      "Upon investing, Ratcliffe vowed to return the once-dominant club back to the summit of European soccer after more than a decade since it last won the Premier League.",
      "But his first year in charge of soccer operations has been turbulent. United endured its worst-ever Premier League season last year and is on course to set a new low this term, with the team currently languishing in the bottom half of the standings.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to even pinpoint a single emotion because I feel that it changes like every five minutes,\u201d she told The Associated Press, still buzzing a day after her debut. \u201cI woke up and I still sort of felt in the world of Oz.\u201d",
      "Kebede, a first-generation Ethiopian American from Los Angeles, spent five years touring with \u201cHamilton,\u201d most recently in the role of Angelica Schuyler. Stepping into \u201cWicked\u201d on Tuesday marked her Broadway debut.",

It just feels like I\u2019m taking the entire audience in my arms.\u201d",

      "The popularity of the Cynthia Erivo-led movie hasn't dampened the appetite for the Broadway version, which opened in 2003 with songs by Stephen Schwartz and a book by Winnie Holzman. Over Christmas, it took in a staggering $5 million over nine performances, marking the highest weekly gross in history for any Broadway show.",
      "Kebede joins a sisterhood of green-clad Black women who have played Elphaba, a list that includes Saycon Sengbloh and Lilli Cooper, both Broadway standbys; Brandi Chavonne Massey, a Broadway understudy; and Alexia Khadime, a full-time West End Elphaba.",
      "Others who have played the role over the years include Shoshana Bean, Stephanie J. Block, Jessica Vosk, Eden Espinosa, Ana Gasteyer and, of course, Idina Menzel, who won a Tony Award in the role in 2004.",
      "Kebede graduated from Occidental College in 2016 with a double major of diplomacy & world affairs and politics, intending on a career in law or public policy. By her senior year, she had an itch she needed to scratch.",
      "\u201cI just had this creative craving in terms of storytelling in the theatrical way that I was missing,\u201d she says. \u201cSo I sat my mother down and I was like, \u2018Look, I think I need just a couple years to explore this creative endeavor.\u2019\u201d",

      "During its war with Tigray fighters that devastated the region in 2020-2022, Ethiopian government restrictions on the rebellious region reduced aid flows to a trickle. Then in 2023, U.S. and U.N. aid distributions of grain were halted for months over a corruption scandal.",
      "Now the Trump administration\u2019s dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID, has again halted food deliveries to a sprawling camp of over 20,000 people outside Tigray\u2019s regional capital, Mekele.",
      "\u201cWe will just die in silence,\u201d said Tsege, one of the 2.4 million people in Tigray who depend on humanitarian grain, most of it provided by the U.S.",
      "Ethiopia with its over 125 million people had been the biggest beneficiary of U.S. aid in sub-Saharan Africa, receiving $1.8 billion in the 2023 financial year. In addition to life-saving food, the funds were spent on HIV medications, vaccines, literacy programs and jobs creation, as well as services for 1 million refugees hosted by Ethiopia.",

      "As a result, a consortium of aid agencies in Tigray has had to stop distributions to the over 1 million people it has been responsible for feeding with U.S.-provided grain. It has no money to pay for fuel, trucks and drivers to distribute existing food stockpiles.",
      "That includes 5,000 metric tons of sorghum \u2013 enough to feed 300,000 people for a month \u2013 stuck in a storage facility in Mekele that could rot before it reaches those in need.",
      "\u201cThis is just one warehouse. There are several others across the region,\u201d said Teklewoini Assefa, head of the Relief Society of Tigray, part of the consortium. \u201cThis will create malnutrition, disease. If this situation continues, what follows? Death.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cEverything boils down to the payment system.\u201d",
      "The effects of the aid cuts are widespread, with many USAID contracts terminated. Already, Ethiopia has been forced to lay off 5,000 local healthcare workers who were working on its HIV response.",
      "Tigray relied heavily on U.S. funds. More than two years after the war killed hundreds of thousands, full-scale recovery efforts are yet to start. The region\u2019s health system is in ruins and hundreds of schools remain closed.",

      "Now, aid workers say many programs to improve nutrition have halted. Projects to deliver medicines and vaccines have stopped. Dozens of camps for displaced people have had water sources cut off.",
      "\u201cThe impact has been huge,\u201d said Ashenafi Asmelash, executive director of Mums for Mums, which has had two USAID- funded programs terminated. One helped build long-term resilience among farmers. The other helped improve the nutrition of children and new mothers.",
      "Management Sciences for Health, another Tigray organization, has halted a project to combat tuberculosis and told its staff to expect mass layoffs in March, according to a senior executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals.",
      "Efforts to assist thousands of women who were raped during the war have been derailed, said Rigat Bishaw at Ayder Hospital, Tigray\u2019s biggest healthcare facility.",
      "This includes counseling and physiotherapy sessions for survivors run by the U.S.-based Center for Victims of Torture, which received a stop-work order from the Trump administration in February and furloughed its staff.",
      "CVT also halted a program to train health workers to recognize sexual abuse cases and refer survivors to appropriate health services.",

      "Aid cuts by the United States are hurting Africa\u2019s capacity to respond to disease outbreaks, the head of the continent's public health agency said ahead of a meeting with regional health ministers to discuss other financing options",
      "KAMPALA, Uganda -- Aid cuts by the United States are hurting Africa\u2019s capacity to respond to disease outbreaks, the head of the continent's public health agency said Thursday, ahead of a meeting with regional health ministers to discuss other financing options.",
      "Jean Kaseya, director-general of the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or Africa CDC, told reporters that Friday\u2019s meeting with African health ministers will \u201cdiscuss recent developments in global health financing\u201d and where more sustainable funding might come from.",
      "Kaseya spoke of a \u201cnew era\u201d in health financing after U.S. aid cuts that have left health systems in Africa in disarray. The aid cuts, which affect governments and their partners in the non-governmental sector, have shut down or disrupted projects tackling diseases ranging from malaria to AIDS.",
      "Much of the funding to the Africa CDC and regional governments was lost with the Trump administration\u2019s decision to terminate most foreign aid contracts and cut $60 billion in overall U.S. assistance abroad. Many of the affected programs are in fragile countries that are highly reliant on U.S. aid to support health systems, nutrition programs and stave off starvation.",
      "Kaseya cited the immediate impact in Congo, which is the epicenter mpox outbreaks in Africa and where aid cuts and insecurity in the country\u2019s east have contributed to challenges in testing for the disease as well as securing enough vaccine doses.",
      "Aid cuts have impeded the collection and transportation of samples in Congo, Kaseya said.",
      "\u201cWe know this aid cut is a difficult moment for our countries, and it came overnight,\u201d he said. \u201cSome of them were not prepared for this major aid cut.\u201d",
      "The U.S. aid cuts affecting the response to outbreaks of mpox, Ebola and other diseases are the latest in a trend of declining monetary support by international partners over the years, he warned.",
      "\u201cWe are not just talking about the U.S.,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are saying almost all Western countries are decreasing their support. And that one is a critical issue for our health security.\u201d",
      "Kaseya said the Africa CDC and the World Bank are discussing possible \u201ctransitional\u201d funding in the aftermath of U.S. aid cuts."

    "story": [
      "The Trump Administration's quest to \u201cMake America Health Again\u201d is targeting ultraprocessed foods",
      "In the Trump administration\u2019s quest to \u201cMake America Healthy Again,\u201d there may be no bigger target than ultraprocessed foods.",
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the nation\u2019s new health secretary, has cited \u201chighly chemically processed foods\u201d as a chief culprit behind an epidemic of chronic disease in the U.S., including ailments such as obesity, diabetes and autoimmune disorders.",
      "Such foods are \u201cpoisoning\u201d people, particularly children, Kennedy said during Senate confirmation hearings. He has vowed to work to remove such foods from federal programs such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.",
      "\u201cI will do everything in my power to put the health of Americans back on track,\u201d he told lawmakers.",
      "Key to that goal, however, could be making sure that consumers understand basic facts about ultraprocessed foods and the role they play in daily meals.",
      "From sugary cereals at breakfast to frozen pizzas at dinner, plus in-between snacks of potato chips, sodas and ice cream, ultraprocessed foods make up about 60% of the U.S. diet. For kids and teens, it\u2019s even higher \u2014 about two-thirds of what they eat.",
      "That\u2019s concerning because ultraprocessed foods have been linked to a host of negative health effects, from obesity and diabetes to heart disease, depression, dementia and more. One recent study suggested that eating these foods may raise the risk of early death.",
      "Nutrition science is tricky, though, and most research so far has found connections, not proof, regarding the health consequences of these foods.",
      "Food manufacturers argue that processing boosts food safety and supplies and offers a cheap, convenient way to provide a diverse and nutritious diet.",
      "Even if the science were clear, it\u2019s hard to know what practical advice to give when ultraprocessed foods account for what one study estimates is more than 70% of the U.S. food supply.",
      "The Associated Press asked several nutrition experts and here\u2019s what they said:",
      "Most foods are processed, whether it\u2019s by freezing, grinding, fermentation, pasteurization or other means. In 2009, Brazilian epidemiologist Carlos Monteiro and colleagues first proposed a system that classifies foods according to the amount of processing they undergo, not by nutrient content.",
      "At the top of the four-tier scale are foods created through industrial processes and with ingredients such as additives, colors and preservatives that you couldn\u2019t duplicate in a home kitchen, said Kevin Hall, a researcher who focuses on metabolism and diet at the National Institutes of Health.",
      "\u201cThese are most, but not all, of the packaged foods you see,\u201d Hall said.",
      "Such foods are often made to be both cheap and irresistibly delicious, said Dr. Neena Prasad, director of the Bloomberg Philanthropies\u2019 Food Policy Program.",
      "\u201cThey have just the right combination of sugar, salt and fat and you just can\u2019t stop eating them,\u201d Prasad said",
      "However, the level of processing alone doesn\u2019t determine whether a food is unhealthy or not, Hall noted. Whole-grain bread, yogurt, tofu and infant formula are all highly processed, for instance, but they\u2019re also nutritious.",
      "Here\u2019s the tricky part. Many studies suggest that diets high in such foods are linked to negative health outcomes. But these kinds of studies can\u2019t say whether the foods themselves are the cause of the negative effects \u2014 or whether there\u2019s something else about the people who eat these foods that might be responsible.",
      "Ultraprocessed foods, as a group, tend to have higher amounts of sodium, saturated fat and sugar, and tend to be lower in fiber and protein. It\u2019s not clear whether it\u2019s just these nutrients that are driving the effects.",
      "Hall and his colleagues were the first to conduct a small but influential experiment that directly compared the results of eating similar diets made of ultraprocessed versus unprocessed foods.",
      "Published in 2019, the research included 20 adults who went to live at an NIH center for a month. They received diets of ultraprocessed and unprocessed foods matched for calories, sugar, fat, fiber and macronutrients for two weeks each and were told to eat as much as they liked.",
      "When participants ate the diet of ultraprocessed foods, they consumed about 500 calories per day more than when they ate unprocessed foods, researchers found \u2014 and they gained an average of about 2 pounds (1 kilogram) during the study period. When they ate only unprocessed foods for the same amount of time, they lost about 2 pounds (1 kilogram).",
      "Hall is conducting a more detailed study now, but the process is slow and costly and results aren\u2019t expected until late next year. He and others argue that such definitive research is needed to determine exactly how ultraprocessed foods affect consumption.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s better to understand the mechanisms by which they drive the deleterious health consequences, if they\u2019re driving them,\u201d he said.",
      "Some advocates, like Prasad, argue that the large body of research linking ultraprocessed foods to poor health should be more than enough to spur government and industry to change policies. She calls for actions such as increased taxes on sugary drinks, stricter sodium restrictions for manufacturers and cracking down on marketing of such foods to children.",
      "\u201cDo we want to risk our kids getting sicker while we wait for this perfect evidence to emerge?\u201d Prasad said.",
      "Last year, former FDA Commissioner Robert Califf broached the subject, telling a conference of food policy experts that ultraprocessed foods are \u201cone of the most complex things I\u2019ve ever dealt with.\u201d",
      "But, he concluded, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to have the scientific basis and then we\u2019ve got to follow through.\u201d",
      "In countries like the U.S., it\u2019s hard to avoid highly processed foods \u2014 and it's not clear which ones should be targeted, said Aviva Musicus, science director for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, which advocates for food policies.",
      "\u201cThe range of ultraprocessed foods is just so wide,\u201d she said.",
      "Instead, it\u2019s better to be mindful of the ingredients in foods. Check the labels and make choices that align with the current dietary guidelines, she suggested.",
      "\u201cWe have really good evidence that added sugar is not great for us. We have evidence that high-sodium foods are not great for us,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have great evidence that fruits and vegetables which are minimally processed are really good for us.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s important not to vilify certain foods, she added. Many consumers don\u2019t have the time or money to cook most meals from scratch.",
      "\u201cFoods should be joyous and delicious and shouldn\u2019t involve moral judgment,\u201d Musicus said.",

      "New Mexico has paired up with the Alzheimer\u2019s Association in a pilot U.S. initiative aimed at raising awareness about a disease that affects several million people in the country",
      "ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. -- New Mexico has paired up with the Alzheimer's Association in a pilot U.S. initiative aimed at raising awareness about a disease that affects several million people across the nation, including family members and friends who often provide countless hours of unpaid care.",
      "The joint campaign \u2014 a year in the making \u2014 features billboards, digital ads and social media posts. It was unveiled Wednesday, days after authorities confirmed that actor Gene Hackman died at his Santa Fe home of heart disease with complications from Alzheimer\u2019s disease.",
      "Hackman, like the majority of people with Alzheimer\u2019s and related dementias, lived at home. His wife, Betsy Arakawa, was his caregiver but died from hantavirus, a rare, rodent-borne disease. Experts believe Hackman, in the advanced stages of Alzheimer's, was unable to seek help.",
      "The goal of the new partnership between the state and the Alzheimer's Association is to spark conversations within families and to educate the public on warning signs and treatments. It also aims to publicize support services for family members and other caregivers.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s kind of the whole point of the campaign \u2014 to start talking, to start thinking, to take some action,\u201d said Joey Long, a spokesperson with the state Aging and Long-Term Services Department. \u201cSo it's like, maybe they\u2019ve been confused. Well, let\u2019s talk about what that means.\u201d",
      "According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 7 million people are living with the disease in the U.S., where Alzheimer\u2019s is the seventh-leading cause of death. In New Mexico, estimates put the number of people with the disease at 46,000, with another 67,000 family members providing care at home within the last year.",
      "Alzheimer's kills more people in the U.S. than breast cancer and prostate cancer combined, according to statistics shared by the Alzheimer's Association, which is helping to fund research projects in dozens of countries around the world.",
      "One of the challenges is that only about half of the people who are living with the disease are ever diagnosed, said Jim Herlihy, a spokesperson for the association's Rocky Mountain region. The number of undiagnosed people is higher in communities of color, he said.",
      "Neurologists say it can take 20 years from the start of the disease taking shape in the brain to when it becomes recognizable and diagnosed, what Herlihy describes as a glacial pace.",
      "\u201cPeople think of this as either an old person\u2019s disease or something that happens to somebody else,\u201d Herlihy said. \u201cAnd unless it\u2019s happened in your family and you have seen a loved one decline from this disease, or you have been put into the role of being a caregiver, you don\u2019t realize the impact that this has.\u201d",
      "The nonprofit association published a special report last year detailing the importance of families mapping out a plan for care, acknowledging that it can be a complex maze involving social services, medications and specialists.",
      "The billboards and ads are simple. One of them pictures a caution sign in the road that reads: \u201cHoney, you've been confused.\u201d The messages urge people to talk about it and to visit a website that includes a hotline for those who don't know where to start.",
      "A significant percentage of New Mexico's population is aging, which has spurred officials to find ways to educate and prepare state residents. In addition to the awareness campaign, the state is planning a series of community forums on the subject this spring in rural areas with high rates of the disease.",
      "The Alzheimer's Association is hoping the campaign will expand to other states."

      "NEW YORK -- Dr. David Weldon had been out of the national spotlight for more than 15 years when he was nominated to head the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But many anti-vaccine advocates knew him well.",
      "\u201cHe is one of us!! Since before our movement had momentum,\u201d the co-director of Mississippi Parents for Vaccine Rights wrote on Facebook. And on X, formerly known as Twitter, the Autism Action Network credited the former congressman with introducing legislation two decades ago \u201cto stop the vaccine pedocide.\u201d",
      "Weldon, who was nominated by President Donald Trump, needs to be confirmed by the U.S. Senate before he can lead the nation\u2019s top public health agency. His confirmation hearing is to be held Thursday.",
      "The 71-year-old retired Florida congressman is considered to be closely aligned with his presumptive boss, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the U.S. health secretary who for years has been one of the nation's leading anti-vaccine activists.",
      "Department of Health and Human Services officials declined to make Weldon or Kennedy available for an Associated Press interview.",
      "When he made the nomination announcement, Trump said Weldon \u201cwill proudly restore the CDC to its true purpose, and will work to end the Chronic Disease Epidemic, and Make America Healthy Again!\u201d",
      "The CDC was created nearly 80 years ago to prevent the spread of malaria in the U.S. Its mission was later expanded, and it gradually became a global leader on infectious and chronic diseases and a go-to source of health information.",
      "Today, the Atlanta-based agency has a more than $9 billion core budget. It had about 13,000 employees when Trump took office, but more than 500 were fired as part of a dramatic \u2014 and continuing \u2014 push by the president and his billionaire adviser Elon Musk to cut staffing across federal agencies.",
      "Weldon has no experience in federal public heath, but that isn't unusual. The last few presidential administrations \u2014 both Democratic and Republican \u2014 have appointed outsiders with no CDC experience.",
      "Unlike Weldon, however, those outsiders had been public health researchers or had run state health departments. He is an Army veteran and internal medicine doctor whose main claim to fame was representing a central Florida district in Congress from 1995 to 2009.",
      "After he left Congress, Weldon practiced medicine in Florida, taught at the Florida Institute of Technology, served as board chairman for the Israel Allies Foundation and made unsuccessful runs at federal and state elected office. In a March 1 letter to HHS, Weldon said that if confirmed he will resign from the foundation and from two Florida health-care organizations. He also promised to sell his holdings in funds investing in energy, pharmaceutical and health-care companies.",
      "Weldon was a leader of a Congressional push for research into autism\u2019s causes, which began around 2000. It was fueled by a controversial \u2014 and ultimately discredited \u2014 study by British researcher Dr. Andrew Wakefield that claimed to find a link between the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine and autism.",
      "The action in Congress was driven largely by U.S. Rep. Dan Burton, an Indiana Republican whose grandson had autism. Weldon was a prominent voice in Burton\u2019s hearings and co-sponsored a bill that would give responsibility for the nation\u2019s vaccine safety to an independent agency within HHS \u2014 an idea that not everyone in public health opposes.",
      "But Weldon also rejected studies that found no causal link between childhood vaccines and autism, and accused the CDC of short-circuiting research that might show otherwise.",
      "Meanwhile, Weldon was a friend to practitioners of fringe medicine. When Weldon invited Wakefield to testify before Congress, he also brought in Dr. James \u201cJeff\u201d Bradstreet, who used alternative medicine to try to treat autistic children. Bradstreet died in 2015, after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration raided his office, of a gunshot wound that police labeled a suicide.",
      "Weldon later appeared in \u201cVaxxed: From Cover-Up to Catastrophe,\u201d a 2016 documentary directed by Wakefield and produced by Del Bigtree, an activist who later became the manager of Kennedy\u2019s 2024 presidential campaign. In the movie, Weldon repeated suspicions and accusations about CDC that he\u2019d made as a congressman.",
      "Kennedy has argued that experts who advise the CDC on vaccine policy have conflicts from working with, or receiving money from, pharmaceutical companies. Those advisers routinely disclose conflicts in public meetings, but the CDC last week launched a web tool \u201cto increase the transparency of conflicts of interest.\u201d",
      "At Thursday's hearing, Democrats are likely to press Weldon on his vaccine views and his plans for the agency under a health secretary who has shown disdain for it.",
      "Dr. Anne Schuchat worked at the CDC for 33 years before retiring in 2021, and twice served as acting director. She said she doesn\u2019t know Weldon, but that agency directors gradually develop an appreciation and respect for its work.",
      "If Weldon follows a similar pattern, she said, he could be a great asset: His Capitol Hill experience could help CDC secure funding and political support.",
      "\u201cWith an optimistic view, there\u2019s lot you can build on, with what he has on paper,\u201d she said. \u201cWith a pessimistic view, if he wants the job to tear the place down, that would be disappointing \u2014 and dangerous.\u201d",

      "The Connecticut Supreme Court has upheld the murder conviction of a man found guilty of killing his wife in 2015, in a case that drew widespread attention because of evidence from the victim's Fitbit exercise activity tracker",
      "HARTFORD, Conn. -- Despite finding \u201cimproprieties\u201d were committed by a prosecutor, the Connecticut Supreme Court on Monday upheld the murder conviction of a man found guilty of killing his wife in a case that drew wide attention because the victim's Fitbit exercise tracker contradicted his statements to police.",
      "The justices ruled in a 6-0 decision that Richard Dabate was not deprived of a fair trial because of four missteps by the prosecutor they called \u201ctroubling,\u201d including referring to one of Connecticut's most notorious crimes while cross-examining the man.",
      "Dabate, 48, was convicted of murder and other charges in the fatal shooting of Connie Dabate, 39, at the couple's home in Ellington two days before Christmas in 2015 while their two young sons were in school. He's serving a 65-year prison sentence.",
      "Prosecutors said Dabate wanted his wife dead, in part, because he had a yearslong affair with another woman who was pregnant at the time of the killing and later gave birth to their child.",
      "Dabate staged a phony crime scene, including tying himself up loosely with zip ties and stabbing himself with a box cutter, and told police an unknown intruder in camouflage broke into their home, killed his wife and assaulted him, authorities said.",
      "State police said Dabate gave them a timeline of events that conflicted with data on his wife\u2019s Fitbit, which showed she was moving around for about an hour after the time Dabate said she was shot.",
      "Dabate testified in his defense and maintained his innocence, saying a large masked man with a voice like actor Vin Diesel was the killer.",
      "Part of Dabate's appeal questioned the reliability of the Fitbit evidence and whether the trial judge was wrong to have allowed it, but the Supreme Court upheld the data and its use.",
      "Dabate also accused Tolland State's Attorney Matthew Gedansky of multiple instances of impropriety, including Gedansky mentioning a notorious home invasion in Cheshire in 2007 while cross-examining Dabate. The home invaders killed a woman and her two daughters, ages 11 and 17, after terrorizing them for hours, while the woman's husband survived a vicious beating.",
      "Gedansky asked Dabate if he was trying to create a \u201clittle mini-Cheshire scene\u201d in his own home. The trial judge upheld an objection by Dabate's lawyer and asked Gedansky to rephrase the question, but Gedansky asked nearly the same exact question. The Supreme Court found Gedansky violated the judge's order to rephrase.",
      "\u201cIn referring to a \u2018mini Cheshire,\u2019 the prosecutor\u2019s question was unnecessarily inflammatory because it compared the defendant to other notorious offenders or infamous figures,\u201d Justice Joan Alexander wrote in the decision.",
      "Gedansky and Dabate's lawyer, Trent LaLima, did not immediately return email messages seeking comment Monday.",
      "The Supreme Court also found that Gedansky committed three other improprieties, including suggesting that the jury would have to be unintelligent or lazy to agree with the defense theory of the case.",
      "\u201cWe disapprove of the improprieties committed by the prosecutor during the trial of this case in strong and unqualified terms and expect our message to be taken with the utmost seriousness by prosecutors,\u201d the decision said.",
      "The court said it agreed with Dabate that \u201cthe prosecutor engaged in multiple acts of impropriety at trial that we consider troubling.\u201d",
      "Justices, however, said the state's case was very strong and Gedansky's missteps did not overshadow testimony by 130 witnesses and the 600 exhibits presented during the five-week trial."

      "Utah's governor intends to sign legislation making the state the first to ban fluoride in public water systems",
      "SALT LAKE CITY -- Utah will become the first state to ban fluoride in public drinking water, despite widespread opposition from dentists and national health organizations.",
      "Republican Gov. Spencer Cox said he would sign legislation that bars cities and communities from deciding whether to add the mineral to their water systems.",
      "Fluoride strengthens teeth and reduces cavities by replacing minerals lost during normal wear and tear, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The addition of low levels of fluoride to drinking water has long been considered one of the greatest public health achievements of the last century.",
      "Government researchers have found that community water fluoridation prevents about 25% of tooth decay.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got tried and true evidence of the safety and efficacy of this public health initiative,\u201d said American Dental Association President Brad Kessler, of Denver. Cavities could start emerging in children within months or years of Utah stopping fluoridation, Kessler said.",
      "The ban comes weeks after federal health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has expressed skepticism about water fluoridation, was sworn into office.",
      "\u201cIt's not a bill I care that much about,\u201d Cox added, \u201cbut it's a bill I will sign.\u201d",
      "Utah lawmakers who pushed for a ban said putting fluoride in water was too expensive. Its Republican sponsor, Rep. Stephanie Gricius, acknowledged fluoride has benefits, but said it was an issue of \u201cindividual choice\u201d to not have it in the water.",
      "Cox said that like many people in Utah, he grew up and raised his own children in a community that doesn\u2019t have fluoridated water \u2014 or what he called a \u201cnatural experiment.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou would think you would see drastically different outcomes with half the state not getting it. We haven\u2019t seen that,\u201d Cox said in a weekend interview with ABC4 in Salt Lake City. \u201cSo it\u2019s got to be a really high bar for me if we\u2019re going to require people to be medicated by their government.\u201d",
      "Already, some cities across the country have gotten rid of fluoride from their water, and other municipalities are considering doing the same. A few months ago, a federal judge ordered the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to regulate fluoride in drinking water because high levels could pose a risk to kids\u2019 intellectual development.",
      "A Utah teenager who urged lawmakers to pass the bill described suffering a medical emergency when the fluoride pump in Sandy, Utah, malfunctioned in 2019, releasing an excessive amount of the mineral into the drinking water. The fluoride sickened hundreds of residents and led many in Utah to push for its removal.",
      "It\u2019s rare to find high levels of fluoridation in water, according to the National Institutes of Health. The agency said it\u2019s \u201cvirtually impossible\u201d to get a toxic dose of fluoride from water with standard levels of the mineral.",
      "Kessler said the amounts of fluoride added to drinking water have been reduced over time and are below levels considered problematic.",
      "\u201cThe science proves that it is effective at reducing cavities with little to no risk of other problems,\u201d he said.",
      "He added that a ban in Utah could have a domino effect with other legislatures being encouraged to follow suit with fluoride bans in their states.",
      "Opponents warned it would disproportionately affect low-income residents who may rely on public drinking water having fluoride as their only source of preventative dental care. Low-income families may not be able to afford regular dentist visits or the fluoride tablets some people buy as a supplement in cities without fluoridation.",
      "Fluoridation is the most cost-effective way to prevent tooth decay on a large scale, said Lorna Koci, who chairs the Utah Oral Health Coalition.",
      "Utah in 2022 ranked 44th in the nation for the percentage of residents that receive fluoridated water, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About two in five Utah residents served by community water systems received fluoridated water.",
      "In February, the city council in Riverton, a Salt Lake City suburb, unanimously passed a resolution to remove fluoride from the city\u2019s public water systems. Voters in Brigham City, 59 miles (95 kilometers) north of the capital city, struck down by a large margin a measure in 2023 that would have removed the mineral from its public water supply.",
      "Out of the 484 Utah water systems that reported data to the CDC in 2024, only 66 fluoridated their water, an Associated Press analysis showed. The largest was the state\u2019s biggest city, Salt Lake City.",
      "Rodney Thornell, president of the Utah Dental Association, began practicing dentistry in a Salt Lake City suburb before the city added fluoride to its water. His adult patients who grew up locally continue to get lots of cavities but younger patients who grew up with fluoride in the water get fewer, he said.",
      "\u201cIf we\u2019re going to keep eating sugar, we need fluoride.\u201d Thornell said, noting that Utah residents consume more than the national average of candy and sugary drinks.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court agreed Monday in a case from Colorado to decide whether state and local governments can enforce laws banning conversion therapy for LGBTQ+ children.",
      "The conservative-led court is taking up the case amid actions by President Donald Trump targeting transgender people, including a ban on military service and an end to federal funding for gender-affirming care for transgender minors.",
      "The justices also have heard arguments in a Tennessee case over whether state bans on treating transgender minors violate the Constitution. But they have yet to issue a decision.",
      "Colorado is among roughly half the states that prohibit the practice of trying to change a person\u2019s sexual orientation or gender identity through counseling.",
      "The issue is whether the law violates the speech rights of counselors. Defenders of such laws argue that they regulate the conduct of professionals who are licensed by the state.",
      "The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver upheld the state law. The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta has struck down local local bans in Florida.",
      "In 2023, the court had turned away a similar challenge, despite a split among federal appeals courts that had weighed state bans and come to differing decisions.",
      "At the time, three justices, Samuel Alito, Brett Kavanaugh and Clarence Thomas, said they would have taken on the issue. It takes four justices to grant review. The nine-member court does not typically reveal how justices vote at this stage of a case so it\u2019s unclear who might have provided the fourth vote.",
      "The case will be argued in the court\u2019s new term, which begins in October. The appeal on behalf of Kaley Chiles, a counselor in Colorado Springs, was filed by Alliance Defending Freedom, the conservative legal organization that has appeared frequently at the court in recent years in cases involving high-profile social issues.",
      "One of those cases was a 5-4 decision in 2018 in which the justices ruled that California could not force state-licensed anti-abortion crisis pregnancy centers to provide information about abortion.",
      "Chiles\u2019 lawyers leaned heavily on that decision in asking the court to take up her case. They wrote that Chiles doesn\u2019t \u201cseek to \u2018cure\u2019 clients of same-sex attractions or to \u2018change\u2019 clients\u2019 sexual orientation.\u201d",
      "In arguing for the court to reject the appeal, lawyers for Colorado wrote that lawmakers acted to regulate professional conduct, \u201cbased on overwhelming evidence that efforts to change a child\u2019s sexual orientation or gender identity are unsafe and ineffective.\u201d",

      "Authorities have revealed that actor Gene Hackman died of heart disease and showed severe signs of Alzheimer\u2019s disease a full week after his wife died of hantavirus in their home",
      "SANTA FE, N.M. -- SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) \u2014 Actor Gene Hackman died of heart disease a full week after his wife died from hantavirus in their New Mexico hillside home, likely unaware that she was dead because he was in the advanced stages of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, authorities revealed Friday.",
      "Both deaths were ruled to be from natural causes, chief medical examiner Dr. Heather Jarrell said alongside state fire and health officials at a news conference.",
      "\u201cMr. Hackman showed evidence of advanced Alzheimer\u2019s disease,\u201d Jarrell said. \u201cHe was in a very poor state of health. He had significant heart disease, and I think ultimately that\u2019s what resulted in his death.\u201d",
      "Authorities didn't suspect foul play after the bodies of Hackman, 95, and Betsy Arakawa, 65, were discovered Feb 26. Immediate tests for carbon monoxide poisoning were negative.",
      "Investigators found that the last known communication and activity from Arakawa was Feb. 11 when she visited a pharmacy, pet store and grocery before returning to their gated neighborhood that afternoon, Santa Fe County Sheriff Adan Mendoza said Friday.",
      "Hackman's pacemaker last showed signs of activity a week later and that he had an abnormal heart rhythm Feb. 18, the day he likely died, Jarrell said.",
      "Although there was no reliable way to determine the date and time when both died, all signs point to their deaths coming a week apart, Jarrell said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s quite possible he was not aware she was deceased,\u201d Jarrell said.",
      "Dr. Michael Baden, a former New York City medical examiner, said he believes Hackman was severely impaired due to Alzheimer\u2019s disease and unable to deal with his wife\u2019s death in the last week of his life.",
      "Most older Americans with dementia live at home, and many receive care from family or friends.",
      "Their bodies were found a little over a week later. Hackman was found in the home\u2019s entryway. His death was tied to heart disease with Alzheimer\u2019s disease contributing.",
      "Arakawa was found in a bathroom. Authorities linked her death to hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, a rare but potentially fatal disease spread by infected rodent droppings. Thyroid medication pills prescribed to Arakawa were found nearby and weren\u2019t listed as contributing to her death, Jarrell said.",
      "Hantavirus typically is reported in spring and summer, often due to exposures that occur when people are near mouse droppings in homes, sheds or poorly ventilated areas. This is the first confirmed case of hantavirus in New Mexico this year.",
      "While hantavirus is found throughout the world, most cases in the U.S. have been found in western states. The virus can cause a severe and sometimes deadly lung infection.",
      "Jarrell said it was not known how quickly Arakawa died.",
      "One of the couple\u2019s three dogs also was found dead in a crate in a bathroom closet near Arakawa, while two other dogs survived. Authorities initially misidentified the breed.",
      "Dogs do not get sick from hantavirus, said Erin Phipps, a veterinarian with the New Mexico Health Department. The sheriff considers this an open investigation until they receive results of the dog's necropsy and finish checking into data from personal cellphones retrieved from the home.",
      "When Hackman and Arakawa were found, the bodies were decomposing with some mummification, a consequence of body type and climate in Santa Fe\u2019s especially dry air at an elevation of nearly 7,200 feet (2,200 meters).",
      "\u201cAll of us that knew him should have been checking on him,\u201d said Stuart Ashman, co-owner of Artes de Cuba gallery who cherished his encounters with Hackman at a local Pilates exercise studio, where they used to swap stories. \u201cI had no idea. ... It's just really sad. And that she died a week before him. My God.\u201d",
      "Dr. Victor Weedn, a forensic pathologist in Virginia, said when two bodies are found at the same time, the usual assumption would be that they died at the same time. But Hackman\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s disease added a complicating factor: He apparently was unable to seek help after his wife died.",
      "\u201cThey died several days apart: One dying of a viral infection, the hantavirus, which can kill quite quickly. And the other death occurring from heart disease. And that too can be a relatively sudden death,\" Weedn said. \"Their (the authorities\u2019) explanation, I thought, was quite clear and plausible. I believe they really discovered what truly happened in this case.\u201d",
      "Hackman, a Hollywood icon, won two Oscars during a storied career in films including \u201cThe French Connection,\u201d \u201cHoosiers\u201d and \u201cSuperman\u201d from the 1960s until his retirement in the early 2000s.",
      "Arakawa, born in Hawaii, studied as a concert pianist, attended the University of Southern California and met Hackman in the mid-1980s while working at a California gym.",
      "Hackman dedicated much of his time in retirement to painting and writing novels far from Hollywood\u2019s social circuit. He served for several years on the board of trustees at the Georgia O\u2019Keeffe Museum in Santa Fe, and he and his wife were investors in local businesses.",

      "Much of the literature about vitamin A and measles comes from lower- and middle-income countries, where deficiency may pose more of a problem. However, given that vitamin A deficiency can put kids at risk of worse outcomes with measles  --  and most kids aren't assessed for vitamin A levels  --  U.S. expert consensus has settled on administering the vitamin in all cases.",
      "",
      "Tina Tan, MD, of Northwestern University, who is president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, said vitamin A \"really plays an important role in maintaining a healthy immune system and supports the function of immune cells so the body can fight off infections like measles.\"",

      "If you\u2019re about to go to the gym, should you eat something beforehand",
      "If you listen to some self-proclaimed exercise experts on social media, they swear that working out on an empty stomach burns more fat.",
      "But it\u2019s a common misconception that exercising in a fasted state improves performance or burns more calories, said Abby Langer, a dietitian in Toronto.",
      "\u201cThe research shows that in terms of gains, it doesn\u2019t really make much of a difference,\u201d she said.",
      "Does that mean you should load up on protein and carbs right before a workout? No, that\u2019s not true either.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at when \u2014 and how \u2014 you should eat, before, after or even during a workout. (And remember, experts say what you eat is more important than when you eat.)",
      "The calories in food literally are energy, so you need them to fuel your body for a proper workout. Eating too much too soon beforehand, though, can be problematic.",
      "Exercising diverts blood from organs including the stomach to the muscles, said Langer, author of \u201cGood Food, Bad Diet.\u201d So exercising on a full stomach affects the digestive process, which could cause cramping or even make you feel sick.",
      "That\u2019s particularly the case with meals high in fat, protein or fiber, which take longer to digest than carbohydrates. Langer recommends eating a high ratio of carbs beforehand and waiting two to three hours before intense exercise.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t want to eat a big steak an hour before you play hockey,\u201d she said.",
      "If you exercise first thing in the morning or before dinner, it\u2019s OK to have a carb-rich snack like a banana with peanut butter or yogurt with fruit beforehand. It will give you the energy to perform well, and you can fuel up afterward with a full meal.",
      "That steak may serve you better afterward because that\u2019s when a higher ratio of protein is easier to digest, said Krista Austin, a physiologist in Colorado Springs.",
      "Austin said if it will be an hour or longer before you can have a full meal, it\u2019s better to have a high-protein snack in the meantime to help curb your appetite. The reason has little to do with muscle recovery or nutrient absorption: Rather, people who are too hungry make poor dietary choices.",
      "\u201cA lot of people get very hungry about an hour after exercise, and you don\u2019t want to do that,\u201d said Austin, author of \u201cPerformance Nutrition: Applying the Science of Nutrient Timing.\u201d \u201cYou want to catch it early, or you go and overeat.\u201d",
      "But it\u2019s another myth that you need to grab a protein shake within minutes of finishing to build the biggest muscles, Langer said.",
      "Many exercise enthusiasts point to what\u2019s known as an \u201canabolic window\u201d of about an hour within exercising that the body is primed to repair muscle. For the average person, you have a much longer window, and nutrient timing is less important than making sure you consume some protein at every meal, Langer said. The body needs a continuous supply of amino acids like protein for muscle repair and maintenance, she said, which means about 25 to 30 grams at every meal, depending on various factors.",
      "\u201cPrioritizing that will help with goals, either muscle building, satiety, weight loss, all of that,\u201d Langer said.",
      "Most people who are eating enough throughout the day don\u2019t need anything during a workout. Langer and Austin said the threshold is about an hour of intense exercise. Longer than that \u2014 say you're training for a marathon \u2014 and you can benefit from a carb-rich snack in the middle.",
      "Instead of focusing on when to eat, Austin said to focus on what and how much. She cautioned against overcomplicating the topic and recommended following the USDA\u2019s My Plate recommendations for a balanced diet.",
      "\u201cThe biggest thing we need to teach people is that nutrition is simple,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe you need to stop focusing on the concept of nutrient timing and just make sure that you\u2019re consistently eating throughout the day and focus on health.\u201d",

      "Polish abortion rights activists have opened a center across from the parliament building in Warsaw where women can have abortions with pills, either alone or with other women",
      "WARSAW, Poland -- Polish abortion rights activists opened a center across from the parliament building in Warsaw on Saturday where women can go to have abortions with pills, either alone or with other women.",
      "Opening the center on International Women's Day across from the legislature was a symbolic challenge to authorities in the traditionally Roman Catholic nation, which has one of Europe's most restrictive laws.",
      "A small but loud group of protesters stood outside the center as activists gathered inside for its inauguration. The activists had private security guards, while police also separated the protesters from those inside.",
      "Activists with the group Abortion Dream Team say it is the first stationary abortion center in Poland. It is meant to offer support to women who prefer not to have abortions alone in their bathrooms at home.",
      "They also say they want to put pressure on politicians and to destigmatize abortion in a society where they say one in four women have had the procedure but it remains a taboo topic.",
      "The country's centrist prime minister, Donald Tusk, came to power in an election in 2023 in which he vowed to liberalize the country's abortion law. But the coalition he leads spans a broad ideological divide, with lawmakers on the left who want to legalize abortion and conservatives strongly opposed.",
      "Last year he acknowledged that he lacks the backing in parliament to change the law. Allowing abortion up to the 12th week of pregnancy had been one of his campaign promises."

      "A new study finds the number of butterflies has dropped 22% since 2000, a new study finds",
      "WASHINGTON -- America's butterflies are disappearing because of insecticides, climate change and habitat loss, with the number of the winged beauties down 22% since 2000, a new study finds.",
      "The first countrywide systematic analysis of butterfly abundance found that the number of butterflies in the Lower 48 states has been falling on average 1.3% a year since the turn of the century, with 114 species showing significant declines and only nine increasing, according to a study in Thursday's journal Science.",
      "\u201cButterflies have been declining the last 20 years,\u201d said study co-author Nick Haddad, an entomologist at Michigan State University. \u201cAnd we don't see any sign that that's going to end.\"",
      "A team of scientists combined 76,957 surveys from 35 monitoring programs and blended them for an apples-to-apples comparison and ended up counting 12.6 million butterflies over the decades. Last month an annual survey that looked just at monarch butterflies, which federal officials plan to put on the threatened species list, counted a nearly all-time low of fewer than 10,000, down from 1.2 million in 1997.",
      "Many of the species in decline fell by 40% or more.",
      "David Wagner, a University of Connecticut entomologist who wasn't part of the study, praised its scope. And he said while the annual rate of decline may not sound significant, it is \u201ccatastrophic and saddening\u201d when compounded over time.",
      "\u201cIn just 30 or 40 years we are talking about losing half the butterflies (and other insect life) over a continent!\u201d Wagner said in an email. \"The tree of life is being denuded at unprecedented rates.\u201d",
      "The United States has 650 butterfly species, but 96 species were so sparse they didn't show up in the data and another 212 species weren't found in sufficient number to calculate trends, said study lead author Collin Edwards, an ecologist and data scientist at the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife.",
      "\u201cI'm probably most worried about the species that couldn't even be included in the analyses\u201d because they were so rare, said University of Wisconsin-Madison entomologist Karen Oberhauser, who wasn't part of the research.",
      "Haddad, who specializes in rare butterflies, said in recent years he has seen just two endangered St. Francis Satyr butterflies \u2014 which only live on a bomb range at Fort Bragg in North Carolina \u2014 \u201cso it could be extinct.\u201d",
      "Some well-known species had large drops. The red admiral, which is so calm it lands on people, is down 44% and the American lady butterfly, with two large eyespots on its back wings, decreased by 58%, Edwards said.",
      "Even the invasive white cabbage butterfly, \u201ca species that is well adapted to invade the world,\" according to Haddad, fell by 50%.",
      "\"How can that be?\u201d Haddad wondered.",
      "Cornell University butterfly expert Anurag Agrawal said he worries most about the future of a different species: Humans.",
      "\u201cThe loss of butterflies, parrots and porpoises is undoubtedly a bad sign for us, the ecosystems we need and the nature we enjoy,\u201d Agrawal, who wasn't part of the study, said in an email. \u201cThey are telling us that our continent's health is not doing so well ... Butterflies are an ambassador for nature's beauty, fragility and the interdependence of species. They have something to teach us.\u201d",
      "Oberhauser said butterflies connect people with nature and that \u201ccalms us down, makes us healthier and happier and promotes learning.\u201d",
      "What's happening to butterflies in the United States is probably happening to other, less-studied insects across the continent and world, Wagner said. He said not only is this the most comprehensive butterfly study, but the most data-rich for any insect.",
      "Butterflies are also pollinators, though not as prominent as bees, and are a major source of pollination of the Texas cotton crop, Haddad said.",
      "The biggest decrease in butterflies was in the Southwest \u2014 Arizona, New Mexico, Texas and Oklahoma \u2014 where the number of butterflies dropped by more than half in the 20 years.",
      "\u201cIt looks like the butterflies that are in dry and warm areas are doing particularly poorly,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cAnd that kind of captures a lot of the Southwest.\u201d",
      "Edwards said when they looked at butterfly species that lived both in the hotter South and cooler North, the ones that did better were in the cooler areas.",
      "Climate change, habitat loss and insecticides tend to work together to weaken butterfly populations, Edwards and Haddad said. Of the three, it seems that insecticides are the biggest cause, based on previous research from the U.S. Midwest, Haddad said.",
      "\u201cIt makes sense because insecticide use has changed in dramatic ways in the time since our study started,\u201d Haddad said.",
      "Habitats can be restored and so can butterflies, so there's hope, Haddad said.",
      "\u201cYou can make changes in your backyard and in your neighborhood and in your state,\u201d Haddad said. \u201cThat could really improve the situation for a lot of species.\u201d",

      "LONDON -- The captain of a cargo ship that collided with a U.S. tanker is a Russian national who remains in U.K. police custody, the vessel\u2019s owner said Wednesday, as it emerged that the ship failed several safety checks last year.",
      "The 59-year-old man, who hasn't been named by authorities, was arrested by police in northeast England Tuesday on suspicion of manslaughter by gross negligence over the collision. He hasn't been charged.",
      "Shipping company Ernst Russ, which owns the Portugal-flagged cargo vessel Solong, said that the ship\u2019s 14 crew were a mix of Russian and Filipino nationals.",
      "U.K. authorities say they have so far found no evidence of foul play in the crash. Humberside Police said that detectives were conducting inquiries alongside partner agencies.",
      "The U.K. Marine Accident Investigation Branch is also involved in investigating what caused the Solong, bound from Grangemouth, Scotland, to Rotterdam, Netherlands, to hit the stationary tanker, which was anchored about 10 miles (16 kilometers) off the English coast.",
      "The investigation is being led by the U.S. and Portugal, the countries where the vessels are flagged.",
      "Port inspection documents show the Solong failed steering-related safety checks in Dublin, Ireland, in July, with the vessel's \"emergency steering position communications/compass reading\u201d unreadable. Inspectors found a total of 10 deficiencies, including \u201cinadequate\u201d alarms, survival craft \u201cnot properly maintained\u201d and fire doors \u201cnot as required.\"",
      "An inspection in Scotland in October found two other deficiencies. The ship wasn't detained after either inspection.",
      "The cargo ship collided Monday with MV Stena Immaculate, a tanker transporting jet fuel for the U.S. military in the North Sea off eastern England on Monday, setting both vessels ablaze. One sailor from the Solong is missing and presumed dead. The other 36 crew members from the two vessels were brought safely ashore, with no major injuries.",
      "The Solong was drifting and still on fire Wednesday, but is likely to remain afloat rather than sinking, officials said.",
      "The 183-meter (596-foot) Stena Immaculate was operating as part of the U.S. government\u2019s Tanker Security Program, a group of commercial vessels that can be contracted to carry fuel for the military when needed.",
      "The collision sent jet fuel pouring into the sea and sparked fears of significant environmental damage. Environmentalists said that oil and chemicals posed a risk to sea life, including whales and dolphins and to birds, including puffins, gannets and guillemots that live on coastal cliffs.",
      "Environmental campaigning group Greenpeace expressed hope that the impact on local marine life may not be as bad as first feared.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not quite out of the danger zone yet, but it\u2019s starting to look like an environmental disaster may have been narrowly averted,\" said Dr. Paul Johnston from the Greenpeace Research Laboratories. \u201cWhen a container ship the length of a football pitch rams into a tanker carrying thousands of tons of jet fuel at 16 knots close to sensitive nature sites, the potential for serious harm is huge.\u201d",

      "The torso, believed to be from the 12th or 13th century, was discovered during a dig by a team of Cambodian and Indian experts last month at Angkor\u2019s Ta Prohm temple. It was found along with 29 fragments that appeared to be part of the same statue, archaeologist Neth Simon said this week.",
      "It stands at 1.16 meters (3 3/4 feet) tall and is in the Bayon art style, associated with Angkor\u2019s Bayon temple.",

      "The statue\u2019s presumed head was discovered at the same temple in 1927 during the French colonial era, and is currently kept at Cambodia\u2019s main National Museum in the capital Phnom Penh. Neth Simon said the torso was found about 50 meters (yards) away from the site where the head was discovered, and that an optical electronic scan confirmed they were a match.",
      "A near-complete reconstruction of the status is possible, Neth Simon added, now that only the right hand of the statue remains missing. Her team will ask the Minister of Culture and Fine Art for approval to reattach the head and body of the sculpture to make it whole for public display.",

      "LA MALBAIE, Canada -- Top diplomats from the Group of 7 industrialized democracies gathered in Canada on Thursday as U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s trade and foreign policies have thrown the bloc\u2019s once solid unity into disarray.",
      "The meeting began just minutes after Trump threatened to impose 200% tariffs on European wine and other alcohol if the European Union doesn\u2019t back down from retaliating against U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs with a levy on American whiskey.",
      "The escalating trade war adds to uncertainty over relations between the U.S. and its closest allies, which have already been strained by Trump\u2019s position on Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine.",
      "It also likely means U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio will hear a litany of complaints as he meets with the foreign ministers of Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan over the next two days.",
      "All of them have been angered by the new American president\u2019s policies, and the ministers smiled stiffly in frigid temperatures as they posed for a group photo at a snowy resort in La Malbaie, Quebec, on the St. Lawrence River.",
      "\u201cPeace and stability is at the top of our agenda, and I look forward discussing how we continue to support Ukraine in the face of Russia\u2019s illegal aggression,\u201d Canadian Foreign Minister M\u00e9lanie Joly said in brief remarks at the start of the meetings. \u201cOf course we want to foster long-term stability as well in the Middle East.\u201d",
      "Rubio met earlier with Joly, arriving in Quebec just hours after Trump\u2019s steel and aluminum tariffs kicked in \u2014 prompting responses from the European Union and Canada.",
      "En route to Canada from Saudi Arabia, where he had won agreement from Ukraine for a 30-day ceasefire in the war pending Russia's approval, Rubio dismissed suggestions that he would face an uncomfortable reception from this counterparts.",
      "But Joly, the host of the meeting, made clear that Canada, at least, would not back down. Trump has arguably been most antagonistic toward Canada with persistent talk of it becoming the 51st U.S. state, additional tariffs and repeated insults against its leadership.",
      "Ahead of the talks, Joly said that \"in every single meeting, I will raise the issue of tariffs to coordinate a response with the Europeans and to put pressure on the Americans.\u201d She noted that Trump \u201crepeated his disrespectful 51st state rhetoric.\u201d",
      "Rubio downplayed Trump's those comments, saying the president was only expressing what he thought would be a good idea.",
      "The G7 grouping \"is not a meeting about how we\u2019re going to take over Canada,\u201d Rubio said.",
      "On tariffs, Rubio said G7 partners should understand that these are a \u201cpolicy decision\u201d by Trump to protect American competitiveness.",
      "\u201cI think it is quite possible that we could do these things and at the same time deal in a constructive way with our allies and friends and partners on all the other issues that we work together on,\u201d Rubio told reporters Wednesday on a refueling stop in Ireland. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what I expect out of the G7 and Canada.\u201d",
      "Asked if he expected a difficult reception from his counterparts, Rubio brushed the question aside: \u201cI don\u2019t know, should I be? I mean, they\u2019ve invited us to come. We intend to go. The alternative is to not go. I think that would actually make things worse, not better.\u201d",
      "Rubio notably skipped a meeting of G20 foreign ministers \u2014 a bigger but less powerful group that includes developing nations \u2014 last month in South Africa because of his concerns that the agenda, which included climate change and diversity, did not align with Trump administration policies.",
      "The agenda for the G7 meeting includes discussions on China and the Indo-Pacific; Ukraine and Europe; stability in the Americas; the Middle East; maritime security; Africa; and China, North Korea, Iran and Russia.",
      "Rubio and Trump's national security adviser, Mike Waltz, had been in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, earlier in the week securing a potentially huge win for the administration \u2014 a possible ceasefire to end the Russia-Ukraine war, an issue that galvanized the G7 since even before the conflict began. Trump\u2019s special envoy Steve Witkoff arrived Thursday in Russia for talks with officials on the proposal.",
      "Armed with Ukraine\u2019s acceptance of the proposal for a 30-day ceasefire but still awaiting a Russian response, Rubio can expect cautiously optimistic responses from his fellow diplomats.",
      "Yet, Trump\u2019s apparent desire to draw Russian President Vladimir Putin back into the fold \u2014 including saying he would like to see Russia rejoin the group to restore it to the G8 \u2014 continues to alarm G7 members. They united behind Ukraine, with large amounts of military assistance and punishing economic sanctions against Moscow, after the invasion began in February 2022.",
      "Russia was thrown out of the G8 after it annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014.",
      "Among international groupings, the G7 \u2014 whose members, with the exception of Japan, are all NATO allies \u2014 had been the toughest on Russia.",
      "At the last G7 foreign ministers meeting before the 2022 invasion, members warned Russia in a joint statement in December 2021 of \u201cmassive consequences\u201d should it attack Ukraine. Three months later, they coordinated to impose sweeping financial, travel and other sanctions on Moscow.",
      "Since Trump's election, that appears to be changing, at least from the U.S. side.",
      "Rubio said his goal was not to antagonize Russia as it considers the ceasefire proposal \u201cby issuing statements that are abrasive in any way.\u201d He noted that all of the sanctions against Russia remain in place but that new threats of action could be counterproductive to getting Putin on board with the U.S. peace plan.",
      "That throws into question hopes that the G7 can unify around a common statement condemning Russia.",
      "Britain, along with France, has been spearheading efforts to set up a \u201ccoalition of the willing\u201d to help safeguard a future ceasefire in Ukraine, including with troops on the ground. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer \u2014 who has said the plan will only work with U.S. security guarantees to back it up \u2014 plans to host a virtual meeting of about two dozen countries Saturday to discuss progress.",
      "Rubio and other Trump administration officials have so far refused to endorse European peacekeepers.",
      "German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said G7 unity has been critical in ensuring that \u201cPutin to this day hasn\u2019t achieved his war aims in Ukraine.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe way to peace goes via strength and unity \u2014 a language that Putin understands,\u201d she said in a statement before the meeting.",

      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- An Emirati diplomat earlier identified by Tehran as carrying a letter from U.S. President Donald Trump seeking to jump-start talks over Iran's rapidly advancing nuclear program met Wednesday with Iran's foreign minister in the Iranian capital.",
      "It is unclear how Iran will react to the letter, which Trump revealed during a television interview last week. Its intended recipient, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has said he's not interested in talks with a \u201cbullying government.\u201d",
      "But Iran struggles with economic woes exacerbated by U.S. and Western sanctions over its nuclear program, and Trump has imposed more since he took office in January. That pressure, coupled with internal turmoil in Iran and recent direct attacks by Israel, has put Tehran in one of the most precarious positions its theocracy has faced since its 1979 Islamic Revolution.",
      "\u201cAmerica threatens with military action, but in my opinion, this threat is irrational,\u201d Khamenei said earlier Wednesday. \u201cIran is capable of delivering a reciprocal blow, and it will certainly do so.\u201d",
      "Iranian state television showed Emirati official Anwar Gargash meeting with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi in Tehran. Gargash's visit had not been previously announced. Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman earlier said he'd be carrying the letter from Trump. The UAE, home to Abu Dhabi and Dubai, maintains close ties with the United States.",
      "The brief footage shot before the meeting did not show the letter. Gargash and the UAE government did not immediately acknowledge his trip during the holy Muslim month of Ramadan.",
      "Trump last week acknowledged writing a letter to the 85-year-old Khamenei.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve written them a letter saying, \u2018I hope you\u2019re going to negotiate because if we have to go in militarily, it\u2019s going to be a terrible thing,'\u201d Trump said in the interview.",
      "Trump has offered no details on what, if anything, was specifically offered to Iran in the letter.",
      "The move recalled Trump\u2019s letter-writing to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in his first term, which led to face-to-face meetings but no deals to limit Pyongyang\u2019s atomic bombs and a missile program capable of reaching the continental U.S.",
      "The last time Trump tried to send a letter to Khamenei, through the late Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in 2019, the supreme leader mocked the effort. Abe ended up slipping the envelope under his leg in footage widely shared by Iranian state media to this day.",
      "On Wednesday before Gargash's arrival, Khamenei spoke to students during a ceremony in Tehran and called Trump's letter \"an attempt to deceive global public opinion.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis person tore apart and threw out of the window finished and completed, and signed, talks,\" Khamenei said. \u201cHow could one possibly negotiate with such a person?\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cIf we wanted to build a nuclear weapon, America couldn\u2019t stop us.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s overture comes as Israel and the United States have warned they will never let Iran acquire a nuclear weapon, leading to fears of a military confrontation as Tehran enriches uranium at near weapons-grade levels of 60% purity \u2014 something only done by atomic-armed nations.",
      "Iran has long maintained its program is for peaceful purposes, even as its officials increasingly threaten to pursue the bomb as tensions are high with the U.S. over its sanctions and with Israel as a shaky ceasefire holds in its war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip.",
      "Israel and Iran have traded direct attacks during the Israel-Hamas war, while partners in Tehran\u2019s self-described \u201cAxis of Resistance\u201d are reeling after the assassinations of their leaders by Israel. In Israel, officials have suggested striking Iran\u2019s nuclear program now, something Trump has threatened while insisting he\u2019d prefer reaching a diplomatic deal with Tehran.",
      "Since Trump returned to the White House, his administration has said Iran must be prevented from acquiring nuclear weapons. A report last month by the U.N.\u2019s nuclear watchdog said Iran has accelerated its production of near weapons-grade uranium.",
      "Trump\u2019s first term in office was marked by a particularly troubled period in relations with Tehran. In 2018, he unilaterally withdrew the United States from Iran\u2019s nuclear deal with world powers, leading to sanctions hobbling Iran\u2019s economy. Iran retaliated with attacks at sea \u2014 including one that it likely carried out and that temporarily halved Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil production.",
      "Trump also ordered the attack that killed Iran\u2019s top general in a Baghdad drone strike in January 2020.",
      "It is unclear how Iran will handle further pressure. The Islamic Republic\u2019s currency, the rial, has dramatically fallen in value. Unemployment and underemployment are rampant. Meanwhile, women have continued their defiance of laws on the mandatory headscarf, or hijab, and go without the head covering, two years after the death of a detained young woman, Mahsa Amini, sparked nationwide protests.",

      "The Bosnian Prosecutor\u2019s Office issued the order after Bosnian Serb President Milorad Dodik, Prime Minister Radovan Viskovic and Parliament Speaker Nenad Stevandic failed to answer two summons for questioning.",
      "The three are suspected of violating Bosnia\u2019s constitutional order with their policies, Bosnian media reported.",
      "Last month Bosnian Serb lawmakers passed a set of disputed laws that barred the central Bosnian state judiciary and police from operating in the Serb-controlled part of the country, called Republika Srpska.",

      "Dodik has repeatedly said he does not recognize the Bosnian prosecution office and will not go to Sarajevo for questioning. He dismissed the detention order at a press conference on Wednesday as \u201cnon-existent.\u201d",

      "Interior Minister Sinisa Karan said Bosnian Serb police will respect the new laws which barred the authority of Bosnia's prosecutor and other judicial institutions on the territory of Republika Srpska, roughly half of Bosnia.",
      "Karan said that \u201cno one will be arrested and all will be protected.\u201d",
      "The recent Bosnian Serb moves are seen as part of escalating efforts to break the territory away from Bosnia and have been condemned by the United States and the European Union. Dodik, who has faced U.S. and Bristish sanctions, is backed by Moscow.",
      "The assembly of Republika Srpska on Wednesday debated a new draft constitution that would advance the separation process even further by establishing its own army and allowing the entity to join a union with neighboring countries.",
      "It was not immediately clear what would happen next. Bosnia\u2019s state security agency known as SIPA has confirmed they were asked to assist in the detention of the three officials.",
      "In Banja Luka, the northwestern town that is the seat of the Bosnian Serb government, police could be seen deployed around the parliament building ahead of a session Wednesday.",
      "The latest tensions have raised fears of violent incidents between Bosnia\u2019s central security forces and the Serb police.",
      "They also recall separatist aspirations that sparked Bosnia's war in 1992. The conflict ended three years later in a U.S.-sponsored peace accord that created two administrations \u2014 one Bosnian Serb, the other Bosniak-Croat \u2014 that are tied together by joint central institutions.",
      "During a visit this week to Bosnia, NATO's Secretary General Mark Rutte pledged the Western military Alliance's support for Bosnia's integrity while a European peacekeeping force in Bosnia, EUFOR, stepped up the number of its troops."

      "Starmer\u2019s center-left party won a landslide election victory in July, ending 14 years of Conservative government. But polls suggest support for his Labour government has plummeted since then, as public services creak under record demand and economic growth remains stubbornly low.",
      "Last month, the government said it would boost defense spending from the current 2.3% of GDP to 2.5% by 2027, a move that will cost billions. That makes it likely the government will announce tax increases or spending cuts, or both, in its spring budget statement on March 26.",

But anti-poverty groups and advocates for the disabled worry they will cut support to some of society\u2019s most vulnerable people.",

      "The media have dubbed Starmer\u2019s plans \u201cProject Chainsaw,\u201d a nickname that evokes Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Starmer\u2019s office rejected what it called \u201cthat juvenile characterization.\u201d",
      "Mike Clancy, general secretary of the Prospect union, urged the government \u201cto avoid the incendiary rhetoric and tactics we are seeing in the United States, and to be clear that reforms are about enhancing and not undermining the civil service.\u201d",
      "Soon Starmer will return to the international realm amid deep uncertainty over Ukraine\u2019s future as Washington pushes to end the war. His careful diplomacy has seen Starmer \u2014 alongside French President Emmanuel Macron \u2014 work to assemble a \u201ccoalition of the willing\u201d to secure a future ceasefire, while striving to persuade Trump to maintain support for Kyiv.",
      "Starmer will convene leaders from around 25 countries for a conference call on Saturday to flesh out plans.",

      "The new Austrian government says it has decided to immediately stop family reunion procedures for migrants because the country is no longer able to absorb newcomers adequately",
      "VIENNA -- The new Austrian government said Wednesday that family reunion procedures for migrants will be immediately halted because the country is no longer able to absorb newcomers adequately.",
      "The measure is temporary and intended to ensure that those migrants who are already in the country can be better integrated, Chancellor Christian Stocker from the conservative Austrian People\u2019s Party said.",
      "\u201cAustria\u2019s capacities are limited, and that is why we have decided to prevent further overloading,\u201d Stocker said.",
      "The new measure means that migrants with so-called protected status \u2014 meaning they cannot be deported \u2014 are no longer allowed to bring family members still living in their home countries to Austria.",
      "The new three-party coalition made up of the People\u2019s Party, the center-left Social Democrats and the liberal Neos, has said that curbing migration is one of its top issues and vowed to implement strict new asylum rules.",
      "Official figures show that 7,762 people arrived in Austria last year as part of family reunion procedures for migrants. In 2023 the figure was 9,254. Most new arrivals were minors.",
      "Migrants who are still in the asylum process or have received a deportation order are not allowed in the first place to bring family members from their countries of origin.",
      "Most recent asylum seekers came from Syria and Afghanistan, the Austrian chancellery said in a statement.",
      "The European Union country has 9 million inhabitants.",
      "Stocker said the measure was necessary because \u201cthe quality of the school system, integration and ultimately the security of our entire systems need to be protected \u2014 so that we do not impair their ability to function.\u201d",
      "The government said it had already informed the EU of its new measures. It denied to say for how long it would put family reunions on hold.",
      "\u201cSince last summer, we have succeeded in significantly reducing family reunification,\" Interior Minister Gerhard Karner said. \"Now we are creating the legal basis to ensure this stop is sustainable.\u201d",
      "All over the continent, governments have been trying to cut the number of migrants. The clamp-down on migrants is a harsh turnaround from ten years ago, when countries like Germany and Sweden openly welcomed more than 1 million migrants from war-torn countries such as Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq.",
      "Many communities and towns in other countries, such as Germany, also say they no longer have capacities to find shelter or homes for migrants.",
      "The EU is trying to keep more migrants from entering its 27-country bloc and move faster to deport those whose asylum procedures are rejected.",
      "On Tuesday, the EU unveiled a new migration proposal that envisions the opening of so-called \u201creturn hubs\u201d to be set up in third countries to speed up the deportation for rejected asylum-seekers.",
      "So far, only 20% of people with a deportation order are effectively removed from EU territory, according to the European Commission.",
      "The commission has proposed a \u201cEuropean System for Returns\" that will set a standard for all 27 members of the bloc and allow national authorities from one country to enforce deportation orders issued by another. Such rules were missing from the EU\u2019s migration and asylum pact approved last year.",

      "A former Australian government secured an exemption with the previous Trump administration in 2018 based on arguments including that Australian steelmaker BlueScope employs thousands of workers in the U.S.",
      "Albanese said he would continue to pursue an Australian exemption. The 2018 exemption took several months to secure.",
      "\u201cIt has been foreshadowed that no country regardless of its relationship with the United States has been granted an exemption. Such a decision by the Trump administration is entirely unjustified,\u201d Albanese said.",
      "\u201cTariffs and escalating trade tensions are a form of economic self-harm and a recipe for slower growth and higher inflation. They are paid by the consumers. This is why Australia will not be imposing reciprocal tariffs on the United States,\u201d Albanese added.",
      "The U.S. officially increased tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports to 25% on Wednesday.",
      "The U.S. decision not to exempt Australia was announced days after a spat became public between Trump and the former Australian prime minister who secured the 2018 exemption, Malcolm Turnbull.",
      "Trump described Turnbull, who quit politics in 2018 after being overthrown as prime minister by his own government, as a weak and ineffective leader.",

      "\u201cI always thought he was a weak and ineffective leader and, obviously, Australian\u2019s (sic) agreed with me!!!\u201d Trump added.",
      "Trump was responding to an interview Turnbull gave this week to U.S. media company Bloomberg in which the former Australian leader said Chinese President Xi Jinping would take advantage of the U.S. president's chaotic and erratic leadership.",
      "\u201cI think China will take advantage, massive advantage of Trump,\u201d Turnbull told Bloomberg.",
      "\u201cWhat my prediction will be that President Xi will aim to be the exact opposite of Trump. Where Trump is chaotic, he will be consistent. Where Trump is rude and abusive, he\u2019ll be respectful. Where Trump is erratic, he will be consistent,\u201d Turnbull said.",
      "\u201cAnd what that will do is build trust with countries, and there\u2019ll be many countries who will, you know, looking at China on the one hand and Trump on the other, will find China a more attractive partner,\u201d Turnbull added."

      "Syria\u2019s interim president has signed a temporary constitution that leaves the country under Islamist rule for five years during a transitional phase",
      "DAMASCUS, Syria -- Syria's interim president on Thursday signed a temporary constitution that leaves the country under Islamist rule for five years during a transitional phase.",
      "The country's interim rulers have struggled to exert their authority across much of the country since the Islamist former insurgent group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, led a lightning insurgency that overthrew former leader Bashar Assad in December.",
      "Former HTS leader Ahmad Al-Sharaa is now the country's interim president \u2014 a decision that was announced after a meeting of the armed groups that took part in the offensive against Assad. At the same meeting, the groups agreed to repeal the country's old constitution and said a new one would be drafted.",
      "While many were happy to see an end to the Assad family\u2019s dictatorial rule of over 50 years in the war-torn country, religious and ethnic minorities have been skeptical of the new Islamist leaders and reluctant to allow Damascus under its new authorities to assert control of their areas.",
      "Abdulhamid Al-Awak, one of the seven members of the committee al-Sharaa tasked to draft the temporary constitution, told a press conference Thursday that it will maintain some previsions from the previous one, including the stipulation that the head of state has to be a Muslim, and Islamic law is the main source of jurisprudence.",
      "However, Al-Awak, a constitutional law expert who teaches at the Mardin Artuklu University in Turkey, also said the temporary constitution includes provisions that enshrine freedom of expression and the press. The constitution will \u201cbalance between social security and freedom\u201d during Syria's shaky political situation, he said.",
      "A new committee to draft a permanent constitution will be formed, but it is unclear if it will be more inclusive of Syria's political, religious, and ethnic groups.",
      "Al-Sharaa on Monday reached a landmark pact with the U.S.-backed Kurdish-led authorities in northeastern Syria, including a ceasefire and a merging of their armed forces with the central government's security agencies.",
      "The deal came after government forces and allied groups crushed an insurgency launched last week by gunmen loyal to Assad. Rights groups say that hundreds of civilians \u2014 mostly from the Alawite minority sect to which Assad belongs \u2014were killed in retaliatory attacks by factions in the counter-offensive.",
      "A key goal of the interim constitution was to give a timeline for the country\u2019s political transition out of its interim phase. In December, Al-Sharaa said it could take up to three years to rewrite Syria\u2019s constitution and up to five years to organize and hold elections.",
      "Al-Sharaa appointed a committee to draft the new constitution after Syria held a national dialogue conference last month, which called for announcing a temporary constitution and holding interim parliamentary elections. Critics said the hastily-organized conference was not inclusive of Syria's different ethnic and sectarian groups or civil society.",
      "The United States and Europe have been hesitant to lift harsh sanctions imposed on Syria during Assad's rule until they are convinced that the new leaders will create an inclusive political system and protect minorities. Al-Sharaa and regional governments have been urging them to reconsider, fearing that the country's crumbling economy could bring further instability.",

      "The warning from the Houthis again throws into chaos a crucial maritime waterway between Asia and Europe, threatens revenue from Egypt's Suez Canal and possibly will halt aid shipments to war zones. The rebels in the past have also had a loose definition of what constitutes an Israeli ship, meaning other vessels could be targeted as well.",

      "\u201cWe hope it is understood that the actions taken by the (Houthi military) ... stem from a deep sense of religious, humanitarian and moral responsibility toward the oppressed Palestinian people and aim to pressure the Israeli usurper entity to reopen the crossings to the Gaza Strip and allow the entry of aid, including food and medical supplies,\u201d the statement said.",
      "It described the warning as taking hold in the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden, the Bab el-Mandeb Strait and the Arabian Sea.",

      "There was no immediate sign of an attack on ships. Israel's military did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Israel earlier this month halted all aid coming into the Gaza Strip and has warned of \u201cadditional consequences\u201d for Hamas if the fragile ceasefire in the war isn\u2019t extended as negotiations continue over starting a second phase of the pause in fighting. The move drew intense international criticism as even before the war the over 2 million Palestinians living in Gaza relied on international aid, something that's only intensified after a grinding Israeli military offensive destroyed the enclave.",
      "The maritime security firm Ambrey warned the statements from the Houthis were \u201cambiguous,\u201d likely putting more ships at risk.",
      "It's \u201clikely to have extended once more toward ships partially owned by Israeli individuals or entities, vessels managed and/or operated by Israeli individuals or entities, vessels heading to Israel and to ships of companies that call Israel,\u201d the firm said.",
      "There was no direct threat made against the U.S. Navy, whose Bahrain-based 5th Fleet patrols the Mideast. However, the earlier Houthi campaign saw American and Western warships repeatedly targeted, sparking the most-serious combat the Navy had seen since World War II.",
      "The aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman and other ships associated with its carrier group are operating in the Red Sea now. The U.S. military said Wednesday that its forces in the region \u201cremain vigilant.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe will do what is necessary to protect and defend U.S. personnel, assets and partners,\u201d it said.",
      "The rebels\u2019 secretive leader, Abdul-Malik al-Houthi, warned Friday that attacks against Israel-linked vessels would resume within four days if Israel didn\u2019t let aid into Gaza. That deadline passed Tuesday.",
      "The rebels had targeted over 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two vessels and killing four sailors during their campaign targeting ships from November 2023 until January of this year.",
      "The attacks greatly raised the Houthis' profile as they faced economic problems and launched a crackdown targeting any dissent and aid workers at home amid Yemen's decadelong stalemated war that's torn apart the Arab world's poorest nation."

      "Trump was asked about the market after a selloff Monday and more trembling on the markets Tuesday. \u201cMarkets are going to go up and they\u2019re going to go down. We have to rebuild our country,\" he said.",
      "In response to a question about whether his tariffs caused the turmoil in the markets, Trump said: \u201cBiden gave us a horrible economy. He gave us horrible inflation. And I think the market was going to go very, very bad. If anything, I have a lot of very smart people, friends of mine, and great businessmen. They're not investing because of what I've done.\u201d",
      "On whether he thinks there will be a recession: \u201cI don't see it at all. I think this country's going to boom. But as I said, I can do it the easy way or the hard way. The hard way to do it is exactly what I'm doing, but the results are going to be 20 times greater. Remember, Trump is always right.\u201d"

Then, the Chinese foreign minister blasted the U.S. for responding to Beijing's goodwill with tariffs. And this week, Chinese officials expressed their indignation at a rare background briefing with journalists.",
      "\u201cIn the spirit of humanity, China assisted the U.S. in various ways,\u201d Foreign Minister Wang Yi told journalists last week in an annual appearance before the media. \"The U.S. should not meet good with evil or even impose arbitrary tariffs. No responsible major country should do that.\u201d",
      "Trump cited the fentanyl issue as the reason for imposing a 10% tariff on all Chinese imports in early February, on top of any existing duties. He doubled that to 20% earlier this month. He also has cited fentanyl, along with other reasons, for imposing tariffs on Canada and Mexico.",

      "The Chinese government hit back both times Trump imposed tariffs with its own duties on selected U.S. products and other measures aimed at American companies. Analysts have described the response as a measured one designed to try to avoid an escalation of the trade war, which could deal a blow to an already sluggish Chinese economy.",
      "The government's report on its fentanyl-related actions said that China and the U.S. have held multiple high-level meetings since early last year to promote cooperation, and that its Narcotics Control Bureau holds regular exchanges with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency.",

In August of that year, a visit to Taiwan by a top U.S. legislator, then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, angered China, and the government responded by cutting off talks on a range of issues including drug control.",
      "A rapprochement in late 2023, negotiated over several months, led to a meeting on fentanyl in January of last year. Drug enforcement, like climate, was held up as an area where the two countries could cooperate despite growing differences and their military, economic and technological competition.",
      "Now Trump, back in the White House after a four-year hiatus, is trying to shift the playing field in the U.S.-China relationship. So far, China has indicated it won't blink.",

      "\u201cIt has been foreshadowed that no country regardless of its relationship with the United States has been granted an exemption. Such a decision by the Trump administration is entirely unjustified,\u201d Albanese said.",
      "\u201cTariffs and escalating trade tensions are a form of economic self-harm and a recipe for slower growth and higher inflation. They are paid by the consumers. This is why Australia will not be imposing reciprocal tariffs on the United States,\u201d Albanese added.",

He told reporters that Moscow is awaiting \u201cdetailed information\u201d about it from the U.S. and suggested that Russia must get that first before it can take a position.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that the 30-day ceasefire would allow the sides \u201cto fully prepare a step-by-step plan for ending the war, including security guarantees for Ukraine.\u201d",
      "Technical questions over how to effectively monitor a truce along the roughly 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line, where small but deadly drones are a common sight, are \u201cvery important,\u201d Zelenskyy told reporters in Kyiv on Wednesday.",
      "Arms deliveries to Ukraine have already resumed through a Polish logistics center, the foreign ministers of Ukraine and Poland announced Wednesday. The deliveries go through a NATO and U.S. hub in the eastern Polish city of Rzeszow that\u2019s has been used to ferry Western weapons into neighboring Ukraine about 70 kilometers (45 miles) away.",
      "The American military help is vital for Ukraine\u2019s shorthanded and weary army, which is having a tough time keeping Russia\u2019s bigger military force at bay. But for Moscow, more American aid spells potentially more difficulty in achieving its war aims and likely will be a tough sell in Moscow for Washington\u2019s peace efforts.",
      "U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Wednesday that Washington will pursue \u201cmultiple points of contacts\u201d with Russia to see if President Vladimir Putin is ready to negotiate an end to the war. He declined to give details.",
      "\u201cThe ball is truly in their court,\u201d Rubio said at a refueling stopover in Shannon, Ireland on his way to talks in Canada with other Group of Seven leading industrialized nations.",
      "Rubio said he hoped to see Russia stop attacks on Ukraine within the next few days as a first step.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t think it\u2019s constructive to stand here today and say what we\u2019re going to do if Russia says no,\u201d Rubio said, adding he wanted to avoid statements about Russia that \u201care abrasive in any way.\u201d",
      "His comments came amid intensifying Russian effort to push Ukrainian forces out of its Kursk region that has yielded breakthroughs in recent days, Ukrainian soldiers told The Associated Press. The fighting has escalated as ceasefire talks come to a head, with Moscow intent on taking back its territory and Kyiv determined to hold onto it as a bargaining chip in any negotiations.",
      "Ukrainian forces made a daring raid into the Russian region last August in the first foreign occupation of Russian territory since World War II. They have held on despite intense pressure from tens of thousands of Russian and North Korean troops.",
      "Recent fighting reportedly has focused on the Kursk town of Sudzha, which is a key Ukrainian supply hub and operational base. Ukrainian soldiers said the situation is dynamic and fighting continues in and around the town, but three of them conceded Russian forces were making headway.",
      "Russian state news agencies RIA Novosti and Tass reported Wednesday that the Russian military have entered Sudzha. It wasn't possible to independently verify either side's claims.",
      "Inside Ukraine, Russian ballistic missiles killed at least five civilians, officials said Wednesday,",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump wants to end the three-year war and pressured Zelenskyy to enter talks. The suspension of U.S. assistance came days after Zelenskyy and Trump argued about the conflict in a tense White House meeting.",
      "Rubio, who led the American delegation to Tuesday's talks in Saudi Arabia, said Washington would present the ceasefire offer to the Kremlin, which has so far opposed anything short of a permanent end to the conflict and hasn't accepted any concessions.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to tell (the Russians) this is what\u2019s on the table. Ukraine is ready to stop shooting and start talking. And now it\u2019ll be up to them to say yes or no,\u201d Rubio told reporters after the talks. \u201cIf they say no, then we\u2019ll unfortunately know what the impediment is to peace here.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, is expected to travel this week to Moscow, where he could meet with Putin, according to a person familiar with the matter but not authorized to comment publicly. The person cautioned that scheduling could change.",
      "Russian lawmakers signaled wariness about the prospect of a ceasefire.",
      "\u201cRussia is advancing (on the battlefield), so it will be different with Russia,\u201d senior Russian senator Konstantin Kosachev noted in a post on the messaging app Telegram.",
      "\u201cAny agreements (with the understanding of the need for compromise) should be on our terms, not American,\u201d Kosachev wrote.",

      "The European Union has announced retaliatory trade action with new duties on U.S. industrial and farm products",
      "BRUSSELS -- The European Union on Wednesday announced retaliatory trade action with new duties on U.S. industrial and farm products, responding within hours to the Trump administration's increase in tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports to 25%.",
      "The world\u2019s biggest trading bloc was expecting the U.S. tariffs and prepared in advance, but the measures still place great strain on already tense trans-Atlantic relations. Only last month, Washington warned Europe that it would have to take care of its own security in the future.",
      "The EU measures will cover goods from the United States worth around 26 billion euros ($28 billion), and not just steel and aluminum products, but also textiles, home appliances and agricultural goods. Motorcycles, bourbon, peanut butter and jeans will also be hit, as they were during U.S. President Donald Trump's first term.",
      "The EU duties aim for pressure points in the U.S. while minimizing additional damage to Europe. EU officials have made clear that the tariffs \u2014 taxes on imports \u2014 are aimed at products made in Republican-held states, such as beef and poultry from Kansas and Nebraska and wood products from Alabama and Georgia. Yet the tariffs will also hit blue states such as Illinois, the No. 1 U.S. producer of soybeans, which is also on the list.",
      "Spirits producers have in essence become collateral damage in the dispute over steel and aluminum. The EU move \u201cis deeply disappointing and will severely undercut the successful efforts to rebuild U.S. spirits exports in EU countries,\u201d said Chris Swonger, head of the Distilled Spirits Council. The EU is a major destination for U.S. whiskey, with exports surging 60% in the past three years after an earlier set of tariffs was suspended.",
      "European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement that the bloc \u201cwill always remain open to negotiation.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs the U.S. are applying tariffs worth 28 billion dollars, we are responding with countermeasures worth 26 billion euros,\u201d she said. The commission manages trade and commercial conflicts on behalf of the 27 EU member countries.",
      "\u201cWe firmly believe that in a world fraught with geopolitical and economic uncertainties, it is not in our common interest to burden our economies with tariffs,\u201d von der Leyen said.",
      "Trump said that his taxes would help create U.S. factory jobs, but von der Leyen said: \u201cJobs are at stake. Prices will go up. In Europe and in the United States.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe deeply regret this measure. Tariffs are taxes. They are bad for business, and even worse for consumers. These tariffs are disrupting supply chains. They bring uncertainty for the economy,\u201d she said.",
      "The American Chamber of Commerce to the EU said the U.S. tariffs and EU countermeasures \u201cwill only harm jobs, prosperity and security on both sides of the Atlantic.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe two sides must de-escalate and find a negotiated outcome urgently,\u201d the chamber said Wednesday.",
      "Trump slapped similar tariffs on EU steel and aluminum during his first term in office, which enraged European and other allies. The EU also imposed countermeasures in retaliation at the time, raising tariffs on U.S.-made motorcycles, bourbon, peanut butter and jeans, among other items.",
      "This time, the EU action will involve two steps. First on April 1, the commission will reintroduce what it calls \u201crebalancing measures,\u201d which the EU had from 2018 and 2020, but which were suspended under the Biden administration. Then on April 13 come the additional duties targeting 18 billion euros ($19.6 billion) in U.S. exports to the bloc.",
      "EU Trade Commissioner Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d traveled to Washington last month in an effort to head off the tariffs, meeting with U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and other top trade officials.",
      "He said on Wednesday that it became clear during the trip \u201cthat the EU is not the problem.\"",
      "\u201cI argued to avoid the unnecessary burden of measures and countermeasures, but you need a partner for that. You need both hands to clap,\u201d \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d told reporters at the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France.",
      "The EU could lose up to 3.7 million tons of steel exports, according to the European steel association Eurofer. The U.S. is the second-biggest export market for EU steel producers, representing 16% of the total EU steel exports.",
      "The EU estimates that annual trade volume between both sides stands at about $1.5 trillion, representing around 30% of global trade. While the bloc has a substantial export surplus in goods, it says that is partly offset by the U.S. surplus in the trade of services.",

      "LONDON -- A lawyer argued Thursday that global mining giant BHP Group should be held liable for Brazil\u2019s worst environmental disaster 10 years ago when a dam collapse poured tons of toxic mining waste into a major waterway that killed 19 people and devastated villages.",
      "High Court Justice Finola O\u2019Farrell said she would rule later in the class action case in which claimants are seeking 36 billion pounds ($47 billion) in damages from Australia-based BHP. The case was filed in Britain because one of BHP\u2019s two main legal entities was based in London at the time.",

      "\u201cAs a result of its heavy involvement in Samarco\u2019s operations, BHP had many opportunities to avert disaster but failed to do so and instead kept allowing and encouraging the dam to be raised by constantly pushing for ever greater production by Samarco,\u201d attorney Alain Choo Choy said in his closing argument.",
      "A defense lawyer had argued that BHP did not own or operate the Fundao dam and the company was not responsible for the pollution. The company also said a deadline to bring the claims had expired before the lawsuit was filed on behalf of 600,000 Brazilians.",

      "A lawyer for the Federal Trade Commission says the agency needs to seek a trial delay in a case against Amazon due to staffing and budgetary challenges",
      "The Federal Trade Commission asked a federal judge on Wednesday to delay a trial in a case accusing Amazon of using deceptive practices in its Prime subscription program, citing staffing and budgetary challenges at the government agency.",
      "Jonathan Cohen, a lawyer for the FTC, made the request before U.S. District Judge John Chun, who is overseeing the legal proceedings from a 2023 lawsuit the commission filed against the e-commerce giant in Washington state.",
      "\u201cOur resource constraints are severe and really unique to this moment,\u201d Cohen said during a status hearing on Wednesday. \u201cWe have lost employees in the agency, in our division and on the case team.\u201d",
      "When the judge asked if the agency\u2019s challenges were due to recent cuts in the federal government, Cohen said it was, adding that some employees chose to leave the FTC following the \u201cFork in the road\u201d email sent by Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency in January. Staff members who resigned for other reasons also have not been replaced due to a government hiring freeze, he said.",
      "The Amazon trial had been scheduled to start in September. The FTC is seeking to relax some of the deadlines in the case and a delay akin to a two-month continuance. The agency does not want to \u201cmove the trial back more than a couple of months,\u201d Cohen said.",
      "Currently, the agency's legal team is \u201cracing at considerable cost\u201d to meet a late April deadline for discovery while at the same time dealing with restrictive rules on purchasing court documents and travel, Cohen explained.",
      "Other factors could hamper staffers' preparations for the trial, he said. In April, FTC employees will have to spend time packing up and vacating their office building so they can potentially move into \u201can abandoned USAID facility,\u201d Cohen said.",
      "Chun, the judge, asked how \u201cthings are going to be different in two months\u201d with the issues the agency is experiencing.",
      "Cohen responded by saying he \u201ccannot guarantee if things won\u2019t be even worse.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut there are a lot of reasons to believe ... we have been through the brunt of it, at least for a while,\u201d he said.",
      "During the hearing, John Hueston, an attorney representing Amazon, pushed back on the agency's request. He said most of the FTC attorneys assigned to the Amazon case were still employed by the agency.",
      "Even in the case of staff turnover, the government still lacks the grounds to seek a delay since changes in legal teams happen often, Hueston argued. Amazon executives and trial lawyers already cleared their schedules for a September trial, and the company has wanted to clear its name for more than two years, he said.",
      "\u201cWe really want to keep the date\" for the trial, Hueston said.",
      "The lawsuit, which was brought under former FTC Chair Lina Khan, alleged Amazon had enrolled consumers in the Prime program without consent and made it difficult for them to cancel their subscriptions.",
      "The agency filed the case months before it submitted an antitrust lawsuit against the retail and technology company, accusing it of having monopolistic control over online markets. Attorneys for that case, which is scheduled to go to trial in October 2026, presented economic arguments in court last week.",
      "Like other tech companies, Amazon has been attempting to forge friendlier ties with President Donald Trump, who repeatedly criticized the company during his first term.",
      "In December, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos said he was \u201coptimistic\u201d about Trump's second term. The same month, the company said it would donate $1 million to Trump's inauguration fund. Bezos, along with other tech leaders, was also a guest at the inauguration.",
      "This week, Amazon's Prime Video service began streaming \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d the long-running TV show that boosted Trump's profile before he ran for president. The company is also working on a documentary that offers an \u201cunprecedented behind-the-scenes look\u201d into the life of first lady Melania Trump.",

      "President Donald Trump is openly challenging U.S. allies by increasing tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports to 25% as he vows to take back wealth he says was \u201cstolen\u201d by other countries, drawing quick retaliation from Europe and Canada",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump openly challenged U.S. allies on Wednesday by increasing tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports to 25% as he vowed to take back wealth \u201cstolen\u201d by other countries, drawing quick retaliation from Europe and Canada.",
      "The Republican president's use of tariffs to extract concessions from other nations points toward a possibly destructive trade war and a stark change in America\u2019s approach to global leadership. It also has destabilized the stock market and stoked anxiety about an economic downturn.",
      "\u201cThe United States of America is going to take back a lot of what was stolen from it by other countries and, frankly, by incompetent U.S. leadership,\u201d Trump told reporters on Wednesday. \u201cWe\u2019re going to take back our wealth, and we\u2019re going to take back a lot of the companies that left.\u201d",
      "Trump removed all exemptions from his 2018 tariffs on the metals, in addition to increasing the tariffs on aluminum from 10%. His moves, based off a February directive, are part of a broader effort to disrupt and transform global commerce.",
      "He has separate tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China, with plans to also tax imports from the European Union, Brazil and South Korea by charging \u201creciprocal\u201d rates starting on April 2.",
      "The EU announced its own countermeasures on Wednesday. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that as the United States was \u201capplying tariffs worth 28 billion dollars, we are responding with countermeasures worth 26 billion euros,\u201d or about $28 billion. Those measures, which cover not just steel and aluminum products but also textiles, home appliances and agricultural goods, are due to take effect on April 1.",
      "U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer responded by saying that the EU was punishing America instead of fixing what he viewed as excess capacity in steel and aluminum production.",
      "\u201cThe EU\u2019s punitive action completely disregards the national security imperatives of the United States \u2013 and indeed international security \u2013 and is yet another indicator that the EU\u2019s trade and economic policies are out of step with reality,\u201d he said in a statement.",
      "Meeting on Wednesday with Ireland\u2019s Taoiseach Miche\u00e1l Martin, Trump said \u201cof course\u201d he wants to respond to EU's retaliations and \u201cof course\u201d Ireland is taking advantage of the United States.",
      "\u201cThe EU was set up in order to take advantage of the United States,\u201d Trump said.",
      "Canada sees itself as locked in a trade war under the pretext that its center for fentanyl smuggling and that its natural resources and factories subtract from the U.S. economy instead of supporting it.",
      "\u201cThis is going to be a day to day fight. This is now the second round of unjustified tariffs leveled against Canada,\u201d said M\u00e9lanie Joly, Canada's foreign affairs minister. \u201cThe latest excuse is national security despite the fact that Canada\u2019s steel and aluminum adds to America\u2019s security. All the while there is a threat of further and broader tariffs on April 2 still looming. The excuse for those tariffs shifts every day.\u201d",
      "Canada is the largest foreign supplier of steel and aluminum to the United States and plans to impose retaliatory tariffs of Canadian $29.8 billion ($20.7 billion) starting Thursday in response to the U.S. taxes on the metals.",
      "Canada's new tariffs would be on steel and aluminum products, as well as U.S. goods including computers, sports equipment and water heaters worth $14.2 billion Canadian ($9.9 billion). That's in addition to the 25% counter tariffs on $30 billion Canadian (US$20.8 billion) of imports from the U.S. that were put in place on March 4 in response to other Trump import taxes that he\u2019s partially delayed by a month.",
      "Trump told CEOs in the Business Roundtable a day earlier that the tariffs were causing companies to invest in U.S. factories. The 8% drop in the S&P 500 stock index over the past month on fears of deteriorating growth appears unlikely to dissuade him, as Trump argued that higher tariff rates would be more effective at bringing back factories.",
      "\u201cThe higher it goes, the more likely it is they\u2019re going to build,\u201d Trump told the group. \u201cThe biggest win is if they move into our country and produce jobs. That\u2019s a bigger win than the tariffs themselves, but the tariffs are going to be throwing off a lot of money to this country.\u201d",
      "Trump on Tuesday had threatened to put tariffs of 50% on steel and aluminum from Canada, but he chose to stay with the 25% rate after the province of Ontario suspended plans to put a surcharge on electricity sold to Michigan, Minnesota and New York.",
      "Democratic lawmakers dismissed Trump's claims that his tariffs are about national security and drug smuggling, saying they're actually about generating revenues to help cover the cost of his planned income tax cuts for the wealthy.",
      "\u201cDonald Trump knows his policies could wreck the economy, but he\u2019s doing it anyway,\u201d said Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York. \u201cWhy are they doing all these crazy things that Americans don\u2019t like? One reason, and one reason alone: tax breaks for billionaires, the north star of the Republican party\u2019s goals.",
      "In many ways, the president is addressing what he perceives as unfinished business from his first term. Trump meaningfully increased tariffs, but the revenues collected by the federal government were too small to significantly increase overall inflationary pressures.",
      "Outside forecasts by the Yale University Budget Lab, Tax Policy Center and others suggest that U.S. families would have the costs of the taxes passed onto them in the form of higher prices.",
      "With Wednesday's tariffs on steel and aluminum, Trump is seeking to remedy his original 2018 import taxes that were eroded by exemptions.",
      "After Canada and Mexico agreed to his demand for a revamped North American trade deal in 2020, they avoided the import taxes on the metals. Other U.S. trading partners had import quotas supplant the tariffs. And the first Trump administration also allowed U.S. companies to request exemptions from the tariffs if, for instance, they couldn\u2019t find the steel they needed from domestic producers.",
      "While Trump's tariffs could help steel and aluminum plants in the United States, they could raise prices for the manufacturers that use the metals as raw materials.",
      "Moreover, economists have found, the gains to the steel and aluminum industries were more than offset by the cost they imposed on \u201cdownstream\u2019\u2019 manufacturers that use their products.",
      "At these downstream companies, production fell by nearly $3.5 billion because of the tariffs in 2021, a loss that exceeded the $2.3 billion uptick in production that year by aluminum producers and steelmakers, the U.S. International Trade Commission found in 2023.",
      "Trump sees the tariffs as leading to more domestic factories, and the White House has noted that Volvo, Volkswagen and Honda are all exploring an increase to their U.S. footprint. But the prospect of higher prices, fewer sales and lower profits might cause some companies to refrain from investing in new facilities.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re an executive in the boardroom, are you really going to tell your board it\u2019s the time to expand that assembly line?\u201d said John Murphy, senior vice president at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.",
      "The top steel exporters to the U.S. are Canada, Mexico, Brazil, South Korea and Japan, with exports from Taiwan and Vietnam growing at a fast pace, according to the International Trade Administration. Imports from China, the world's largest steel producer, account for only a small fraction of what the U.S. buys.",
      "The lion's share of U.S. aluminum imports comes from Canada."

      "Struggling chipmaker Intel has hired former board member and semiconductor industry veteran Lip-Bu Tan as the latest in a succession of CEOs to attempt to turn around a once-dominant company that helped define Silicon Valley.",
      "Tan, 65, will take over the daunting job next Tuesday, more than three months after Intel's previous CEO, Pat Gelsinger, abruptly retired amid a deepening downturn that triggered massive layoffs and raised questions about the chipmaker's ability to survive as an independent company.",
      "This won't be Tan's first time running a semiconductor company, nor his first association with Intel. He spent more than a decade as CEO of Cadence Design Systems, which makes software that helps designs processors, and joined Intel's board of directors in 2022 before stepping down last August. Tan will rejoin Intel's board in addition to becoming CEO.",
      "\u201cLip-Bu is an exceptional leader whose technology industry expertise, deep relationships across the product and foundry ecosystems, and proven track record of creating shareholder value is exactly what Intel needs in its next CEO,\u201d Intel's interim Executive Chairman Frank Yeary said.",
      "Intel has been led by interim co-CEOs, David Zinsner and Michelle Johnston Holthaus, since Gelsinger walked away from a job that he undertook in February 2021.",
      "Although Gelsinger arrived at Intel amid high hopes, his tenure was a major letdown as Intel's stock price plunged 60%, wiping out $160 billion in shareholder wealth. Leading up to his departure last year, Intel laid of 17,500 of its employees \u2014 about 15% of its workforce \u2014 and suspended its dividend to save money on its way to an annual loss of $19 billion.",
      "More recently, Intel delayed the opening of two new chip factories i n Ohio to ensure the projects are completed in a \u201cfinancially responsible manner.\u201d The project is supposed to draw upon the $7.8 billion in funding earmarked for Intel in the CHIPS Incentives Program created during the administration of President Joe Biden.",
      "It was the latest sign of distress for Intel, a Santa Clara, California, company that helped launch Silicon Valley by developing the microprocessors that enabled the personal computer revolution under the leadership of its CEO at that time, Andy Grove.",
      "But as its leadership changed Intel missed the technological shift to mobile computing triggered by Apple's 2007 release of the iPhone, and it's lagged more nimble chipmakers. Intel's troubles have been magnified since the advent of artificial intelligence \u2014 a booming field where the chips made by once-smaller rival Nvidia have become tech's hottest commodity.",
      "Nvida now boasts a market value of $2.8 trillion compared to Intel's $90 billion. Intel's stock price rose more than 10% in Wednesday's extended trading after Tan's hiring was announced, indicating investors believe he will revive the company's fortunes.",
      "While Tan was Cadence Design's CEO from January 2009 to May 2021, the company's stock price increased by 44-fold.",
      "Tan's past accomplishments resulted him being named winner of the Semiconductor Industry Association's 2022 Robert Noyce Award \u2014 an honor named after one of Intel's co-founders.",

      "SAN DIEGO -- Lawyers representing four Indonesian fishermen who say they were beaten and trapped on vessels that were part of the global supply chain that provided tuna to Bumble Bee Seafoods filed a lawsuit Wednesday against the canned seafood giant.",
      "It is believed to be the first such case of forced labor at sea brought against a U.S. seafood company, the men\u2019s lawyer, Agnieszka Fryszman, said.",
      "U.S. companies that benefit from forced labor and undercut other businesses need to be held accountable, Fryszman said.",
      "\u201cWhat you see is really devastating,\u201d she said.",
      "The lawsuit accuses the company headquartered in San Diego of violating the Trafficking Victims Protection Act. The law allows foreigners who suffered from human trafficking to sue U.S. businesses that knew or should have known that they were profiting from forced labor.",
      "Bumble Bee did not immediately respond to an email from The Associated Press requesting comment.",
      "The fisherman are all from villages in Indonesia and worked for longline vessels owned by Chinese companies from which Bumble Bee sourced its albacore tuna, according to the lawsuit. They say they were beaten regularly by their captains.",
      "One fisherman named Akhmad, who like many Indonesians uses only one name, said he was hit by a metal hook and forced to work even after being injured on the job by a load of fish that gashed open his leg to the bone. Another fisherman, Syafi\u2019i, said he received no medical care for severe burns and was ordered to return to work to pay to eat. All the men said they asked to go home and even tried to go on strike on board, according to the lawsuit.",
      "The boats stayed out at sea while supply ships provided provisions and collected the catch. The men were strapped with debt from food bills and other fees and the threat of fines if they quit, Fryszman said.",
      "Bumble Bee had been warned of inhumane conditions in its supply chain over the years. In 2020, accounts of abusive conditions and forced labor prompted the U.S. to halt imports from a Taiwan-based fishing vessel that reportedly supplied the global tuna trading company that acquired Bumble Bee Seafoods that same year. None of these fishermen worked on that vessel.",
      "The lawsuit seeks compensation for their unpaid wages and abuse, Fryszman said. The men are also seeking systemic changes, she said. For example, they want companies like Bumble Bee to require in their contracts that the vessels in their supply chain bring in their catch rather than remain out at sea, and have medical care on board and Wi-Fi service for workers to get help.",
      "The global fishing industry has been plagued by labor abuses for years, with workers subjected to brutal treatment often with little or no pay. Congress approved legislation providing the agency with additional authority to crack down on forced labor in 2016 after an Associated Press investigation found that seafood caught by slaves in Southeast Asia was ending up in restaurants and markets around the United States.",
      "In 2018, Fryszman represented two Indonesian fishermen who said they were enslaved on an American fishing boat. They settled their lawsuit for an undisclosed amount against the vessel\u2019s California-based owner seven years after escaping and receiving special U.S. visas as victims of human trafficking."

      "The U.S. president has given a variety of explanations for his antagonism of Canada. He has said that his separate 25% tariffs on all imports from Canada, some of which have been suspended for a month, are about fentanyl smuggling and objections to Canada putting high taxes on dairy imports that penalize U.S. farmers. He also continued to call for Canada to become part of the United States.",

      "Miuccia Prada acknowledged interest in the brand on the sidelines of Milan Fashion Week last month, while Versace made no comment at what was to be her last runway show. Versace, 69, took over as creative director in 1997, after her brother\u2019s murder in Miami.",
      "Capri Holding\u2019s statement made no mention of any plans to sell Versace, but the arrival of a designer from Miu Miu is only likely to fuel speculation of a possible deal.",
      "Versace CEO John D. Idol said in a statement that the creative shift was \u201cpart of a thoughtful succession plan for Versace.\u201d He called Vitale \u201ca strong leader,\u2019\u2019 and expressed confidence that \u201chis talent and vision will be instrumental to Versace\u2019s future growth.\u201d",
      "As chief brand ambassador, Versace \u201cwill continue to champion the Versace brand and its values,\u2019\u2019 Idol said.",
      "Versace said she was \u201cthrilled\u201d as a champion of the next generation of designers that Vitale would join Versace and that she was \u201cexcited'' to see the brand her brother founded in 1978 \"through new eyes.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt has been the greatest honor of my life to carry on my brother Gianni\u2019s legacy. He was the true genius, but I hope to have some of his spirit and tenacity,\u2019\u2019 she said in a statement. \u201cIn my new role as chief brand ambassador, I will remain Versace\u2019s most passionate supporter. Versace is in my DNA and always in my heart.\u2019\u2019",
      "Versace represented 20% of Capri Holdings 2024 revenue of 5.2 billion euros. Capri recently laid out strategic plans to rebalance the Versace portfolio to return the brand to its more daring roots, increase sales of accessories and win back entry-level consumers put off by a post-pandemic focus on higher net-worth clients."

    "story": [
      "A more than 40-mile long conveyor belt filled with sand stretches from the oil fields of West Texas to New Mexico, all for the purpose of one mission: oil production",
      "KERMIT, Texas -- It's longer than the width of Rhode Island, snakes across the oil fields of the southwest U.S. and crawls at 10 mph \u2013 too slow for a truck and too long for a train.",
      "It's a new sight: the longest conveyer belt in America.",
      "Atlas Energy Solutions, a Texas-based oil field company, has installed a 42-mile long (67 kilometers) conveyer belt to transport millions of tons of sand for hydraulic fracturing. The belt the company named \u201cThe Dune Express\u201d runs from tiny Kermit, Texas, and across state borders into Lea County, New Mexico. Tall and lanky with lids that resemble solar modules, the steel structure could almost be mistaken for a roller coaster.",
      "In the remote West Texas, there are few people to marvel at the unusual machine in Kermit, a city with a population of less than 6,000, where the sand is typically hauled by tractor-trailers. During fracking, liquid is pumped into the ground at a high pressure to create holes, or fractures, that release oil. The sand helps keep the holes open as water, oil and gas flow through it.",
      "But moving the sand by truck is usually a long and potentially dangerous process, according to CEO John Turner. He said massive trucks moving sand and other industrial goods are a common site in the oil-rich Permian Basin and pose a danger to other drivers.",
      "\u201cPretty early on, the delivery of sand via truck was not only inefficient, it was dangerous,\u201d he said.",
      "The conveyor belt, with a freight capacity of 13 tons (11.79 metric tonnes), was designed to bypass and trudge alongside traffic.",
      "Innovation isn't new to the oil and gas industry, nor is the idea to use a conveyor belt to move materials around. Another conveyer belt believed to be the world\u2019s longest conveyor \u2014 at 61 miles (98.17 kilometers) long \u2014 carries phosphorous from a mine in Western Sahara on the northwest coast of Africa, according to NASA Earth Observatory.",
      "When moving sand by truck became a nuisance, an unprecedented and risky investment opportunity arose: constructing a $400 million machine to streamline the production of hydraulic fracturing. The company went public in March 2023, in part, to help pay for the conveyor belt and completed its first delivery in January, Turner said.",
      "The sand sits in a tray-shaped pan with a lid that can be taken off at any point, but most of the it gets offloaded into silos near the Texas and New Mexico border. Along its miles-long journey, the sand is sold and sent to fracking companies who move it by truck for the remainder of the trip.",
      "Keeping the rollers on the belt aligned and making sure it runs smoothly are the biggest maintenance obstacles, according to Turner. The rollers are equipped with chips that signal when its about to fail and need to be replaced. This helps prevent wear and tear and keep the machine running consistently, Turner said.",
      "The belt cuts through a large oil patch where environmentalists have long raised concerns about the industry disturbing local habitats, including those of the sagebrush lizard, which was listed as an endangered species last year by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.",
      "\u201cIn addition to that, we know that the sand will expedite further drilling nearby,\u201d said Luke Metzger, executive director of Environment Texas. \u201cWe could see more drilling than we otherwise would, which means more air pollution, more spills than we otherwise would.\u201d",
      "The Dune Express currently runs for about 12 to 14 hours a day at roughly half capacity but the company expects to it to be rolling along at all hours later this year.",
      "In New Mexico, Lea County Commissioner Brad Weber said he hopes the belt alleviates traffic on a parallel highway where car crashes are frequent.",
      "\u201cI believe it\u2019s going to make a very positive impact here,\u201d he said.",

      "Discount carrier Spirit Airlines has emerged from bankruptcy protection",
      "NEW YORK -- Discount carrier Spirit Airlines has emerged from bankruptcy protection.",
      "The budget airline \u2014 known for its no-frills, low-cost flights on a fleet of yellow planes \u2014 said Wednesday that its parent, Spirit Aviation Holdings, exited Chapter 11 after finalizing debt restructuring. The reorganization plan, which received the court greenlight last month, aims to bring the carrier back to profitability and boost resources to compete with rivals.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re emerging as a stronger and more focused airline,\u201d CEO Ted Christie, who will continue to lead Spirit post-bankruptcy, said in a statement.",
      "The restructuring deal allows Spirit to convert $795 million of its debt into equity. The company says it's also received a $350 million equity investment from existing investors to aid future operations.",
      "Spirit filed for bankruptcy back in November, following years of struggles and mounting debt as it failed to bounce back from the COVID-19 pandemic. The Florida carrier was particularly hit hard by rising operating expenses and stiffer competition. By the time of its Chapter 11 filing, the airline had lost more than $2.5 billion since the start of 2020.",
      "Whether Spirit will continue as a standalone airline has also been up in the air, although takeover attempts from budget rivals like JetBlue and Frontier have proven to be unsuccessful before and during the bankruptcy process. Spirit rejected a third bid from Frontier last month.",
      "While future merger proposals may not be entirely off the table, Spirit signaled Wednesday that it would continue to focus its own growth and offerings. Christie noted that the airline would be \"moving forward with our strategy to redefine low-fare travel with our new, high-value travel options.\u201d",
      "In an evolution from its budget-exclusive roots, Spirit is attempting to tap into the growing market for more upscale travel. It is now offering flight options with tiered prices, the higher-priced tickets coming with more amenities. Last year, months before filing for Chapter 11, Spirit decided to sell bundled fares that include a bigger seat, priority boarding, free bags, internet service and snacks and drinks.",
      "In a message sent to Spirit customers Wednesday, Christie continued to point those four travel options from the airline, which he said \u201clet you choose how you want to fly.\"",
      "Wednesday's announcement also noted plans to trade shares publicly again, although not immediately. Shares of Spirit previously issued by Spirit Airlines Inc. was canceled upon its exit from bankruptcy \u2014 but it expects to re-list shares, newly-issued under new owners, \u201cas soon as reasonably practicable.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile \u2014 between wider economic turmoil, high-profile plane crashes and other consumer uncertainty \u2014 major airlines have issued warnings in recent days about falling demand. Carriers like Delta, Southwest, American have all recently downgraded revenue outlooks for the first quarter.",

      "The top-ranked Blue Devils were trailing by 26-17 late in the first half when Flagg went up for a rebound and crashed to the floor after he appeared to have his left foot land on the foot of Georgia Tech\u2019s Darrion Sutton. He hobbled back to the bench in clear distress, then bent over with his hands on the seats and pounded a chair with his right fist.",
      "After sitting on the bench for a few minutes, Flagg got up and put his arms around two teammates and was taken to the locker room for observation.",
      "It\u2019s unclear if Flagg will return to the game.",

    "story": [
      "Pittsburgh Penguins goaltender Tristan Jarry is off to a strong start in his return to the NHL",
      "PITTSBURGH -- Tristan Jarry's career was at a crossroads in mid-January. The Pittsburgh Penguins goaltender was struggling and even worse, the franchise's faith in him appeared to be shot.",
      "Things grew so bleak for Jarry at the end of a stretch in which he dropped six straight starts that general manager Kyle Dubas \u2014 the same man who'd signed Jarry to a five-year deal shortly after taking over in the summer of 2023 \u2014 made the unusual decision to send Jarry to the minors.",
      "Not just to get some reps in, but seemingly for good.",
      "Players with two All-Star appearances and millions in the bank typically don't make their way back after a fall like that. At least not with the same team.",
      "Yet there Jarry was on Tuesday night standing inside PPG Paints Arena, turning aside 36 shots in a 3-2 overtime victory over Vegas that offered hope that while Pittsburgh's season is all but lost, Jarry's tenure with the only NHL club he's ever known might not be.",
      "Yes, those six-plus weeks in Wilkes-Barre/Scranton riding the bus to Bridgeport and Lehigh Valley were \u201ctough\u201d as he put it. They may also have been necessary.",
      "\u201cIt was something I had to work through,\u201d Jarry said. \u201cSomething I need to look at myself in the mirror and just say \u2018I need to have a better game.\u2019\u201d",
      "The Penguins called Jarry back up quietly earlier this month when 23-year-old Joel Blomqvist \u2014 potentially the club's goalie of the future \u2014 had struggles of his own during a somewhat extended NHL look.",
      "Jarry returned to the lineup on Sunday in a road victory over likely playoff-bound Minnesota. Pittsburgh coach Mike Sullivan called Jarry \u201cspectacular\u201d while outdueling future Hall of Famer and former Penguin Marc-Andre Fleury.",
      "Sullivan saw enough to give Jarry the nod again against Pacific Division-leading Vegas, a potentially fraught assignment for a player who hasn't looked comfortable playing at home this season.",
      "Yet the jitters \u2014 particularly the early-game ones that have popped up frequently during a season in which he has allowed a first-shot goal six times \u2014 never materialized. Jarry turned aside the first puck the Golden Knights threw his way and quickly settled into the game.",
      "Vegas, which is charging toward the postseason, dominated for long stretches. Jarry responded by showcasing the athleticism that's always been there and the confidence, which admittedly hasn't.",
      "He was at his best in the third period. During one sequence Jarry turned aside a breakaway and a wraparound attempt within seconds of each other to protect a one-goal lead. When the whistle blew, the crowd that reveled in booing him in mid-winter was cheering his name instead.",
      "Though Vegas tied it late on a slap shot by Noah Hanifin, Pittsburgh prevailed in overtime to secure two points in a season in which they've been hard to come by. Jarry's uneven play is one of the major reasons the Penguins will likely miss the playoffs for a third straight year.",
      "Yet if he can find something over the next month, he could perhaps make his contract that features an average cap hit of $5 million palatable for another team to take on. Or maybe a goaltender who has been part of the problem during Pittsburgh's swoon could end up being part of the solution.",
      "\u201cHe's got a long body of work in Pittsburgh that suggests strongly that he\u2019s an NHL goaltender,\u201d Sullivan said of Jarry. \"We\u2019ve said that on many occasions ... He\u2019s made the All-Star team twice, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s coincidence. There\u2019s substance there.\u201d",
      "Jarry needs to pair that substance with consistency and maybe a dash of toughness too. He's been around long enough \u2014 Jarry made his NHL debut nearly eight years ago \u2014 to know two solid games doesn't mean he's \u201cback.\u201d Every meaningful stat, from goals against average (3.15) to save percentage (.893), ranks as the worst of his career.",
      "There's more work to be done. Probably a lot more. Yet he finds himself in a better place than he was in mid-January. He believes being sent down freed him in a way. He had nothing left to lose, so Jarry headed to the AHL with a \u201cfree mind\" that has helped pave the way for a comeback that seemed remote not long ago.",
      "\u201cI think just over my time that I\u2019ve been playing in the NHL, I\u2019ve played a lot of good hockey,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I want to continue that.\u201d",
      "Given Pittsburgh's spot in the standings and the need to get a feel once and for all whether he can reclaim the team's No. 1 goaltending spot, Jarry probably won't lack for opportunities down the stretch. What he does with them will say plenty about his future.",
      "\u201cFor whatever reason it didn\u2019t go the way any of us hoped (early in the season),\u201d Sullivan said. \"I think he\u2019s just showing what he\u2019s capable of, quite honestly.\u201d",

      "With Josh Allen's personal and financial life set, the NFL MVP is focusing his attention on unfinished business: leading the Buffalo Bills to a Super Bowl title",
      "ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. -- As blessed as Josh Allen considers himself following a year in which he was voted NFL MVP, got engaged to a Hollywood actor and became one of the league\u2019s top-paid players, one item remains on the Buffalo Bills quarterback\u2019s to-do list.",
      "Win a Super Bowl, of course.",
      "\u201cAnybody I run into, friend or not friend, it\u2019s always a congrats for having a heck of a year,\u201d Allen told reporters on Wednesday.",
      "\u201cAnd when you kind of look back at it, the only thing missing is finishing our season with a win,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s really the only thing I\u2019m thinking about, just trying to continue to get better and find a way to bring a Lombardi Trophy to western New York.\u201d",
      "Though his focus remains on the future, Allen took time to appreciate the moment, three days after agreeing to a six-year, $330 million contract extension, with an NFL-record $250 million guaranteed.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty surreal feeling. And 8-year-old me would obviously be just as pumped as a 28-year-old me,\u201d Allen said, speaking on a Zoom call from his offseason base in Southern California.",
      "\u201cI just think I\u2019m blessed. Sometimes it is a little breath-taking, or you can\u2019t find the right words on how to describe it,\" he added. \u201cI\u2019m a pretty lucky guy.\u201d",
      "Resilient, too, as Allen also reflected on the obstacles he has overcome: from starting his career at Reedley Community College in Central California, to transferring to Wyoming, where he was knocked for being raw and inaccurate, never mind those who continued to doubt him over the past year.",
      "\u201cMaybe, we\u2019ll see,\u201d Allen said with a laugh on whether he\u2019s closed the book on being called overrated.",
      "Though the closest he has led the Bills to a Super Bowl berth is two AFC championship game losses to Kansas City in 2020 and this past season, Allen has a hold on his adopted community and team that are unquestioned since Buffalo traded up five spots to draft him seventh overall in 2018.",
      "He has set nearly every single-season franchise passing and scoring record for his position while leading Buffalo to five straight AFC East titles.",
      "And he\u2019s coming off a season regarded as his most memorable on and off the field.",
      "Allen became the Bills third player to win MVP honors, being recognized for essentially achieving more with less after Buffalo traded top threat Stefon Diggs to Houston and lost No. 2 receiver Gabe Davis in free agency. He combined for 41 touchdowns, including one receiving, with a career-low six interceptions in a 13-win season.",
      "Off the field, he got engaged to Hailee Steinfeld in November.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m so grateful for what\u2019s going on in my life and finding the person that I want to share it with,\u201d Allen said. \u201cWhen you have that piece figured out, it seems like everything else kind of comes a little bit easier.\u201d",
      "Now Allen has a new contract that locks him in through 2030, a deal he negotiated with an eye on helping the team. As eye-popping as the numbers are, Allen made sure the contract helped the Bills by freeing up much-needed salary cap space in order to retain and add talent.",
      "The benefits were readily apparent in the days leading up to free agency on Wednesday. The Bills upgraded their defensive line by signing edge rusher Joey Bosa and tackle Larry Ogunjobi to one-year deals and landed receiver Joshua Palmer.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s weird to say this, but what is $5 million more going to do for my life that I can\u2019t already do right now. It\u2019s not that crazy to me,\u201d Allen said. \u201cI was like, if it has any impact on the cap, let\u2019s figure out a way to not do that.\u201d",
      "Though Allen\u2019s deal places him tied for second among NFL players by averaging $55 million per year, the contract ranks 13th by taking up only 19.7% of his team\u2019s cap total.",
      "Allen is cashing in for a second time, following the six-year, $258 million deal he signed in August 2021. Buffalo is where Allen feels like home, and it\u2019s where he wants to finish out his career.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to play anywhere else,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen it\u2019s time to put the cleats up, hopefully it\u2019ll be in Buffalo.\u201d",
      "Allen then laughed, saying he\u2019s far from considering retirement, while at the same time appreciating how quickly time has passed.",
      "\u201cIt feels like an eternity ago, but I still remember being the guy sitting on the sidelines in junior college just waiting for a chance to get on the field,\u201d Allen said. \u201cBut I\u2019m not a very nostalgic person. I focus more so on what\u2019s going on right now, trying to be where my feet are and take it just one day at a time.\u201d",

      "Filmmaker Deon Taylor has built a pipeline for pro athletes to transition into a filmmaking post career with the Hidden Empire Sports Collective",
      "SANTA MONICA, Calif. -- Isaac Ukwu's sights were solely set on just playing in the NFL \u2014 until two season-ending knee injuries in college served as a harsh reality of football's fragility.",
      "The setbacks reshaped Ukwu's perspective, showing him that football was part of him, but not all of him. Even after signing with the Detroit Lions as an undrafted free agent last year, the defensive end knew he needed more than just the game.",
      "So, when the NFL introduced a program for players exploring careers in film and television, he seized the chance to build his off-the-field legacy.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t let your entire identity be football,\u201d said Ukwu, an aspiring actor, who was one of 20-plus former and active NFL players selected to join film training sessions at the NFL Career Tour hosted by Hidden Empire and Skydance Sports. During the three-day sessions, athletes explored the nuances of filmmaking \u2014 learning behind-the-camera roles like directing, producing and other essential elements of bringing a project to life \u2014 while also sharpening their skills as actors.",
      "The sessions recently concluded with the creation of short films at the Hidden Empire studios in Santa Monica, California. The company is led by independent filmmaker Deon Taylor, best known for \u201cBlack and Blue\u201d and \u201cThe Intruder,\u201d and his wife Roxanne Avent Taylor.",
      "\u201cThis experience is really invaluable,\u201d said Ukwu, who hopes to break into acting before eventually exploring directing and producing.",
      "Some of the players featured in the sessions included Arizona Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray, Cincinnati Bengals lineman Orlando Brown, Pittsburgh Steelers defensive lineman Cam Heyward, Buffalo Bills offensive lineman Dion Dawkins and Los Angeles Chargers linebacker Daiyan Henley.",
      "It\u2019s the third year of program \u2014 which has featured panelists including entertainers Tyrese Gibson and Master P and retired NFL player Vernon Davis.",
      "\u201cThey let you know there\u2019s a way to enter that door,\u201d said Heyward, a seven-time Pro Bowler, who's interested in becoming a director or producer. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you have to come from a film background. But if you appreciate films and you\u2019re a fan of it, there\u2019s a space for you.\u201d",
      "Taylor\u2019s vision is to redefine storytelling and build a pipeline for authentic, culture-driven narratives straight from the world\u2019s top athletes.",
      "He sees the Hidden Empire Sports Collective \u2014 launched last month \u2014 as a key step in helping athletes prepare for life beyond the game. This new entertainment division focuses on amplifying athletes\u2019 voices through content creation and intellectual property development.",
      "\u201cWe should be educating athletes on how to actually create content, make IP themselves,\u201d said Taylor, who played basketball in East Germany before he ultimately directed other notable titles such as \u201cMeet the Blacks\" and \u201cFatale.\u201d He\u2019s become a major player in the independent filmmaking space.",
      "\u201cBut then more importantly, it\u2019s being a sound information highway for them to understand how they could take something that was great in their life or something that was painful in their lives, tweak it and make it become something that could be content,\u201d he said.",
      "The sports collective has partnered with several athletes, landing developmental deals with stars like boxing champion Floyd Mayweather Jr., NBA champion Scottie Pippen and Los Angeles Clippers star James Harden. One upcoming project is a four-part docuseries on Mayweather's life.",
      "With the training sessions, Taylor believes athletes can find inspiration through the sports collective and Ephraim Salaam, who successfully transitioned from the NFL to Hollywood. After playing 13 seasons in the league, he has built a career as a screenwriter.",
      "Salaam stressed to pro athletes the importance of owning their stories. He noted that they can offer a deeper perspective on their lives that might captivate the masses.",
      "\u201cThe No. 1 thing I always tell them is \u2018You\u2019re one of one,\u2019\u201d said Salaam, who is the collective's president of talent strategy and creative executive. \u201cYou\u2019ve been able to look and see life through a lens very few people have. That information is valuable in a writers room.\u201d",
      "In just a few days, athletes dove into filmmaking with the same intensity they bring to studying playbooks.",
      "Players broke into different groups to film scenes for their own movie using iPhones. They went through career and educational panels along with interactive workshops that included a tour of Paramount Studios.",
      "Many assumed acting was their standout skill \u2014 until they realized every role on a project is just as crucial to the final score.",
      "For Okwu, he learned that a film producer wears many hats, much like an NFL general manager, overseeing everything from reading scripts to securing directors and funding projects. He credits Taylor for guiding him and his peers through their early filmmaking journey.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like if I was in high school and I had access to Dan Campbell just to talk and coach me up on some things that can lead my success in the future,\u201d said Okwu.",
      "The project took shape after an NFL Career Tour stop, an initiative designed to provide insight into the entertainment industry. This tour is part of Skydance Sports, a joint NFL-Skydance venture offering athletes a behind-the-scenes look at sports programming and storytelling.",
      "The collaboration aims to equip players with the tools to transition into media, content creation and production to share their own narratives with the world.",
      "\u201cWithout the players, there is no game,\u201d said Tracy Perlman, senior vice president of player operation for the NFL. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to build athletes. We want to build people.\"",
      "Dion Dawkins said the opportunities are ripe for the taking.",
      "\u201cYou have to create your lane without that helmet on,\u201d said Dawkins, a four-time Pro Bowler who's an aspiring actor with a big personality. He gets inspired watching former NFL players who transitioned into the TV and film industry such as Salaam, Terry Crews, Laith Wallschleger and Vernon Davis.",
      "\u201cIf you think you\u2019re bigger than a football player, you have avenues that can show it,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause we have OGs that have done it, and doing it currently, it gives you that bit of ... I\u2019m not an outsider, I\u2019m an insider. As long as I conduct and control myself in the right manner, I\u2019ll have a chance.\u201d",

      "Aaron Rodgers is officially no longer a member of the New York Jets",
      "Aaron Rodgers' much-hyped but overwhelmingly disappointing two-year tenure with the New York Jets is officially over.",
      "The team released the four-time MVP, as expected, and the 41-year-old quarterback can now join another team as a free agent for the first time in his career \u2014 if he stills intends to play a 21st NFL season.",
      "While the team didn\u2019t announce the move, which was a formality, it appeared on the league's transaction wire early Thursday morning.",
      "Meanwhile, the Jets absorbed a $49 million dead money charge by cutting Rodgers, but are able to spread that over two years instead of one \u2014 $14 million this year and $35 million next year \u2014 by designating him a post-June 1 cut.",
      "The Jets' new regime of general manager Darren Mougey and coach Aaron Glenn said on Feb. 13 that they informed Rodgers they were moving on without him. New York posted on its social media platforms at that time a picture of Rodgers in a black Jets uniform, with his back to the camera. The post read: \u201cFor everything you\u2019ve given us the past two years, thank you 8.\u201d",
      "On Monday, New York agreed to terms with former Steelers and Bears quarterback Justin Fields on a two-year deal worth $40 million with $30 million guaranteed. Fields is expected to step in as the Jets\u2019 starting quarterback.",
      "Rodgers joins wide receiver Davante Adams and linebacker C.J. Mosley as big-name players released by the Jets this offseason.",
      "Rodgers could have a few options to start if he still wants to play, including the Steelers, Giants and possibly the Vikings.",

      "Instead, Rodgers\u2019 stint was marked by a torn Achilles tendon four snaps into his debut that cost him his first season, and a disappointing 5-12 finish last season during which both coach Robert Saleh and GM Joe Douglas were fired.",
      "Rodgers finished his Jets tenure with six wins \u2014 including the victory during which he was injured \u2014 in 18 starts. His 28 touchdown passes and 3,897 yards passing last year both rank third for a single season in franchise history. But he lacked some mobility early in his return and then dealt with a few additional leg injuries, including a significant hamstring ailment that hobbled him.",
      "Rodgers has 503 regular-season touchdown passes (fifth in NFL history), joining Tom Brady (649), Drew Brees (571), Peyton Manning (539) and Brett Favre (508) as the only players to throw at least 500. His 62,952 yards passing rank seventh in NFL history.",

      "Norway men\u2019s head coach Magnus Brevig and equipment manager Adrian Livelten admitted they had cheated, though just on one occasion, ahead of the large hill event held Saturday.",
      "\u201cWe regret it like dogs, and I\u2019m terribly sorry that this happened,\u201d Brevig said. \u201cI don\u2019t really have anything else to say other than that we got carried away in our bubble.\u201d",
      "Livelten apologized to the disqualified athletes plus \u201csponsors, the jumping family and the Norwegian people\u201d for an act of cheating he said was \u201ccompletely unacceptable.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was an extremely high level manipulation,\u201d race director Pertile said of the Norwegian actions that were \u201cabsolutely by far the worst\u201d in his five years in the job. \u201cWe destroyed the suit to be able to find this adjustment.\u201d",
      "The Italian official said alterations were not detected by eye and only were revealed by examining the seams of the crotch area of the ski suits after the competition.",
      "Extra material in the same color had been inserted that added weight and helped to lower the material between an athlete's legs as they took off into the flight phase. More surface area hitting the air helps add to flight time, Pertile said.",
      "FIS previously said a 5% bigger surface area of a suit helps an athlete fly further, though the exact distance added is not known, Pertile said.",
      "FIS has an extensive 11-page document of rules for measuring and verifying ski jumpers' suits during the season. Multiple RFID chips are attached and noted on a FIS register, after which a suit must not be altered. Any attempt to remove a chip should make the suit ineligible and the chips are deactivated.",
      "One suit is allowed at World Cup events and two more for a world championships or Winter Olympics, though just one is used on each competition day.",
      "FIS investigators are now likely to want to closely inspect all the Norwegian team suits, in men's and women's ski jumping and Nordic combined, at the world championships.",
      "Lindvik's gold medal in normal hill is sure to be looked at, though it is unclear how far back an investigation could reach for results at World Cup events this season or beyond to previous seasons. Lindvik was Olympic champion in large hill at the 2022 Beijing Winter Games.",
      "The ski jumping World Cup season continues for three more weekends, starting Thursday in Oslo.",

      "The NCAA selection committee will have some juggling to do before the bracket comes out Sunday to keep March Madness from looking like an extension of the Southeastern Conference\u2019s regular season",
      "The NCAA selection committee will have some juggling to do before the bracket comes out Sunday to keep March Madness from looking like an extension of the Southeastern Conference's regular season.",
      "With the country's deepest league in line to place between 12 and 14 teams in the tournament, some long-held guidelines drawn to help set the matchups will have to give way, bringing the possibility that conference rivals could face each other as early as the second round or the Sweet 16.",
      "\u201cWe will move it to try to ensure they don't play each other too frequently,\u201d the chair of the selection committee, North Carolina athletic director Bubba Cunningham, said Wednesday in a call to preview the selection. \u201cBut it is a reality of where we are today.\u201d",
      "The reality is shaped thanks in part to a flurry of realignment that has left college sports with four megaconferences. Three of those will gobble up nearly half of the 68 spots in the tournament. The record for a conference came in 2011 when the Big East placed 11 teams in the bracket.",
      "Some projections have the SEC earning up to 14 spots, the Big Ten getting as many as 10 and the Big 12 earning up to eight. Of those 32 projected spots, seven could go to teams that were in different conferences as recently as 2023 \u2014 programs such as Oklahoma, Oregon and BYU.",
      "There will be some big-picture repercussions from all this realignment. In a notable development earlier this week, Big 12 Commissioner Brett Yormark got on board with an idea to expand the tournament to 76 teams in a move that would favor Power Four conferences.",
      "More urgently, though, having so many teams from so few conferences will force the 12 members of the selection committee, who are holed up in a conference room in Indiana this week, to make some nontraditional decisions.",
      "The NCAA bracketing principles frown on teams that have played three times in a season from meeting before the Elite Eight. Likewise, they urge the committee to avoid potential pairings between teams that have played twice coming before the Sweet 16. But, in a tweak that was put in for this season, the principles note that those rules \u201ccan be relaxed if a league has nine or more teams in the tournament.\u201d",
      "Cunningham said the committee's biggest priority will be getting the seedings right, an exercise that could make it more difficult to avoid these early matchups.",
      "\u201cWe really try to keep everybody on the same seed line\" they've earned, he said. \u201cWe don't want to move them to a different seed line because that really does impact the tournament. But it'll be a little bit trickier this year.\"",
      "The SEC's dominance is showing up not only in the sheer volume of teams but also where they land. Auburn is a lock for a No. 1 seed, with Florida considered a slight favorite to edge out Tennessee and Alabama for another.",
      "Among the biggest questions is whether the top overall seed in the tournament will go to Auburn or Duke, which this week supplanted the Tigers at No. 1 in the AP Top 25. The irony there is that Duke is one of only three teams from the ACC projected to make the field of 68, which would mark the hoops powerhouse's lowest total in 25 years.",

      "INDIANAPOLIS -- Robert Morris coach Andrew Toole stood next to the staging area near midcourt Tuesday night, the confetti strewn around him as the jubilant Colonials players danced, mingled with fans and climbed ladders to cut down the nets.",
      "It was a moment of pure joy for the school located in suburban Pittsburgh.",
      "But for Toole, winning his first Horizon League Tournament title came with bittersweet memories from the last time his team earned an NCAA Tournament bid \u2014 two days before the event was canceled on March 12, 2020, because of the coronavirus pandemic.",
      "\u201cIt was the worst locker room I've ever been in,\u201d he said minutes after the victory over Youngstown State, describing a team meeting from five years earlier. \"To be part of the greatest tournament in college athletics and maybe sports in general and you don't see that come to fruition when you've earned it, when you've won it, it's a killer. I've had more opportunities to try to do it again, but these guys only have a short amount of time so when you get it in your hands and it gets robbed from you, it's heartbreaking.\u201d",
      "It wasn't just Toole and Robert Morris, of course. Nor was it just college basketball. On that Thursday afternoon, NCAA officials announced the cancellation of all remaining winter and spring championships. Other sporting events around the world ended up being affected as well, including the Tokyo Olympics.",
      "The decision to cancel March Madness had long-lasting consequences everywhere, especially for schools whose one shining moment often comes from the journey of earning the only NCAA bid their conference receives. For Robert Morris, that was the Northeast Conference.",
      "At Indiana University-Indianapolis, that meant the women's team put its first ever NCAA game on hold for two more seasons despite winning the 2020 Horizon League tourney.",
      "And even now, NCAA officials are keenly aware of the anger, sadness, frustration and disbelief caused by the decision to prioritize public health safety over so many lifetime dreams of competing for a national championship.",
      "\u201cThat was a real tough day for college athletics, a really difficult day for the NCAA staff as well as the (selection) committee,\u201d this year's men's committee chair Bubba Cunningham said during a Zoom call Wednesday. \u201cAt that time, there was an awful lot of anxiety and concern about what was happening to the country.\u201d",
      "The first indications the sports world could get swept up in the health crisis filtered out March 11, 2020, when the NBA announced it was suspending its season after Utah center Rudy Gobert tested positive for the COVID-19 virus.",
      "The next scare came later that night at the Big Ten Tournament when Nebraska coach Fred Hoiberg became visibly ill on the sideline and was taken to an Indianapolis hospital. He did not have COVID.",
      "By the next morning, though, some conferences decided their tournaments would continue \u2014 albeit without fans. But as Michigan and Rutgers warmed up for the first game in Indianapolis on March 12, UMass and VCU were doing the same at the Atlantic 10 Tournament in Brooklyn, New York, when all four teams learned they weren't playing.",
      "\u201cTwo minutes left in warm-up, you're out on the court, you've got your game face on, you're locked in and then no game,\u201d then-VCU coach Mike Rhoades said at the time. \u201cIt's surreal.\u201d",
      "UMass coach Matt McCall went a step further, telling his players that 10 years later, they would still remember where they were when the announcement came.",
      "It's a day nobody in the college basketball world may ever forget, and a half decade later that's still the case.",
      "Toole remembers seeing the official announcement on social media before he could even tell his devastated players.",
      "\u201cYour whole team knows about it, so you can't control the narrative,\u201d Toole said. \u201cYou can't do anything to soften the blow. So we met that Friday morning and you walk in and it's like a morgue. I mean, they already knew the news. You didn't have to tell them, that's what made it so hard.\u201d",
      "While the news may have hit hardest at schools such as Robert Morris, it was a big deal everywhere.",
      "Kansas and Gonzaga were ranked Nos. 1 and 2 in what turned out to be the final Associated Press Top 25. Dayton and San Diego State were ranked Nos. 3 and 6 and Kentucky was No. 8.",
      "\u201cFive years ago today we weren\u2019t doing this!\u201d SEC Commissioner Greg Sankey wrote on Twitter, posted with a photo of a basketball game. \u201cNever take for granted the special opportunities and the chance to watch teams from the greatest basketball conference in the land!\u201d",
      "So as stunning as it seemed to shut down the sports world in March 2020, it's still unfathomable for today's players to comprehend what that month was like for their predecessors, the ones who never reaped the real rewards from their accomplishments.",
      "\u201cI think for those guys, all the hard work they put in to not go to the tournament, it's a sour taste, a sour feeling,\u201d Robert Morris guard Josh Omojafo said. \u201cThe team this year, we knew (what happened in 2020). We used that as motivation, you know, we wanted to get that back for them. That was our model for the whole year.\u201d",

      "The incomplete skull \u2014 a section of the left cheek bone and upper jaw \u2013 was found in northern Spain in 2022. The fossil is between 1.1 million and 1.4 million years old, according to research published in the journal Nature.",
      "\u201cThe fossil is exciting,\" said Eric Delson, a paleontologist at the American Museum of Natural History, who was not involved in the study. \u201cIt's the first time we have significant remains older than 1 million years old in western Europe.\u201d",
      "A collection of older fossils from early human ancestors was previously found in Georgia, near the crossroads of eastern Europe and Asia. Those are estimated to be 1.8 million years old.",
      "The Spanish fossil is the first evidence that clearly shows human ancestors \u201cwere taking excursions into Europe\u201d at that time, said Rick Potts, director of the Smithsonian\u2019s Human Origins Program.",
      "But there is not yet evidence that the earliest arrivals persisted there long, he said. \u201cThey may get to a new location and then die out,\u201d said Potts, who had no role in the study.",
      "The partial skull bears many similarities to Homo erectus, but there are also some anatomical differences, said study co-author Rosa Huguet, an archaeologist at the Catalan Institute of Human Paleoecology and Social Evolution in Tarragona, Spain.",

      "One student asked a search engine, \u201cWhy does my boyfriend hit me?\u201d Another threatened suicide in an email to an unrequited love. A gay teen opened up in an online diary about struggles with homophobic parents, writing they just wanted to be themselves.",
      "In each case and thousands of others, surveillance software powered by artificial intelligence immediately alerted Vancouver Public Schools staff in Washington state.",
      "Vancouver and many other districts around the country have turned to technology to monitor school-issued devices 24/7 for any signs of danger as they grapple with a student mental health crisis and the threat of shootings.",
      "The goal is to keep children safe, but these tools raise serious questions about privacy and security \u2014 as proven when Seattle Times and Associated Press reporters inadvertently received access to almost 3,500 sensitive, unredacted student documents through a records request about the district\u2019s surveillance technology.",
      "___",
      "The Education Reporting Collaborative, a coalition of eight newsrooms, is investigating the unintended consequences of AI-powered surveillance at schools. Members of the Collaborative are AL.com, The Associated Press, The Christian Science Monitor, The Dallas Morning News, The Hechinger Report, Idaho Education News, The Post and Courier in South Carolina, and The Seattle Times.",
      "___",
      "The released documents show students use these laptops for more than just schoolwork; they are coping with angst in their personal lives.",
      "Students wrote about depression, heartbreak, suicide, addiction, bullying and eating disorders. There are poems, college essays and excerpts from role-play sessions with AI chatbots.",
      "Vancouver school staff and anyone else with links to the files could read everything. Firewalls or passwords didn\u2019t protect the documents, and student names were not redacted, which cybersecurity experts warned was a massive security risk.",
      "The monitoring tools often helped counselors reach out to students who might have otherwise struggled in silence. But the Vancouver case is a stark reminder of surveillance technology\u2019s unintended consequences in American schools.",
      "In some cases, the technology has outed LGBTQ+ children and eroded trust between students and school staff, while failing to keep schools completely safe.",
      "Gaggle Safety Management, the company that developed the software that tracks Vancouver schools students\u2019 online activity, believes not monitoring children is like letting them loose on \u201ca digital playground without fences or recess monitors,\u201d CEO and founder Jeff Patterson said.",
      "Roughly 1,500 school districts nationwide use Gaggle\u2019s software to track the online activity of approximately 6 million students. It\u2019s one of many companies, like GoGuardian and Securly, that promise to keep kids safe through AI-assisted web surveillance.",
      "The technology has been in high demand since the pandemic, when nearly every child received a school-issued tablet or laptop. According to a U.S. Senate investigation, over 7,000 schools or districts used GoGuardian\u2019s surveillance products in 2021.",
      "Vancouver schools apologized for releasing the documents. Still, the district emphasizes Gaggle is necessary to protect students\u2019 well-being.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think we could ever put a price on protecting students,\u201d said Andy Meyer, principal of Vancouver\u2019s Skyview High School. \u201cAnytime we learn of something like that and we can intervene, we feel that is very positive.\u201d",
      "Dacia Foster, a parent in the district, commended the efforts to keep students safe but worries about privacy violations.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s not good at all,\u201d Foster said after learning the district inadvertently released the records. \u201cBut what are my options? What do I do? Pull my kid out of school?\u201d",
      "Foster says she\u2019d be upset if her daughter\u2019s private information was compromised.",
      "\u201cAt the same time,\u201d she said, \u201cI would like to avoid a school shooting or suicide.\u201d",
      "Gaggle uses a machine-learning algorithm to scan what students search or write online via a school-issued laptop or tablet 24 hours a day, or whenever they log into their school account on a personal device. The latest contract Vancouver signed, in summer 2024, shows a price of $328,036 for three school years \u2014 approximately the cost of employing one extra counselor.",
      "The algorithm detects potential indicators of problems like bullying, self-harm, suicide or school violence and then sends a screenshot to human reviewers. If Gaggle employees confirm the issue might be serious, the company alerts the school. In cases of imminent danger, Gaggle calls school officials directly. In rare instances where no one answers, Gaggle may contact law enforcement for a welfare check.",
      "A Vancouver school counselor who requested anonymity out of fear of retaliation said they receive three or four student Gaggle alerts per month. In about half the cases, the district contacts parents immediately.",
      "\u201cA lot of times, families don\u2019t know. We open that door for that help,\u201d the counselor said. Gaggle is \u201cgood for catching suicide and self-harm, but students find a workaround once they know they are getting flagged.\u201d",
      "Seattle Times and AP reporters saw what kind of writing set off Gaggle\u2019s alerts after requesting information about the type of content flagged. Gaggle saved screenshots of activity that set off each alert, and school officials accidentally provided links to them, not realizing they weren\u2019t protected by a password.",
      "After learning about the records inadvertently released to reporters, Gaggle updated its system. Now, after 72 hours, only those logged into a Gaggle account can view the screenshots. Gaggle said this feature was already in the works but had not yet been rolled out to every customer.",
      "The company says the links must be accessible without a login during those 72 hours so emergency contacts \u2014 who often receive these alerts late at night on their phones \u2014 can respond quickly.",
      "In Vancouver, the monitoring technology flagged more than 1,000 documents for suicide and nearly 800 for threats of violence. While many alerts were serious, many others turned out to be false alarms, like a student essay about the importance of consent or a goofy chat between friends.",
      "Foster\u2019s daughter Bryn, a Vancouver School of Arts and Academics sophomore, was one such false alarm. She was called into the principal\u2019s office after writing a short story featuring a scene with mildly violent imagery.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m glad they\u2019re being safe about it, but I also think it can be a bit much,\u201d Bryn said.",
      "School officials maintain alerts are warranted even in less severe cases or false alarms, ensuring potential issues are addressed promptly.",
      "\u201cIt allows me the opportunity to meet with a student I maybe haven\u2019t met before and build that relationship,\u201d said Chele Pierce, a Skyview High School counselor.",
      "Between October 2023 and October 2024, nearly 2,200 students, about 10% of the district\u2019s enrollment, were the subject of a Gaggle alert. At the Vancouver School of Arts and Academics, where Bryn is a student, about 1 in 4 students had communications that triggered a Gaggle alert.",
      "While schools continue to use surveillance technology, its long-term effects on student safety are unclear. There\u2019s no independent research showing it measurably lowers student suicide rates or reduces violence.",
      "A 2023 RAND study found only \u201cscant evidence\u201d of either benefits or risks from AI surveillance, concluding: \u201cNo research to date has comprehensively examined how these programs affect youth suicide prevention.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you don\u2019t have the right number of mental health counselors, issuing more alerts is not actually going to improve suicide prevention,\u201d said report co-author Benjamin Boudreaux, an AI ethics researcher.",
      "In the screenshots released by Vancouver schools, at least six students were potentially outed to school officials after writing about being gay, transgender or struggling with gender dysphoria.",
      "LGBTQ+ students are more likely than their peers to suffer from depression and suicidal thoughts, and turn to the internet for support.",
      "\u201cWe know that gay youth, especially those in more isolated environments, absolutely use the internet as a life preserver,\u201d said Katy Pearce, a University of Washington professor who researches technology in authoritarian states.",
      "In one screenshot, a Vancouver high schooler wrote in a Google survey form they\u2019d been subject to trans slurs and racist bullying. Who created this survey is unclear, but the person behind it had falsely promised confidentiality: \u201cI am not a mandated reporter, please tell me the whole truth.\u201d",
      "When North Carolina\u2019s Durham Public Schools piloted Gaggle in 2021, surveys showed most staff members found it helpful.",
      "But community members raised concerns. An LGBTQ+ advocate reported to the Board of Education that a Gaggle alert about self-harm had led to a student being outed to their family, who were not supportive.",
      "Glenn Thompson, a Durham School of the Arts graduate, spoke up at a board meeting during his senior year. One of his teachers promised a student confidentiality for an assignment related to mental health. A classmate was then \u201cblindsided\u201d when Gaggle alerted school officials about something private they\u2019d disclosed. Thompson said no one in the class, including the teacher, knew the school was piloting Gaggle.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t just (surveil) people and not tell them. That\u2019s a horrible breach of security and trust,\u201d said Thompson, now a college student, in an interview.",
      "After hearing about these experiences, the Durham Board of Education voted to stop using Gaggle in 2023. The district ultimately decided it was not worth the risk of outing students or eroding relationships with adults.",
      "The debate over privacy and security is complicated, and parents are often unaware it\u2019s even an issue. Pearce, the University of Washington professor, doesn\u2019t remember reading about Securly, the surveillance software Seattle Public Schools uses, when she signed the district\u2019s responsible use form before her son received a school laptop.",
      "Even when families learn about school surveillance, they may be unable to opt out. Owasso Public Schools in Oklahoma has used Gaggle since 2016 to monitor students outside of class.",
      "For years, Tim Reiland, the parent of two teenagers, had no idea the district was using Gaggle. He found out only after asking if his daughter could bring her personal laptop to school instead of being forced to use a district one because of privacy concerns.",
      "The district refused Reiland\u2019s request.",
      "When Reiland's daughter, Zoe, found out about Gaggle, she says she felt so \u201cfreaked out\u201d that she stopped Googling anything personal on her Chromebook, even questions about her menstrual period. She didn\u2019t want to get called into the office for \u201csearching up lady parts.\u201d",
      "\u201cI was too scared to be curious,\u201d she said.",
      "School officials say they don\u2019t track metrics measuring the technology\u2019s efficacy but believe it has saved lives.",
      "Yet technology alone doesn\u2019t create a safe space for all students. In 2024, a nonbinary teenager at Owasso High School named Nex Benedict died by suicide after relentless bullying from classmates. A subsequent U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights investigation found the district responded with \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d to some families\u2019 reports of sexual harassment, mainly in the form of homophobic bullying.",
      "During the 2023-24 school year, the Owasso schools received close to 1,000 Gaggle alerts, including 168 alerts for harassment and 281 for suicide.",
      "When asked why bullying remained a problem despite surveillance, Russell Thornton, the district\u2019s executive director of technology responded: \u201cThis is one tool used by administrators. Obviously, one tool is not going to solve the world\u2019s problems and bullying.\u201d",
      "Despite the risks, surveillance technology can help teachers intervene before a tragedy.",
      "A middle school student in the Seattle-area Highline School District who was potentially being trafficked used Gaggle to communicate with campus staff, said former Superintendent Susan Enfield.",
      "\u201cThey knew that the staff member was reading what they were writing,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cIt was, in essence, that student\u2019s way of asking for help.\u201d",
      "Still, developmental psychology research shows it is vital for teens to have private spaces online to explore their thoughts and seek support.",
      "\u201cThe idea that kids are constantly under surveillance by adults \u2014 I think that would make it hard to develop a private life, a space to make mistakes, a space to go through hard feelings without adults jumping in,\u201d said Boudreaux, the AI ethics researcher.",
      "Gaggle\u2019s Patterson says school-issued devices are not the appropriate place for unlimited self-exploration. If that exploration takes a dark turn, such as making a threat, \u201cthe school\u2019s going to be held liable,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re looking for that open free expression, it really can\u2019t happen on the school system\u2019s computers.\u201d",

      "SpaceX launched the Spherex observatory from California, putting it on course to fly over Earth\u2019s poles. Tagging along were four suitcase-size satellites to study the sun. Spherex popped off the rocket's upper stage first, drifting into the blackness of space with a blue Earth in the background.",
      "The $488 million Spherex mission aims to explain how galaxies formed and evolved over billions of years, and how the universe expanded so fast in its first moments.",
      "Closer to home in our own Milky Way galaxy, Spherex will hunt for water and other ingredients of life in the icy clouds between stars where new solar systems emerge.",
      "The cone-shaped Spherex \u2014 at 1,110 pounds (500 kilograms) or the heft of a grand piano \u2014 will take six months to map the entire sky with its infrared eyes and wide field of view. Four full-sky surveys are planned over two years, as the telescope circles the globe from pole to pole 400 miles (650 kilometers) up.",
      "Spherex won\u2019t see galaxies in exquisite detail like NASA\u2019s larger and more elaborate Hubble and Webb space telescopes, with their narrow fields of view.",
      "Instead of counting galaxies or focusing on them, Spherex will observe the total glow produced by the whole lot, including the earliest ones formed in the wake of the universe-creating Big Bang.",
      "\u201cThis cosmological glow captures all light emitted over cosmic history,\u201d said the mission\u2019s chief scientist Jamie Bock of the California Institute of Technology. \u201cIt\u2019s a very different way of looking at the universe,\u201d enabling scientists to see what sources of light may have been missed in the past.",
      "By observing the collective glow, scientists hope to tease out the light from the earliest galaxies and learn how they came to be, Bock said.",
      "\u201cWe won\u2019t see the Big Bang. But we\u2019ll see the aftermath from it and learn about the beginning of the universe that way,\u201d he said.",
      "The telescope\u2019s infrared detectors will be able to distinguish 102 colors invisible to the human eye, yielding the most colorful, inclusive map ever made of the cosmos.",

      "Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin on Wednesday announced nearly three dozen deregulatory moves that he said would spur the U.S. economy by rolling back rules that have unfairly burdened industry. Many of the moves would affect landmark regulations aimed at protecting clean air and water.",
      "Industry generally applauded the proposed changes, while environmentalists worried about what would amount to historic rollbacks if they are approved. Here's a look at some of the 31 regulatory changes Zeldin announced:",
      "The Biden administration set limits on planet-warming emissions from existing gas and coal-fired power plants \u2013 a major step in the administration\u2019s effort to reduce greenhouse gases from the heavily polluting energy sector. Trump has long opposed such tough, climate-friendly limits and has instead promoted oil and gas development. Zeldin said the agency would reconsider the Biden administration standards to avoid constraining energy production.",
      "Coal plants emit toxic metals like mercury and the Biden administration issued a rule to severely limit those pollutants. Officials at the time said technology had progressed enough for these plants to do better. The EPA on Wednesday said nearly two dozen states had sued, arguing the rule was costly and a major burden, especially to coal plants. They also considering offering industry a two-year compliance extension while officials reconsider the rule.",
      "Hazardous metals like mercury and arsenic end up in the wastewater of steam-powered electric generating power plants like coal. These can have serious health effects including increasing cancer rates and lowering childhood IQ scores. The Biden administration tightened regulations of this wastewater. The EPA said it will revisit those \u201cstringent\u201d rules that are costly to industry and therefore may raise residential energy bills.",
      "Currently, treated wastewater generated from oil and gas drilling can be used in limited ways in certain western lands, such as for agriculture. Environmentalists say there can be a broad range of contaminants in the wastewater, some of which might not be known. The EPA said it will reconsider those rules and look at how the treated water could be used for other purposes like cooling data centers, fighting fires and other ecological needs. They say the current rules are costly, old and don\u2019t reflect the capabilities of modern treatment technologies.",
      "The Biden administration tightened safeguards against accidents for industrial and chemical plants that millions of people live near. The agency\u2019s risk management program added planning and reporting requirements for facilities and forced some to implement new safeguards. Accidents at these plants can be severe \u2013 a 2019 explosion at a Texas facility, for example, forced tens of thousands to evacuate, for example. Industry associations have criticized parts of the rule, such as requirements to publicly report sensitive information.",
      "Zeldin said Biden administration officials \u201cignored recommendations from national security experts on how their rule makes chemical and other sensitive facilities in America more vulnerable to attack.\u201d The EPA is reconsidering the rule.",
      "The EPA said it was reconsidering its mandatory greenhouse gas reporting program, which requires thousands of major industrial polluters to tell the agency about its emissions. Zeldin said the \u201cbureaucratic government program\u201d costs hundreds of millions of dollars and doesn\u2019t help air quality. Until now, the EPA said the data helped businesses compare their emissions to competitors and find opportunities to reduce them and lower costs.",
      "Zeldin vowed to review his agency\u2019s emissions standards for cars and trucks, calling the tightened emissions rules the \u201cfoundation for the Biden-Harris electric vehicle mandate.\u201d Nothing the Biden administration implemented required automakers to make and sell EVs or for consumers to buy them. Loosening standards would allow vehicles to emit more planet-warming greenhouse gases, but many automakers have already been investing in making their vehicles more efficient.",
      "The scientific finding, under the 2009 Clean Air Act, determined that planet-warming greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare. It has been at the core of the nation\u2019s action against climate change. Trump had already directed the EPA to consider the finding\u2019s \u201clegality\u201d in an executive order. Experts say the impacts of climate change on human health and the environment are already clear, and that upending the finding would be devastating.",
      "This program enforced strict rules to reduce the use of hydrofluorocarbons, highly potent and planet-warming greenhouse gases used in refrigerators, air conditioners, heat pumps and more. HFCs, as they are known, are thousands of times more powerful than carbon dioxide and leak through equipment that uses compressed refrigerants. Dozens of countries around the globe have pledged to slash their use and production of the chemicals.",
      "This rule was intended to limit air pollution by restricting power plant smokestack emissions, and those from other industrial sites, across 11 states. Eliminating it would especially impact downwind neighborhoods that are burdened by pollution from ground-level ozone, or smog, that is out of their control. However, the Supreme Court had already put a hold on the rule last summer, ruling that states challenging it were likely to prevail.",
      "These seats have long been politicized given how influential they can be in setting national environmental policy. The board reviews \u201cthe quality and relevance of the scientific and technical information being used by the EPA or proposed as the basis for Agency regulations\u201d and agency research programs. Congress directed the agency to establish the board to provide the Administrator science advice in 1978. The committee can give \u201cindependent advice\u201d to the agency\u2019s Administrator specific to the nation\u2019s Ambient Air Quality Standards.",
      "Power plants and industrial facilities release particulate matter, or soot, that can easily pass through a person\u2019s lungs and into their bloodstream. Last year, the Biden administration tightened standards regulating soot in response to scientific research indicating existing regulations were insufficient. At the time, the EPA estimated its stronger regulations would save thousands of lives and prevent hundreds of thousands of cases of asthma and lost workdays annually. The Trump administration\u2019s EPA says these regulations are \u201ca major obstacle\u201d for companies and that the U.S. has low levels of soot.",
      "These EPA standards apply to pollutants known or suspected to cause cancer, birth defects or other serious health problems. Industrial facilities are required to follow strict standards to monitor and limit the amount of these chemicals they release into the air. Last year, the EPA tightened standards surrounding ethylene oxide emissions, a human carcinogen commonly used as a sterilizer for medical equipment. The Trump administration said it is considering a \u201c2-year compliance exemption\u201d for facilities affected by these standards, among others.",
      "For decades, this EPA program has required states to reduce pollution that threatens scenic views in more than 150 national parks and wilderness areas, including in the Grand Canyon and Yellowstone. Zeldin said that the U.S. has made strides in improving visibility in national parks and that the program is being used as justification for shutting down industrial facilities and threatening affordable energy.",
      "The social cost of carbon is an EPA tool to weigh the economic costs and benefits of regulating polluting industries by putting a price tag on climate-warming carbon dioxide emissions \u2013 set at $190 per ton under the Biden administration\u2019s EPA. That calculation is used in cost-benefit analyses, and was intended to account for greenhouse gas emissions\u2019 impacts including natural disasters, crop damage, health problems and sea-level rise. Under the first Trump administration, carbon was pegged at around $5 per ton. An executive order Trump signed on his first day in office directs the EPA to consider eliminating this calculation entirely to advance his \u201cUnleashing American Energy\u201d policy.",
      "After coal is burned, ash filled with heavy pollutants including arsenic, lead and mercury is left behind and typically stored in giant pits under federal regulation. The EPA says it is now seeking to rapidly put regulation \u201cmore fully into state hands,\u201d which environmental groups fear could lead to weaker standards. Last year, the Biden administration closed a gap that had allowed companies to avoid responsibility for cleaning up inactive coal ash pits \u2013 a policy that environmental groups say could now be repealed.",

      "Hundreds of users reported FAFSA outages to Downdetector starting midday Wednesday, saying they were having trouble completing the form, which is required for financial aid at colleges nationwide. The National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators, a group of people who handle colleges' financial aid awards, also received reports of users experiencing technical issues and having trouble completing the FAFSA.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been trying to get more clarity on why it\u2019s down,\" said Allie Bidwell Arcese, a spokeswoman for NASFAA. The Education Department hadn't shared any information on the outage, she said. \u201cThe maintenance and troubleshooting may be impacted by yesterday\u2019s layoffs.\u201d",
      "The developers and IT support staff who worked on the FAFSA form were hard hit in the Education Department's layoffs Tuesday, along with staff buyouts and the termination of probationary employees. In all, the Education Department has reduced its staff by half, to roughly 2,000, since Trump took office.",
      "A list of laid-off staff obtained and verified by AP shows more than 300 people cut from Federal Student Aid \u2014 two dozen of them from Federal Student Aid's technology division. That included the entire team responsible for systems supporting the FAFSA form, a person with knowledge of the outage told The Associated Press, speaking anonymously for fear of retaliation. While laid-off staffers are still technically employed until March 21, they had limited access to their email, phones and computers, making a response to the outage difficult, the person said. At one point Wednesday, about 70 people had joined a Teams call to try to pinpoint the cause of the outage.",

      "Problems with the FAFSA had vexed the administration of former President Joe Biden, drawing rebuke from Republicans. The form was overhauled last year in an attempt to simplify it, but technical problems blocked students from submitting forms or bungled financial aid calculations.",
      "Advocates say the frustration probably led thousands of students to give up on going to college at all. Last fall, U.S. colleges saw a 5% decrease in freshmen enrollment over the previous year, and it was deeper at colleges with large numbers of low-income students, according to the National Student Clearinghouse.",

      "In February, the administration announced deep cuts to National Institutes of Health grants for research institutions, a shift that could reduce the money going to some universities by over $100 million. Some schools already have shelved projects because of the cuts, which have been delayed temporarily by a court challenge.",

      "WASHINGTON -- There sat Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the nation\u2019s top health official, at a Steak \u2019n Shake with Fox News host Sean Hannity, raving about the fries.",
      "\u201cSteak \u2019n Shake has been great, we\u2019re very grateful for them,\u201d Kennedy said, in between nibbles of fries that the Midwestern franchise recently announced would be cooked in beef tallow instead of common cooking oils that Kennedy says are bad for Americans' diet.",
      "It's the kind of endorsement that doctors have implored him to make about the childhood vaccines used to prevent deadly diseases, like measles as outbreaks worsened in Texas and New Mexico during his first month in office.",
      "The secretary of Health and Human Services has, instead, raised doubts about vaccines, most recently saying in his interview with Hannity that the shots cause \u201cdeaths every year,\" although he later added that vaccinations should be encouraged.",
      "In his first month in office, Kennedy, who vowed to \u201cMake America Healthy Again,\u201d has delivered an inconsistent message that has the nation's top infectious diseases specialists worried that his tepid recommendations of vaccines will undermine access to long-proven remedies.",
      "During his first address to thousands of workers at the federal public health agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as well as the Food and Drug Administration, Kennedy promised to \u201cinvestigate\u201d the childhood vaccine schedule. Days later, the CDC cancelled a public meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Panel, a group of doctors and scientists who make recommendations on vaccines. That meeting has not been rescheduled.",
      "In another case, a cancelled public meeting of vaccine advisers who make recommendations on the flu vaccine every year for the FDA also has not been given a new date. This week, the National Institutes for Health, also under Kennedy's purview, began cancelling funding for some research on vaccines.",
      "The CDC also is preparing to research autism and vaccines, planning to \"leave no stone unturned in its mission to figure out what exactly is happening,\u201d HHS spokesman Andrew Nixon said in a statement. Agency officials did not comment further for this article.",
      "Numerous studies have concluded that there is no link between the two, a fact the agency states on its website.",
      "\u201cWhat he is trying to do is scare about the safety of vaccines,\u201d Dr. Paul Offit, an FDA vaccine adviser and infectious disease doctor at the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia, said of Kennedy's first month in office. \u201cIt shouldn't surprise anybody. His agenda has always been to get vaccines off the market, or to make them less available.\u201d",
      "Offit worries that the cancellation of the FDA\u2019s flu vaccine meeting, held every March for at least 30 years, is just the beginning. The committee's June meeting to recommend the COVID-19 vaccine's formulation has also not been scheduled, he said.",
      "Democrats and Republicans pushed back when Dr. Marty Makary, the FDA nominee, wouldn\u2019t commit to rescheduling the committee's flu meeting .",
      "\u201cWhat is lost is the transparency,\u201d said Sen. Bill Cassidy, the Louisiana Republican who chairs the Senate health committee who is also a physician.",
      "During his senate confirmation hearings earlier this year, Kennedy repeatedly rejected any notion that he would undermine vaccines. \u201cI support vaccines. I support the childhood schedule,\u201d he said. He promised Cassidy, who was unsettled about Kennedy's anti-vaccine advocacy work, that he would not change existing vaccine recommendations.",
      "But Kennedy\u2019s skeptical views of vaccines have emerged during interviews and public statements since his confirmation.",
      "He's sent \u201cmixed messages\u201d on vaccine safety, even though the U.S. has \u201cthe most elaborate vaccine adverse event surveillance system in the world,\u201d said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University. Serious problems, including death, are very rare and the benefits of vaccination far outweigh the risks, he said.",
      "\u201cA simple way to describe this to the average person is the serious adverse events generally occur at a rate of 1 to a few cases per million doses of vaccine,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a needle in a haystack.\u201d",
      "In an opinion piece on FoxNews.com earlier this month, Kennedy said the measles outbreak in West Texas that left a six-year old child dead was a \u201ccall to action\u201d but stopped short of recommending that people receive the vaccine that prevents 97% of cases. Despite the U.S. registering its first measles death in a decade, Kennedy has repeatedly downplayed this year's outbreaks, noting that when he was a child \u201ceverybody got measles.\"",
      "This year's cases \u2014 reported at 250 \u2014 are on track to far outpace last year's reports of 286 measles infections.",
      "Pediatricians are fielding more questions from confused parents in their exam rooms, said Dr. Susan Kressly. Worried about reports of cancelled vaccine meetings, they\u2019re wondering about their access to next year\u2019s flu vaccines. Others are asking if they should get doses of the Measles, Mumps and Rubella (MMR) vaccine earlier. Kressly said there\u2019s a clear message the government can send to help stop the rising case count.",
      "\u201cThe only way to stop an outbreak is increased coordinated positive messaging around vaccinating,\u201d Kressly said.",
      "The CDC has assisted with vaccination efforts in West Texas. But Kennedy himself has publicly advocated for an alternative treatment for measles: Vitamin A. Under his watch, the CDC\u2019s guidance was updated to say that Vitamin A should be given to children with severe measles and prescribed in doses under a doctor\u2019s supervision.",
      "Vitamin A supplementation has been recommended for decades to reduce pneumonia and death in malnourished children in developing countries, but the benefits in well-nourished children in countries like the U.S. are less clear.",
      "\u201cWe need to use Vitamin A for those kids who are unlucky enough to get measles,\u201d said Dr. Andy Pavia, a pediatric infectious disease expert at the University of Utah. \u201cBut it can\u2019t prevent measles and it can only provide some help in reducing the severity.\u201d",
      "When administered correctly, using Vitamin A in kids with severe measles will \u201cdo no harm,\u201d Pavia said. But if improperly done, high doses of Vitamin A can be toxic and deadly.",
      "Abrupt staffing changes have also dominated Kennedy's first weeks in office, with CDC pick Dave Weldon withdrawing from the nomination mere minutes before his hearing, Kennedy's top HHS spokesman quitting two weeks into the job and the Food and Drug Administration's newly minted chief counsel departing 48 hours into the position.",
      "Trump and Kennedy's supporters, however, have dismissed concerns about the rocky start.",
      "His newfound platform as health secretary and talk of healthier foods is already affecting change in the American diet, advisers close to Kennedy and Trump have claimed on social media.",
      "They credit Kennedy with prompting Republican legislators to introduce bills in Utah and Texas that would ban soda in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, for example. And then there's Steak \u2018n Shake\u2019s new fries.",
      "\u201cRFK Jr. just ate Steak \u2019n Shake on live TV, the fast food joint that\u2019s bravely frying everything in beef tallow,\u201d conservative podcaster Charlie Kirk said this week in a tweet. \u201cThis is the way.\u201d",
      "On Wednesday, after a meeting with a handful of executives from the nation's largest food manufactures, Kennedy released a slickly-produced video that promised more change would be on the way, saying companies were taking his \u201cMAHA\" movement seriously.",
      "\u201cThey understand they have a new sheriff in town,\u201d Kennedy said.",
      "He did not share any details about what was discussed at the meeting.",

      "The total number of dabbling and diving ducks is down about 30% from 2017, said Brasher. Loss of grasslands habitat and a prolonged drought affecting the wetlands of the Great Plains\u2019 prairie pothole region have taken a toll. Among all waterfowl, numbers are down 20% since 2014, the report found.",

      "Chicken meat producers remain the most resistant to vaccines because of concerns they could harm meat exports, which totaled nearly $4.7 billion last year. Egg and turkey producers sell most of their products in the U.S. and have been hit hardest by the virus.",
      "Without a new policy including vaccines, the government will continue to slaughter every flock with a bird flu infection to limit the spread of the disease. Those deaths have totaled over 166 million birds in the U.S. since 2022.",
      "Most birds killed are egg-laying chickens, and the death of so many hens is the main reason egg prices keep rising. The average price per dozen has hit $5.90, and in some part of the country, it is far higher.",
      "Poultry veterinarian Simon Shane, who runs www.Egg-News.com, said the government is hesitant to use vaccines and change its policy of killing birds largely because of the meat chicken industry's opposition.",
      "\u201cBasically this is a political issue, and this only came to a head because eggs are at $8 to $9 a dozen, and it\u2019s embarrassing the government \u2014 embarrassing the present administration,\u201d Shane said.",
      "Before using vaccinations, the government must decide how to devise an effective system and monitor for outbreaks within vaccinated flocks that might not show any symptoms, said John Clifford, the USDA's former longtime chief veterinary officer, who now works with a poultry industry export group. Once that is figured out, the industry can negotiate with countries to minimize trade problems.",
      "\u201cWhat the industry wants is the ability to develop the strategic plan to share that with the trading partners and then find out what kind of impact that that will have on trade,\u201d Clifford said.",
      "There are fears that vaccinating could allow the virus to linger undetected in flocks and mutate in ways that could make it more of a threat to humans and allow sick birds to get into the food supply. Like with other diseases, properly cooking chicken to 165 degrees Fahrenheit (74 degrees Celsius) will kill bird flu, but the industry and chicken buyers don't want it there at all.",
      "For meat chicken, known as broilers, the virus isn't as significant because those birds are slaughtered at 6 to 8 weeks old and thus have less chance of being infected compared with egg-laying hens, which live to 2 years or older. Also most broilers are raised in the Southeast, which hasn't had as many outbreaks as the Midwest and West.",
      "Another delay to vaccinating concerns distribution. Egg farmers want to administer it through chicken feed or water, saying it's not practical to give shots to millions of birds in a single barn.",
      "It can also be difficult to tell the difference between a vaccinated bird and one that has been sick with the virus. That would make other countries nervous about importing meat.",
      "\u201cPeople have talked about how expensive it would be to monitor vaccinated populations. And it would be. But where do we want to spend our money?\u201d said Dr. Carol Cardona, a bird flu expert at the University of Minnesota. \u201cWe\u2019re spending our money hand over fist right now in depopulation and to buy eggs for breakfast.\u201d",
      "China and Mexico have been vaccinating their poultry for years, but they take different approaches.",
      "In Mexico chicken are vaccinated, but Clifford said the country doesn't slaughter flocks when infections are found. That basically ensures the virus is present in poultry.",
      "China still slaughters vaccinated flocks when infections are found, which has proven more effective at limiting the spread of the virus and reigning in outbreaks.",
      "Clifford said the U.S. would need to continue culling flocks with outbreaks even after vaccinating, and it might make sense to give shots only to egg layers and turkeys, not broilers.",
      "Don't expect big relief anytime soon.",
      "The USDA, which did not respond to a request for comment for this article sent last week, clearly isn't moving to vaccinate immediately. And, regardless, it will take time to raise new hens.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to wait to replace those with new hatched chicks, and it takes 20 weeks before they even start laying,\u201d Shane said. \u201cSo I don\u2019t know where they\u2019re going to get the eggs from.\u201d",
      "Prices may ease somewhat later this year after peak demand, which happens around Easter, if massive egg farms in Iowa, Ohio, California and elsewhere can avoid more outbreaks.",
      "The USDA has predicted that average egg prices will be 41% higher than the 2024 average of $3.17 per dozen. That would mean $4.47 per dozen, slightly below the current average."

      "Struggling chipmaker Intel has hired former board member and semiconductor industry veteran Lip-Bu Tan as the latest in a succession of CEOs to attempt to turn around a once-dominant company that helped define Silicon Valley.",
      "Tan, 65, will take over the daunting job next Tuesday, more than three months after Intel's previous CEO, Pat Gelsinger, abruptly retired amid a deepening downturn that triggered massive layoffs and raised questions about the chipmaker's ability to survive as an independent company.",
      "This won't be Tan's first time running a semiconductor company, nor his first association with Intel. He spent more than a decade as CEO of Cadence Design Systems, which makes software that helps designs processors, and joined Intel's board of directors in 2022 before stepping down last August. Tan will rejoin Intel's board in addition to becoming CEO.",
      "\u201cLip-Bu is an exceptional leader whose technology industry expertise, deep relationships across the product and foundry ecosystems, and proven track record of creating shareholder value is exactly what Intel needs in its next CEO,\u201d Intel's interim Executive Chairman Frank Yeary said.",
      "Intel has been led by interim co-CEOs, David Zinsner and Michelle Johnston Holthaus, since Gelsinger walked away from a job that he undertook in February 2021.",
      "Although Gelsinger arrived at Intel amid high hopes, his tenure was a major letdown as Intel's stock price plunged 60%, wiping out $160 billion in shareholder wealth. Leading up to his departure last year, Intel laid of 17,500 of its employees \u2014 about 15% of its workforce \u2014 and suspended its dividend to save money on its way to an annual loss of $19 billion.",
      "More recently, Intel delayed the opening of two new chip factories i n Ohio to ensure the projects are completed in a \u201cfinancially responsible manner.\u201d The project is supposed to draw upon the $7.8 billion in funding earmarked for Intel in the CHIPS Incentives Program created during the administration of President Joe Biden.",
      "It was the latest sign of distress for Intel, a Santa Clara, California, company that helped launch Silicon Valley by developing the microprocessors that enabled the personal computer revolution under the leadership of its CEO at that time, Andy Grove.",
      "But as its leadership changed Intel missed the technological shift to mobile computing triggered by Apple's 2007 release of the iPhone, and it's lagged more nimble chipmakers. Intel's troubles have been magnified since the advent of artificial intelligence \u2014 a booming field where the chips made by once-smaller rival Nvidia have become tech's hottest commodity.",
      "Nvida now boasts a market value of $2.8 trillion compared to Intel's $90 billion. Intel's stock price rose more than 10% in Wednesday's extended trading after Tan's hiring was announced, indicating investors believe he will revive the company's fortunes.",
      "While Tan was Cadence Design's CEO from January 2009 to May 2021, the company's stock price increased by 44-fold.",
      "Tan's past accomplishments resulted him being named winner of the Semiconductor Industry Association's 2022 Robert Noyce Award \u2014 an honor named after one of Intel's co-founders."

      "The renamed app, announced Monday and now called CBP Home, is part of the administration\u2019s campaign to encourage \u201cself-deportations, \" touted as an easy and cost-effective way to nudge along President Donald Trump\u2019s push to deport millions of immigrants without legal status.",
      "\u201cThe app provides illegal aliens in the United States with a straightforward way to declare their intent to voluntarily depart, offering them the chance to leave before facing harsher consequences,\u201d Pete Flores, the acting commissioner for U.S Customs and Border Protection, said in a statement.",
      "Moments after Trump took office, the earlier version of the app, CBP One, stopped allowing migrants to apply for asylum, and tens of thousands of border appointments were cancelled.",
      "More than 900,000 people were allowed in the country on immigration parole under CBP One, generally for two years, starting in January 2023.",

    "story": [
      "Japanese automaker Nissan says its chief executive, Makoto Uchida, is stepping down",
      "TOKYO -- Japanese automaker Nissan's chief executive, Makoto Uchida, is stepping down after the company reported dismal financial results and its merger talks with Honda collapsed.",
      "Nissan Motor Corp. said in a statement Tuesday that Ivan Espinosa, who is now the company\u2019s chief planning officer, will take Uchida\u2019s place, effective April 1.",
      "Nissan stock edged up slightly at the opening but soon slipped about 1% in early Wednesday trading in Tokyo, highlighting investors' skepticism over what was announced late the previous day.",
      "Espinosa, who joined Nissan in 2003, has spent much of his Nissan career in Mexico and Southeast Asia, overseeing product planning including the drive toward electric vehicles, meaning he's an insider perhaps less willing to take drastic action.",
      "\u201cI sincerely believe that Nissan has so much more potential than what we're seeing today,\u201d Espinosa told reporters, while stressing that he needs time to come up with details for a turnaround.",
      "He stressed his love for Nissan, noting he has developed a deep understanding of what makes the company unique and valuable.",
      "Nissan said the company leadership needed to be \u201crenewed\u201d to achieve long-term growth. Uchida, who remains as a director, expressed confidence in Espinosa as \u201ca real car guy,\u201d and stressed he was handing over the baton of leadership to better unify company ranks.",
      "\u201cI am confident that Nissan will definitely make a comeback,\u201d he said, appearing at the hastily called news conference with Espinosa.",
      "Speculation about Uchida's future was rife after he called off talks last month with Japanese rival Honda Motor Co., announced late last year, to set up a joint holding company to integrate their businesses. At the time, he told reporters the focus of the talks had changed to making Nissan into a Honda subsidiary, which he denounced as unacceptable.",
      "He also said their strategic partnership to realize synergies on specific projects like electric vehicles and other research will continue.",
      "Nissan is projecting a loss of 80 billion yen ($540 million) for the full fiscal year through the end of this month.",
      "When asked about talks with Honda and other possible partnerships, Espinosa declined comment, saying he needed more time.",
      "During Uchida\u2019s more than five years at Nissan\u2019s helm, sales faltered, including in key markets like the U.S. and China. Uchida also earlier announced the company was slashing 9,000 jobs.",
      "Analysts said Nissan's future remains precarious, with little time left, but noted Nissan may need an outsider rather than an insider like Espinosa.",
      "Todd Duvick and Will Lee, auto analysts at CreditSights, believe the focus is still on a business turnaround, not the proposed integration with Honda.",
      "\u201cNot that a turnaround could not coexist with a Honda merger, but we view it as unlikely that Nissan would be open to becoming a subsidiary of Honda at this time, at least until the board has time to assess the effectiveness of Espinosa\u2019s strategy once it is unveiled and put into action,\u201d they said in a report.",
      "It\u2019s a sad turn for the maker of the Z sportscar, loved by auto buffs around the world, and the Leaf electric car, a pioneer in that sector that launched in 2010. Besides its proud legacy, Nissan also boasts solid engineering. It recently showed off its autonomous vehicle running on regular streets near its Yokohama headquarters.",
      "Uchida joined Nissan in 2003, job-hopping from major Japanese trading company Nissho Iwai, and worked with Nissan\u2019s alliance partner Renault SA of France before overseeing Nissan\u2019s China operations.",
      "Nissan was rescued from near bankruptcy by Renault in 1999. In 2018, Carlos Ghosn, the former superstar executive sent in by Renault, was arrested by Japanese authorities on various financial misconduct charges, including under-reporting his compensation. He later fled to Lebanon, which has no extradition treaty with Japan.",
      "Nissan's tarnished corporate image after the Ghosn fiasco was a major challenge, Uchida said. So were the COVID-19 pandemic and broader shifts in the auto industry.",
      "Apart from Uchida's departure as chief executive, Nissan announced other sweeping managerial changes, including giving an expanded role to Guillaume Cartier, its chief performance officer, in global marketing and customer experience.",
      "Eiichi Akashi, corporate vice president of the Vehicle Planning and Vehicle Component Engineering Division, was named chief technology officer, succeeding Kunio Nakaguro.",
      "Teiji Hirata, a corporate vice president, will become chief \u201cmonozukuri\u201d officer and executive officer, responsible for manufacturing and supply chain management, replacing Hideyuki Sakamoto.",
      "Jeremy Papin, the chief financial officer, was also appointed to be an executive officer. There was no change for Stephen Ma, who serves as chairperson of Nissan's management committee in China.",

      "In less than a month, TikTok could have one or a few new owners, be banned again, or simply receive another reprieve to continue operating in the United States.",
      "Questions about the fate of the popular video sharing app have continued to linger since a law requiring its China-based parent company to divest or face a ban took effect on Jan. 19. After taking office, President Donald Trump gave TikTok a 75-day reprieve by signing an executive order that delayed enforcement of the statute until April 5.",
      "As he returned to Washington from his Florida home on Sunday, Trump told reporters that a deal could come soon. He did not offer any details on the interested buyers, but said the administration was in talks with \u201cfour different groups\u201d about TikTok.",
      "\u201cA lot of people want it and it\u2019s up to me,\u201d Trump said aboard Air Force One.",
      "A TikTok spokesperson declined to comment.",
      "If TikTok is not sold to an approved buyer by April 5, the original law that bans it nationwide would once again go into effect. However, the deadline for the executive order doesn't appear to be set in stone and the president has reiterated it could be extended further if needed.",
      "Trump\u2019s order came a few days after the Supreme Court unanimously upheld a federal law that required TikTok\u2019s parent company, ByteDance, to divest or be banned in January. The day after the ruling, TikTok went dark for U.S. users and came back online after Trump vowed to stall the ban.",
      "During his first term, Trump tried to ban TikTok on national security grounds, which was halted by the courts before his administration negotiated a sale of the platform that eventually failed to materialize. He changed his position on the popular app during last year's presidential election and has credited the platform with helping him win more young voters.",
      "The decision to keep TikTok alive through an executive order has received some scrutiny, but it has not faced a legal challenge in court.",
      "Although it\u2019s unclear if ByteDance plans to sell TikTok, several potential bidders have come forward in the past few months.",
      "Aides for Vice President JD Vance, who was tapped to oversee a potential deal, have reached out to some parties, such as the artificial intelligence startup Perplexity AI, to get additional details about their bids, according to a person familiar with the matter. In January, Perplexity AI presented ByteDance with a merger proposal that would combine Perplexity\u2019s business with TikTok\u2019s U.S. operation.",
      "Other potential bidders include a consortium organized by billionaire businessman Frank McCourt, which recently recruited Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian as a strategic advisor. Investors in the consortium say they\u2019ve offered ByteDance $20 billion in cash for TikTok\u2019s U.S. platform. And if successful, they plan to redesign the popular app with blockchain technology they say will provide users with more control over their online data.",
      "Jesse Tinsley, the founder of the payroll firm Employer.com, says he too has organized a consortium, which includes the CEO of the video game platform Roblox, and is offering ByteDance more than $30 billion for TikTok.",
      "Trump said in January that Microsoft was also eyeing the popular app. Other interested parties include Trump\u2019s former Treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin and Rumble, the video site popular with some conservatives and far-right groups. In a post on X last March, Rumble said it was ready to join a consortium of parties interested in purchasing TikTok and serving as a tech partner for the company.",
      "Trump has said he is looking to have the U.S. government broker a deal for 50% control of TikTok. However, the administration hasn't provided details on what exactly that would entail, or what role the U.S. government could play in the future of the short-form video app.",
      "Some potential bidders have floated proposals that would allow the U.S. to invest or own a stake in the platform. Last month, Trump himself also said the U.S. could own part of TikTok through a new government-owned investment fund.",
      "Chinese officials, who would have to approve the deal, appear to have softened their stance on the issue compared to last year when Beijing called the push for divestment a \u201crobbers\u201d act.",
      "Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said in January that business operations and acquisitions \u201cshould be independently decided by companies in accordance with market principles.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf it involves Chinese companies, China\u2019s laws and regulations should be observed,\u201d Mao said.",
      "If ByteDance sits down to negotiate, the company would likely need to iron out major details with the U.S. over the proprietary algorithm that populates TikTok feeds as well as the flow of content between the U.S. and the rest of the world.",

      "Explorers have discovered the sunken wreckage of one of the first steel cargo ships to travel the Great Lakes",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- Twenty years before the Titanic changed maritime history, another ship touted as the next great technological feat set sail on the Great Lakes.",
      "The Western Reserve was one of the first all-steel cargo ships to traverse the lakes. Built to break speed records, the 300-foot (91.4-meter) freighter dubbed \u201cthe inland greyhound\u201d by newspapers was supposed to be one of the safest ships afloat. Owner Peter Minch was so proud of her that he brought his wife and young children aboard for a summer joyride in August 1892.",
      "Then tragedy struck. As the ship entered Lake Superior's Whitefish Bay between Michigan and Canada on Aug. 30, a gale came up. With no cargo aboard, the ship was light and floating high in the water. The storm battered it until it cracked in half. Twenty-seven people perished that night, including the Minch family. The only survivor was wheelsman Harry W. Stewart, who swam a mile (1.6 kilometers) to shore after his lifeboat capsized.",
      "For almost 132 years the lake hid the wreckage. In July, explorers from the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society pinpointed the Western Reserve off Michigan's Upper Peninsula. The society announced the discovery Saturday at the annual Ghost Ships Festival in Manitowoc, Wisconsin. Executive Director Bruce Lynn called the discovery one of the society's most significant finds.",
      "\u201cThere's a number of concurrent stories that make this important,\u201d Lynn said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press. \u201cMost ships were still wooden. It was a technologically advanced ship. They were kind of a famous family at the time. You have this new ship, considered one of the safest on the lake, new tech, a big, big ship. (The discovery) is another way for us to keep this history alive.\u201d",
      "Darryl Ertel, the society's marine operations director, and his brother, Dan Ertel, spent more than two years looking for the Western Reserve.",
      "Lynn said this winter the brothers outlined a search grid. On July 22 they set out on the David Boyd, the society's research vessel. Heavy ship traffic that day forced them to alter their course, though, and search an area adjacent to their original grid, Lynn said.",
      "The brothers towed a side-scanning sonar array behind their ship. Side sonar scans to starboard and port, providing a more expansive picture of the bottom than traditional sonar mounted beneath a ship. About 60 miles (97 kilometers) northwest of Whitefish Point on the Upper Peninsula, they picked up a line with a shadow behind it in 600 feet of water. They dialed up the resolution and spotted a ship broken in two with the bow resting on the stern. Each section was 150 feet (45.2 meters) long, suggesting they'd found the Western Reserve.",
      "Eight days later, the brothers returned to the site along with Lynn. They deployed a submersible drone equipped with high-intensity lighting and a high-resolution camera. The drone returned clear images of a portside running light that match the Western Reserve's starboard running light, which had washed ashore in Canada after the ship went down. That light was the only artifact recovered from the ship.",
      "\u201cThat was confirmation day,\u201d Lynn said. \u201cIt's pretty exciting.\u201d",
      "Darryl Ertel said that discovery gave him chills \u2014 and not in a good way. \u201cKnowing how the 300-foot Western Reserve was caught in a storm this far from shore made a uneasy feeling in the back of my neck,\" he said in a society news release. \"A squall can come up unexpectedly\u2026anywhere, and anytime.\u201d",
      "The Edmund Fitzgerald, a freighter that went down in a November 1975 storm that was immortalized in the Gordon Lightfoot song, \u201cThe Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald,\" sank off Whitefish Point within 100 miles of the Western Reserve. There were no survivors."

      "As AI continues to grow, experts say that the wine industry is proof that businesses can integrate the technology efficiently to supplement labor without displacing a workforce",
      "LOS ANGELES -- When artificial intelligence-backed tractors became available to vineyards, Tom Gamble wanted to be an early adopter. He knew there would be a learning curve, but Gamble decided the technology was worth figuring out.",
      "The third-generation farmer bought one autonomous tractor. He plans on deploying its self-driving feature this spring and is currently using the tractor's AI sensor to map his Napa Valley vineyard. As it learns each row, the tractor will know where to go once it is used autonomously. The AI within the machine will then process the data it collects and help Gamble make better-informed decisions about his crops \u2014 what he calls \u201cprecision farming.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not going to completely replace the human element of putting your boot into the vineyard, and that\u2019s one of my favorite things to do,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s going to be able to allow you to work more smartly, more intelligently and in the end, make better decisions under less fatigue.\u201d",
      "Gamble said he anticipates using the tech as much as possible because of \u201ceconomic, air quality and regulatory imperatives.\u201d Autonomous tractors, he said, could help lower his fuel use and cut back on pollution.",
      "As AI continues to grow, experts say that the wine industry is proof that businesses can integrate the technology efficiently to supplement labor without displacing a workforce. New agricultural tech like AI can help farmers to cut back on waste, and to run more efficient and sustainable vineyards by monitoring water use and helping determine when and where to use products like fertilizers or pest control. AI-backed tractors and irrigation systems, farmer say, can minimize water use by analyzing soil or vines, while also helping farmers to manage acres of vineyards by providing more accurate data on the health of a crop or what a season\u2019s yield will be.",
      "Other facets of the wine industry have also started adopting the tech, from using generative AI to create custom wine labels to turning to ChatGPT to develop, label and price an entire bottle.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t see anybody losing their job, because I think that a tractor operator\u2019s skills are going to increase and as a result, and maybe they\u2019re overseeing a small fleet of these machines that are out there, and they\u2019ll be compensated as a result of their increased skill level,\u201d he said.",
      "Farmers, Gamble said, are always evolving. There were fears when the tractor replaced horses and mules pulling plows, but that technology \u201cproved itself\u201d just like AI farming tech will, he said, adding that adopting any new tech always takes time.",
      "Companies like John Deere have started using the AI that wine farmers are beginning to adopt. The agricultural giant uses \u201cSmart Apply\u201d technology on tractors, for example, helping growers apply material for crop retention by using sensors and algorithms to sense foliage on grape canopies, said Sean Sundberg, business integration manager at John Deere.",
      "The tractors that use that tech then only spray \u201cwhere there are grapes or leaves or whatnot so that it doesn\u2019t spray material unnecessarily,\u201d he said. Last year, the company announced a project with Sonoma County Winegrowers to use tech to help wine grape growers maximize their yield.",
      "Tyler Klick, partner at Redwood Empire Vineyard Management, said his company has started automating irrigation valves at the vineyards it helps manage. The valves send an alert in the event of a leak and will automatically shut off if they notice an \u201cexcessive\u201d water flow rate.",
      "\u201cThat valve is actually starting to learn typical water use,\u201d Klick said. \u201cIt\u2019ll learn how much water is used before the production starts to fall off.\u201d",
      "Klick said each valve costs roughly $600, plus $150 per acre each year to subscribe to the service.",
      "\u201cOur job, viticulture, is to adjust our operations to the climatic conditions we\u2019re dealt,\u201d Klick said. \u201cI can see AI helping us with finite conditions.\u201d",
      "Angelo A. Camillo, a professor of wine business at Sonoma State University, said that despite excitement over AI in the wine industry, some smaller vineyards are more skeptical about their ability to use the technology. Small, family-owned operations, which Camillo said account for about 80% of the wine business in America, are slowly disappearing \u2014 many don\u2019t have the money to invest in AI, he said. A robotic arm that helps put together pallets of wine, for example, can cost as much as $150,000, he said.",
      "\u201cFor small wineries, there\u2019s a question mark, which is the investment. Then there\u2019s the education. Who\u2019s going to work with all of these AI applications? Where is the training?\u201d he said.",
      "There are also potential challenges with scalability, Camillo added. Drones, for example, could be useful for smaller vineyards that could use AI to target specific crops that have a bug problem, he said \u2014 it would be much harder to operate 100 drones in a 1,000 acre vineyard while also employing the IT workers who understand the tech.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think a person can manage 40 drones as a swarm of drones,\u201d he said. \u201cSo there\u2019s a constraint for the operators to adopt certain things.\u201d",
      "However, AI is particularly good at tracking a crop\u2019s health \u2013 including how the plant itself is doing and whether it\u2019s growing enough leaves \u2013 while also monitoring grapes to aid in yield projections, said Mason Earles, an assistant professor who leads the Plant AI and Biophysics Lab at UC Davis.",
      "Diseases or viruses can sneak up and destroy entire vineyards, Earles said, calling it an \u201celephant in the room\u201d across the wine industry. The process of replanting a vineyard and getting it to produce well takes at least five years, he said. AI can help growers determine which virus is affecting their plants, he said, and whether they should rip out some crops immediately to avoid losing their entire vineyard.",
      "Earles, who is also cofounder of the AI-powered farm management platform Scout, said his company uses AI to process thousands of images in hours and extract data quickly \u2014 something that would be difficult by hand in large vineyards that span hundreds of acres. Scout's AI platform then counts and measures the number of grape clusters as early as when a plant is beginning to flower in order to forecast what a yield will be.",
      "The sooner vintners know how much yield to expect, the better they can \u201cdial in\u201d their wine making process, he added.",
      "\u201cPredicting what yields you\u2019re going to have at the end of the season, no one is that good at it right now,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s really important because it determines how much labor contract you\u2019re going to need and the supplies you\u2019ll need for making wine.\u201d",
      "Earles doesn\u2019t think the budding use of AI in vineyards is \u201cfreaking farmers out.\u201d Rather, he anticipates that AI will be used more frequently to help with difficult field labor and to discern problems in vineyards that farmers need help with.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve seen people trying to sell them tech for decades. It\u2019s hard to farm; it\u2019s unpredictable compared to most other jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cThe walking and counting, I think people would have said a long time ago, \u2018I would happily let a machine take over.\u2019\u201d",

      "The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant\u2019s radiation levels have significantly dropped since the cataclysmic meltdown 14 years ago Tuesday",
      "OKUMA, Japan -- The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant's radiation levels have significantly dropped since the cataclysmic meltdown 14 years ago Tuesday. Workers walk around in many areas wearing only surgical masks and regular clothes.",
      "It's a different story for those who enter the reactor buildings, including the three damaged in the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. They must use maximum protection \u2014 full facemasks with filters, multi-layered gloves and socks, shoe covers, hooded hazmat coveralls and a waterproof jacket, and a helmet.",
      "As workers remove melted fuel debris from the reactors in a monumental nuclear cleanup effort that could take more than a century, they are facing both huge amounts of psychological stress and dangerous levels of radiation.",
      "The Associated Press, which recently visited the plant for a tour and interviews, takes a closer look.",
      "A remote-controlled extendable robot with a tong had several mishaps including equipment failures before returning in November with a tiny piece of melted fuel from inside the damaged No. 2 reactor.",
      "That first successful test run is a crucial step in what will be a daunting, decades-long decommissioning that must deal with at least 880 tons of melted nuclear fuel that has mixed with broken parts of internal structures and other debris inside the three ruined reactors.",
      "Akira Ono, chief decommissioning officer at the Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings, which manages the plant, says even the tiny sample gives officials a lot of information about the melted fuel. More samples are needed, however, to make the work smoother when bigger efforts to remove the debris begin in the 2030s.",
      "A second sample-retrieval mission at the No. 2 reactor is expected in coming weeks.",
      "Operators hope to send the extendable robot farther into the reactor to take samples closer to the center, where overheated nuclear fuel fell from the core, utility spokesperson Masakatsu Takata said. He pointed out the target area as he stood inside the inner structure of the No. 5 reactor, which is one of two reactors that survived the tsunami. It has an identical design as No. 2.",
      "Radiation levels are still dangerously high inside the No. 2 reactor building, where the melted fuel debris is behind a thick concrete containment wall. Earlier decontamination work reduced those radiation levels to a fraction of what they used to be.",
      "In late August, small groups took turns doing their work helping the robot in 15- to 30-minute shifts to minimize radiation exposure. They have a remotely controlled robot, but it has to be manually pushed in and out.",
      "\u201cWorking under high levels of radiation (during a short) time limit made us feel nervous and rushed,\" said Yasunobu Yokokawa, a team leader for the mission. \"It was a difficult assignment.\u201d",
      "Full-face masks reduced visibility and made breathing difficult, an extra waterproof jacket made it sweaty and hard to move, and triple-layered gloves made their fingers clumsy, Yokokawa said.",
      "To eliminate unnecessary exposure, they taped around gloves and socks and carried a personal dosimeter to measure radiation. Workers also rehearsed the tasks they'd perform to minimize exposure.",
      "The mission stalled early on when workers noticed that a set of five 1.5-meter (5-foot) pipes meant to push the robot into the reactor's primary containment vessel had been arranged in the wrong order.",
      "A camera on the robot also failed because of high radioactivity and had to be replaced.",
      "The workers' highest individual radiation dose was more than the overall average but still far below anything approaching a 100-millisievert five-year dose limit.",
      "Even so, a growing number of workers are concerned about safety and radiation at the plant, said Ono, the decommissioning chief, citing an annual survey of about 5,5,00 workers.",
      "In 2023, two workers splashed with contaminated sludge at a water treatment facility suffered burns and were hospitalized, though they had no other health problems.",
      "Yokokawa and a plant colleague, Hiroshi Ide, helped in the 2011 emergency and work as team leaders today. They say they want to make the job safer as workers face high radiation in parts of the plant.",
      "On the top floor of the No. 2 reactor, workers are setting up equipment to remove spent fuel units from the cooling pool. That's set to begin within two to three years.",
      "At the No. 1 reactor, workers are putting up a giant roof to contain radioactive dust from decontamination work on the top floor ahead of the removal of spent fuel.",
      "To minimize exposure and increase efficiency, workers use a remote-controlled crane to attach pre-assembled parts, according to TEPCO. The No. 1 reactor and its surroundings are among the most contaminated parts of the plant.",
      "Workers are also removing treated radioactive wastewater. They recently started dismantling the emptied water tanks to make room to build facilities needed for the research and storage of melted fuel debris.",
      "After a series of small missions by robots to gather samples, experts will determine a larger-scale method for removing melted fuel, first at the No. 3 reactor.",
      "Experts say the hard work and huge challenges of decommissioning the plant are just beginning. There are estimations that the work could take more than a century. The government and TEPCO have an initial completion target of 2051, but the retrieval of melted fuel debris is already three years behind, and many big issues remain undecided.",
      "Ide, whose home in Namie town, northwest of the plant, is in a no-go zone because of nuclear contamination, still has to put on a hazmat suit, even for brief visits home.",
      "\u201cAs a Fukushima citizen, I would like to make sure the decommissioning work is done properly so that people can return home without worries,\u201d he said."

      "A bipartisan group of lawmakers urge the Trump administration to scrap plans to kill more than 450,000 invasive barred owls in West Coast forests in coming decades",
      "A bipartisan group of lawmakers on Monday urged the Trump administration to scrap plans to kill more than 450,000 invasive barred owls in West Coast forests as part of efforts to stop the birds from crowding out a smaller type of owl that's facing potential extinction.",
      "The 19 lawmakers \u2014 led by Republican Rep. Troy Nehls, a Texas conservative, and Democrat Rep. Sydney Kamlager-Dove, a California liberal \u2014 claimed the killings would be \u201cgrossly expensive\u201d and cost $3,000 per bird.",
      "They questioned if the shootings would help native populations of northern spotted owls, which have long been controversial because of logging restrictions in the birds' forest habitat beginning in the 1990s, and the closely related California spotted owl.",
      "Barred owls are native to eastern North America and started appearing in the Pacific Northwest in the 1970s. They\u2019ve quickly displaced many spotted owls, which are smaller birds that need larger territories to breed.",
      "An estimated 100,000 barred owls now live within a range that contains only about 7,100 spotted owls, according to federal officials.",
      "Under a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service plan approved last year, trained shooters would target barred owls over 30 years across a maximum of about 23,000 square miles (60,000 square kilometers) in California, Oregon and Washington.",
      "The plan did not include a cost estimate. But the lawmakers said in a letter to Interior Secretary Doug Burgum that it could top $1.3 billion based on extrapolating costs from a grant awarded to the the Hoopa Valley Native American Tribe in California to kill up to 1,500 barred owls.",
      "\u201cThis is an inappropriate and inefficient use of U.S. taxpayer dollars,\u201d the lawmakers wrote. \"This latest plan is an example of our federal government attempting to supersede nature and control environmental outcomes at great cost.\u201d",
      "A U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service spokesperson did not immediately respond to questions about the cost estimate and the owl removal program. The agency's plan called for more than 2,400 barred owls to be removed this year and for that number to ramp up to more than 15,500 birds annually beginning in 2027.",
      "Scientists for years have been shooting barred owls on an experimental basis and officials say the results show the strategy could halt spotted owl declines. As of last year, about 4,500 barred owls were killed on the West Coast by researchers since 2009.",
      "Killing one bird species to save others has divided wildlife advocates and is reminiscent of past government efforts to save West Coast salmon by killing sea lions and cormorants. Or when, to preserve warblers, cowbirds that lay eggs in warbler nests were killed. The barred owl removals would be among the largest such effort to date involving birds of prey, researchers and wildlife advocates said.",
      "Barred owls arrived in the Pacific Northwest via the Great Plains, where trees planted by settlers gave them a foothold, or via Canada\u2019s boreal forests, which have become warmer and more hospitable as the climate changes, researchers said.",
      "Their spread has undermined decades of spotted owl restoration efforts that previously focused on protecting forests where they live. That included logging restrictions under former President Bill Clinton that ignited bitter political fights and temporarily helped slow the spotted owl\u2019s decline.",

      "The driverless technology from Nissan Motor Corp., which uses 14 cameras, nine radars and six LiDar sensors installed in and around the vehicle, highlights Japan's eagerness to catch up with players like Google\u2019s Waymo that have taken the lead in the U.S.",
      "Japan, home to the world\u2019s top automakers, has not kept pace with the global shift to autonomous driving, so far led by China and the U.S. But momentum is building.",

      "\u201cHow the sensors must be adapted to the car\u2019s movements, or to monitor sensors and computers to ensure reliability and safety requires an understanding of the auto system overall,\u201d he said during a recent demonstration that took reporters on a brief ride.",
      "Nissan\u2019s technology, being tested on its Serena minivan, is still technically at the industry's Level Two because a person sits before a remote-control panel in a separate location outside the vehicle, in this case, at the automaker's headquarters, and is ready to step in if the technology fails.",
      "Nissan also has a human sitting in the front passenger seat during the test rides, who can take over the driving, if needed. Unless there is a problem, the people in the remote control room and the passenger seat are doing nothing.",
      "Nissan plans to have 20 such vehicles moving in the Yokohama area in the next couple of years, with the plan to reach Level Four, which means no human involvement even as backup, by 2029 or 2030.",

      "After one of the worst single day sell-offs in Tesla's history, President Donald Trump threw his support behind his advisor, billionaire Elon Musk, vowing to buy one of his cars on Tuesday.",
      "Tesla has been pummeled this year under competition from rival electric vehicles, particularly out of China, as well as his close association with Trump and with far right causes globally.",
      "Shares have plummeted 45% in 2025 and on Monday tumbled more than 15% to $222.15, the lowest since late October, reflecting newfound pessimism as sales crater around the globe.",
      "In an overnight post on his Truth Social platform, Trump said Musk is \u201cputting it on the line\u201d to help the country. Trump claimed in the post that \u201cRadical Left Lunatics\u201d were attempting to \u201cillegally and collusively boycott Tesla, one of the World's great automakers, and Elon's \u2018baby.\"",
      "The stock climbed more than 3% before the market open on Tuesday.",
      "Numerous auto industry analysts have attributed Tesla's recent sagging stock \u2014 and auto sales \u2014 to Musk's support of Trump and other far right candidates around the world. In recent days, Tesla showrooms in the U.S. have been besieged by protesters, its vehicles vandalized on the street. Tesla owners, perhaps in a bid to avoid being targeted, have placed bumper stickers on their cars with messages like, \u201cI bought it before Elon went nuts.\u201d",

      "Musk has become the face of the Trump administration's slash-and-burn government downsizing efforts, known as the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. The department has promised massive federal worker layoffs and aims to drastically reduce government spending.",
      "Analysts have said Musk's shift to right-wing politics doesn't appear to sit well with potential Tesla buyers, generally perceived to be wealthy and progressive consumers.",
      "Tesla sales are falling precipitously in California, the company's biggest U.S. market, and the company recorded its first annual global sales decline last year. Similarly, Tesla sales plunged 45% in Europe in January, according to research firm Jato Dynamics, even as overall electric vehicle sales rose. The sales numbers were particularly bad in Germany and France.",
      "The latest auto sales figure from China show that Tesla sales there have been nearly halved from February a year ago, although the decline is largely due increased competition from domestic EV companies.",
      "But sales in the U.S. have fallen due to competition, and a country sharply divided about Trump.",
      "U.S. Analysts at UBS Global Research expect deliveries to fall 5% in the first quarter and full year compared to the same periods for 2024.",
      "\u201cOur UBS Evidence Lab data shows low delivery times for the Model 3 and Model Y (generally within two weeks) in key markets which we believe is indicative of softer demand,\u201d they wrote.",
      "In addition to backing Trump, Musk has also shown support for the far-right, pro-Russian, anti-Muslim party in German y, called the British p rime minister an \u201cevil tyrant\u201d and called Canada \u2014 a major Tesla market \u2014\"not a real country.\u201d",
      "Tesla is not the only Musk-led company to run into trouble recently. His X social media platform crashed several times on Monday, which Musk claimed was a \u201cmassive\" cyberattack.

      "The move prevented Democrats from forcing GOP to go on the record on tariffs.",
      "In a sneaky legislative maneuver tied into the effort to pass a funding bill and avert a government shutdown, House Republicans earlier this week successfully blocked Democrats from forcing votes and debate on President Donald Trump's controversial tariffs.",
      "It was a somewhat complicated move. But it worked -- and demonstrated that Republicans are attempting to give cover to Trump and his implementation of sweeping tariffs on top U.S. trading partners that have roiled the stock market and stoked diplomatic tensions.",
      "Had Democrats forced a vote and debate on the tariffs, it could have forced Republicans to go on the record on Trump's tariff agenda -- perhaps splitting with the president's actions.",
      "To tee up Speaker Mike Johnson's temporary government funding bill, which the House passed Tuesday evening, the House first needed to pass what's known as \"a rule.\" Buried inside the text of that rule was legislative language that prevents Democrats from forcing a potentially politically painful vote to end Trump's tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China.",
      "How could Democrats compel a vote to end the tariffs?",
      "Trump imposed tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China by declaring illegal migration and fentanyl constituted a national emergency under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and the National Emergencies Act.",
      "But, here's the catch: under the NEA, Congress has the authority to move quickly to terminate that emergency declaration. Top House Democrats tried to do that last week.",
      "But inside that rule, which passed along party lines and cleared the way for a vote on the House GOP's stopgap funding bill, was a provision prohibiting lawmakers from forcing a vote to terminate the president's border emergency and the resulting tariffs until at least January 2026.",
      "The section reads, \"Each day for the remainder of the first session of the 119th Congress shall not constitute a calendar day for purposes of section 202 of the National Emergencies Act with respect to a joint resolution terminating a national emergency declared by the President on February 1, 2025.\"",
      "Democrats are blasting the move.",
      "\"Guess what they tucked into this rule, hoping nobody would notice? They slipped in a little clause letting them escape ever having to debate or vote on Trump's tariffs. Isn't that clever?\" Rep. Jim McGovern, the ranking member on the House Rules Committee, said during floor debate Tuesday.",
      "Congress could still approve a joint resolution to terminate the president's national emergency. That would require the support of both rank-and-file GOP lawmakers and House Republican leadership, which is unlikely.",
      "Democratic Rep. Don Beyer blasted the maneuver on \"ABC News Live Prime with Linsey Davis\" Tuesday.",
      "Asked about the Republicans' move and if Democrats have any way around it, Beyer said \"not really,\" calling it \"tragic.\"",
      "\"Once again, Trump has ignored existing law and the Constitution with all the tariffs he's been announcing in recent weeks,\" Beyer said. \"He inherited on Jan. 20 the strongest economy this country has ever had. And we are rapidly heading towards recession right now just because of the extraordinary uncertainty in business decisions and capital investment and hiring decisions.\"",

      "\"I care deeply about who Michigan will elect as Governor and send to the U.S. Senate next year, but I have decided against competing in either race,\" Buttigieg wrote on X. \"I remain enthusiastic about helping candidates who share our values - and who understand that in this moment, leadership means not only opposing today's cruel chaos, but also presenting a vision of a better alternative.\"",
      "Buttigieg's announcement comes as Democrats grapple both with being locked out of power in Washington and the prospect of defending multiple key Senate seats in the 2026 midterms.",
      "A lot can happen between now and the next presidential race, but there is little doubt that's what the former secretary is gearing up for. A source familiar with Buttigieg's thinking said they believe this move puts him in the strongest possible position to run in 2028 and running for governor or senator in 2026 would have taken that off the table.",

      "Buttigieg did not mention any specific plans for the future or his own plans, he said, include talking to \"both legacy and digital media,\" talking with people around the Midwest, and \"engaging partners, allies, friends and strangers in the service of a more convincing and widespread account of American prosperity than either side has so far offered\" -- seemingly sending a dig at both the Republican Party and his own Democratic Party. He mentioned neither party by name.",
      "Without calling out President Donald Trump by name either, Buttigieg called the United States \"demonstrably less free, less secure, less democratic - and less prosperous - than it was just ten weeks ago,\" and said that people need to both show a positive vision of a \"better future\" for America and to be creative over \"where we make our case\" given that how Americans receive information has changed.",
      "Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, first rose to national prominence when he ran in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary. He served in President Joe Biden's Cabinet as secretary of the Department of Transportation, becoming the first openly gay Cabinet secretary to be confirmed by the Senate.",
      "During Biden's 2024 presidential campaign -- and later, Vice President Kamala Harris's own campaign after Biden left the race -- Buttigieg served as a key campaign surrogate and was floated as a potential running mate for Harris, who ultimately chose Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.",

For the last several years, the U.S. has been the largest producer of oil and natural gas in the world.",
      "\"There's no crisis or emergency by any conventional standard or use of the word,\" Noah Kaufman, a senior researcher at Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy, told ABC News.",
      "Trump campaigned heavily on the promise of increasing fossil fuel production but there has not been any significant increase in drilling over the last several months, Bob Howarth, a professor of ecology and environmental biology and a faculty fellow at Cornell University's Atkinson Center for Sustainability, told ABC News",
      "\"And I don't think there's likely to be,\" he added.",
      "With oil prices remaining steady, the oil and gas industry may not even be incentivized to drill more, the experts said.",
      "As of Tuesday, the price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil, the key benchmark for oil prices in the U.S., was about $66 per barrel -- \"not crazy-high,\" Kaufman said.",
      "\"They're not going to increase drilling if they lose money by doing so,\" Howarth said.",
      "The world doesn't need more oil, despite Trump's suggestions that the U.S. is not producing nearly enough, the experts said. The U.S. may be the largest exporter of natural gas in the world, but global demand is falling -- with countries in Europe and Asia decreasing their use of fossil fuels as renewables such as wind, solar, batteries and electric vehicles, eat away at the demand for fossil fuels, Nemet said.",
      "\"It's cheaper and more energy secure for them to use renewable power,\" Howarth said.",
      "Trump's attempts to bring oil and gas back to the forefront will set the U.S. behind compared to other G2 countries and their climate goals. the experts said. China and Europe are rapidly developing renewables energy.",
      "\"We're doing nothing like that here,\" Howarth said.",
      "The Trump administration is \"disingenuously\" using the rhetoric of an energy crisis to promote fossil fuels, speed the permitting of extraction projects and justify the bypassing of environmental reviews, David Konisky, a professor of environmental politics at Indiana University's O'Neill School of Public and Environmental Affairs, told ABC News.",
      "The messaging of an energy emergency is also the administration's attempt to defend its ideological goals of deregulation and reversal of Biden-era efforts to address climate change, Konisky said.",
      "A lot of of the momentum for solar, wind and other clean energy sources in recent years came from tax credits and other policies in the Inflation Reduction Act, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law other legislation passed during the Biden administration, Kaufman said. Trump promised during the campaign to rescind all unspent funds from the IRA.",
      "While there may no shortage of fossil fuels in sight, climate scientists and international communities continue to warn of the climate consequences the planet is facing if worldwide production of fossil fuels -- the main culprit for global warming -- are not drastically reduced in the near future.",
      "The development of the U.S. as a fossil fuel superpower is a \"brazen disregard\" for climate action, Matt Huber, a professor in Syracuse University's geography and environment department, told ABC News",
      "\"We don't have an energy crisis,\" Howarth said. \"What we have is a climate crisis.\"",

    "story": [
      "Outside groups have poured millions into ads and campaign efforts in the race.",
      "Wisconsin Supreme Court candidates Brad Schimel and Susan Crawford sparred over how the court might impact abortion law in the state, as well as the involvement of Elon Musk in the high-profile race, during a Wisconsin Supreme Court election debate on Wednesday night in Milwaukee, Wisconsin hosted by ABC affiliate WISN.",
      "Wisconsin is holding a Supreme Court election on April 1, as part of its spring elections, with what is technically a nonpartisan race to replace retiring justice Ann Walsh Bradley.",
      "Whoever wins the seat will help determine the ideological bent of the court -- which currently leans liberal -- and will join the bench as the court grapples with hot-button issues such as abortion access and redistricting.",
      "Outside groups have poured millions into ads and get-out-the-vote efforts. Conservative groups affiliated with Musk have spent millions in the race supporting Schimel, while liberal billionaire George Soros donated to the Wisconsin Democratic Party, and the state party has donated $2 million to Crawford.",
      "Crawford, the Democratic-backed candidate and a Dane County Circuit judge, is a former private attorney.",
      "\"I think a lot is at stake. The future of our state, for our kids and our grandkids, and the fundamental rights and freedoms of everyone in Wisconsin,\" Crawford said.",
      "Schimel, the candidate backed by Republicans, is a former state attorney general who is currently a circuit court judge in Waukesha County.",
      "\"I've never been involved in anything where the stakes were bigger than this,\" he said. \"And if you told me five years ago, the Wisconsin Supreme Court would be going through a political agenda, I would have said, 'you're crazy' \u2026 Justice is no longer blind on the Wisconsin Supreme Court; that's what's at stake. We have to restore objectivity.\"",
      "It took little time for one of the race's key issues -- abortion access -- to come up, given ongoing and pending court cases surrounding whether an 1849 Wisconsin law that bans almost all abortions is valid or constitutional. The law is currently not enforced.",
      "Crawford seized upon Schimel's remark about objectivity to claim that Schimel was paying \"good lip service\" to objectivity, but that while campaigning he had opined about pending cases such as those dealing with the 1849 law.",
      "\"He has openly said, when he's in front of audiences of his political allies, that there is nothing wrong with that law and it should be enforced. That is not the kind of open-mindedness that we expect from judges. It is prejudicial to the parties in that case,\" Crawford said, referencing audio that had leaked from an event Schimel spoke at where he asked if there were any flaws with the law.",
      "\"And Brad Schimel is making those pronouncements not based on the law in that case or the facts or the arguments of the attorneys, but based on political consideration.\"",
      "Schimel -- interjecting \"I can't let that go\" -- countered that his remarks had been taken out of context and that he was referring to the validity of the way the law was passed.",
      "\"I was asked if the 1849 [law] was a valid law ... And the answer is, my answer was, it was passed by two houses of the legislature and signed by the governor. That means it's a valid law. But what I said next was that there's a real question as to whether that law reflects the will of the people of Wisconsin now and today,\" Schimel said.",
      "Pressed on if he thinks the law is valid today, Schimel added, \"I don't believe that it reflects the will of the people of Wisconsin today.\"",
      "Crawford later accused Schimel of trying to \"backpedal\" his position on the law, while Schimel later said he thinks the current Wisconsin Supreme Court is \"playing politics\" by not ruling on one of the cases surrounding the 1849 law yet.",
      "The sheer amount of money in the race also became a major flashpoint during the debate.",
      "Asked if he embraced the support of Musk, Schimel framed investments from Musk-related groups as beyond his control.",
      "\"I got in this race over 15 months ago. I have campaigned in all 72 counties; I've gone to every corner of this state. I'm looking for the endorsement of the Wisconsin voters on April 1. Outside help that comes is not something I control,\" Schimel said.",
      "He also criticized Crawford for allegedly getting support from Soros. When asked if she embraces that endorsement, Crawford responded, \"I have had generous contributions that have gone to the Democratic Party of Wisconsin. The Democratic Party of Wisconsin has endorsed me and supported my candidacy. But let's talk about Elon Musk. Talk about somebody who's been dangerous,\" she said, mentioning some examples of cuts Musk has overseen in the federal government.",
      "Crawford suggested that Musk is interested in the race because of a lawsuit brought by his company, Tesla, in the state.",
      "Tesla has a lawsuit against the state over not being allowed to open dealerships in the state. Wisconsin law largely prohibits manufacturers from opening dealerships. Some have speculated that Musk's interest in the race stems from this suit; Musk and Tesla have not confirmed this.",
      "Later, during another back-and-forth about donors in the race, Crawford referenced \"Elon Schimel.\"",
      "\"I have support from all over the country, and it is because Elon Schimel is trying to buy this race. And people are very upset about that, and they are disturbed about that,\" Crawford said.",
      "Schimel, asked if the mailers from outside groups that say he would enforce President Donald Trump's agenda in the state are true, countered again that he cannot control what outside groups say.",
      "\"I will enforce the law,\" he added. \"I will apply the law the way the legislature has written it. If President Trump or anyone defies Wisconsin law, and I end up with a case in front of me, I'll hold them accountable as I would anybody in my courtroom.\"",
      "Later, when asked about the 2020 Wisconsin Supreme Court decision where the court blocked an attempt by the Trump campaign to invalidate around 220,000 absentee ballots, Schimel was similarly blunt over how he would act if Trump brought a case.",
      "\"If President Trump violates the law or President Trump brings a lawsuit that he's wrong on the law -- of course I would. I don't have any personal loyalty to him that supersedes the oath I take as a judge.\"",
      "He declined to weigh in on whether a justice who recused himself from that case made the right decision, saying he'd have to review the case.",
      "Crawford sidestepped when asked if she would recuse herself from cases involving the Democratic Party of Wisconsin, while Schimel sidestepped similarly over if he would recuse himself from the Tesla case.",

      "Joe Murphy, whose position as a management and data analyst was eliminated when the Department of Education laid off nearly 50% of its workforce Tuesday evening, said on Wednesday that he and his colleagues are filled with a sense of \"sadness\" and \"disbelief.\"",
      "\"We got the sense that we were disposable in a certain sense, especially those of us in the data space,\" he told ABC News.",
      "According to Murphy, everyone he worked with directly had their positions terminated.",
      "The 56-year-old from Dumfries, Virginia, said he has spent almost 20 years in education data, previously working for the National Center for Education Statistics, in addition to serving as a contractor for a formula grant data collection space in the Education Department.",
      "In the Department of Government Efficiency's latest efforts to cut federal costs, some 1,315 Education Department employees were affected by the \"reduction in force\" notices, leaving 2,183, according to senior officials at the agency.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt defended the job cuts on Wednesday, referring to them as \"a promise made and a promise kept.\"",
      "\"There is no reason that we should be spending more than most developed countries in the world. And our education system is failing,\" she added. \"The president wants to return education back to the states, empower those closest to the people to make these very important decisions for our children's lives. And this is a first step in that process.\"",
      "Though Murphy said the terminations were expected, he said the experience has still been disconcerting.",
      "\"Nothing surprises me anymore, but it's still kind of shocking and impactful,\" he said.",
      "\"I do not know where I go forward from here ... I am suddenly belched out into a job market that has been at the very same time, severely constricted and also completely flooded with people who have a similar skill set to mine. I'm 56 years old,\" Murphy continued, adding that he has spend \"more than a third of [his] entire life\" in this line of work.",
      "\"Felt really weird to wake up this morning and be like, wow, what am I gonna do?\" he said.",
      "Murphy emphasized how the most important and rewarding aspect of his job, which falls under the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education, was serving the nation's children.",
      "\"It's really for the kids, and what we do is for the kids. And so many of us feel that way,\" he said, adding that he \"wish[es] things went differently.\"",
      "\"That's the thing I have the greatest sense of pride in. I would think, you know, doing a good job and getting the data to the programs in the right timely fashion -- good, accurate data, so that they can make decisions on behalf of, you know, 100,000 schools in this country and 18,000 districts and 50-something state education agencies,\" he explained.",
      "When asked if he believes children will continue to receive needed educational benefits and services, Murphy projected a bleak outlook and expressed his belief that \"we're politicizing the department of education and the education of our students.\"",
      "He also expressed concern over whether his work will even be able to continue.",
      "\"So, all that work that we did for the programs, I don't know who's going to do it now or be able to do it. The folks in the programs were already overwhelmed. They were so grateful to us for the work that we did for them in distilling down this massive amount of data to a few answers with groundwork that they laid together with us,\" he said. \"So, I don't know where that's going to get done.\"",
      "Murphy is a member of the American Federation of Government Employees union, which he says he joined only recently due to the change in administrations from Biden to Trump.",
      "\"When it seemed to be going south and everybody was taking over after the inauguration, I said, okay, well, I'm gonna go ahead and sign up,\" he said, explaining how he was affected by the \"last two months of being led by threats and intimidation.\"",
      "\"I don't necessarily disagree with the idea that the federal government needed some improvements and some restructuring to some degree,\" Murphy acknowledged. \"But how you do it really matters, and you can't just ... the federal government is not a private business, and you can't run it that way.\"",

    "story": [
      "Ethics experts say the event could show a president's endorsement is for sale.",
      "President Donald Trump and Elon Musk\u2019s controversial showcase of Tesla cars in front of the White House has set off alarms around Washington over what some see as an infomercial for the billionaire\u2019s car company on high-profile government property.",
      "Ethics experts ABC News spoke with are raising concerns that the Tuesday event could blur or even cross the lines of what's considered proper conduct by elected officials.",
      "\"It could be reasonably assumed by some that the White House and the president\u2019s endorsement is up for sale,\" William F. Hall, an adjunct professor of political science at Webster University, said Wednesday.",
      "The event happened hours after Trump posted he was going to buy a Tesla following the company\u2019s mass protests and a major decline in stock value and sales across the world. When reporters asked Trump about the optics of the event, he didn't deny that he was doing it to help Musk's bottom line.",
      "\"I think he's been treated very unfairly by a very small group of people. And I just want people to know that he can't be penalized for being a patriot. And he's a great patriot, and he's also done an incredible job with Tesla,\" he told reporters, adding that Musk hadn't asked him for anything. Musk later thanked Trump on X.",
      "Hall, who previously served in the Justice Department as a field director during the Reagan, Bush and Clinton administrations, said it is not uncommon for presidents to lend support to American companies but that it's usually done outside of the White House at other locations such as at a factory or an office space.",
      "\"As the elected leader of our nation, I think it would not be at all difficult for the average American who might have viewed that to reasonably interpret that he was endorsing this product,\" he said.",
      "Delaney Marsco, Director of Ethics for the Campaign Legal Center, a non-profit legal group, told ABC News that ethics laws primarily focus on executive employees serving under the president but not on the president himself.",
      "She said that was because lawmakers who wrote those rules did not anticipate any president disregarding longstanding standards of what's expected and acceptable.",
      "\"One of the things we have relied on in ethics norms are the norms about what is right. President Trump doesn't abide by those norms,\" she said.",
      "Marsco added that Musk's vaguely-defined role as a presidential adviser, as well as his being the CEO of tech companies that do business with the government, also raised serious concerns given Tuesday's event. She noted she expected that Musk's behavior wasn't being questioned just on the political front.",
      "\"I'm sure shareholders are concerned about this line being blurred, and it's equally confusing for the public,\" she said.",
      "Tesla's stock dived over the last couple of weeks but saw a slight increase after Trump checked out Musk's vehicles at the White House. Hall noted that Tesla and Musk have been on the receiving end of protests due to his actions and words since he got more involved with Trump.",
      "The president claimed he was going to write a check for one of the cars full price and provide it for the White House staff, however, it was not clear as of Wednesday evening if that actually happened.",
      "The ethics experts warned that the move may set an unprecedented standard for future presidents, one that diminishes the objectivity of the executive branch.",
      "\"The federal government isn't in the business of endorsing products to buy. The federal government is supposed to be making policy decisions that better the lives of the American public not making endorsements of the president's friends or the president's donors,\" Marso said.",
      "Marsco added that there is nothing stopping Trump or future presidents from making these unethical decisions, however, those ethics laws governing the executive branch can be strengthened by lawmakers, especially if there is outcry from the public.",
      "\"When you start talking about ethics some people don't understand the ethic laws and what they entail \u2026 but the public isn't stupid,\" she said. \"They know what a conflict of interest is and what the government is supposed to do for them. The public knows this is not the right use of the office of a president, to endorse a product that is a friend and a major political donor.\"",

      "But as of this week, nearly all of the agency's 130 staffers have been fired, according to the former employees, gutting the agency and raising questions about how it can continue its work to measure the performance of the country's 18,000 school districts and efficacy of any policy changes.",

It does it in a neutral and nonpartisan way.\"",
      "It also coordinates the country's participation in the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), which measures the performance of American students against others around the world.",
      "The cancellation of agency contracts has also frozen essential data collection for the agency, former employees told ABC News. That, together with mass layoffs, could jeopardize the quality and value of future reports the agency -- in whatever shape it is left in -- is required by Congress to produce.",
      "Trying to collect and analyze the vast troves of data required to produce reports like the \"Nation's Report Card\" without a full staff \"would be the equivalent of manning a 13-person sailboat with a 12-month-old,\" one employee who was fired this week told ABC News. \"It's not possible.\"",
      "While it's not clear what will happen to the agency, former employees speculated that the Trump administration could follow the recommendations of the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 proposal and merge NCES with the Commerce Department's Census Bureau.",

      "\"Today's NAEP results reveal a heartbreaking reality for American students and confirm our worst fears: not only did most students not recover from pandemic-related learning loss, but those students who were the most behind and needed the most support have fallen even further behind,\" the department said in a statement.",

      "ANCHORAGE, Alaska -- A volcano near Alaska\u2019s largest city is showing new signs of unrest, with experts saying the likelihood of an eruption at Mount Spurr in the next few weeks or months has increased.",
      "The Alaska Volcano Observatory said Wednesday that it had measured during recent overflights \u201csignificantly elevated volcanic gas emissions,\u201d and said signs indicated an eruption was likely, though not certain, in the weeks or months ahead.",
      "\u201cWe expect to see further increases in seismic activity, gas emissions and surface heating prior to an eruption, if one were to occur,\u201d the observatory said in a statement. \u201cSuch stronger unrest may provide days to weeks of additional warning.\u201d",
      "It is an 11,070-foot (3,374-meter) tall, ice- and snow-covered volcano roughly 80 miles (129 kilometers) northwest of Anchorage.",
      "Mount Spurr is one of 53 volcanoes in Alaska that have been active within the last 250 years. It has two main vents.",
      "The last known eruption from the summit vent was more than 5,000 years ago. The Crater Peak vent, meanwhile, erupted once in 1953 and three times in 1992, according to the observatory. The Crater Peak vent is about 2 miles (3 kilometers) south of the summit.",
      "There have been periods of increased earthquake or other activity since then, including between 2004 and 2006, but no other eruptions. Last October, the observatory raised its alert status for Mount Spurr from green to yellow when an increase in seismic activity became pronounced and a ground deformation was spotted in satellite data.",
      "The most likely outcome of the current unrest would be an eruption or eruptions similar to those in 1953 and 1992, the observatory said.",
      "However, \u201cIt is also possible that no eruption occurs and the present activity slowly dies away or that a smaller eruption takes place,\u201d John Power, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey at the observatory, wrote in an email.",
      "The eruptions during the last century lasted between three and seven hours, produced ash columns that rose more than 50,000 feet (15,240 meters) above sea level and deposited ashfall in south-central Alaska communities, according to the observatory.",
      "In 1992, ashfall of about a quarter-inch in Anchorage prompted residents to stay inside or to wear masks if going outside to avoid breathing ash. The cloud drifted as far as Greenland.",
      "Volcanic ash is angular and sharp and has been used as an industrial abrasive. The powdered rock can cause a jet engine to shut down.",
      "The 1992 eruptions prompted the temporary closures of airports in Anchorage and other communities.",
      "Closing airports can be more than an inconvenience in a state where most communities aren't connected to Alaska's main road system. Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport also is among the world\u2019s busiest cargo hubs.",

      "California corrections officials say high-security prisons across the state are tightly restricting movement, calls and visits while they probe a surge in violence this year",
      "High-security prisons across California have tightly restricted movement, calls and visits while officials probe a surge in violence this year.",
      "The restrictions started Saturday and affect the top-security sections of nearly a dozen lockups including the California Correctional Institution, California State Prison-Los Angeles County and California State Prison-Sacramento.",
      "Under the protocols, meals must be delivered directly to housing units and showers and any other movements must be done in a \u201ccontrolled manner,\u201d the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation said in a statement.",
      "Calls by telephone and ViaPath tablet are also restricted, as are visitations.",
      "Prisoners still have access to medical care, legal proceedings and other \u201ccritical appointments,\u201d corrections officials said.",
      "\u201cIt is important to note this modified program is distinct from a lockdown and applies exclusively to Level IV housing units,\u201d the statement said.",
      "Asked for more information about the restrictions, CDCR spokesperson Terri Hardy said only that officials are conducting a \u201ccomprehensive investigation into underlying causes of violent incidents at Level IV facilities throughout the state. The investigation continues.\u201d",
      "Corrections officials are investigating seven deaths since the beginning of the year as homicides. Three of those happened the day before the restrictions were announced by the Corrections department.",
      "Joshua L. Peppers, 39, was attacked by another prisoner at the Los Angeles County institution March 7 and died at a medical facility, corrections officials said in a statement. He was serving a sentence for second-degree robbery.",
      "That same morning Jake T. Kennedy, 32, was found stabbed multiple times in his cell at the Sacramento prison, according to corrections officials. He died at a triage and treatment area, and an improvised weapon was found. He was serving time for carrying a concealed bladed weapon and for a subsequent prison assault.",
      "And hours later German M. Merino, 37, died after he was attacked by two inmates in Kern Valley State Prison, authorities said. He was serving a life sentence for first-degree murder.",
      "Prison violence is a longstanding problem as people serving life sentences have little to lose.",
      "In January, for example, Mario Campbell, 36, was attacked on the main exercise yard at the Sacramento prison by two inmates serving live with the possibility of parole, according to corrections officials. He died at a medical facility about an hour and a half later, and officers found three improvised weapons.",
      "The restrictions will stay in place until the investigation is completed. It\u2019s unclear how long that could take.",
      "Last year there were 32 homicides in state lockups, according to the California Correctional Health Care Services."

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Egg prices again reached a record high in February, as the bird flu continues to run rampant and Easter and Passover approach.",
      "The latest monthly Consumer Price Index showed a dozen Grade A eggs cost an average of $5.90 in U.S. cities in February, up 10.4% from a year ago. That eclipsed January's record-high price of $4.95.",
      "Avian flu has forced farmers to slaughter more than 166 million birds, mostly were egg-laying chickens. Just since the start of the year, more than 30 million egg layers have been killed.",
      "If prices remain high, it will be third year in a row consumers have faced sticker shock ahead of Easter on April 20 and Passover, which starts on the evening of April 12, both occasions in which eggs play prominent roles.",
      "The price had consistently been below $2 a dozen for decades before the disease struck. The U.S. Department of Agriculture expects egg prices to rise 41% this year over last year\u2019s average of $3.17 per dozen.",
      "But there may be light at the end of the tunnel. The USDA reported last week that egg shortages are easing and wholesale prices are dropping, which might provide relief on the retail side before this year\u2019s late Easter, which is three weeks later than last year. It said there had been no major bird flu outbreak for two weeks.",
      "\u201cShoppers have begun to see shell egg offerings in the dairycase becoming more reliable although retail price levels have yet to adjust and remain off-putting to many,\u201d the USDA wrote in the March 7 report.",
      "David Anderson, a professor and extension economist for livestock and food marketing at Texas A&M University, said wholesale figures dropping is a good sign that prices could go down as shoppers react to the high prices by buying fewer eggs.",
      "\u201cWhat that should tell us is things are easing a little bit in terms of prices,\u201d he said. \u201cSo going forward, the next CPI report may very well indicate falling egg prices.\u201d",
      "However, he doesn't expect lasting changes until bird stock can be replenished and production can be replaced.",
      "\u201cRecord high prices is a market signal to producers to produce more, but it takes time to be able to produce more, and we just haven\u2019t had enough time for that to happen yet,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I do think it\u2019s going to happen. But it\u2019s going to take some more months to get there.\u201d",
      "Advocacy groups and others have also called for a probe into whether egg producers have used the avian flu to price gouge. But egg producers say the avian flu is solely behind the elevated prices.",
      "Meanwhile, restaurants have added surcharges and made other changes to offset the cost of eggs.",
      "The Trump administration has unveiled a plan to combat bird flu, $500 million investment to help farmers bolster biosecurity measures, $400 million in additional aid for farmers whose flocks have been impacted by avian flu, $100 million to research and potentially develop vaccines and therapeutics for U.S. chicken flocks. But it will likely take a while for that plan to make an impact."

      "The head of the Environmental Protection Agency has announced a series of actions to roll back landmark environmental regulations, including rules on pollution from coal-fired power plants, climate change and electric vehicles",
      "WASHINGTON -- In what he called the \u201cmost consequential day of deregulation in American history,\u201d the head of the Environmental Protection Agency announced a series of actions Wednesday to roll back landmark environmental regulations, including rules on pollution from coal-fired power plants, climate change and electric vehicles.",
      "\u201cWe are driving a dagger through the heart of climate-change religion and ushering in America\u2019s Golden Age,'' EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in an essay in the Wall Street Journal.",
      "His actions will eliminate trillions of dollars in regulatory costs and \u201chidden taxes,\u201d Zeldin said, lowering the cost of living for American families and reducing prices for such essentials such as buying a car, heating your home and operating a business.",
      "\u201cOur actions will also reignite American manufacturing, spreading economic benefits to communities,\" Zeldin wrote.",
      "In all, Zeldin said he is rolling back 31 environmental rules, including a scientific finding that has long been the central basis for U.S. action against climate change.",
      "Zeldin said he and President Donald Trump support rewriting the agency\u2019s 2009 finding that planet-warming greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare. The Obama-era determination under the Clean Air Act is the legal underpinning of a host of climate regulations for motor vehicles, power plants and other pollution sources.",
      "Environmentalists and climate scientists call the endangerment finding a bedrock of U.S. law and say any attempt to undo it will have little chance of success.",
      "\u201cIn the face of overwhelming science, it\u2019s impossible to think that the EPA could develop a contradictory finding that would stand up in court,\" said David Doniger, a climate expert at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group.",
      "In a related action, Zeldin said EPA will rewrite a rule restricting air pollution from fossil-fueled fired power plants and a separate measure restricting emissions from cars and trucks. Zeldin and Trump incorrectly label the car rule as an electric vehicle \"mandate.''",
      "The Biden administration had said the power plant rules would reduce pollution and improve public health while supporting the reliable, long-term supply of electricity that America needs."

      "ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. -- New Mexico has paired up with the Alzheimer's Association in a pilot U.S. initiative aimed at raising awareness about a disease that affects several million people across the nation, including family members and friends who often provide countless hours of unpaid care.",
      "The joint campaign \u2014 a year in the making \u2014 features billboards, digital ads and social media posts. It was unveiled Wednesday, days after authorities confirmed that actor Gene Hackman died at his Santa Fe home of heart disease with complications from Alzheimer\u2019s disease.",
      "Hackman, like the majority of people with Alzheimer\u2019s and related dementias, lived at home. His wife, Betsy Arakawa, was his caregiver but died from hantavirus, a rare, rodent-born disease. Experts believe Hackman, in the advanced stages of Alzheimer's, was unable to seek help.",
      "The goal of the new partnership between the state and the Alzheimer's Association is to spark conversations within families and to educate the public on warning signs and treatments. It also aims to publicize support services for family members and other caregivers.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s kind of the whole point of the campaign \u2014 to start talking, to start thinking, to take some action,\u201d said Joey Long, a spokesperson with the state Aging and Long-Term Services Department. \u201cSo it's like, maybe they\u2019ve been confused. Well, let\u2019s talk about what that means.\u201d",
      "According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 7 million people are living with the disease in the U.S., where Alzheimer\u2019s is the seventh-leading cause of death. In New Mexico, estimates put the number of people with the disease at 46,000 people, with another 67,000 family members providing care at home within the last year.",
      "Alzheimer's kills more people in the U.S. than breast cancer and prostate cancer combined, according to statistics shared by the Alzheimer's Association, which is helping to fund research projects in dozens of countries around the world.",
      "One of the challenges is that only about half of the people who are living with the disease are ever diagnosed, said Jim Herlihy, a spokesperson for the association's Rocky Mountain region. The number of undiagnosed people is higher in communities of color, he said.",
      "Neurologists say it can take 20 years from the start of the disease taking shape in the brain to when it becomes recognizable and diagnosed, what Herlihy describes as a glacial pace.",
      "\u201cPeople think of this as either an old person\u2019s disease or something that happens to somebody else,\u201d Herlihy said. \u201cAnd unless it\u2019s happened in your family and you have seen a loved one decline from this disease, or you have been put into the role of being a caregiver, you don\u2019t realize the impact that this has.\u201d",
      "The nonprofit association published a special report last year detailing the importance of families mapping out a plan for care, acknowledging that it can be a complex maze involving social services, medications and specialists.",
      "The billboards and ads are simple. One of them pictures a caution sign in the road that reads: \u201cHoney, you've been confused.\u201d The messages urge people to talk about it and to visit a website that includes a hotline for those who don't know where to start.",
      "A significant percentage of New Mexico's population is aging, which has spurred officials to find ways to educate and prepare state residents. In addition to the awareness campaign, the state is planning a series of community forums on the subject this spring in rural areas with high rates of the disease.",
      "The Alzheimer's Association is hoping the campaign will expand to other states."

      "The release follows a recent visit to the region by Adam Boehler, the Trump administration's top hostage envoy, and comes amid a continued U.S. government push to bring home American citizens jailed in foreign countries.",
      "Six of the newly freed prisoners were accompanied on a flight from Kuwait to New York by Jonathan Franks, a private consultant who works on cases involving American hostages and detainees and who had been in the country to help secure their release.",

      "The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The names of the released prisoners were not immediately made public.",
      "Kuwait, a small, oil-rich nation that borders Iraq and Saudi Arabia and is near Iran, is considered a major non-NATO ally of the United States. Secretary of State Marco Rubio paid tribute to that relationship as recently as last month, when he said the U.S. \u201cremains steadfast in its support for Kuwait\u2019s sovereignty and the well-being of its people.\u201d",

The status is applied to a subsection of Americans jailed abroad and historically ensures the case is handled by the administration's special presidential envoy for hostage affairs \u2014 the office that handles negotiations for a release.",
      "But advocates of those held in foreign countries are hopeful the Trump administration takes a more flexible approach and secures the release of those not deemed wrongfully detained.",
      "\u201cThe sad reality is that these Americans were left in prison for years due to a misguided policy that had, before President Trump took office, effectively abandoned Americans abroad who hadn't been designated wrongfully detained,\u201d Franks said in a statement.",

      "The Associated Press has obtained a document showing that the Trump administration is halting a $1 billion program that helps preserve affordable housing",
      "The Trump administration is halting a $1 billion program that helps preserve affordable housing, threatening projects that keep tens of thousands of units livable for low-income Americans, according to a document obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "The action is part of a slew of cuts and funding freezes at the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, largely at the direction of President Donald Trump and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, that have rattled the affordable-housing industry.",
      "Preserving these units gets less attention than ribbon-cuttings, but it's a centerpiece of efforts to address the nation's housing crisis. Hundreds of thousands of low-rent apartments, many of them aging and in need of urgent repair, are at risk of being yanked out from under poor Americans.",
      "The program has already awarded the money to projects that would upgrade at least 25,000 affordable units across the country, and details of how it will be wound down remain unclear.",
      "A spokesperson for HUD did not respond to repeated requests for comment. But an internal document reviewed by the AP said that the program is being \u201cterminated\u201d at the direction of DOGE. Two HUD workers, who have knowledge of the program and spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal, confirmed the directive to shutter it.",
      "On it's face, the over $1 billion Green and Resilient Retrofit Program, passed by Congress in 2022, is intended for energy-efficiency improvements. It is distributed in grants and loans to owners of affordable housing in need of updating, including replacing or repairing heating and cooling systems, leaky roofs, aging insulation or windows, or undertaking floodproofing.",
      "But the money plays a much larger role in preserving affordable units.",
      "Projects that use the funds are required to keep their buildings affordable for up to 25 years. The money is also leveraged to pull in other investments for major repairs and renovations needed to keep the buildings livable.",
      "It's like building a Jenga tower, where one of the program's grants or loans \u2014 which range from hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars \u2014 is a bottom block and each new block is another investment, experts said.",
      "This money \u201cwas essential in order for the project to come together,\u201d said Mike Essian, vice president at American Community Developers, Inc., which received funding for several affordable housing projects. \u201cProjects will fail and these are projects that are already difficult to finance.\u201d",
      "The news has been a jolt to Al Hase and Joan Starr, tenants in an apartment building in Vancouver, Washington, full of other low-income seniors with few or no other options \u2014 most of whom live on less than $33,000 a year.",
      "The 170-unit Smith Tower Apartments, built in the 1960s, is in need of updates, including it's first building-wide sprinkler system. The $10 million award was a financial kickstart for its nearly $100 million project, and is cited in applications for other investments.",
      "The potential loss \u201cseriously jeopardizes our ability to be able to provide an upgrade to the current systems,\u201d said Greg Franks, president of the property\u2019s management company, adding that the work is \"needed to sustain the livability of this building based on its age, and to keep it viable for another 60 years.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are depending on that $10 million,\u201d he said.",
      "So, too, are Hase and Starr, a retired couple in their 70s who have lived there for 16 years.",
      "They fill their balcony with geraniums and petunias, count the eagles at a nearby park and live off of meager Social Security incomes. They learned about the potential funding loss in a letter from the apartment's management company.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s kinda terrifying, it\u2019s almost like getting news from a doctor that something's going to take your life in six months or a year,\u201d Hase told the AP in a phone call.",
      "\u201cWe're from an era where the wages weren't there, so our Social Security ...\u201d he said, pausing. \u201cSucks,\u201d pitched in Starr.",
      "\u201cIf I'd been born a rich man,\u201d he said. Starr added: \u201cWe\u2019re just regular people.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd we're the lucky ones because we've got two social securities coming in,\" she said.",
      "But being lucky ones still doesn't count for much in today's rental market. \u201cPrices keep going up, I've looked, and there's no way,\" she said.",

      "A former Republican Tennessee lawmaker says President Donald Trump has pardoned him two weeks into his 21-month prison sentence for an illegal campaign finance scheme",
      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- A former Republican Tennessee lawmaker says President Donald Trump has pardoned him two weeks into his 21-month prison sentence for an illegal campaign finance scheme that he pleaded guilty to in 2022, before he tried unsuccessfully to take back his plea.",
      "Former Sen. Brian Kelsey announced that he received a \u201cfull and unconditional pardon\u201d in a social media post Tuesday evening. He had been ordered to report to FCI Ashland's minimum security satellite camp in Kentucky on Feb. 24. A federal database said Kelsey was no longer in Bureau of Prisons custody as of Tuesday.",
      "\u201cMay God bless America, despite the prosecutorial sins it committed against me, President Trump, and others the past four years,\u201d Kelsey said in the post.",
      "The 47-year-old pleaded guilty in November 2022 to charges related to his attempts to funnel campaign money from his state legislative seat toward his failed 2016 congressional bid.",
      "Kelsey was indicted in October 2021. He initially labeled the prosecution a witch hunt and blamed the Democratic administration of then-President Joe Biden. But when a co-defendant pleaded guilty the following October, Kelsey quickly did as well.",
      "He repeated his attack on the Biden administration Tuesday, saying, \u201cGod used Donald Trump to save me from the weaponized Biden DOJ,\u201d referring to the Department of Justice. In 2017, during Trump's first term, Kelsey's campaign finance dealings spurred a complaint by the nonprofit Campaign Legal Center with the Federal Election Commission and the Department of Justice.",
      "Kelsey was unsuccessful in his March 2023 attempt to rescind his guilty plea.",
      "Kelsey had argued he entered the plea with an \u201cunsure heart and a confused mind.\u201d He noted that he and his wife had twin sons born in September 2022, and his father had terminal pancreatic cancer, then died in February 2023.",
      "U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw in Nashville denied the change of plea in May 2023. He expressed disbelief that Kelsey, a Georgetown University-educated attorney and prominent former state senator, didn\u2019t understand the gravity of pleading guilty.",
      "Crenshaw later denied another challenge in which Kelsey accused prosecutors of violating his plea agreement. However, that September the judge also allowed Kelsey to stay out of prison until his appeal was decided. Kelsey\u2019s challenge ultimately failed.",
      "Last month, Crenshaw denied another motion to remain free by Kelsey, who argued he had ineffective legal counsel and that his claim of innocence is supported by recordings by two key witnesses \u2014 the co-defendant, Joshua Smith, and former GOP Rep. Jeremy Durham, who was not charged. The judge responded that Kelsey had given an \u201cunconditional admission of guilt\u201d under penalty of perjury.",
      "Kelsey had another appeal pending as he announced the pardon.",
      "Smith, a Nashville social club owner, pleaded guilty to one count under a deal that required him to \u201ccooperate fully and truthfully.\u201d He was sentenced to five years of probation.",
      "The indictment alleges that Kelsey, Smith and others illegally concealed the transfer of $91,000 \u2014 $66,000 from Kelsey\u2019s state Senate campaign committee and $25,000 from a nonprofit that advocated about legal justice issues \u2014 to a national political organization to fund advertisements urging support of Kelsey\u2019s 2016 failed congressional campaign. The scheme caused the political group to file false campaign finance reports and make illegal, excessive campaign contributions to Kelsey, the indictment says.",
      "Although the indictment does not name the national political organization, the Campaign Legal Center's 2017 complaint said the American Conservative Union was making coordinated independent expenditures with Kelsey\u2019s campaign. The American Conservative Union has said it has cooperated with investigators.",
      "Kelsey, an attorney from Germantown, was first elected to the General Assembly in 2004 as a state representative. He was later elected to the Senate in 2009. He didn\u2019t seek reelection in 2022.",
      "Kelsey served as the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which oversees changes to civil and criminal laws, judicial proceedings and more. His law license was suspended in 2022 after his guilty plea.",

      "DENVER -- When President Donald Trump gave his joint address to Congress last week, he boasted that in his first few weeks back in the White House he had \u201cbrought free speech back to America.\u201d",
      "But First Amendment advocates say they've never seen freedom of speech under attack the way it has been in Trump's second term.",
      "Trump's Republican administration has threatened Democratic members of Congress with investigation for criticizing conservatives, pulled federal grants that include language it opposes, sanctioned law firms that represent Trump's political opponents and arrested the organizer of student protests that Trump criticized as \u201canti-Semitic, anti-American.\u201d",
      "\u201cYour right to say something depends on what the administration thinks of it, which is no free speech at all,\u201d said Will Creeley, legal director of the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, a nonpartisan First Amendment group.",
      "Trump on Monday took credit for the arrest by immigration agents of Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate student and legal permanent resident who helped lead pro-Palestinian protests there. Khalil's lawyers say the government is targeting him for his activism and to \u201cdiscriminate against particular viewpoints.\u201d",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the administration will revoke the visas or green cards of supporters of Hamas, which the U.S. has designated a terrorist organization, \"so they can be deported.\u201d The government has not yet filed documents specifying why Khalil was detained, and a federal judge earlier this week ordered immigration officials not to remove Khalil from the country while his case is sorted out.",
      "Trump supporters, including members of Congress, have argued that because Khalil is not a U.S. citizen, the government can target him for his speech, which they contend amounts to sympathy for terrorism.",
      "\u201cThis is the first arrest of many to come. We know there are more students at Columbia and other Universities across the Country who have engaged in pro-terrorist, anti-Semitic, anti-American activity, and the Trump Administration will not tolerate it,\u201d Trump wrote.",
      "Even some Trump allies were uncomfortable with that approach: \u201cThere's almost no one I don't want to deport,\u201d wrote conservative commentator Ann Coulter on X, \u201cbut, unless they've committed a crime, isn't this a violation of the first amendment?\u201d",
      "On the other end of the political spectrum, activists who organized to protest the war in Gaza were aghast at the administration's move.",
      "\u201cWe learn about our First Amendment rights since we\u2019re children,\u201d said Germ\u00e1n Rafael Gonz\u00e1lez, a member of Stanford University's Students for Justice in Palestine. \u201cBut that is very much a myth. It\u2019s not the reality we live in right now. And it\u2019s scary.\u201d",
      "Prior to the arrest of Khalil over the weekend, the administration pressured Columbia University to crack down on anti-Israel activism among students and faculty, and Trump has threatened to go after any college that supports protests he deems \u201cillegal.\u201d",
      "He also issued an order forbidding federal funding of what his administration labels diversity, equity and inclusion, which led to a freeze on federal grants as the administration reviews them for forbidden words such as \u201cgender.\u201d",
      "Todd Wolfson, president of the American Association of University Professors, which sued the Trump administration over its DEI ban and won an injunction against it from a federal judge, said the administration is pulling funding from projects that have prohibited words, yanking grants from research into such areas as crop diversity or differences in infant mortality in urban and rural areas.",
      "\u201cNobody really wants Big Brother telling you what you can research,\u201d Wolfson said. \u201cThese are questions our country needs to know the answers to.\u201d",
      "Republicans for several years have been the party complaining about infringements on the First Amendment, from complaints about \u201cwoke\u201d colleges canceling conservative speakers to bashing social media companies they accuse of censoring conservative viewpoints, including cutting Trump off after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack by his supporters on the U.S. Capitol. GOP-controlled Florida and Texas even drew up laws to limit how social media firms regulate content, though the U.S. Supreme Court kept them on hold last year because of possible First Amendment violations.",
      "Last year, Trump positioned himself as a champion of the First Amendment during his campaign, and he signed an executive order just hours after being sworn into office prohibiting anyone in the federal government from interfering with Americans' free speech rights. But he also made pledges that signaled he might oppose some of the First Amendment's fundamental protections, such as deporting foreign students who protested Israel or outlawing flag-burning, which the Supreme Court has ruled is protected free speech.",
      "Creeley, of the individual rights foundation, said he tried to be optimistic before Trump took office that the new president would fix some First Amendment issues. Instead, he said, it's gotten worse.",
      "\u201cI cannot recall anything like this,\" Creeley said. \"I've been defending First Amendment rights since 2006, and this is the most serious of threats I can recall.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration also has gone after the news media.",
      "The president has sued several outlets for coverage he dislikes, and his appointees at the Federal Communications Commission have helped pressure those media companies. Meanwhile, Trump's FCC is opening investigations of other media companies with which Trump has feuded, and the administration has barred The Associated Press from the White House press pool because it won't use Trump's preferred name for the Gulf of Mexico. The AP is suing to restore its access on First Amendment grounds.",
      "The administration also has targeted law firms for their affiliations with Democrats or the previous administration. It stripped security clearances for lawyers at a firm that helped special counsel Jack Smith's investigations of Trump during President Joe Biden's administration and Perkins Coie, a longtime Democratic firm that Trump blames for the investigation into his campaign's relationship with Russia during his first term. On Tuesday, Perkins Coie sued the administration to reverse the action, saying it violated the First Amendment and other constitutional guarantees.",
      "Jameel Jaffer, director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia, said the attacks on the law firms have scared some high-profile attorneys out of taking cases that challenge the administration, which, he contended, is the point.",
      "\u201cThere's a long tradition of lawyers taking on controversial clients, sometimes against our government,\u201d Jaffer said. \u201cThe Trump administration has made it clear it will retaliate against lawyers.\u201d",
      "Jaffer said attacks on free speech and association are intended to chill dissent by convincing people in the opposition that they could become targets.",
      "\u201cAll of us are able to participate in government by engaging in protest,\u201d Jaffer said. \u201cWhen the government shuts down that kind of speech, it's shutting down democracy.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration has even targeted members of Congress.",
      "Trump appointed Ed Martin, a defense attorney who represented some of those charged in the Jan. 6 attack, as acting U.S. attorney in the District of Columbia. Martin wrote to Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader and one of the nation's top Democrats, telling him that a comment he made in 2020 warning conservative Supreme Court judges they would \u201cpay the price\u201d for overturning the right to abortion could be seen as a threat. Schumer has since apologized for the statement.",
      "Martin also wrote to Democratic Rep. Robert Garcia of California, warning him that comments he made about Trump adviser Elon Musk could be seen as a threat. Garcia had said Democrats should \u201cbring actual weapons to this bar fight.\u201d",
      "\u201cMembers of Congress must have the right to forcefully oppose the Trump Administration,\" Garcia replied on Musk\u2019s X platform. \"I will not be silenced.\u201d",

      "U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins has pledged to start paying out tens of billions in aid to victims of Hurricane Helene later this month",
      "ATLANTA -- Tens of billions in aid for victims of Hurricane Helene should start flowing later this month, U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins pledged Wednesday, but delays are already making it hard this year for some farmers to plant crops.",
      "Congress set a deadline of March 21 to hand out the money when it passed a $100 billion disaster relief package on Dec. 21. The late September storm cut a swath from Florida's Big Bend across eastern Georgia and upstate South Carolina before causing historic flooding in western North Carolina and eastern Tennessee.",
      "The National Centers for Environmental Information says Helene is the seventh-most expensive disaster in the United States since 1980, causing an estimated $78 billion in damage and 219 deaths.",
      "At a news conference in Atlanta on Wednesday, Rollins pledged the aid would begin to be disbursed before the deadline.",
      "\u201cThat money will begin to move in the next few weeks,\" she said.",
      "That's not a moment too soon for Chris Hopkins, who farms near Lyons in south Georgia. Helene wiped out half the cotton Hopkins was growing on 1,400 acres (560 hectares). He said Tuesday that he began planting 300 acres (121 hectares) of corn this month, and plans to start planting cotton in late April.",
      "Hopkins said the big losses forced him to dip into emergency reserve funds to pay off $200,000 in 2024 loans for seed, fertilizer and other materials. Some neighboring farmers hit hard by the storm still have unpaid debts from last year, he said, leaving them unable to borrow more to start planting 2025 crops.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s desperately needed,\u201d Hopkins said of federal aid. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is that producers are almost in a holding or pause pattern because they can\u2019t afford to pay their rent or their loans.\u201d",
      "Hopkins said farmers had hoped the money would come sooner, in January or February, so they could pay off creditors before planting season. He said some have sold equipment or even land to generate enough cash to get new crops started.",
      "\u201cThe general consensus in the farming and ag community is that it would have been much better earlier,\u201d Hopkins said. \u201cAg producers are thankful for it by all means. But taking the full 90 days to get it is tough.\u201d",
      "In South Carolina, Republican legislative leaders decided to wait to approve Helene damage relief money in the state\u2019s regular budget instead of an emergency bill in part because they expected federal officials to get relief money out quickly.",
      "Most but not all of the disaster relief bill is earmarked for Helene. It includes $21 billion to help farmers, $8 billion to rebuild damaged roads and highways, $12 billion in grants to help communities and individuals recover and $2.2 billion in low-interest loans for businesses, nonprofits and homeowners.",
      "Officials have estimated that Helene caused property and economic damage to the agriculture sector totaling $5.5 billion in Georgia and $4.9 billion in North Carolina.",
      "Beyond the cotton crop, the storm toppled pecan trees and flattened chicken houses in Georgia. Farming in western North Carolina is dominated by specialty crops including Christmas trees and nursery plants, with fewer growers covered by crop insurance.",
      "South Carolina officials estimated $620 million in agriculture damage in 2024, not just from Helene, but also from other weather disasters.",
      "State governments have been moving to expand their aid packages. Georgia has earmarked $285 million for low-interest loans for farmers and removing downed timber from private land in an amended budget that Gov. Brian Kemp signed last week, part of $862 million in Helene-related spending.",
      "North Carolina lawmakers are negotiating the details of a supplemental Helene relief bill that may total more than $500 million, in part to provide more funds for crop losses. It would be North Carolina\u2019s fourth Helene aid package to be enacted. The state has requested close to $1.9 billion from the disaster relief law approved by Congress in December. Most of that money would go to address crop and timber losses, debris removal, stream restoration and erosion.",
      "The South Carolina House on Wednesday gave final approval to a budget that includes $220 million in Helene relief for farmers and others as a match to money from the federal government. They also set aside $50 million to give to the state Department of Transportation to pay back what they spent repairing roads and clearing trees.",

      "It was Trump's first Oval Office meeting with a foreign leader since his recent sit-down with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, which morphed into a shouting match as they jousted over ending Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

      "Martin, who offered only gentle pushback to some of Trump's comments, is set to return to the White House in the evening to present Trump with a bowl of shamrocks at an early St. Patrick's Day celebration. The duo also attended an annual luncheon at the Capitol.",

I have great respect for Ireland and what they did and they should have done just what they did, but the United States shouldn\u2019t have let it happen.\u201d He was referring to the concentration of U.S. pharmaceutical companies in Ireland, due to the country's tax policies.",
      "\u201cWe had stupid leaders. We had leaders that didn\u2019t have a clue or let\u2019s say they weren\u2019t businesspeople, but they didn\u2019t have a clue what was happening and all of a sudden Ireland has our pharmaceutical companies,\" Trump said.",

      "More than 700 Irish companies are also based in America, creating thousands of jobs, Martin said. \u201cThat's a little known fact that doesn't turn up in the statistics,\u201d he added.",

      "BILLINGS, Mont. -- A 37-year-old man died after falling from a chairlift that was having a mechanical problem at a Montana ski area, according to local authorities and a spokesperson for Red Lodge Mountain.",
      "The man was riding alone in a three-person chair that carries skiers up the mountain when he fell from an unspecified height, according to Red Lodge Mountain spokesperson Troy Hawks. The accident happened Monday just before noon at the ski area southeast of Billings in the Beartooth Mountains.",
      "Jeffrey Zinne of Billings was taken to a Billings hospital where he was pronounced dead early Wednesday from injuries suffered in the fall, according to Carbon County Sheriff Josh McQuillan and Rich Hoffman with the Yellowstone County Coroner's Office.",
      "The lift, known as the Triple Chair, was stopped after the accident. More than 100 people who were on it at the time were evacuated by ski patrollers who used ropes to lower them to the ground.",
      "Hawks said the lift had a mechanical problem at the time Zinne fell, but declined to comment further and said the circumstances were being investigated. Weather conditions and the victim's actions also were being looked at, he said.",
      "On the morning of the accident, some other chairlifts at Red Lodge Mountain were not operating because of high winds. Wind gusts of about 50 mph (80.4 kph) were recorded in the area shortly before and after the accident, according to the National Weather Service.",
      "Hawks said the Triple Chairlift, which is almost a mile (1.6 kilometers) long and was built in 1983, was operating within safety parameters. It will remain shut down until an engineer fully assesses it, he said.",
      "Staff at the ski area inspect its chairlifts daily, Hawks said. A professional inspection is conducted annually as required by Red Lodge Mountain's insurance carrier and the U.S. Forest Service, which leases land to the ski area, he said.",
      "Zinne, who had been snowboarding on Monday prior to his accident, was married with a 2-year-old son and owned the Montana Air Cartage freight hauling company, according to a post on a GoFundMe fundraising site set up on his family\u2019s behalf.",
      "\u201cHe was more than just a boss for many people here. He was a friend, a mentor,\u201d said Jessice Sande, a manager at Montana Air Cartage who recalled Zinne's infectious laugh.",
      "Fatal lift accidents at ski areas are relatively rare, according to the National Ski Areas Association. Between 1956 and 2024, 35 people died in accidents involving chairlifts and aerial ropeways. Sixteen of the deaths were linked to mechanical malfunctions, according to data collected by the group.",
      "The latest death during that time period was in 2020, when a man died at Colorado's Vail resort after his clothing got entangled in part of the chairlift, making him unable to breathe."

    "story": [
      "The fate of the IRS Direct File program remains unclear as Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency cleave their way through the federal bureaucracy",
      "WASHINGTON -- Mia Francis, a 22-year-old barista from Boston, filed her taxes on her own this year for the first time, using a free government tax filing program that made it easy because it did most of the work for her.",
      "Francis said it took 45 minutes to finish her taxes with the IRS Direct File program, an electronic tax return filing system that the IRS made permanent last year and that has rolled out to 25 states.",
      "Francis is expecting a $530 refund. And because she saved cash by not using a commercial tax preparation company to file her taxes, \u201cthat money will go a long way,\u201d she said. She plans to use it for a trip to Amsterdam this year.",
      "Despite its popularity with Francis and other members of the American public, the IRS Direct File\u2019s fate remains unclear as Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency cleave their way through the federal bureaucracy. So far, the program is still available for use ahead of the April 15 tax filing deadline, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent committed during his January confirmation hearing to maintaining it, at least for this tax season.",
      "Representatives from the Internal Revenue Service and DOGE did not respond to requests for comment from The Associated Press on their plans for Direct File. But one Republican tax expert says the IRS never got congressional authorization to create Direct File. And Republican lawmakers and commercial tax preparation firms complain the program is a waste of money because free filing programs already exist, although they are hard to use.",
      "Direct File was rolled out as a pilot program in 2024 after the IRS was tasked with looking into how to create a \u201cdirect file\u201d system as part of the money it received from the Inflation Reduction Act signed into law by President Joe Biden in 2022. Last May, the agency announced that the program would be made permanent.",
      "The IRS accepted 140,803 returns filed by taxpayers using Direct File in the 12 states where it was available last tax season. It\u2019s been expanded to include half the country this year. It is unclear how many taxpayers have used Direct File this year.",
      "Merici Vinton, an original architect of Direct File from the U.S. Digital Service, noted the ease and accessibility of the program and called it \u201ca great example of how people should interact with the government in the 21st century.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe effectively launched a startup in the IRS,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was built by an in-house product team, in an iterative manner, and we ship updates to the software to improve user experience in real time based on feedback. If we continue to invest in it, both taxpayers and the IRS can benefit.\u201d",
      "Musk posted last month on his social media site that he had \u201cdeleted\u201d 18F, a government agency that worked on technology projects such as the IRS\u2019 Direct File program. This led to some confusion about whether Direct File is still available to taxpayers. However, conversations inside the IRS indicate that no decision has been made on whether to cut the program, two people familiar with these conversations tell the AP.",
      "Former IRS Commissioner Daniel Werfel, who oversaw the rollout of the program, said Treasury officials considering the future of the program should take into account \u201cthe voice of the taxpayers.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy reflection is that taxpayers are in very different situations and have very different preferences for how they want to file,\" he said. \u201cThose whose preference is to file electronically direct with the IRS for free, it\u2019s a good option to have on the menu. But it should not replace other options.\u201d",
      "Derrick Plummer, a spokesperson for Intuit, one of the country's largest commercial tax preparation firms, said free tax preparation had been available for years before Direct File came along.",
      "\u201cIRS Direct File is a solution in search of a problem, a waste of taxpayer dollars and a drain on critical IRS resources,\u201d he said. A June 2024 Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration report estimates that the annual costs of Direct File may range from $64 million to $249 million.",
      "\u201cThe IRS should focus on its core mission including data privacy and customer service while policymakers in Washington focus on simplifying the tax code,\u201d Plummer said.",
      "However, other taxpayers, like 31 year-old Aquiel Warner in Austin, Texas, say they want to avoid using commercial tax preparation software.",
      "Warner filed her taxes with Direct File in 10 minutes using her phone and a chatbot that the IRS provides. She likes the program\u2019s convenience, that it prepopulated her tax forms and that it allowed for free filing. Although she has some concerns about data privacy in the government \u2014 DOGE is reported to have access to some of the IRS' internal systems \u2014 she feels more secure going through the IRS than commercial tax preparation services.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to be a product. I don\u2019t want my information sold when I file my taxes,\" she said. \"I have to file my taxes, and I don\u2019t want to be put in a situation where, in order to file my taxes, I have to pay to get the help I need because I\u2019m not a professional tax preparer.\"",
      "Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform, said the IRS never got explicit permission from Congress to create the Direct File system.",
      "\u201cIt really doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a good idea. It was done illegally,\" he said, calling on Congress and the Justice Department to look into what he says is unauthorized spending that went into the creation of Direct File.",
      "Democratic lawmakers in January asked Bessent and IRS commissioner nominee Billy Long to preserve the program. They wrote in a letter that \u201cending Direct File would hurt everyday Americans.\u201d Long has not yet received a nomination hearing.",
      "In the meantime, Musk and his cadre of computer programmers could decide to wield their tech skills to boost the program \u2014 or use the very same digital savvy to delete it.",
      "For his part, Werfel hopes that the agency will keep the program. \u201cIt\u2019s a big country with a lot of taxpayers with a lot of different preferences,\u201d he said.",
      "Francis, the Boston barista, hopes so, too.",
      "\u201dThere are a lot of young people like me who are working and figuring out how to file their taxes \u2014 this just makes it faster and easier,\" she said."

      "Who killed Donald Goines",
      "DETROIT -- Who killed Donald Goines?",
      "Producers of a documentary on the life of the prisoner-turned urban fiction writer of novels about the violence, drugs and prostitution that he surrounded himself with in Detroit are hoping the answer hasn't been lost to time \u2014 or the streets.",
      "It's been more than 50 years since Goines and his common-law wife, Shirley Sailor, were found shot to death on Oct. 21, 1974 in their flat in Highland Park, a small enclave of Detroit. Each had been shot five times. Their two young children were home at the time of the killings.",
      "Goines was 37.",
      "No arrests were made and rumors swelled. Some speculated the killings had something to do with Goines' heroin addiction. Others nodded to the theory that the fictional subjects of his novels appeared a bit too much like the real-life hustlers, pimps, drug dealers and stickup men who prowled the city's streets.",
      "\u201cThere have been at least a half-dozen, quite possibly a dozen, elements of speculation as to how Mr. Goines and the mother of his children were murdered,\u201d said Bill Proctor, a private investigator hired to find the killer or killers. \u201cBut no one has come forward with enough information to charge the persons responsible.\u201d",
      "Proctor said a $5,000 reward being offered by the producers of the documentary might help \u201cshake the trees\u201d and find \u201csomeone who might still be alive or have an understanding\u201d of the facts of the case.",
      "Goines wrote 16 books over a span of several short years. His raw, stark and undiluted writings are filled with the urban street life imagery of the late 1960s and early 1970s.",
      "\u201cDopefiend,\u201d was published in 1971. Fifteen more including \u201cStreet Players,\u201d \u201cDaddy Cool\u201d and \u201cKenyatta's Last Hit,\u201d would follow over the next three years. The titles and the content resonated with many Black readers, especially in Detroit where Goines' books often held prominence on living room coffee tables and bookshelves.",
      "\u201cWhen I read his books, I can visualize \u2014 I can picture what he\u2019s writing about,\u201d said his daughter, Donna Sailor. \u201cHe was so descriptive about what he wrote. That\u2019s kind of like how it was back then.\u201d",
      "Donna Sailor was 2 when her parents were killed. She doesn\u2019t remember anything about the shooting or her parents.",
      "\u201cWe would see friends of the family that knew my dad and my mom,\u201d Sailor, 52, told The Associated Press Thursday. \u201cThey would say she was a sweetheart, and she was funny and had a great smile.\u201d",
      "Less information about Goines was volunteered, though, she added.",
      "\u201cNo one ever went into great detail about him. They would say he was a nice guy,\u201d said Sailor.",
      "The urban lit genre dates back at least to 1967, and the release of the memoir \u201cPimp,\u201d written by Robert Maupin, who also was in jail when he began writing under the name Iceberg Slim. Maupin built a large word-of-mouth following and one of his readers was Goines. Generations later, hip-hop stars like Tupac Shakur were also inspired by the books and have referenced Goines and Iceberg Slim in their recordings. Shakur even once declared: \u201cMachiavelli was my tutor, Donald Goines my father figure.\u201d",
      "Goines' parents owned a clothes-cleaning and other businesses in Detroit and were part of the city's Black middle class. He enlisted in the Air Force and spent time in Korea and Japan during the Korean War. It was there Goines became addicted to heroin, according to various reports on his life.",
      "After his time in the military, Goines returned to Detroit in the mid-1950s. He drifted into the city's criminal underbelly, finding himself jailed for various crimes.",
      "Holloway House published Goines' novels from 1971 to 2008, according to current publisher Kensington.",
      "Under Kensington, Goines books have sold about 500,000 copies in print, alone. He consistently is one of Kensington's top reordered authors and his books have been \u201cselling at a stronger pace\u201d since it launched a reissue program in 2020, according to the company.",
      "Robert (Tape) Bailey and Craig Gore are the driving forces behind the documentary which is expected to be released by the end of the year. Both read Goines\u2019 books while incarcerated, separately.",
      "Bailey, 49, was born in Detroit and now lives in Los Angeles. He spent time in federal prison as young man for possession with intent to deliver drugs in Ohio.",
      "Goines wrote in detail about things he had witnessed firsthand, Bailey said.",
      "Gore, 51, of Los Angeles, stumbled onto Goines while serving time for burglary and theft. He says that through the $5,000 reward, they hope to bring more accuracy to the documentary.",
      "\u201cWe might find nothing. We might solve the murder,\u201d he said."

      "After the cuts, the Office for Civil Rights will only have workers in Washington and five regional offices, which traditionally take the lead on investigating complaints and mediating resolutions with schools and colleges. Buildings are being closed and staff laid off in Dallas, Chicago, New York, Boston, Cleveland, Philadelphia and San Francisco.",
      "Many lawyers at the New York City office were juggling 80 or more cases, said one staffer who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear for reprisals. The branch often mediated cases with New York City schools, the nation\u2019s largest district, and its lawyers were handling a high-profile antisemitism investigation at Columbia University \u2014 a priority for President Donald Trump.",
      "The staffer described several pending cases involving students with disabilities who are wrongly being kept out of school because of behavioral issues. With limited oversight from the office, they said, school districts will be less likely to comply with legal requirements.",
      "Pillera, who had said before the cuts that he was leaving the department, said it's unclear how complaints will be investigated in areas that no longer have offices.",
      "\u201cWe have to physically go to schools,\u201d Pillera said. \u201cWe have to look at the playground to see if it\u2019s accessible for kids with disabilities. We have to measure doorways and bathrooms to see if everything is accessible for kids with disabilities.\u201d",
      "Even before the layoffs, the civil rights office had been losing staff even as complaints rose to record levels. The workforce had fallen below 600 staffers before Trump took office, and they faced nearly 23,000 complaints filed last year, more than ever.",
      "Trump officials ordered a freeze on most cases when they arrived at the department, adding to the backlog. When Education Secretary Linda McMahon lifted the freeze last week, there were more than 20,000 pending cases.",
      "Historically, most of the office\u2019s work deals with disability rights cases, but it has fielded growing numbers of complaints alleging discrimination based on sex or race. It has also played a prominent role in investigating complaints of antisemitism and Islamophobia amid the Israel-Hamas war and a wave of campus demonstrations that spread across the country last year.",
      "Craig Trainor, Trump\u2019s appointee over the office, directed staff to focus on antisemitism cases as a top priority last week. In a memo, he accused former President Joe Biden of failing to hold colleges accountable and promised tougher action against violators.",
      "At her confirmation hearing, McMahon said the goal is not to defund key programs but to make them operate more efficiently. She vowed to uphold the agency\u2019s civil rights work but said it might fit better being moved to the Justice Department.",
      "An email the Education Department sent to all staff after the layoffs said there will need to be significant changes to how they work.",
      "\u201cWhat we choose to prioritize, and in turn, not prioritize, will be critical in this transition,\u201d the message said.",

The strips help the pup learn how to interact with kelp, which it would be around a lot in its natural environment, and how to explore its environment using its mouth, said Tremonti.",
      "The strip, which is made out of heavy duty felt material, is just small enough for Pepper to grab and manipulate, said Tremonti. In the video, the sea lion pulls it with its flipper while chasing the tail end to create the graceful circles and later clamps down on the strip with its mouth.",

      "Madison Mayor Satya Rhodes-Conway said in a statement that the city has launched an investigation and that she needed to suspend City Clerk Maribeth Witzel-Behl to maintain public confidence in the clerk\u2019s office. The mayor added that the city will spare no expense to ensure every vote is counted heading into the swing state's spring election. The state Elections Commission also is investigating whether Witzel-Behl violated any state laws or abused her discretion.",

      "No listing for Witzel-Behl's personal contact information could be immediately found.",
      "The suspension comes with the state's April 1 general election just weeks away. The highest-profile race is between conservative Brad Schimel and liberal Susan Crawford for an open state Supreme Court seat. The outcome will determine the ideological balance of the court as it ponders cases involving abortion, the strength of public sector unions, voting rules and congressional district boundaries. Early voting begins next week.",
      "Rhodes-Conway said in her statement that she has appointed City Attorney Michael Haas as interim city clerk and that she expects he will ensure the election runs smoothly in Madison. Haas has previously worked as administrator and attorney for the state elections commission.",
      "According to commission investigators, Wiztel-Behl\u2019s office discovered 67 unprocessed absentee ballots in a courier bag that had been placed in a security cart. The discovery came on Nov. 12, seven days after the election, while county workers were conducting the official count of election results.",
      "Witzel-Behl said she told two employees to notify the elections commission, but neither did. A third city worker visited the Dane County Clerk\u2019s Office to inform officials there, but that employee said the county didn\u2019t want the ballots for the count, known as a canvass. Dane County Clerk Scott McDonell has said he knew nothing of the uncounted ballots until they were reported in the media.",
      "Witzel-Behl\u2019s office found another 125 uncounted absentee ballots in a sealed courier bag in a supply tote on Dec. 2. According to commission investigators, Witzel-Behl said she didn\u2019t inform county canvassers because the canvass was finished. She added that based on the county\u2019s response to the Nov. 12 discovery she didn\u2019t think the county would be interested.",
      "The commission wasn\u2019t notified of either discovery until Dec. 18. Witzel-Behl told investigators that the employees she asked to notify the commission waited until reconciliation was completed. That\u2019s a routine process in which poll workers and elections officials ensure an election\u2019s accuracy, including checking the number of ballots issued at the polls against the number of voters. She couldn\u2019t explain why she didn\u2019t contact county officials or the elections commission herself, according to the investigators.",
      "The elections commission was expected to approve guidelines during a late-afternoon meeting Wednesday to help clerks around the state ensure they count every ballot in the spring election.",
      "The recommendations include thoroughly documenting any incidents on election day; making sure all materials are returned from the polling sites; checking voting equipment\u2019s ballot bins for anything that might have been missed; and immediately reporting any mistakes to county officials and the commission."

      "U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell in Washington granted a temporary restraining order sought by the firm, Perkins Coie, one day after it alleged in a federal lawsuit that it's illegally being targeted because of its legal work. The judge said the president's action sends a chilling message that lawyers can be punished for representing clients or advancing views unfavorable to the administration.",
      "\u201cSuch a circumstance threatens the very foundation of or legal system,\" said Howell, who was nominated to the bench by Democratic President Barack Obama. \u201cOur justice system is based on the fundamental belief that justice works best when all parties have zealous advocates.\u201d",
      "The order came during an extraordinary court hearing in which Attorney General Pam Bondi\u2019s chief of staff, Chad Mizelle, defended the latest in a series of retributive moves targeting the president\u2019s perceived adversaries.",
      "Mizelle, who's also serving as the acting associate attorney general, argued that the president has the clear authority to take action against entities he believes present a threat to national security. It\u2019s highly unusual for such a high-ranking Justice Department official to argue on behalf of the government in the trial court.",

The families are originally from Colombia, Romania, Iran, Angola, Russia, Armenia, Turkey and Brazil.",

Some were in the U.S. for as little as 20 days and others for as long as about 10 years, Al-Juburi said. The nonprofit provided service to adult detainees at the center prior to last week's shift in the center\u2019s detention population when the adult detainees were moved out.",
      "Both the Obama administration and Trump's first administration detained families until their immigration cases played out. Trump severely curbed asylum and forcibly separated children from their parents at the border in a policy widely denounced as inhumane.",

      "The US president called for the immediate removal of the EU's tariff on US whiskey, calling the bloc \"nasty\", \"hostile and abusive\", and \"formed for the sole purpose of taking advantage of the United States\".",
      "A European Commission spokesperson said that \"calls are being prepared\" between between the US and the EU to discuss the situation.",
      "It confirmed that its trade commissioner, Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d, had \"reached out to his American counterparts\" after Trump's latest threat of retaliation.",
      "Trump said the EU's tariff on US-produced whiskey was \"not removed immediately\", he would \"shortly place a 200% Tariff on all wines, champagnes & alcoholic products coming out of France and other EU represented countries\".",
      "The president, on Truth Social, added that a US alcohol tariff - which would be a new border tax on alcohol imports from the EU - would be \"great for the Wine and Champagne businesses in the US\".",
      "The latest move marks a continued escalation of a trade war which has rattled financial markets amid concerns over the impact on the economies and consumers in many countries around the world, including the US.",
      "Europe exports more than \u20ac4.5bn ($4.89bn; \u00a33.78bn) worth of wine each year to the US, which is its largest export market, according to the Comit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9en des Entreprises Vins, which represents the European wine industry.",
      "Ignacio S\u00e1nchez Recarte, secretary-general of the group, said if Trump carried through on his threats, it would destroy the market, costing thousands of jobs.",
      "\"There is no alternative to sell all this wine,\" he said, pleading with the two sides to \"keep wine out of this fight\".",

      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "Six things that could get more expensive for Americans under Trump tariffs",
      "Is the US really heading into a recession?",
      "Earlier this month, Trump put 25% taxes on goods from Mexico and Canada, some of which he later suspended, and raised levies on Chinese imports into the US to at least 20%.",
      "His action on steel and aluminium came into effect on Wednesday, imposing a blanket duty of 25% on imports and ending exemptions that the US had previously granted for shipments, including from the EU and Canada.",
      "Trump has also threatened further tariffs, promising to unveil country-specific \"reciprocal\" tariffs next month, while floating new taxes on a range of more specific items, including copper, lumber and cars.",
      "Leaders in Canada and Europe - which are among America's biggest trade partners - have called the new taxes unjustified. They struck back with their own tariffs on a range of US products after the metals tariffs.",
      "The clash over alcohol is a reprise of a battle that played out during Trump's first term, when he first hit aluminium and steel with tariffs.",
      "The EU retaliated with tariffs of its own, including a 25% tax on American whiskey.",
      "In the aftermath, whiskey sales to the EU dropped 20%, falling from roughly $552m in 2018 to $440m in 2021, according to the Distilled Spirits Council of the US.",
      "The two sides ultimately reached a deal and the tariffs were lifted, after an agreement that exempted a certain amount of European metals from the duties.",
      "But Trump has indicated little appetite for deal-making this time round, at least when it comes to steel and aluminium.",
      "The inclusion of wine and whiskey is symbolic - there are few consumer goods more iconic than French Bordeaux or Tennessee whiskey. From a value standpoint, drinks trade is worth less than some of the other items facing tariffs.",
      "'It's giant threat to our livelihoods'",
      "However, Mary Taylor, a US-based importer of European wines, said the latest threat posed a more existential risk to her business, which imports about two million bottles a year, that would ripple out to restaurants, bars and distributors.",
      "Ms Taylor weathered the 25% tariff Trump put on EU bottles during his first term by expanding her distribution in Europe, but said \"200% is a whole different ball game\".",
      "She is currently waiting for an order of 16 containers, the cost of which could triple if Trump follows through on his threat.",
      "\"It just looks like a big, giant threat to our livelihoods.\"",
      "In interviews with US business media on Thursday, White House officials blamed the EU for escalating the dispute.",
      "\"Why are Europeans picking on Kentucky bourbon or Harley-Davidson motorcycles? It's disrespectful,\" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told Bloomberg Television, describing the back-and-forth as \"off the topic\".",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warned that a trade war was likely to inflict more economic pain on the EU than on the US, dismissing concerns that the clash could spiral.",
      "\"One or two items, with one trading bloc \u2013 I'm not sure why that's a big deal for the markets,\" he said.",
      "Shares in the US were lower on Thursday, with the Dow Jones and S&P 500 stock markets both down about 1%. London's FTSE 100 was flat, while Germany's Dax dropped about 0.5% and in Paris, the Cac 40 closed 0.64% lower.",
      "In an interview with the BBC's HardTalk, European central bank president Christine Lagarde, said that the EU had \"no choice\" but to retaliate.",
      "If the conflict were to develop into a \"real trade war\", \"everybody will suffer\", she warned.",
      "\"What I suspect is that...until there is implementation, parties are going to sit down and negotiate. That is what usually happens in trade matters.\"",
      "Trump pledges to match EU and Canada's retaliatory tariffs",
      "EU braces for higher prices as US trade war ramps up",
      "So far, Trump has shown little tolerance for retaliation from countries over the tariffs he has introduced.",
      "Earlier this week, he blasted Canada with the threat of a 50% tariff on its steel and aluminium after the Canadian province of Ontario responded to new tariffs with a surcharge on electricity exports to the US.",
      "He rescinded that threat after Ontario agreed to suspend the charges.",
      "Former Trump adviser Stephen Moore, now an economist with the Heritage Foundation, said he thought the EU would have to make a concession to defuse the situation, noting that Trump had consistently voiced concerns about rules on agricultural products.",
      "\"Absolutely this is going to end up with a deal,\" he said. \"It's only a question if it ends up in a deal in a day, a week, a month or six months, but there will eventually be a negotiated settlement.\"",
      "The full HARDtalk will be available from 14 March on the BBC News Channel, iPlayer, the World Service and as a podcast."

    "story": [
      "A judge has ordered several federal government agencies to reinstate the jobs of probationary employees fired en masse by the Trump administration last month.",
      "Judge William Alsup called the sacking of these employees part of a \"sham\" strategy that aimed to circumvent proper procedures for reducing the federal workforce.",
      "The order will apply to thousands of probationary workers who were fired at the Agriculture, Defence, Energy, Interior, Treasury, and Veterans Affairs departments.",
      "During Thursday's hearing, the Department of Justice maintained that the firings were done based on guidance - rather than a directive - from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).",
      "The BBC has contacted OPM for comment.",
      "OPM, a once-obscure agency that manages the federal government's civil service, has been thrust into the spotlight amid President Donald Trump's moves to slash the size of the federal workforce.",

      "It was 2019 and her California-based firm, Austere, had just agreed to supply several big US retailers with its high-end audio and video accessories that are largely manufactured in China.",
      "Then Trump imposed sweeping tariffs on China, and overnight Deena found herself paying a 25% surcharge on every cable and component she imported \u2013 up from zero previously.",
      "She was forced to absorb the costs and for a while thought she would go bust.",
      "\"I literally thought I am going to start and end a business in less than a year,\" she says. \"I had spent all this time, money and effort, and to have something like this blindside you was shocking.\"",
      "The firm pulled through, but like numerous other US businesses it now finds itself in a strikingly similar situation.",
      "Since returning to office in January, Mr Trump has raised tariffs on all goods imported from China by 20%, and put taxes of 25% on Canadian and Mexican products, only to delay some of them until April.",
      "The president says he wants to force these countries to do more to stop flows of illegal drugs and migrants into America, to bring more manufacturing back to the US, and to address what he sees as unfair trade imbalances.",
      "But the duties are much broader in scope than last time, when they were phased in gradually and many products were granted exemptions.",
      "Goods like smartphones, desktop computers and tablets are now incurring tariffs for the first time, while taxes on others have climbed higher.",
      "\"US importers have to pay these taxes not the exporters,\" says Ed Brzytwa, vice president of international trade at the Consumer Technology Association (CTA), a North American trade body that represents more than 1,200 tech firms.",
      "\"It's American businesses and consumers who will suffer.\"",
      "Businesses like Ms Ghazarian's are particularly exposed. China is still the number one supplier of electronic products to the US, with imports totalling $146bn (\u00a3112bn) in 2023, according to official data.",

      "At the same time, the US president is now targeting Mexico - another major electronics supplier. And while domestic manufacturing in the US has increased, partly due to tariffs, it is still limited by higher costs and stricter regulations.",

Earlier this month Corie Barry, boss of US electronics retailer Best Buy, said that the \"the vast majority\" of the new tariffs will \"probably be passed on to the consumer\" because vendors in the industry have such small margins.",
      "In February, Taiwanese firm Acer said the price of its laptops would likely rise by 10% based on the 10% duties in place on China at the time, while US group HP has warned its profits would be lower because of the tariffs.",

      "During Mr Trump's first term, companies such as Apple successfully secured exemptions for products, and we may yet see carve-outs.",

      "Fears of a US economic slowdown could also make him change course.",
      "For the time being, though, tensions look likely to escalate. China, Mexico and Canada have vowed to retaliate against any US duties imposed on them, and this week Mr Trump threatened to double tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminium only to row back at the last minute.",
      "He plans to impose \"reciprocal tariffs\" on the rest of the world soon, and threatened tariff increases of up to 60% on Chinese goods while on the campaign trail.",
      "There is a risk this could drive up the price of tech goods around the world if China is forced to relocate manufacturing to countries where labour costs are higher. Moreover, countries may hit back with tariffs on imported US technology.",

      "The site, which is the most popular in the UK among young gamers aged eight to 12, has been dogged by claims of some children being exposed to explicit or harmful content through its games, alongside multiple reported allegations of bullying and grooming.",
      "But its co-founder and CEO Dave Baszucki insisted that the company is vigilant in protecting its users and pointed out that \"tens of millions\" of people have \"amazing experiences\" on the site.",
      "When asked what his message is to parents who don't want their children on the platform, Mr Baszucki said: \"My first message would be, if you're not comfortable, don't let your kids be on Roblox.\"",
      "\"That sounds a little counter-intuitive, but I would always trust parents to make their own decisions,\" he told BBC News in an exclusive interview.",
      "Responding to the interview, Mumsnet boss Justine Roberts said parents on the forum had spoken of how they struggled to manage their children's use of Roblox.",

In 2024 it averaged more than 80 million players per day \u2013 roughly 40% of them below the age of 13. Its vast empire includes some 40 million user-generated games and experiences.",

      "But Mr Baszucki says he remains confident in Roblox's safety tools and insists the firm goes above and beyond to keep its users safe.",
      "\"We do in the company take the attitude that any bad, even one bad incident, is one too many,\" he says.",
      "\"We watch for bullying, we watch for harassment, we filter all of those kinds of things, and I would say behind the scenes, the analysis goes on all the way to, if necessary, reaching out to law enforcement.\"",
      "Players who choose not to display what he calls \"civility\" can face temporary time-outs and longer bans, and Roblox claims to analyse all communications that pass between members on the platform, increasingly using more advanced AI systems and other tech to do so \u2014 and anything flagged is sent for further investigation.",
      "In November last year, under 13s were banned from sending direct messages, and also from playing in \"hangout experiences\" which features chat between players.",

      "While the filters caught our attempts to overtly move the conversation onto a different platform, we found easy ways to re-word requests to chat elsewhere and make suggestions about playing more adult games.",
      "When we showed the Roblox boss these findings, he argued that our example highlighted the comparative safety of Roblox: that people felt they had to take content which might breach Roblox's rules to other platforms.",
      "\"We don't condone any type of image-sharing on our own platform, and you'll see us getting more and more, I think, way beyond where the law is on this type of behaviour,\" Mr Baszucki says.",
      "He admits there is a delicate balance between encouraging friendships between young people, and blocking opportunities for them come to harm, but says he is confident Roblox can manage both.",

      "Mr Nagel called Trump's tariff policy \"economics from the past\" and \"definitely not a good idea\".",
      "A global trade war is one of the concerns from tariffs and retaliatory tariffs, he said, but added it was a \"necessity\" for the EU to react \"because if something is working against you, you can't accept a policy like this\".",
      "However, he suggested that when the US realises that the price that needs to be paid will be \"highest on the side of the Americans\", it will allow further opportunity for all sides to come to a different resolution.",

      "Mr Nagel refuted claims that Germany was the \"sick man of Europe\", saying it had a \"strong economic basis\" and \"strong small and medium sized companies\".",
      "\"But nevertheless, when you are exposed to an export-oriented model, then you are more exposed in a situation when tariffs are going up and there are so many uncertainties, so many unknowns,\" he added.",

      "However, German consumers are set to face higher prices.",
      "The head of Germany's BGA federation of wholesale, foreign trade and service, Dirk Jandura, warned on Wednesday that Germans might have to dig deeper into their pockets to pay for American products, such as orange juice, bourbon and peanut butter, in supermarkets.",
      "'Tectonic changes'",
      "Commenting on recent unprecedented changes in Germany's economic policy, which were altered allow the country to borrow more to spend on defence and infrastructure, Mr Nagel said it was an \"extraordinary measure\" for an \"extraordinary time\".",
      "\"The whole world is facing tectonic changes which makes the current situation very different from those seen in the past, hence the fiscal change,\" he said.",
      "He added the policy change would allow Germany some financial breathing room for recovery in the next few years, adding it provided a \"stability signal to the market\"."

      "And the EU is targeting US goods including Bourbon whiskey, jeans and Harley-Davidson motorcycles, which are considered to be politically sensitive in America because of their iconic status and because of which US states some of them are  produced in.",
      "Notwithstanding the hope for a free trade deal, in the wake of any reciprocal tariffs imposed by the US, which are perceived to be unfair and punitive, the UK government could find itself under growing pressure to retaliate in a similar way to the EU.",
      "Why is Trump imposing tariffs?",
      "The US President has a long - and often shifting - list of justifications for imposing these import taxes.",
      "One is that he claims to want to restore fairness to America's trading relations with the rest of the world.",
      "Trump complains that some other countries have higher tariffs on the goods they import from the US, than the other way round.",
      "The US had an average external tariff of 3.3% in 2023.",
      "That was slightly lower than the UK's average tariff of 3.8%.",
      "It was also below the European Union's average tariff of 5% and China's average tariff of 7.5%.",
      "However, America's average tariff was considerably lower than those of some of its other trading partners such as India (17%) and South Korea (13.4%).",
      "Broadly speaking, it is legitimate for Trump to point out that some countries have a higher average tariff on imports than America does.",
      "Replacing income tax?",
      "Another justification for tariffs from the president is raising more tax revenue for the US government. At one stage during the presidential election campaign in 2024, he suggested that tariff revenue could entirely replace the federal income tax.",
      "This is not only implausible given the $3 trillion a year value of US imports and the $2 trillion a year raised by income tax - but it needs to be seen in the context of the fact that tariffs would push up US consumer prices.",
      "Trump also wants to put pressure on other countries to change some of their policies. This has been the explicit rationale for US tariffs on Canada and Mexico, with the White House saying it wants to pressure those countries to stamp out cross-border Fentanyl smuggling.",
      "Another key goal articulated by the president is wanting to encourage multinational manufacturing companies to invest and produce more in America to create domestic jobs.",
      "Some of these justifications are inconsistent.",
      "Tariffs cannot be a both a major permanent tax revenue raiser as well as a way to bring manufacturing back to America on a large scale as the latter implies imports - and therefore tariff revenues - slumping.",
      "Moreover, the vast majority of economists are also extremely sceptical about the likelihood of tariffs achieving many of these goals.",

    "story": [
      "Sir Keir Starmer has been urged to protect disabled people claiming welfare payments from expected cuts to the benefits system.",
      "The health and disability-related benefits bill is now \u00a365bn a year and projected to increase to \u00a3100bn over the next four years, with research suggesting rising levels of mental ill health are behind the figures.",
      "The government is identifying cuts to the welfare budget ahead of the Spring Statement, with the PM working to rally MPs to support the move.",
      "Sir Keir was challenged at PMQs by Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey and Labour's Richard Burgon, who said disabled people were \"frightened\" and suggested \"the moral thing to do\" would be to introduce a wealth tax.",
      "Starmer says benefit system unfair and indefensible",
      "Work coaches to focus on long-term unemployed",
      "How big is the welfare budget and where might cuts fall?",
      "Expected cuts could fall on Personal Independent Payments (PIP), which provides help with extra living costs to those with a long-term physical or mental health condition, and cuts to incapacity benefits for people unable to work and receiving Universal Credit (UC).",
      "Speaking at PMQs, Sir Ed asked the prime minister to confirm that disability benefits for people who cannot work would not be cut.",
      "Sir Keir said: \"We will of course support those who need support, but help those who can work into work. They'll be the guiding principles.\"",
      "Later, Labour MP Burgon said that when disabled people \"hear the language of tough choices... it means the easy option of of making the poor and vulnerable people pay\", and said the \"courageous\" thing to do would be to introduce a wealth tax.",
      "Sir Keir responded that the Conservatives had \"locked millions out of work\" and there was \"a moral imperative\" to \"help those who want to work to get back into work\".",
      "On a wealth tax, he added: \"We have raised money, the energy profits levy, taxing non-doms, and air passenger duty on private jets, but this isn't a bottomless pit and must kickstart growth to get the economic stability that we need.\"",
      "Labour MPs have been called in to 10 Downing Street to discuss the changes,",
      "Bassetlaw MP Jo White, who represents the so-called Red Wall MPs, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme there was \"a moral duty to change people's lives\".",
      "\"It's a generational thing \u2013 if families are out of work they tend to bring up their children to exist on the benefits system,\" she said.",
      "\"People slide along on that low level of income, perhaps dipping into the black market, but their aspirations are so low and the communities do not change.\"",
      "Tackling this issue through changing the welfare system \"is absolutely critical\", White argued, because in order to \" lift people out of poverty... they need to be in work\".",
      "But significant numbers of Labour colleagues are unhappy. Nottingham East MP Nadia Whittome told the BBC her party was \"getting it badly wrong on this\".",
      "\"We cannot go back\" to the \"narrative of strivers versus skivers\", she said.",
      "Asked if she would rebel over the issue, Whittome said: \"I was on these benefits - my mum had to stop work when I was a teenager to care for me.",
      "\"I represent disabled people, all of us do, and we all hear their stories every day and just how scared they are about this and what a difference these payments make to their lives.",
      "\"I can't look my constituents in the eye, I can't look my mum in the eye, and support this.\"",
      "Many Labour MPs who spoke to the BBC have said they agreed many people currently on disability benefits could work and should.",
      "But they worried the government's rumoured plans, such as freezing Personal Independence Payments, would punish all those on disability benefits, including those with severe disabilities who could never work.",
      "That would be \"unforgivable\", one MP told the BBC.",
      "Another said making it more difficult to access disability payments was \"not what the Labour party ought to be about\".",
      "\"It's our very DNA that Labour was created to lift people out of difficult circumstances,\" they said.",
      "\"The government needs to stop talking about everyone who is on disability benefits as if they are all the same because they are not,\" said another.",
      "In the UK 1.3m people now claim disability benefits primarily for mental health or behavioural conditions \u2013 44% of all claimants, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) found.",
      "Exploring the reasons behind the rise, which has \"accelerated\" since the pandemic,  researchers said the UK was an outlier compared to other countries, none of which have seen the same level of post-pandemic increases in health-related benefit claims.",
      "More than half of the rise in 16 to 64-year-olds claiming disability benefits since the pandemic is for claims relating to mental health or behavioural conditions, according to a report from the IFS.",
      "Researchers found particularly fast growth in new disability benefit claims for learning disability and autism spectrum claims.",
      "There was also evidence of increasing levels of severe mental health problems.",
      "There is a heightened rate of mortality among working age people, due to \"deaths of despair\"- either by suicide, alcohol or drug misuse - and such deaths are much more likely if someone has a mental health illness.",
      "Trades Union Congress (TUC) general secretary Paul Nowak said slashing welfare for disabled people would \"only make the current challenges worse\".",
      "He urged Labour not to cut PIP, which he said enables many disabled people to access work rather than relying on benefits, but he backed reforms to a \"one-size-fits all approach\" towards one that provides tailored employment support.",
      "\"Trade unions share the government's ambitions to improve the nation's health and to help more people into good quality work,\" he said.",
      "\"A major lesson from the Tory years is that austerity damaged the nation's health - we must not make the same mistake again.\"",

    "story": [
      "US President Donald Trump has imposed a range of tariffs - or import taxes - on billions of dollars worth of goods coming into the US from some of its top trading partners.",
      "The tariffs apply to steel and aluminium imported to the US, as well as to some other products from Mexico, Canada and China - prompting counter-measures from the latter two countries and the European Union.",
      "Economists have warned the US tariffs - and those introduced in response by other countries - could put prices up for American consumers.",
      "That's because the tax is paid by the domestic company importing the goods, which may choose to pass the cost on to customers, or to reduce imports, meaning fewer products are available.",
      "So which things could become more expensive?",
      "Cars",
      "Some cars are among the products given a temporary reprieve by Trump from a new 25% import tax imposed on Canada and Mexico.",
      "When this ends, cars are expected to go up in price - by about $3,000 (\u00a32,300) according to TD Economics.",
      "That's because parts cross the US, Canadian and Mexican borders multiple times before a vehicle is assembled.",
      "Many well-known car brands, including Audi, BMW, Ford, General Motors and Honda trade parts and vehicles across the three countries.",

      "\"Suffice it to say that disrupting these trends through tariffs... would come with significant costs,\" said TD Economics' Andrew Foran.",

      "Follow live updates on Trump's tariffs",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "Beer, whisky and tequila",
      "Popular Mexican beers Modelo and Corona could get more expensive for US customers if the American companies importing them pass on the increased import taxes.",
      "However, it's also possible that firms could decide to bring in less foreign beer.",
      "Modelo became the number one beer brand in the US in 2023, and remains in the top spot, for now.",
      "The picture is more complicated when it comes to spirits, which have been largely free of tariffs since the 1990s.",
      "Industry bodies from the US, Canada and Mexico issued a joint statement in advance of the tariffs being announced saying they were \"deeply concerned\".",
      "They argue that certain brands, such as Bourbon, Tennessee whiskey, tequila and Canadian whisky are \"recognized as distinctive products and can only be produced in their designated countries\".",
      "So given the production of these drinks cannot simply be moved, supplies might be impacted, leading to price rises.",
      "The bodies also highlighted that many companies own different spirit brands in the US, Canada and Mexico.",
      "Houses",
      "The US imports about a third of its softwood lumber from Canada each year, and that key building material could be hit by Trump's tariffs.",
      "Trump has said the US has \"more lumber than we ever use\".",
      "However, the National Association of Home Builders urged the president to exempt building materials \"because of their harmful effect on housing affordability\".",
      "The industry group has \"serious concerns\" that the tariffs on lumber could increase the cost of building homes - which are mostly made out of wood in the US - and also put off developers building new homes.",
      "\"Consumers end up paying for the tariffs in the form of higher home prices,\" the NAHB said.",
      "Imports from the rest of the world could also be affected.",
      "On 1 March, Trump ordered an investigation into whether the US should place additional tariffs on most lumber and timber imports, regardless of their country of origin, or create incentives to boost domestic production.",
      "Findings are due towards the end of 2025.",
      "Maple syrup",
      "The \"most obvious\" household impact of a trade war with Canada would be on the price of Canadian maple syrup, according to Thomas Sampson from the London School of Economics.",
      "Canada's billion-dollar industry accounts for 75% of the world's entire maple syrup production.",
      "The majority of the sweet staple - around 90% - is produced in the province of Quebec, where the world's sole strategic reserve of maple syrup was set up 24 years ago.",
      "\"That maple syrup is going to become more expensive. And that's a direct price increase that households will face,\" Mr Sampson said.",
      "\"If I buy goods that are domestically produced in the US, but [which use] inputs from Canada, the price of those goods is also going to go up,\" he added.",
      "Fuel prices",
      "Canada is America's largest foreign supplier of crude oil.",
      "According to the most recent official trade figures, 61% of oil imported into the US between January and November 2024 came from Canada.",
      "While the US has introduced a 25% tariff on most goods imported from Canada, Canadian energy faces a lower rate of 10%.",
      "The US doesn't have a shortage of oil, but its refineries are designed to process so-called \"heavier\" - or thicker - crude oil, which mostly comes from Canada, with some from Mexico.",
      "\"Many refineries need heavier crude oil to maximize flexibility of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel production,\" according to the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers.",
      "That means if Canada decided to reduce crude oil exports in retaliation against US tariffs, it could push up fuel prices.",
      "Avocados",
      "Avocados thrive in in the Mexican climate.",
      "Nearly 90% of the avocados consumed in the US come from Mexico.",
      "The US Agriculture Department has warned that tariffs on Mexican fruit and vegetables could increase the cost of avocados.",

    "summary": "Stock market falls, tariffs and other changes are reigniting fear of economic downturn in the US.",
    "story": [
      "During his election campaign last year, Donald Trump promised Americans he would usher in a new era of prosperity.",
      "Now two months into his presidency, he's painting a slightly different picture.",
      "He has warned that it will be hard to bring down prices and the public should be prepared for a \"little disturbance\" before he can bring back wealth to the US.",
      "Meanwhile, even as the latest figures indicate inflation is easing, analysts say the odds of a downturn are increasing, pointing to his policies.",
      "So is Trump about to trigger a recession in the world's largest economy?",
      "Markets fall and recession risks rise",
      "In the US, a recession is defined as a prolonged and widespread decline in economic activity typically characterised by a jump in unemployment and fall in incomes.",
      "A chorus of economic analysts have warned in recent days that the risks of such a scenario are rising.",
      "A JP Morgan report put the chance of recession at 40%, up from 30% at the start of the year, warning that US policy was \"tilting away from growth\", while Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, upped the odds from 15% to 35%, citing tariffs.",
      "The forecasts came as the S&P 500, which tracks 500 of the biggest companies in the US sank sharply. It has now fallen to its lowest level since September in a sign of fears about the future.",
      "The market turmoil is being driven partly by concerns about new taxes on imports, called tariffs, which Trump has introduced since he took office.",
      "He has hit products from America's three biggest trade partners with the new duties, and threatened them more widely in moves that analysts believe will increase prices and curb growth.",
      "The latest official inflation figures in the US showed the rate of price increases cooling in February, however.",
      "Prices were up 2.8% over the 12 months to February, down from 3% in January, the Labor Department said.",
      "Still, Trump and his economic advisers have been warning the public to be prepared for some economic pain, while appearing to dismiss the market concerns - a marked change from his first term, when he frequently cited the stock market as a measure of his own success.",
      "\"There will always be changes and adjustments,\" he said last week, in response to pleas from businesses for more certainty.",
      "The posture has increased investor worries about his plans.",
      "Goldman Sachs last week raised its recession bets from 15% to 20%, saying it saw policy changes as \"the key risk\" to the economy. But it noted that the White House still had \"the option to pull back if the downside risks begin to look more serious\".",
      "\"If the White House remained committed to its policies even in the face of much worse data, recession risk would rise further,\" the firm's analysts warned.",
      "Tariffs, uncertainty and slowing growth",
      "For many firms, the biggest question mark is tariffs, which raise costs for US businesses by putting taxes on imports. As Trump unveils tariff plans, many companies are now facing lower profit margins, while holding off on investments and hiring as they try to figure out what the future will look like.",
      "Investors are also worried about big cuts to the government workforce and government spending.",
      "Brian Gardner, chief of Washington policy strategy at the investment bank Stifel, said businesses and investors had thought Trump intended tariffs as a negotiating tool.",
      "\"But what the president and his cabinet are signalling is actually a bigger deal. It's a restructuring of the American economy,\" he said. \"And that's what's been driving markets in the last couple of weeks.\"",
      "The US economy was already undergoing a slowdown, engineered in part by the central bank, which has kept interest rates higher to try to cool activity and stabilise prices.",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?Six things that could get more expensive",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "Six things that could get more expensive",
      "In recent weeks, some data suggests a more rapid weakening.",
      "Retail sales fell in February, confidence - which had popped after Trump's election on several surveys of consumers and businesses - has fallen, and companies including major airlines, retailers such as Walmart and Target, and manufacturers are warning of a pullback.",
      "Some analysts are worried a drop in the stock market could trigger a further clampdown in spending, especially among higher income households.",
      "That could deliver a major hit to the US economy, which is driven by consumer spending and has grown increasingly dependent on those richer households, as lower income families face pressure from inflation.",
      "The head of the US central bank, Jerome Powell, offered assurances in a speech last week, noting that sentiment had not been a good indicator of behaviour in recent years.",
      "\"Despite elevated levels of uncertainty, the US economy continues to be in a good place,\" he said.",
      "But the US economy is currently deeply linked to the rest of the world, warned Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB.",
      "\"The fact that tariffs could disrupt that at the same time that there were signs that the US economy was weakening anyway ... is really fuelling recession fears,\" she says.",
      "Stock market in tech ripe for correction",
      "The unease in the stock market isn't all about Trump.",
      "Investors were already jittery about the possibility of a correction, after big gains over the last two years, driven by the sharp run-up in tech stocks fuelled by investor optimism about artificial intelligence (AI).",
      "Chipmaker Nvidia, for example, saw its share price jump from less than $15 at the start of 2023 to nearly $150 in November of last year.",
      "That type of rise had stirred debate about an \"AI bubble\" - with investors on high alert for signs of it bursting, which would have a big impact on the stock market, regardless of the dynamics in the wider economy.",
      "Now, with views of the US economy darkening, optimism about AI is getting even harder to sustain.",
      "Tech analyst Gene Munster of Deepwater Asset Management wrote on social media this week that his optimism had \"taken a step back\" as the chance of a recession increased \"measurably\" over the past month.",
      "\"The bottom line is that if we enter a recession, it will be extremely difficult for the AI trade to continue,\" he said.",

      "The comments come as Miche\u00e1l Martin presented US President Donald Trump with a bowl of shamrocks in the White House as part of St Patrick's Day celebrations.",
      "It follows a bilateral meeting between the two leaders where the president raised a \"massive\" trade imbalance with Ireland and accused the European Union of treating the US \"very badly\".",
      "Earlier on Wednesday, the EU announced it will impose counter tariffs on \u20ac26bn ($28bn) worth of US goods from next month.",
      "At the shamrock presentation ceremony on Wednesday evening, Martin referenced the US intervention during in the Troubles in Northern Ireland, and its role in the creation of the Good Friday Agreement.",
      "\"The story of peace in Ireland is one that we wrote together,\" the taoiseach said.",
      "\"We know that building peace is a difficult and painstaking task but when the mighty United States of America puts its shoulder to the wheel, there is no mountain it cannot move.\"",
      "Martin also praised Trump's \"unrelenting focus and energy\" in bringing peace to Ukraine and the Middle East.",
      "\"In my view, there is nothing more noble than the pursuit of peace and this is what you are doing,\" he added.",
      "In remarks beforehand, President Trump said he \"loves the Irish\".",
      "\"We're always going to have that special friendship,\" he said. \"The bond between our nations is as old as our country itself.\"",
      "Earlier, while speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, Trump addressed the \"massive deficit\" with Ireland.",
      "\"We want to sort of even that out as nicely as we can, and we'll work together.\"",
      "Martin told President Trump that foreign investment is a two-way street, adding that Ireland is \"investing a lot more in America now\".",
      "The EU's move is in retaliation to President Trump's 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminium imports into the US, which came into effect overnight.",
      "Trump said it had caused \"ill will\".",
      "\"The European Union's been very tough, and it's our turn too. We get a turn at that also,\" he said.",
      "\"I'm not knocking it, they are doing what they are doing for the EU, but it does create ill will and you know we are going to do reciprocal tariffs,\" he added.",
      "'We don't want to do anything to hurt Ireland'",
      "Official figures from Ireland's statistics agency suggest the country had a goods-trade surplus with the US of just over \u20ac50bn (\u00a341.6bn) in 2024.",
      "Ireland's goods exports to the US were \u20ac72.6bn (\u00a360.4bn) in 2024 while its imports from the US were \u20ac22.5bn (\u00a318.7bn).",
      "Trump said that the EU was \"set up in order to take advantage of the United States\".",
      "When asked if Ireland was also taking advantage of the US, Trump said: \"Of course.\"",
      "\"I have great respect for Ireland, for what they did and they should have done just what they did. But the United States shouldn't have let that happen. We had stupid leaders, we had leaders who didn't have a clue.\"",
      "He added: \"All of a sudden Ireland has our pharmaceutical companies, this beautiful island of five million people has got the entire US pharmaceutical industry in its grasps.",
      "\"The Irish are smart, smart people and you took our pharmaceutical companies - and other companies - but you know, through taxation, proper taxation, they made it very, very good for companies to move up there,\" he added.",
      "Trump also said that if he drained Ireland of all the US companies \"maybe I'd lose the Irish vote\".",
      "\"We don't want to do anything to hurt Ireland, but we do want fairness and [Martin] understands that,\" he added.",
      "However, Martin said the pharmaceutical companies \"are doing very well in Ireland\", and that there was room to discuss a deal.",
      "\"I think there's room for those companies to grow in America and many of them, by the way, have already announced fairly significant manufacturing investments now [in the US],\" the taoiseach added.",
      "Martin said Ireland had served the US companies well with a strong, educated workforce and access to the EU single market.",
      "Housing answer stirs controversy",
      "The president said Ireland's housing crisis was caused by the country \"doing so well\".",
      "Housing availability and cost is a major political and social issue in Ireland, with reports stating thousands of new homes every year are needed to keep up with demand.",
      "\"You know why they have a housing crisis? Because they're doing so well, they can't produce houses fast enough,\" Trump said.",
      "Martin added it was a \"good answer\".",
      "However the remark has drawn criticism from opposition parties, with Sinn F\u00e9in stating that joking about the housing crisis is \"never a good answer\".",
      "Trump also praised Northern Ireland golfer Rory McIlroy and MMA fighter Conor McGregor during the visit.",
      "He called McIlroy \"talented\", adding he had played a round with him three weeks ago.",
      "The president also complimented McGregor's tattoos: \"He's got the best tattoos I've ever seen\".",
      "After the bilateral meeting, both Trump and Martin travelled to Capitol Hill to attend the Friends of Ireland luncheon hosted by the US House speaker, Mike Johnson.",
      "Addressing the luncheon, Martin said Trump is a \"great friend of Ireland\" and \"we hope to welcome you back to our small island... very soon\".",
      "The United States has been a \"place of welcome and opportunity for Irish people\" for centuries, the taoiseach added.",
      "\"Our nation's green has been threaded through the rich tapestry of the United States by almost 32 million Irish-Americans.\"",
      "Also speaking at the event, Trump said the \"Irish spirit is truly alive and thriving in America\".",
      "US 'steadfast friend' of Ireland",
      "Prior to the meeting, Martin attended a breakfast hosted by Vice-President JD Vance.",
      "Speaking at the breakfast he said that the US \"has been a steadfast friend of Ireland for centuries\".",
      "He said the peace process was a \"signature achievement of US foreign policy\", adding that Ireland is \"ready to play our part in supporting work to end conflict and to secure peace in the Ukraine or in the Middle East or wherever\".",
      "Martin welcomed the \"progress that has clearly been made\" as a result of the Trump administration's \"unrelenting focus and effort\" to secure peace.",
      "Vance described the US-Ireland relationship as \"one of the great alliances and great friendships between nations\".",
      "He added that Ireland is a country with \"incredible community\u2026 beautiful landscape and also a lot of interesting technological growth\".",
      "\"One of the more robust areas for us to work on with our Irish friends in the years to come is going to be technology and particularly artificial intelligence,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "People protesting against Tesla should be labelled domestic terrorists, President Donald Trump said on Tuesday at a White House media event designed to bolster Elon Musk's electric car company.",
      "Trump sat in the driver's seat of a brand new red Tesla that he said he planned to buy, with Musk in the passenger seat, but did not test drive it.",
      "Demonstrators have targeted Tesla showrooms in recent weeks in protest against Musk's cost-cutting role in Trump's administration.",
      "Trump said they were \"harming a great American company\", and anyone using violence against the electric carmaker would \"go through hell\".",
      "The president described the shiny red Model-S, one of a number of Teslas lined up on the White House drive, as \"beautiful\" but said he was no longer allowed to drive and so would keep the car for the use of White House staff. Current and former presidents are not allowed to drive for security reasons.",
      "He also said he would not want to buy a self-driving model, which Musk said would reach the market next year.",
      "The showcase for Tesla's cars outside the White House came after Tesla's market value halved since its all-time peak in December, sliding 15% in a single day on Monday, before recovering slightly on Tuesday.",
      "Trump said he had told Musk, \"You know, Elon, I don't like what's happening to you, and Tesla's a great company.\"",
      "Musk, Trump's top donor in the election campaign, has been tasked with radically cutting government spending through his Department of Government Efficiency (Doge).",
      "He has instigated sweeping cuts to federal workforce, cancelled international aid programmes, and has voiced support for far-right politics.",
      "That has prompted a backlash among Tesla owners.",
      "\"Tesla takedown\" protests have seen demonstrators gather outside dealerships, in Portland, Oregon, last week, and New York City earlier in March, with the aim of undermining the Tesla brand.",
      "Organisers behind the protests said on social media that the demonstrations were peaceful, but a few have been destructive with fires intentionally set at Tesla showrooms and charging stations in Colorado and Massachusetts last week.",
      "Musk's Tesla facilities in US face 'Takedown' protests",
      "Is Trump reining in Musk after a cabinet showdown with secretaries?",
      "Who is Elon Musk?",
      "Asked in front of the White House whether such protesters should be labelled \"domestic terrorists\", the president said \"I will do that\", a position later confirmed by a White House spokesperson.",
      "\"You do it to Tesla and you do it to any company, we're going to catch you and you're going to go through hell,\" Trump said.",
      "On his social media platform, Truth Social, Trump blamed Tesla's share price falls on \"radical left lunatics\", who he said were trying to \"illegally and collusively boycott\" the firm.",
      "However, stock analysts said the main reason for the poor performance of the shares was fear about Tesla meeting production targets and a drop in sales over the past year.",
      "UBS warned that new Tesla deliveries could be much lower than expected this year.",
      "Lindsay James, an investment strategist at Quilter Investors, said that although there was \"an element\" of Elon Musk's politics having a \"brand impact\", there were other reasons for the share price fall.",
      "Ultimately the drop came down to \"hard numbers\", she said.",
      "\"When we look at new orders, for example in Europe and China, you can see that they've effectively halved over the last year,\" she said.",
      "Sales in Europe have fallen sharply this year. Across the continent, they were down 45% in January compared to the same month in 2024, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA).",
      "There has also been a steep decline in China \u2013 a key market \u2013 and Australia.",
      "Other experts have said Tesla is over-valued, so the fall is seen as a correction, while others have pointed to rising competition from some of China's electric vehicle companies.",
      "Investors are \"certainly getting more worried about an economic slowdown too, so the richest-valued companies like Tesla have been hit hardest in recent days\", Ms James said.",
      "There have also been concerns that Musk has not been focusing enough of his attention on his firms.",
      "In an interview with Fox Business on Monday, he said he was combining the Doge role with running his businesses \"with great difficulty\".",
      "Alongside Tesla, his businesses include Space X, which has experienced serious failures in the last two launches of its giant Starship rocket, and the social media network X, which suffered an outage on Monday.",
      "Despite his supportive comments, President Trump's policies so far have been designed to limit electric car sales in the US, including revoking a 2021 order by former president Joe Biden that half of all car sales should be electric by 2030, and halting unspent government funds for charging stations.",
      "Trump's tariffs could also hurt the manufacturer. Tesla chief financial officer Vaibhav Taneja said in January Tesla parts sourced from Canada and Mexico would be subject to the levies and that this could hit profitability.",
      "Tesla's share price fall came against a broader US market slump on Monday as investors, concerned about the economic effects of Trump tariffs and weakening confidence in the economy, sold shares.",
      "Trump's own economic policies on tariffs are also making investors nervous, analysts said.",

      "Like towns around the UK, Macclesfield has struggled with retailers closing, leaving empty stores, so there is a buzz around the new arrival.",
      "But Gail's, a brand that started in London more than 20 years ago, is controversial. It draws crowds and inspires social media memes, but attracts fierce criticism too.",
      "A recent spate of national media coverage has even asked why some people \"hate\" Gail's so much, focusing on everything from who owns it to what it does with unsold pastries.",
      "Its arrival isn't universally popular here either.",
      "\"We don't need another coffee shop,\" says Linda Willdig. She is out shopping with her friend Nicola Tomlinson, who agrees. \"There are too many,\" says Nicola.",
      "In fact, from a table outside the new Gail's you could easily throw a cinnamon bun and hit both a Caffe Nero and a Costa. Greggs is just around the corner too.",
      "So something different might have been better, says Jane Kent, a community nurse.",
      "\"People will be larding out on all the bakery stuff,\" she says. \"We don't need more pastries.\"",
      "At heart, though, the objections to Gail's are not about what it sells, but that it doesn't really belong, that it will push up prices and put independent cafes out of business.",
      "But Stephanie Lamb, a teacher on maternity leave, is more welcoming.",
      "\"I don't know Gail's, so it's not necessarily a chain to me,\" she says. \"I'm just happy to have something extra in town.\"",
      "She likes a latte and a croissant and somewhere she can read a book for an hour.",
      "At Gail's prices that would set her back \u00a36.50. Yes, it's pricey, she says, but she is still planning to \"give it a whirl\".",
      "Gail's - a name that suggests a traditional, single-owner, cafe - favours attractive old buildings, often ones vacated as bank branches close, especially if it is a corner site that means it's more visible to passers by.",
      "It has 170 outlets mostly clustered in London and the south east. But this year it plans to open around 40 more, including Ely, Cambridgeshire later this month, Bath in April, and Buxton, Derbyshire in May.",
      "At Friday's opening in Macclesfield there was a flurry of interest in the new place on the square.",
      "Even in the wake of the cost of living crisis, we are increasingly choosing a coffee out as a treat. Nearly two-thirds of people said they went to a coffee shop more than once a week, according to World Coffee Portal, spending more than \u00a36 per visit on average.",
      "So coffee shops are weathering the tough economic climate better than most businesses. There are now 11,450 branded chain outlets across the UK, up from 9,800 five years ago.",
      "Speciality chains like Black Sheep Coffee, Coffee#1 and Blank Street are springing up in city centres, while the giants like Costa and Starbucks are opening drive-throughs and outlets in retail parks.",
      "Caffe Nero has bought up several smaller chains, in different parts of the country, and is retaining their independent branding so it can make the most of local loyalties.",
      "With enthusiasm for coffee so strong it's something of a mystery to Gail's chief executive Tom Molnar why people object to his chain. He feels misunderstood.",
      "Mr Molnar - a joint owner with private equity backing - has been working on expanding the brand since he joined in 2003, but says it's not just about coffee. Its role as a neighbourhood bakery - baking fresh in-store and in regional bakery hubs every day - is key.",
      "He's hoping to roll Gail's out to many more neighbourhoods, including less affluent ones.",
      "\"It's not supposed to be posh,\" he insists.",

      "\"I prefer a place that's evolving and growing rather than some place that's too established,\" he says.",
      "If the algorithm homes in on a particular High Street it is a vote of confidence in that town's future.",
      "But retail experts warn that the very nature of the places that Gail's is picking means there are likely to be accusations of gentrification, increasing prices and rents for existing businesses and residents.",
      "\"Gail's is moving into areas with strong local identities. And when that happens, there will always be a reaction,\" says Kate Hardcastle, founder of Insight with Passion.",
      "\"It's not just about a bakery opening, I think it's also about what it represents.",
      "\"Some will see it as a sign of investment and revitalisation, while others worry it's another step back to our High Streets looking like carbon copies of each other,\" she says.",
      "In Flour, Water, Salt - a direct rival to Gail's selling sourdough bread, bagels, coffee-iced buns and sausage rolls - that is just yards from the new shop, some loyal customers are adamantly opposed to the newcomer.",
      "\"Gail's isn't welcome here,\" says Karen Pearson, a businesswoman who lives just outside Macclesfield. She and her friends are worried that the arrival of Gail's means the town is \"on the up\", when in fact they would rather it \"stayed like it is\".",
      "They're not keen on big corporations coming into the town, concerned they might squeeze out independents.",
      "But firefighter and local councillor Anthony Harrison, reckons Gail's is no match for a place like Flour, Water, Salt. \"It's just a posh Greggs,\" he says.",
      "Independents may not be as under threat as people fear, says Graham Soult, a retail consultant from the north of England.",

      "Flour, Water, Salt's manager Toby Johnstone isn't worried. It could mean more footfall, with more people trying his shop too.",

    "story": [
      "The former Bank of England boss, Mark Carney, will be Canada's next prime minister, at least for now. He will need all his experience handling global economic crises as the country faces a trade war launched by US President Donald Trump.",
      "Mark Carney was the first non-British person to become governor of the Bank of England in its more than 300-year history when he took the job in 2013.",
      "He had previously steered his home country through the Great Recession as the governor of the Bank of Canada, the country's central bank, before being poached for Britain's top banking job.",
      "But unlike most PM-hopefuls, Carney has never held political office. Still, he won the contest to replace outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau handily. Now, he must lead the country through one of its toughest challenges yet - an escalating trade war with its biggest trading partner, the United States.",
      "But holding on to the role of PM will be a fight in and of itself. Canada's next federal election is scheduled for this October, but many expect it to be called as early as this month.",

      "LIVE - latest updates and analysis",
      "A simple guide to Canada's federal election",
      "Although Carney has travelled the globe, working for Goldman Sachs in places like New York, London and Tokyo, he was born in the remote northern town of Fort Smith, in the Northwest Territories.",
      "The son of a high-school principal, he went to Harvard University on scholarship where he played the most Canadian of sports, ice hockey. In 1995, he earned his PhD in economics from Oxford University.",
      "In 2003, he left the private sector to join the Bank of Canada as a deputy governor, then worked for the Department of Finance as senior associate deputy minister.",
      "In 2007, he was appointed governor of the Bank of Canada, shortly before global markets crashed, sending the country into a deep recession. His leadership at the central bank is widely praised for helping the country avoid the worst of the crisis.",
      "Although central bankers are notoriously circumspect, he was open about his intentions to keep interest rates low for at least a year, after dramatically cutting them.",
      "That move would be credited for helping businesses keep investing even when the markets sank. He would go on to take a similar approach when he was lured back to London - this time as the governor of the Bank of England.",
      "In his time at the Bank's Threadneedle Street headquarters, he oversaw considerable changes in how the institution worked. At the start of his tenure, the Bank assumed responsibility for financial regulation after the abolition of the Financial Services Authority.",
      "He is credited with modernising the Bank, appearing much more frequently in the media than his predecessor.",
      "In 2015, the Bank reduced the number of interest rate meetings from 12 to eight a year, and started publishing minutes alongside the announcement of interest rate decisions.",
      "Interest rates were anchored at historic lows when he took over, but he introduced a policy of \"forward guidance\", where the Bank would try to further support the economy and encourage lending by pledging not to raise rates until unemployment fell below 7%.",
      "Confusion about this policy saw an MP compare him to an \"unreliable boyfriend\", a monicker which stuck around long after the original controversy died down.",
      "Unlike previous governors who generally kept a low profile, he made controversial interventions ahead of two big constitutional referendums.",
      "In 2014 he warned that an independent Scotland might have to surrender powers to the UK if it wanted to continue using the pound.",
      "Before the Brexit referendum, he warned that a vote to leave the EU could spark a recession.",
      "In the wake of the leave vote, after David Cameron resigned as prime minister and the pound plunged, he addressed the nation in a bid to reassure the country that the financial system would operate as normal.",
      "He described it as his \"toughest day\" on the job, but said the contingency plans the Bank put in place worked effectively.",
      "The Bank later cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - and restarted its quantitative easing programme to support the economy.",
      "His final week in March 2020 saw the start of the acutest phase of the Covid pandemic - the Bank cut rates by 0.5% to support the economy, and Mr Carney told the country that the economic shock \"should be temporary\".",
      "Carney's time at the bank gave him plenty of experience dealing with Donald Trump - who has not only imposed steep tariffs on Canada since returning to office in January, but has also suggested that America should annex its less powerful neighbour.",
      "From 2011-18, Carney was chair of the Financial Stability Board which co-ordinated the work of regulatory authorities around the world, giving him a key role in the global response to the policies of the first Trump presidency.",
      "He was a regular at the G20 meetings, with a pitch-side view of Trump on the global stage.",
      "He is also known as an advocate for environmental sustainability. In 2019 he became a UN special envoy for climate change, and in 2021 launched the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, a grouping of banks and financial institutions working to combat climate change.",
      "His political ambitions have been rumoured for years, but until recently the 59-year-old had brushed off the idea.",
      "\"Why don't I become a circus clown?\" he told a reporter in 2012.",
      "Things changed, however, when Trudeau stepped down in January after his finance minister, Chrystia Freeland quit his cabinet, sparking a party squabble that, coupled with Trudeau's tanking poll numbers, led the prime minister to announce his resignation.",
      "Reports suggested Trudeau had intended to replace Freeland with Carney in the finance post.",
      "Freeland - a personal friend - even ran against him in the race to replace Trudeau. But Carney won by a landslide, pitching himself as the best equipped to take on Trump, who has imposed steep tariffs on Canadians goods.",
      "\"I know how to manage crises,\" Carney said during a leadership debate late last month. \"In a situation like this, you need experience in terms of crisis management, you need negotiating skills.\"",
      "Still, his time in the world of finance has opened him up to criticism from political rivals in Canada.",
      "The Conservatives have accused Carney of lying about his role in moving investment firm Brookfield Asset Management's head office from Toronto to New York, though Carney says the recent formal decision to relocate the firm was made after he quit the board.",
      "They have also pushed him to disclose his financial assets, which Carney currently does not need to do as he is not an elected member of parliament.",
      "His team has said he will comply with all applicable ethics rules and guidelines once he is prime minister."

      "And in secondary schools, though the number of teachers has grown by 3% since 2015, pupil numbers have grown by 15% in the same time - meaning the number of students in class sizes above 30 has increased.",
      "The NFER's school workforce lead, Jack Worth, says more students are now being taught by unqualified or non-specialist teachers, with the impact felt more acutely by students living in disadvantaged areas.",
      "\"The spending review in June is a real now or never moment. Not taking that opportunity will really risk not delivering [on the 6,500 promise] and not having anything to show the electorate at the end of the parliament.\"",

      "The site, which is the most popular in the UK among young gamers aged eight to 12, has been dogged by claims of some children being exposed to explicit or harmful content through its games, alongside multiple reported allegations of bullying and grooming.",
      "But its co-founder and CEO Dave Baszucki insisted that the company is vigilant in protecting its users and pointed out that \"tens of millions\" of people have \"amazing experiences\" on the site.",
      "When asked what his message is to parents who don't want their children on the platform, Mr Baszucki said: \"My first message would be, if you're not comfortable, don't let your kids be on Roblox.\"",
      "\"That sounds a little counter-intuitive, but I would always trust parents to make their own decisions,\" he told BBC News in an exclusive interview.",

In 2024 it averaged more than 80 million players per day \u2013 roughly 40% of them below the age of 13. Its vast empire includes some 40 million user-generated games and experiences.",
      "In the UK the Online Safety Act, which comes in to force in April, has strict laws for all tech firms specifically aimed at protecting children from online harms.",
      "But Mr Baszucki says he remains confident in Roblox's safety tools and insists the firm goes above and beyond to keep its users safe.",
      "\"We do in the company take the attitude that any bad, even one bad incident, is one too many,\" he says.",
      "\"We watch for bullying, we watch for harassment, we filter all of those kinds of things, and I would say behind the scenes, the analysis goes on all the way to, if necessary, reaching out to law enforcement.\"",
      "Players who choose not to display what he calls \"civility\" can face temporary time-outs and longer bans, and Roblox claims to analyse all communications that pass between members on the platform, increasingly using more advanced AI systems and other tech to do so \u2014 and anything flagged is sent for further investigation.",
      "In November last year, under 13s were banned from sending direct messages, and also from playing in \"hangout experiences\" which features chat between players.",

      "Smartphones should not be banned \"outright\" from schools in Wales, a Senedd inquiry has concluded.",
      "Instead the Petitions Committee report said schools should get more Welsh government support to set their own restrictions.",
      "The committee said there was \"plenty of evidence\" that smartphones caused harm but it also heard that they can support young people's welfare and safety.",
      "Responding, the Welsh government said it was working with schools \"to ensure they have policies and resources to reduce the negative impacts of mobile phones and promote learning\". Zena Blackwell, whose petition prompted the inquiry, called for \"consistency\" as \"the current system feels unjust\".",
      "The Senedd's Petitions Committee held an inquiry in response to a petition signed by more than 3,000 people calling for smartphones to be banned in schools, except in exceptional circumstances.",
      "The committee spoke to teachers, pupils and parents as part of its inquiry.",
      "Plan to make phone use safer for teens watered down",
      "Mobile ban in schools not improving grades or behaviour, study suggests",
      "Girl without smartphone unable to join in lesson",
      "It considered the different rules currently adopted by schools in Wales and, what it described as, \"the complex relationship\" between young people and their smartphones.",
      "The committee concluded that an outright \"ban\" on smartphones in all schools was not \"a clear cut call\" and that instead it wanted to see more support for schools to set their own restrictions.",
      "Kayla Lovell, 25, from Cribyn, Ceredigion, said she did not think phones needed to be banned in schools and argued that banning them only led to pupils hiding phones.",
      "Do people want phones banned in schools?",
      "\"I think for people like maybe in sixth form, it would be a good idea, and a part of safety,\" she said.",
      "For Sam Herbert, 50, mother to 13-year-old Stephanie, safety is also a valid reason to question a ban.",
      "\"Maybe they should hold them in the school when they attend school, and then give them back to the end of the day, so that they have them for going home or when they need them,\" she said.",
      "But Stephanie, who is diabetic, uses her phone to manage her condition, meaning a ban would be a real cause for concern for her.",
      "Lewis Jarvis-Blower, 23, from Llanwnnen, Ceredigion, said a ban was \"probably for the best\" but admitted he liked using his phone during breaks and at lunchtime.",
      "\"I would be fuming, really angry,\" he said, if he were a student now and a ban was introduced.",
      "\"It already feels like sometimes there's not the freedom there,\" he added.",
      "\"The schools struggling with it... it's probably best if they have their own rules to cater uniquely to their students.\"",
      "In its report, the committee calls on the Welsh government to establish \"clear guidance, alongside a robust decision-making framework, which will give teachers the confidence to set rules that work best for their young people\".",
      "It also wants the Welsh government to keep following the evidence of studies into the impact of smartphone restrictions during the school day.",
      "Tracey Boothby, 44, from Lampeter, Ceredigion, said a ban would be \"tricky\" but added that while children were in school, social media was \"obviously a no-no\".",
      "\"You're in a place of education, and I do feel, as parents that... we should help with whatever the schools decide,\" she said.",
      "Laura Doel, national secretary of school leaders' union NAHT Cymru, said an outright ban would not work.",
      "\"School leaders need the flexibility and support to develop a policy that works for them to keep the children and staff in their schools and communities safe,\" she said in a statement.",
      "\"The fact is we live in a society where phone use is prevalent.",
      "\"But it is important that we educate children and young people, to help them understand and navigate this online world, and make sure they know how to seek help when it becomes unsafe or unhealthy, as well as clamping down on those who do not obey the rules.\"",
      "Carolyn Thomas, the Labour chairwoman of the committee, said it was \"a complex\" topic.",
      "\"The growing body of evidence about the harms of smartphones outweighing the benefits for children is both compelling and concerning,\" she said.",
      "\"However, on balance we do not believe that it supports a move to a uniform ban on smartphones in all Welsh schools.",
      "\"The more evidence we heard, the clearer it became that the relationship between young people and their phones is not simple.",
      "\"There are children who experience distraction, cyber-bullying, addiction and anxiety delivered through their phones.",
      "\"There are others who are liberated by being able to manage health conditions or feel emboldened to walk to school, knowing they can always contact a parent.\"",
      "In England, smartphones are not banned from schools but the UK government has issued guidance encouraging headteachers to prohibit their use.",
      "Some Welsh schools already ban smartphones.",
      "Zena Blackwell, who set up the petition calling for a Wales-wide ban, said in a statement responding to the report that \"consistency is paramount, as the current system feels unjust\", urging Welsh ministers to \"not shy away from making bold moves\".",
      "\"While some organisations argue that bans will not work, I question how other countries\u2014and even entire boroughs in the UK, such as Barnet\u2014are successfully implementing them to great effect,\" she added."

      "The conditions most likely to result in a refused claim were those that may be managed more successfully by an adult than a child, like diabetes or asthma, experts said.",
      "But among those to have had claims rejected since PIP's introduction in 2013 are thousands living with life-changing conditions including cancer, blindness, psychosis, deafness and epilepsy.",
      "The 124,000 young people affected since then include Holly Crouch, who said the decision by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) had left her feeling \"like a burden\" when \"nothing changed but my age\".",
      "She said she had been refused PIP when she applied as a teenager, despite providing evidence from specialists saying she was at risk of sudden, life-threatening epileptic seizures.",

      "\"Everything was taken so quickly and I felt angry, neglected and like I hadn't been believed. It was so hard to deal with.\"",
      "Holly said she had lost three jobs because of her epilepsy and had to \"rely on others for everything\" without PIP.",
      "\"I'll never feel like an adult as I can't do things everyone else is able to, like drive or work,\" she said. \"My parents even have to be there when I shower or boil a kettle as I could have a seizure.",
      "\"I understand there could be changes to conditions, but that's what reviews are for - you shouldn't just have your money stopped at 16 when you are not old enough for the process.\"",
      "James Taylor, Scope's executive director of strategy, said the number of young people losing out on financial support was \"worrying\".",
      "He called on the government to work with disabled people and \"fix our broken welfare system\".",

      "They include:",

      "A teenager with learning difficulties who said he could cook for himself but did not mention he had broken several microwaves in trying to do so",

      "What is PIP and how are claims decided?",
      "\u2022 Personal Independence Payment is a benefit for over-16s with long-term physical or mental health conditions",
      "\u2022 It is not means-tested and aims to fund the extra living costs associated with having a disability",
      "\u2022 Assessments focus on how capable someone is of living independently and use a series of questions about daily activities",
      "\u2022 Points are awarded based on the individual's abilities and what help they need",
      "\u2022 Those points are added up to determine whether the threshold for a claim is met",
      "\u2022 A third party - like a parent or carer - can apply to represent someone without the capacity to do so themselves",
      "A recent Resolution Foundation report found the number of young people in receipt of disability benefits falls significantly between the ages of 15 and 17.",
      "The think-tank said the failure to qualify - or apply for - PIP was leaving many  \"facing a financial cliff-edge\" as they approached adulthood.",
      "Fightback4Justice, which advocates for disabled people in the welfare system, has called for the process to be more transitional.",
      "Its founder, Michelle Cardno, said: \"Young people are being treated as adults from the day they reach 16, when most do not understand the system.\"",
      "Sally Donley acted for her son Euan Hawes when he was invited to transition from DLA to PIP.",
      "She says she spent two hours talking with an assessor about the impact of Euan's disabilities, which include autism, obsessive compulsive disorder and sensory processing disorder.",
      "\"His assessment was with a nurse who had no background in his issues and he ended up only scoring points for not mixing with others,\" said Ms Donley, from Hampshire.",
      "\"Because I said he could cook eggs in the microwave, they said he could cook for himself and they said he goes to college independently - but it's a specialist college he travels an hour in a taxi to.\"",
      "Euan's claim was refused, but the decision was eventually overturned and he was granted PIP's highest rates when Ms Donley took the DWP to a tribunal.",
      "\"The stress this puts on families is horrendous and cruel,\" she said. \"You have parents trying to care for children with disabilities and they're having to take hours to gather evidence for court appeals.",

      "The European premiere was held on Wednesday at a castle in Northern Spain, instead of a more traditional and high-profile location such as London's Leicester Square.",
      "Dwarfism debate",
      "The debate around the film began making headlines in January 2022, when Game of Thrones star Peter Dinklage, an actor with Dwarfism, described the decision to retell the story of \"seven dwarfs living in a cave\" as \"backward\".",
      "Disney has used computer-generated dwarfs in the remake and said it would \"avoid reinforcing stereotypes from the original animated film\".",
      "But this week, other actors with Dwarfism have said they would have liked the opportunity to play the roles.",

      "Zegler also made headlines after she made critical comments about some elements of the previous animated film.",

      "Zegler also called the original film \"extremely dated when it comes to the ideas of women being in roles of power,\" adding: \"People are making these jokes about ours being the PC Snow White, where it's like, yeah, it is - because it needed that.\"",
      "Elsewhere, fans have speculated that there may have been a behind-the-scenes rift between Zegler and Gadot, who plays the wicked stepmother, because the actresses have opposing views on the Israel-Palestine conflict.",
      "Zegler has publicly taken a pro-Palestine stance, whilst Gadot is Israeli and served in the country's army for two years.",

      "Stranger Things actress Sadie Sink is set to appear in Spider Man 4, according to US  reports.",
      "Hollywood publication Deadline said she had been cast in the sequel opposite returning star Tom Holland.",
      "There is no word yet on which character she might play, but fans have speculated she could be introduced as X-Men mutant Jean Grey.",
      "The reports have not yet been confirmed by Marvel Studios or Sony Pictures, who are due to release the film in July 2026.",
      "In Hollywood, it's normal for casting news to be reported in trade publications before the studio confirms it.",
      "This can be for a variety of reasons - it may be that an actor is in final talks but has not yet signed on the dotted line, or casting news is sometimes leaked by the studio to see how fans will respond, or by an actor's agent to generate excitement.",
      "However, in a few cases, the actor and studio decide not to proceed - so until we hear official news, it's still possible Sink may not be cast.",
      "Spoiler warning: This section features plot details of the most recent Spider-Man film.",
      "The most recent Spider-Man film, 2021's No Way Home, was a huge box office success, grossing $1.9bn worldwide.",

      "As a result, Holland's Spider-Man decided to complete Doctor Strange's spell that erases his identity from the world, meaning his girlfriend MJ (Zendaya) and friend Ned (Jacob Batalon) would forget he had ever existed.",
      "Given the way the plot is likely to develop, Deadline said there would porbably be several new actors such as Sink added to the ensemble cast as a new collection of characters are brought in.",
      "Holland is currently filming The Odyssey, the latest film from Oppenheimer director Christopher Nolan, but is expected to move on to Spider-Man when shooting concludes.",
      "Sink's reported casting comes after she finished shooting the final season of Stranger Things, the horror series that has been one of Netflix's biggest hits since its launch in 2016.",
      "The show helped launch or boost the careers of several young stars, including Sink, Millie Bobby Brown, Noah Schnapp and Finn Wolfhard.",

      "In Meet the Shoplifters, Dooley asks shoplifters about their motivations. Some see it as an act of defiance against big corporations, while others say they find it \"really degrading\" but do it to get things like nappies and milk for their children.",
      "One shoplifter Dooley spoke to, for example, was a mother stealing milk and bread to feed her child. \"She was riddled with guilt,\" Dooley says of the mother. \"It was out of sheer desperation.\"",

      "\"It's not a victimless crime. Somebody always pays the price for it down the line. And for us, it's the staff in here,\" she adds.",

      "Helen Dickinson, the chief executive of the BRC, adds that while an incident can be \"over in a matter of seconds\", it can have \"life-long consequences\" on those who experience it, making them think twice about visiting their local high streets.",

      "Facebook's parent company, Meta, says the ruling - which orders her to stop promotions \"to the extent within her control\" - affirms that \"the false and defamatory book should never have been published\".",

      "Her allegations include that executives had worked \"hand in glove\" with the Chinese government on potential ways of allowing Beijing to censor and control content in exchange for access to the lucrative market.",

      "In his ruling, Mr Gowan said Meta would suffer \"immediate and irreparable loss\" in the absence of a temporary ruling in the case.",
      "He did not order the book's publisher, Flatiron Books, or its parent company, Macmillan, to take any action.",

      "Following the decision, Meta spokesperson Andy Stone said in a post on X: \"This ruling affirms that Sarah Wynn-Williams' false and defamatory book should never have been published.\"",
      "Careless People was released in the US, where it is number six on the Amazon chart, on Tuesday. It was published in the UK on Thursday.",
      "In a statement, a spokeswoman for Macmillan said: \"As publishers, we are committed to upholding freedom of speech and her right to tell her story. Due to legal process instituted by Meta, the author has been prevented from continuing to participate in the book's publicity.\""

      "Mr Marshall told BBC News NI that the models, which are made from cardboard, have a cross generational appeal.",
      "\"Children appreciate the miniature dolls house type model making, adults appreciate the skill that goes into making them, and older people who may remember when some of these places still stood.\"",
      "Lockdown project",
      "\"It all started as a lockdown project,\" Mr Marshall told BBC News NI.",
      "\"I started working on a model of the Grand Opera House as part of the heritage exhibition and through doing that got interested in looking at all the other theatres that aren't about anymore.\"",
      "The models are \"mostly made of different types of cardboard, like mounting card or coloured paper and then they're glued together\".",
      "\"The Hippodrome was the most complicated and detailed one I've made, it took me around six weeks to make.\"",
      "He said he mostly works from old photographs, but it can be hard to get enough accurate detail because \"with a black and white photograph that you can't move around, it's basically static\".",
      "When photographs of the old theatres are not available or poor quality, Mr Marshall refers to old newspaper articles which sometimes have written descriptions of what materials the theatre was built from and how it appeared.",
      "The Alhambra - 'quite a rowdy place'",
      "Opening in the early 1870s, the Alhambra was Belfast's first music hall and was a \"real spit on the floor type joint\", according to Mr Marshall.",
      "\"In the early days, the Alhambra was more of a variety house, and I've heard that it wasn't the most enticing establishment, quite a rowdy place.",
      "\"The Alhambra didn't cater for the more refined clientele,\" he added.",

      "\"I've seen other things listed, which were more overtly racist, but that was kind of the way at the time,\" he added.",
      "To adapt to the evolution of mass entertainment, the Alhambra converted to a full time cinema house in 1936.",
      "Between the late 1800s and it's closure in 1959, the Alhambra suffered four separate fires.",
      "The Theatre Royal - 'higher class establishment'",
      "The Theatre Royal was Belfast's original high-end theatre, opening in the late 1700s with a capacity of just over 1,000.",
      "The building was demolished and rebuilt a number of times.",
      "\"As these places go, they kept getting burnt down or demolished and rebuilt again - there's always a renewal aspect to them.\"",
      "The Theatre Royal was to be Belfast's \"higher class establishment\", which in the end became \"a mixed-use building of shops and place called the 'boom boom room', which was like a dance hall upstairs, which then became the starlight ballroom upstairs\".",
      "\"Now,  there's a little Starbucks in the corner where the building stood,\" he added.",
      "The Empire - 'stayed true to theatre'",
      "Not to be mistaken with the pub and music hall on Botanic Avenue, The Empire Theatre was situated on Victoria Square and opened to the public in 1894.",
      "According to Mr Marshall, the Empire \"operated at a similar time to the Alhambra from the 1890s up until the early 1960s, and then it was it was knocked down.",
      "\"It was eventually replaced by a Little Woods department store, which has been redeveloped again and again, until finally becoming Victoria Square shopping centre.\"",
      "While it did adapt to the growing popularity of cinema, The Empire \"stayed true to theatre for all of its life\", Mr Marshall said.",
      "The Hippodrome - 'Cinema in mind'",
      "The Hippodrome was \"more fiddly [model to make] than some of the other ones\".",
      "Mr Marshall describes how there aren't too many quality photographs of the Hippodrome, so he \"had to use his judgement\" when designing the model in terms of colour scheme and scale.",
      "Coming quite late, the \"Hippodrome was was built in 1907 originally with a cinema in mind\" as to take full advantage of the advent of modern cinema and growing popularity of picture shows.",
      "The Ritz - 'The Stones, The Beatles...'",
      "\"And then there was the Ritz...\" which opened in 1938.",
      "The Ritz was, according to Mr Marshall, \"a giant cinema more or less, but it called itself the Ritz Theatre\". However, it did produce shows as part of the night's entertainment.",
      "\"They would have a brass band, dancers or a ballet, and then a film at the end.\"",
      "\"It also did huge concerts, people like the Stones, The Beatles and Billy Connolly all performed at the Ritz during their time,\" he added.",
      "It was the biggest in Northern Ireland at the time, with just over 2,000 capacity.",
      "The Ritz was damaged by bombs hidden in the seats and the theatres interior and roof was destroyed in 1977.",

      "If he did, experts told the BBC, he likely went through various stages of confusion and grief, trying to wake her up before the disease caused him to become distracted or too overwhelmed to act - a process that likely repeated for days before he, too, died.",
      "Officials in New Mexico say Betsy Arakawa, 65, died of a rare virus about seven days before Hackman perished on 18 February of natural causes.",
      "The pair - and one of their dogs - were found dead in their Santa Fe home after neighbourhood security conducted a welfare check and saw their bodies on the ground through a window.",
      "Authorities, at first, said the grim discovery was \"suspicious enough\" to launch an investigation.",

      "\"I imagine he would be trying to wake her up and not being successful. But then [he] could have been distracted in another room because of one of the dogs or something,\" she described.",
      "Then later, he'd again notice his wife on the ground and would \"live through it again\", she said.",
      "Though no one knows how Hackman spent his last days alive, the grim nature of the possibilities were discussed by authorities and the area's medical examiner.",
      "At a press conference last week, Dr Heather Jarrell, New Mexico's chief medical examiner, said Arakawa died of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), a respiratory illness caused by exposure to infected rodents. Hackman's death was the result of significant heart disease, with Alzheimer's disease as a contributing factor.",
      "Given Hackman's advanced stages of Alzheimer's disease, it is \"quite possible that he was not aware that she [his wife] was deceased\", Dr Jarrell said.",
      "His autopsy indicated he had not eaten recently, though he showed no signs of dehydration. Officials found no evidence that he had communicated with anyone after his wife's death and could not determine whether he was able to care for himself.",
      "Ms Piersol said patients with advanced Alzheimer's aren't able to pick up on environmental cues like light and darkness, making it harder to determine when he should eat, sleep or bathe.",
      "\"Those [cues] are oftentimes just, no longer available to people at this stage of dementia,\" she said.",
      "Dr Brendan Kelley, a neurologist who specialises in memory and cognition at UT Southwestern Medical Center, explained why Hackman may also not have been able to call authorities for help. He said Alzheimer's disease can leave patients caught between emotional discomfort and the inability to act on it.",
      "\"A person might feel worried or frightened, but at the same time they might not be capable to take the actions that you or I might normally think to do in order to alleviate that worry or concern, such as calling somebody else, or going to speak to a neighbour.\"",
      "Dr Kelley says Alzheimer's patients experience emotions like pain and sadness, and experience physical needs like hunger and thirst, it's just harder for them to identify what they are feeling.",
      "He said missing meals could also increase levels of confusion and agitation.",
      "The couple's deaths and the startling details of Hackman living in the home for a week after his wife's passing has shocked the Santa Fe area, where the couple had lived for more than 20 years.",
      "\"It's just absolutely devastating,\" says Jeffery Gomez, a long-time resident of the city, who remembers seeing Hackman around town in his different cars, always with a smile on his face.",
      "His partner, Linda, said the details were triggering, explaining she cared for her elderly mother with dementia. \"Even when you have help, it's a lot,\" she said.",

      "\"She's a phony, but I guess the public likes that\u2026\" This is the line that actress Joan Crawford is said to have declared about film star Bette Davis.",
      "The back-and-forth sniping between the pair played out in public in the 1930s and 40s. \"Bette is a survivor... She survived herself,\" Crawford also apparently remarked.",
      "Their tempestuous relationship was so notorious that in 2017 it was made into an Emmy award-winning TV series, Feud.",
      "Hollywood rivalries are of course nothing new \u2013 yet conflicts today rarely play out so publicly. That might be why the dispute between actors Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni, which spilled out into the open in December 2024, is still in the headlines three months on.",
      "The subsequent legal battle brought to light a fallout during production of the film It Ends With Us. After the promotional and cinematic run had ended, the pair \u2013 who didn't appear on the red carpet together at the premiere in New York \u2013 filed lawsuits against each other.",
      "Lively has accused Baldoni and others of carrying out a smear campaign against her after she complained about alleged sexual harassment on set. Baldoni, meanwhile, has accused Lively, her husband Ryan Reynolds and their publicist of carrying out a smear campaign against him, and claims that she tried to take over control of the film. Both sides deny all allegations.",
      "What emerged as this all played out is that crisis PR managers had been employed. Legal representatives for Lively obtained numerous text messages between Baldoni's publicist Jennifer Abel and the crisis team he retained, led by Melissa Nathan, whose previous clients include Johnny Depp and Drake. Ms Nathan was alleged to have texted Ms Abel, \"You know we can bury anyone.\"",
      "Lively has now reportedly taken on the CIA's former deputy chief of staff Nick Shapiro to advise on her legal communications strategy.",
      "While the outcomes of the lawsuits remain to be seen, the feud has cast the spotlight on an industry that would ordinarily remain largely invisible: that is, the publicity machine at work behind the scenes in Hollywood.",
      "\"On every set, there are fights, liaisons\u2026 there are all sorts of things that go on,\" explains Richard Rushfield, founder and columnist at Hollywood newsletter The Ankler. \"Hollywood is a world full of very messy people coming together for these giant projects, where they put together teams quickly to make these things and disband immediately after.",
      "\"Between all that a lot of stuff goes on, and they deal with it quietly \u2013 they're very obsessive about controlling the narrative. When this stuff explodes into the public, beyond control, it makes everyone very nervous.\"",
      "But the world of the Hollywood PR has shifted in recent years, partly because of the growth of social media, which has changed the relationship between celebrities and fans, bringing them into direct contact and removing some of the mystique.",
      "So, what does that mean for the people whose job it is to keep a lid on the industry's messy reality?",
      "From Tom Hardy to Sarah Jessica Parker",
      "Few fallouts have spilled out into the open in recent years \u2013 and those that did were picked over simply because they're so rare. Actor Dwayne Johnson revealed \"a fundamental difference in philosophies on how we approach moviemaking and collaborating\" with his Fast & Furious co-star Vin Diesel, in a 2018 interview.",
      "The stars of another action film, Mad Max: Fury Road, Charlize Theron and Tom Hardy, are reported to have filmed many of their scenes separately.",
      "And then there were the alleged tensions between Kim Cattrall and Sarah Jessica Parker, who were co-stars of Sex and the City, which ran for six years. In 2018, after Parker offered condolences for Cattrall's brother's death, Cattrall responded on social media, calling Parker a \"hypocrite\" and stating, \"You are not my family. You are not my friend.\"",
      "But behind the scenes, hundreds of other spats will never see the light of day. \"Some of a publicist's best work may never be seen,\" says Daniel Bee, a publicist and brand consultant based in Los Angeles, \"because it stopped something that was wrong, or re-crafted something to a different narrative, or pointed the light in a different direction.",
      "\"The most interesting stuff I've ever done as a publicist is the stuff nobody will ever know about.\"",
      "'Powerful forces at play'",
      "Since Daniel Bee started out as an entertainment publicist in 1997, he has observed a shift in the wider industry. \"I started my career in the British media, there were 11 national newspapers competing with each other. It was a bear pit, hard work, and it was getting to know individuals via relationships.",
      "\"Now, you're up against an anonymous algorithm and accounts where you don't know who you're up against. It's harder to control than ever before.\"",
      "Certainly, social media has posed challenges for those attempting to control narratives around major films and their stars \u2013 while also heralding new forms of \"dark arts\" through which publicists can attempt to shape opinion.",
      "Dating apps could be in trouble \u2013 here's what might take their place",
      "Nasa needs saving from itself \u2013 but is this billionaire right for that job?",
      "Sneaky Britain? How our moral compasses are changing",
      "\"There has always been an army of advisors and consultants doing PR voodoo,\" says Eriq Gardner, entertainment law expert and founding partner of Puck News. \"While I'd love to say the public is media-literate and savvy enough to read between the lines to see the spin, the truth is there are a lot of powerful forces at play and sometimes a large amount of misinformation.\"",
      "So-called PR voodoo is different now that a celebrity \u2013 or their fans \u2013 can access an audience of millions with a click.",
      "While the publicists of previous eras might only have had to worry about print and broadcast platforms, smartphones and social media mean today's digital landscape is a wild west where anyone can shape their own narrative. A badly judged post or comment can damage an actor's career.",
      "But the flipside is a whole new medium in which PRs can practise their \"voodoo\".",
      "Astroturfing and ways to 'cause mischief'",
      "One of the tactics is \"astroturfing\" \u2013 or disguising an orchestrated campaign as a spontaneous up-swelling of public opinion.",
      "This works by manipulating public opinion and creating a false impression of grassroots support (hence the name) or opposition, often coordinated through social media accounts in a way that seems organic.",
      "The practice isn't new, but has been given new life with the advent of social media algorithms.",
      "\"It's deliberately planting disinformation, or twisted versions of the truth, in certain sections of social media,\" says Carla Speight, founder of the PR Mastery app. \"The aim is the halfway point of influential where they will get a bit of traction, but so that it's not too obvious \u2013 you wouldn't hire a Kardashian to do it.",
      "\"It's built up in layers,\" she continues. \"It's like playing a very sinister game of chess. You're putting all the pieces in the right places, just the right amount of mixed-up information, and then you just watch it explode.\"",
      "Although the posts might appear to be genuine public opinion, in fact it's a faked crowd \u2013 whether that's made up of bots or real people, who can be paid to coordinate their posts.",
      "\"All it takes is one or two people to create a meme and put it with the right people,\" says Ms Speight. \"It needs to appear as a trend, and then it's gone. Something is dripped here, something else over there, and when it's done well\u2026 it causes a bit of mischief.\"",
      "Reinventing an age-old tactic?",
      "But all of this is simply a new platform for an age-old trend that has been going on long before the advent of social media, according to Mr Bee. \"Undetected smear campaigns have always been a thing,\" he points out.",
      "\"Previously it would have been a publicist whispering to a diarist of a national newspaper. The issue with digital media is it's anonymous and untraceable.\"",
      "What has changed, he continues, is that audiences have become savvier. \"Whereas before, a quite subservient audience would just take what was given to them in the media, with natural scepticism, curiosity, and a greater level of information, I think people use more critical thinking.\"",
      "Eriq Gardner is less convinced: \"I'm not sure the public approaches what they read with enough scepticism.\"",
      "And yet those in the industry are often alert to it. According to Ms Speight, \"Usually, there's a distinct sort of tell, and it may be the PR thing where we have 'spidey senses' and we can sort of see it, but you're asking, 'Where has that come from? Who started that?' And when there's never a specific place to point it to, that's usually a tell-tale sign.\"",
      "The Hollywood ecosystem",
      "What's clear, though, is that, with studios providing some publications with significant advertising revenue, as well as supplying talent for special events and front covers, revelations often emerge elsewhere in the media.",
      "\"When [scandals] come out, it's usually from places outside of Hollywood,\" argues Mr Rushfield. \"The Harvey Weinstein story was broken by The New York Times and the New Yorker.\"",
      "It was The New York Times that first reported Lively's legal complaint in December. \"It's one of the few places that can afford to do that, and then everyone else jumped in so nobody was sticking their neck out.\" Baldoni filed a $250 million lawsuit against the New York Times in December, although a federal judge indicated this week that it might be dismissed.",
      "Even when bigger outlets break news about Hollywood disputes, the growing dominance of social media means that stories might not have the same cut-through they had previously.",
      "Doreen St Felix, a writer who was previously an editor on Lena Dunham's newsletter, recently wrote in The New Yorker that stories of harassment and abuse, for example, now receive a \"curdled, cynical, and exhausted reception\" \u2013 this, less than a decade after the emergence of the MeToo movement.",
      "She went on to claim that: \"The late 2010s genre of #MeToo reportage cannot thrive on today's volatile internet. Information is misinformation and vice versa. Victims are offenders and offenders are victims.\"",
      "Sometimes, however, the best way for publicists to prevent stories being amplified is by bypassing social media entirely when reacting to a scandal.",
      "\"If you give it to the press first, they don't quote as many of the comments on social media,\" says Ms Speight. \"You control the narrative completely, because the comments come afterwards.\"",
      "Mr Rushfield points out that very little of the revelations in the entertainment press comes out because someone \"uncovered\" something. \"Almost everything you read is there because somebody placed it there \u2013 somebody is dictating a story.\"",
      "What viewers want",
      "None of this industry would exist if the appetite weren't there and if the viewing public didn't want to unpick details about their lives \u2013 and rifts. And yet attitudes towards celebrity have undoubtedly changed since the advent of social media.",
      "\"It's now a two-way communication, which it never was before,\" points out Mr Bee. \"It was generally celebrities, or lawyer or government or whatever, just saying something that gets reported, and that message is conveyed. Now, you have to be prepared for a two-way conversation.\"",
      "But he thinks there are different attitudes to the media today than in the era of celebrity gossip magazines. Nodding to the UK, he continues: \"We had the Leveson Inquiry, we're about to get an ITV drama about phone hacking \u2013 it's as if the curtain has been lifted.\"",
      "As for the Lively and Baldoni lawsuits, it's not clear how these will play out \u2013 but the very fact that it has so unusually spilled into the public domain is a reminder of how well-oiled the Hollywood publicity machine is the rest of the time. And that is unlikely to change soon.",

    "story": [
      "Six months ago, a viral TikTok trend made us obsessed with being very demure and very mindful - but now, modesty has taken a back seat among celebrities who have made see-through outfits all the rage on red carpets and catwalks.",
      "At the Brit Awards last week, big winner Charli XCX went full brat as she wore a sheer black dress, prompting hundreds of complaints to media watchdog Ofcom.",
      "She used one of her acceptance speeches to address the controversy of her outfit. \"I heard that ITV were complaining about my nipples,\" she said. \"I feel like we're in the era of 'free the nipple' though, right?\"",
      "The nearly naked look has been a talking point at other award ceremonies - including last Sunday's Oscars and the Grammys in February, when Kanye West's wife Bianca Censori dropped her coat on the red carpet to reveal an almost entirely invisible dress.",
      "The love for transparent textiles has continued at London and Paris fashion weeks, with many of the celebrities watching on also getting the memo.",
      "At Stella McCartney's Paris show, US actress and Michael Jackson's daughter Paris Jackson wore a translucent black off-the-shoulder maxi dress with only a nude-coloured thong underneath.",
      "Rapper Ice Spice sported a black lace catsuit with a feathered coat at the show.",
      "Naked dressing was a key trend in some designers' spring/summer collections, and the theme has continued in autumn/winter looks too.",
      "As Vogue wrote in January: \"For a period of time, sheerness was few and far between, but nowadays, 'naked dressing' is commonplace every season.\"",
      "Dior's latest collection embraced see-through material and presented it in an ethereal way, with intricate detailing and gender-fluid silhouettes.",
      "Creative director Maria Grazia Chiuri described her collection as \"demonstrating how clothing is a receptacle that affirms cultural, aesthetic and social codes\".",
      "The trend divides opinion but is certainly part of a wider movement - last summer Charli XCX's definition of being a brat included wearing \"a strappy white top with no bra\".",
      "Sheer dressing is a nod to the minimalist looks of the 1990s - think transparent blouses and Kate Moss wearing a thin slip dress - and with our love for nostalgia fashion, it's no wonder it is taking off again.",
      "The trend also had a resurgence a decade ago. The \"free the nipple\" movement was everywhere in the early 2010s, with Rihanna stirring up headlines with her sheer crystal-embellished dress at the CFDA awards in 2014.",
      "Charli XCX's Brits outfit was praised by some on social media. \"Stop policing women's bodies,\" one person wrote, while another said she looked comfortable in her outfit so \"why is society judging?\"",
      "But many found it too risque for prime-time TV. Ofcom received 825 complaints  about the Brits ceremony, the majority relating to Charli's outfit and Sabrina Carpenter's eye-opening pre-watershed performance.",
      "\"Maybe think about putting this on at a time when kids ain't gonna be watching,\" one person wrote on social media.",
      "'Challenging fashion norms'",
      "Fashion stylist and CEO of clothing brand Mermaid Way, Julia Pukhalskaia, calls the choice to wear revealing dresses a \"provocative statement\", but says it's a \"way to reclaim the right to govern one's body\".",
      "The controversy around it feeds into a wider dialogue about women's rights and double standards when it comes to dress codes, she adds.",
      "Abhi Madan, creative director of fashion brand Amarra, believes the trend \"is about embracing freedom and boldness in fashion\".",
      "The idea of freeing the nipple \"isn't just about exposure - it's a movement towards body positivity and challenging conventional fashion norms\", he argues.",
      "\"Designers are now integrating sheer elements not just for shock value but to create a refined and elegant silhouette that empowers wearers.\"",
      "It seems many Hollywood stars this year were feeling empowered as chiffon, lace and tulle were in plentiful supply at the Oscars.",
      "Shock value is surely a factor for some, too, though.",
      "At Vanity Fair's Oscars afterparty, Julia Fox wore a mesh dress with only long wavy hair to cover some of her modesty.",
      "There were other interpretations of the naked dress - Megan Thee Stallion wore a green dress with strategically placed foliage and nipple coverings, while Zoe Kravitz opted to cover up the front but expose the back as a beaded mesh panel revealed her buttocks in her Saint Laurent dress.",
      "\"This year, naked dressing seemed to particularly thrive at the event,\" the New York Times noted.",
      "However, not everyone is on board. The Times fashion director Anna Murphy wrote that she's over the trend because \"it's only women who do this\".",
      "\"It is not an equal opportunities endeavour. It is, rather, a manifestation of the kind of thing that keeps this world unequal. That women's bodies are for public consumption and men's, usually, aren't,\" she wrote.",
      "Some men have been embracing the nearly naked trend, though. In 2022, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet wore striking a backless red top at Venice Film Festival, and at the 2023 Grammys Harry Styles freed the nipple in a plunge harlequin jumpsuit.",
      "It's the women who will continue to cause more of a stir on runways and red carpets - and society will still be split on whether it's redefining conventional notions of modesty in fashion, a product of misogyny, or simply seeking attention.",

    "story": [
      "No-one wants to be alone, and no job is more isolating than being a pop star.",
      "Just ask Lady Gaga.",
      "Her rise to fame in 2009-10 was unlike anything we'd seen before. One of the first pop stars to harness the power of the internet, she seemed to exist in a permanent onslaught of TMZ photos and gossip blogs.",
      "Their appetite was voracious. She wore through so many looks and sounds in the space of three years that one critic wrote she was \"speed-running Madonna's entire career\".",
      "And as her fame grew, the headlines became more unhinged. She staged a satanic ritual in a London hotel... She was secretly a hermaphrodite... She planned to saw her own leg off \"for fashion\".",
      "When she attended the 2010 MTV Awards in a dress made entirely of meat, nobody seemed to get the joke: Gaga was presenting herself as fodder for the tabloids, there to be consumed.",
      "On stage, she was an object of worship for her fans, the Little Monsters. But anyone who isn't a megalomaniac knows that that sort of adulation is a distant illusion.",
      "\"I'm alone, Brandon. Every night,\" Gaga told her stylist in the 2017 documentary, Five Foot Two.",
      "\"I go from everyone touching me all day and talking at me all day to total silence.\"",
      "Now 38, and happily engaged to tech entrepreneur Michael Polansky, Gaga admits that those years of solitude scared her.",
      "\"I think my biggest fear was doing this by myself - doing life on my own,\" she tells the BBC.",
      "\"And I think that the greatest gift has been meeting my partner, Michael, and being in the mayhem with him.\"",
      "The couple have been together since 2020, and revealed their engagement at the Venice Film Festival last September - where Gaga wore her million-dollar engagement ring in public for the first time.",
      "In person, it's dazzling, with a huge, oval-cut diamond set on a 18-karat white and rose gold diamond pav\u00e9 band.",
      "But on her other hand, Gaga sports a smaller, more understated ring, featuring a few blades of grass set in resin. It turns out that this is the really special one.",
      "\"Michael actually proposed to me with these blades of grass,\" she reveals.",
      "\"A long time ago, we were in the back yard, and he asked me, 'If I ever proposed to you, like, how do I do that?'",
      "\"And I just said, 'Just get a blade of grass from the back yard and wrap it around my finger and that will make me so happy'.\"",
      "It was a deeply romantic gesture that came tinged with sadness. Gaga's back yard in Malibu had previously played host to the wedding of her close friend, Sonja Durham, shortly before she died of cancer in 2017.",
      "\"There was so much loss, but this happy thing was happening for me,\" she recalls of Polansky's proposal.",
      "\"To get engaged at 38... I was thinking about what it took to get to this moment.\"",
      "Those feelings ultimately informed a song on her new album, Mayhem.",
      "Called (naturally) Blade of Grass, it finds the star singing about a \"lovers' kiss in a garden made of thorns\", and the promise of love in a time of darkness.",
      "She calls it a \"thank you\" to her partner. And fans might have a reason to thank him, too.",
      "Mayhem marks Gaga's full throttle return to pop, after a period where she'd been preoccupied with her film career, and spin-off albums that dabbled in jazz and the classic American songbook.",
      "Speaking to Vogue last year, the singer revealed it was her fianc\u00e9 who'd nudged her in that direction.",
      "\"He was like, 'Babe. I love you. You need to make pop music',\" she said.",
      "\"On the Chromatica tour, I saw a fire in her,\" Polansky added. \"I wanted to help her keep that alive all the time and just start making music that made her happy.\"",
      "'Angriest song'",
      "With that approach, the album goes right back to the sucker-punch sound of Gaga's early hits like Poker Face, Just Dance and Born This Way.",
      "On the latest single, Abracadabra, she even revisits the \"roma-ma-ma\" gibberish of Bad Romance \u2013 although this time there's a reference to death, as she sings, \"morta-ooh-Gaga\".",
      "In the album's artwork, her face is reflected in a broken mirror. In the videos, she squares off against earlier versions of herself.",
      "There's an overwhelming sense that the artist Stefani Germanotta is reckoning with the stage persona she created.",
      "It all comes to a head on a track called Perfect Celebrity where she sings, \"I became a notorious being\" \u2013 a lyric that, like the meat dress before it, strips away her humanity.",
      "\"That's probably the most angry song about fame I've ever written,\" she says.",
      "\"I'd created this public persona that I was truly becoming in every way - and holding the duality of that, knowing where I begin and Lady Gaga ends, was really a challenge.",
      "\"It kind of took me down.\"",
      "How did she reconcile the public and private sides of her life?",
      "\"I think what I actually realised is that it's healthier to not have a dividing line and to integrate those two things into one whole human being,\" she says.",
      "\"The healthiest thing for me was owning that I'm a female artist and that living an artistic life was my choice.",
      "\"I am a lover of songwriting. I'm a lover of making music, of rehearsing, choreography, stage production, costumes, lighting, putting on a show.",

      "Mayhem marks the moment where she reclaims ownership of her music, not just from \"Lady Gaga\" but from other producers and writers in her orbit.",
      "\"When I was younger, people tried take credit for my sound, or my image [but] all of my references, all of my imagination of what pop music could be, came from me.",

      "From the outset, it was obvious that Gaga was excited about this new phase.",
      "Last summer, after performing at the Olympics opening ceremony, she took to the streets of Paris and played early demos of her new music to fans who'd gathered outside her hotel.",
      "It was a spur of the moment decision, yet it marked another effort to restore the spontaneity of her early career.",
      "\"This has been something I've done for almost 20 years, where I played my fans my music way before it came out,\" she says.",
      "\"I used to, after my shows, invite fans backstage, and we'd hang out and I'd play them demos and see what they thought of the music.",
      "\"I'm sure you can imagine that after 20 years, you don't expect that people are still going to show up to hear your music and be excited to see you. So, I just wanted to share it with them, because I was excited that they were there.\"",
      "As an interviewer, this is a full-circle moment for me, too. I last interviewed Lady Gaga in 2009, as Just Dance hit number one in the UK.",
      "Back then, she was giddy with excitement, chatting enthusiastically about her love of John Lennon, calling herself a \"heroin addict\" for English tea, and promising to email me an MP3 of Blueberry Kisses \u2013 an unreleased song that is, quite brilliantly, about performing a sex act while your breath smells of blueberry flavoured coffee.",
      "Over the years, I've seen her interviews become more guarded. She'd wear outrageous costumes or jet-black sunglasses, deliberately putting a barrier between her and the journalist.",

      "The organisation, which oversees the country's health service, will be brought into the Department of Health, and the PM said the move would free up money for frontline services.",
      "The government said it expected around 50% of the jobs at NHS England, which as of December had 14,400 staff, and the Department of Health, which has 3,500 staff, to go.",
      "In a speech in Hull, Sir Keir said for too long politicians had \"chosen to hide behind vast arrays of quangos\" - organisations funded by taxpayers but not directly controlled by the government.",
      "The government said work would begin immediately to return many of NHS England's current functions to the Department of Health and Social Care, with the aim of completing the process in two years.",
      "The significant move gives the government more control and accountability over one of their key pledges - to cut NHS waiting times.",
      "NHS England - which the government dubbed \"the world's largest quango\" - oversees the health service, working with government to agree funding and priorities, as well as monitoring the performance of local NHS services.",
      "It was given autonomy by the then-Conservative Health Secretary Andrew Lansley in 2012, with the aim of freeing the organisation from interference by politicians.",
      "Health Secretary Wes Streeting said the changes would \"liberate\" frontline workers from excessive and \"competing directions\".",
      "Speaking to BBC Radio 4's PM programme, he said the result would be \"better value for taxpayers and better outcomes for patients because the hundreds of millions of pounds we can save will be redeployed to the front line delivering better care\".",
      "Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch welcomed the move to bring the management of the health service back under ministerial control, but warned Labour \"cannot hide if things go wrong\".",
      "She did not have \"high hopes\" because Labour already ran the NHS in Wales and that was \"doing a lot worse than the rest of the country\", she said.",
      "Liberal Democrat  leader Sir Ed Davey backed the plans, but argued they were not the main issue for the NHS.",
      "To fix it, the government needed to focus on \"getting more GPs, more NHS dentists, more community pharmacists, making sure that social care actually works\", he said.",
      "The Health Foundation think tank warned the reorganisation would distract senior leaders.",
      "And Sharon Graham, head of the Unite union, said: \"Taking an axe to these jobs is an ill-thought-out strategy that could end up meaning frontline healthcare staff struggle to do their jobs effectively if they aren't paid on time, don't have basic medical supplies or are forced to do additional administrative work rather than treat patients.\"",
      "The news comes after senior NHS England figures including chief executive Amanda Pritchard and medical director Sir Stephen Powis announced they were stepping down.",
      "Live updates: Starmer to scrap NHS England and bring health service back under 'democratic control'",
      "NHS England: Why world's biggest quango is being axed",
      "Could Starmer's regulation shake-up mean a 'bonfire of the quangos'?",
      "The announcement came as part of a wider speech on reforming the state, which Sir Keir described as \"overstretched\" and \"unfocused\".",
      "\"Over a number of years politicians have chosen to hide behind vast arrays of quangos, arm's length bodies, regulators, reviews,\" the prime minister said.",
      "\"A sort of cottage industry of checkers and blockers using taxpayer money to stop the government delivering on taxpayer priorities.\"",
      "The number of quangos has fallen by more than half since 2010 but there are still more than 300 across the UK.",
      "They include regulators, cultural institutions and advisory bodies, ranging from large organisations like NHS England, to smaller ones like the Gambling Commission and the British Film Institute.",
      "The water regulator Ofwat could be among other government quangos in line to be scrapped.",
      "Ofwat's role - along with the Environment Agency, the Drinking Water Inspectorate and Natural Resources Wales - is among the organisations already being looked at in a review of the whole water system in England and Wales, by an Independent Water Commission established last year.",
      "Government sources would not pre-empt the outcome of the review but all options for regulating water are understood to be on the table, except nationalising water companies.",
      "The new Labour government has set up more than 20 new quangos since winning power.",
      "These include Great British Energy, which will invest in renewable energy to help meet the government's clean power goals, and Skills England, which aims to support people to find jobs.",
      "The government has also suggested it wants to cut the size of the Civil Service, which has a headcount of more than 500,000.",
      "Civil servants are politically impartial officials employed by the government, covering areas including policy development and services like benefits and prisons.",
      "In his speech, Sir Keir linked the need to reshape government to global instability which has pushed up bills at home, saying the state needs to be operating at \"maximum strength\".",
      "He promised to cut the costs of regulation for businesses by 25% to boost economic growth.",
      "His plan also includes greater use of artificial intelligence, underpinned by the mantra that civil servants should not be spending time on tasks where digital or AI can do it better and quicker.",
      "Earlier this year, Sir Keir faced a backlash saying \"too many people in Whitehall are comfortable in the tepid bath of managed decline\".",
      "In his speech he was keen to stress his criticism was not aimed at individuals but the system as a whole.",
      "Having spent the last few weeks focused on diplomatic wrangling over Ukraine, the speech saw the prime minister return to domestic challenges - specifically a feeling that services in the country do not work well enough.",
      "It also reflected growing concern in Downing Street that there are too many organisations that ministers can not directly control.",
      "For the public, the key question will be whether these changes result in any perceptible improvement.",
      "Former head of the Civil Service Lord [Gus] O'Donnell told the BBC the government's messaging to civil servants was \"nothing short of disastrous\".",

    "story": [
      "The body responsible for the day-to-day running of the health service in England is being scrapped.",
      "The government plans to abolish NHS England and bring it into the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) in a radical overhaul of the management structure of the NHS.",
      "Why? The government argues it will save money, cut red-tape and give ministers more control. But the move is not without risk.",
      "With more than 14,000 staff, NHS England is around four times the size of the DHSC itself.",
      "But that is only because in recent years NHS England has absorbed Health Education England, which oversees staff training, and NHS Digital, which is responsible for data collection and technology.",
      "NHS England also plays a role in organising some key frontline services, including GPs and specialist hospital care, while overseeing the day-to-day running of the health service alongside distributing the money made available by ministers.",
      "Much of this will now fall under the control of the health department. But not all. Expect some to be devolved down to regional health boards.",
      "Nonetheless, it is expected to lead to half of the jobs at the two organisations going \u2013 around 9,000 roles.",
      "That is expected to save at least \u00a3500m a year. While the sum sounds a lot, it is around 0.25% of the health budget. The respected King's Fund think-tank has called it a \"drop in the ocean\" that will not go very far on the frontline.",
      "Bureaucratic monster",
      "But this is also about reducing bureaucracy \u2013 something that can't really be measured in numbers.",
      "In his address to the House of Commons, Streeting cited one organisation that was having to fill in 250 forms in one month to satisfy both the health department and NHS England.",
      "Reacting to the announcement on Thursday, former health secretary Jeremy Hunt told the BBC NHS England has become a \"bureaucratic monster\" that stifles innovation.",
      "Could Starmer's regulation shake-up mean a 'bonfire of the quangos'?",
      "And talk to those doing the work in hospitals and other frontline services, one of the most common complaints is that NHS England was incredibly controlling, even requesting individual NHS trusts ask for permission for something as mundane as granting media interviews.",
      "But make no mistake this is also about control. It was a point made clear by Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer when he set out the plan, which could take two years to fully implement.",
      "He said it was only right that a democratically-elected government was in charge of day-to-day running of the health service.",
      "Significant risk",
      "Quangos - \"quasi-autonomous non-governmental organisations\" - are set up by government to oversee regulations and operate independently from politicians.",
      "NHS England was created as part of the 2012 reforms introduced under former Tory health secretary Andrew Lansley.",
      "The idea was to free the health service from political meddling \u2013 with ministers instead setting the wider strategy, but stepping back from getting involved on a daily basis.",
      "In the years afterwards NHS England has exercised that independence. This was  most notable under the leadership of Sir Simon Stevens, who challenged and pressed the Theresa May government into increasing funding.",
      "In the late 2010s, after Lansley had left government, Conservative health ministers privately expressed frustration that the single-biggest part of their brief was outside of their control.",
      "As soon as Streeting took charge at the DHSC last summer, it was clear he felt the same and NHS England was on borrowed time.",
      "On Monday it was announced half of the roles at NHS England would go \u2013 and that came after the current chief executive, Amanda Pritchard, and a number of her top managers announced they would be stepping down.",
      "But given Labour, in opposition, was critical of the Tories messing around with NHS structures, embarking on its own reorganisation comes with significant risk. Hospital bosses are already warning this will cause disruption.",
      "And the public are understandably asking what difference this will make to the care they receive. The government says it will help it improve services and reduce waiting times \u2013 and, given that is one of its top priorities, there will be no hiding place now."

      "The government has announced NHS England will be abolished to \"cut bureaucracy\" and reform how the National Health Service is run.",
      "The changes will not impact anyone's access to the NHS - it will still be free at the point of use and cover all the services it does already.",
      "Around 9,000 administrative roles are being cut at NHS England and the Department of Health and Social Care as part of the changes - amounting to roughly half of all roles at the two organisations.",
      "As part of Your Voice Your BBC, we asked for your questions on the plans and what they could mean for you - below we have answered them for you.",
      "What does NHS England do?",
      "NHS England is the administrative body which manages how health services up and down the country are run. It is made up primarily of managers and officials, not the doctors and nurses providing care in hospitals.",
      "The government provides it with money and tells it what its priorities are for the health service - for example, that might be cutting waiting times or improving cancer survival rates.",
      "NHS England's role is to funnel the money it is given into different parts of the health service and work out how to juggle resources in order to bring about the change the government wants to see.",
      "In 2012, NHS England was given more independence by the Conservative-led government. They said doing so would prevent politicians from interfering too much in how front line services are run - but critics say that change has made it harder to carry out reform or drive improvement.",
      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer believes that overhauling management structures will put NHS in England \"back into democratic control\" and free up money for front-line services.",
      "NHS England is also responsible for other functions like overseeing training and collecting data, as well as managing GP services.",
      "There are separate organisations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, so these changes only impact England.",
      "Did this decision come out of the blue?",
      "Within the NHS and Westminster, the writing has been on the wall for NHS England for some months.",
      "Even in the latter years of the Tory government, health ministers expressed frustration that they were not in charge of the day-to-day running of the health service.",
      "When Labour came into power, it was clear Health Secretary Wes Streeting wanted more control of the NHS and saw a lot of duplication and bureaucracy.",
      "NHS England's chief executive Amanda Pritchard recently said she would step down at the end of the March and a number of her senior leadership team have followed suit.",
      "In that respect, it was clear there was going to be significant reform - but this is as big a change as you could possibly get at the heart of the NHS management structure.",
      "What is a 'quango' - and why do ministers think 'bureaucracy' is a problem?",
      "These are two words we have heard the government use a lot when setting out why it is scrapping NHS England and bringing the health service under closer government control.",
      "In this context, bureaucracy is a stand-in word for a system that is particularly complicated, or requires excessive amounts of administration, paperwork, regulations or layers of management.",
      "Starmer made it clear he thinks this sort of admin is getting in the way of delivering health services.",
      "We also heard him describe NHS England as the \"world's largest quango\" - a term that stands for Quasi-Autonomous Non-Governmental Organisation.",
      "Could Starmer's regulation shake-up mean a 'bonfire of the quangos'?",
      "In short, quangos are bodies like regulators and advisory groups, which are funded by taxpayers but not directly controlled by central government. They do things on behalf of the government, but are not directly controlled by ministers.",
      "They range from big organisations like NHS England, Network Rail and the Environment Agency to smaller ones like the British Film Institute and Gambling Commission.",
      "Their numbers have fallen by more than half since 2010 because David Cameron's coalition government abolished nearly 300 - but there are still more than 300 across the UK.",
      "Labour has set up more than 20 since winning the election last July, including Great British Energy and Skills England.",
      "The total budget for quangos in 2022/23 - when the latest figures were published - was \u00a3353bn.",
      "Will there be more control over decision-making and budgets locally?",
      "We do not yet know all of the detail about how health services in England will be managed in the future but it is likely that some of the responsibilities NHS England currently holds will be devolved down to regional bodies.",
      "One of the arguments being made about NHS reform is that if you move decision-making down to a local level and nearer to patients, it will be health leaders who are more attuned to the needs of patients in the area making those calls.",
      "They will know what local populations need and where the weaknesses are - and that, in theory, could improve services for patients in different parts of the country.",
      "Will this mean an increase in funding to the NHS and better access to medicines?",
      "Thursday's announcement was not about funding - that is expected in the summer.",
      "We already know NHS is getting an uplift of about 3-4% next year and we do not yet know what spending will look like beyond that.",
      "But government sources believe scrapping NHS England will save the government \u00a3500m a year.",
      "On access to medicines, it is the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence - which is separate from NHS England - which sets the guidelines on what treatments are judged affordable and cost effective.",

      "This includes treatments such as hormonal contraceptives and intrauterine delivery systems.",
      "Helen Knight, director of medicines evaluation at NICE, said it marked \"a potential step-change in how we manage endometriosis, putting control back in patients' hands while ensuring value for the taxpayer\".",

      "Usually, the first treatments for endometriosis, after pain relievers, are hormone injections which temporarily shut down the body's production of estrogen. This is the hormone that causes endometriosis tissue to grow and cause pain.",

    "summary": "The at-home light therapy treatment is increasingly being seen as a must-have skincare accessory.",
    "story": [
      "LED technology has been used to address a number of skin issues, such as eczema, mild to moderate acne, psoriasis and sun damage in a medical setting.",
      "But the at-home LED market is on the verge of becoming a massive industry - with masks and other devices retailing for anything from \u00a340 to \u00a31,500.",
      "The technology harnesses the power of light-emitting diodes (LEDs), which then stimulate skin cells when they are exposed to the skin repeatedly.",
      "Mask developers make big claims that at-home LED masks can be used to treat acne scars, sun damage and fine lines - but does this stand up to scrutiny?",
      "The LED market is set to be worth \u00a3600m globally by 2032 - which is nearly double what airflow technology like the Dyson Airwrap will be worth at the same point.",
      "According to consultant dermatologist Dr Jonathan Kentley, LED technology works by causing the skin to absorb light energy, which then triggers cellular changes in a process known as photobiomodulation (PBM).",
      "\"This allows new blood vessels and skin cells to be formed, along with more collagen and elastin,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "\"PBM has also been used to treat acne as it has anti-inflammatory effects and reduces the amount of oil in the skin,\" he adds.",
      "A recent comprehensive study of PBM stated that more clinical trials on humans need to take place to fully understand how it actually works.",
      "US space agency Nasa first began studying the effect of LEDs in the 1990s to see if it could help in cell regeneration.",
      "Since then, medical-grade devices have been used by dermatologists \"for many years\", according to Dr Kentley.",
      "But at-home masks have only been on the retail market for about five years and cost a fraction of the medical devices.",
      "The main differences between medical devices and High Street masks are the strength of the LEDs, the number of bulbs on the device and how close they sit to the skin's surface when being used.",
      "LED therapy masks are 'visually interesting'",
      "Dr Justine Kluk, who runs her own dermatology clinic and specialises in treating acne, believes that while at-home masks \"sound promising\", mask wholesale manufacturers are \"speculating\" about their benefits.",
      "\"I don't believe anyone has run clinical trials of the LED mask at home to see if it is the same dose as a device you would use in a clinic or hospital,\" she tells the BBC.",
      "\"No-one is testing these devices in big enough sample sizes for long enough periods of time for us to feel really confident.",
      "\"So I believe the benefits from using one of these masks is probably very modest,\" she adds.",
      "Skincare makes up nearly half of all global sales in the beauty industry - and is set to continue to grow more than the likes of haircare, make-up and fragrance in the next year.",
      "This is being boosted by Generation Z (those born between 1995 and 2009) and even Generation Alpha (born 2010 to now) whose skincare fascination is said to be fuelled by social media trends.",
      "Dr Kluk says she has noticed \"that people's interest in at-home skin care and treatments has increased hugely since Covid\" and believes the \"visually interesting\" element of the at-home LED mask makes it such an eye-catching product to sell online.",
      "\"People sitting watching TV wearing a red LED mask increases people's curiosity.",
      "\"Every other consultation I've had for the last six months, has involved people asking me about LED masks,\" she adds.",
      "When you search LED masks on social media platforms such as TikTok, you will be met with hundreds of videos with users showing off their results after using one of these at-home devices.",
      "Natalie O'Neill, 29, tells the BBC she started to use a mask \"out of curiosity to see if I would notice any difference\" and did not use it to treat an existing skin condition like acne.",
      "The skincare content creator says:  \"I noticed a change in my skin after a couple of weeks and felt it prevented breakouts really well.\"",
      "She adds that the mask has helped to \"keep my skin tone looking more even\" and faded marks on her face more quickly.",
      "O'Neill was not paid to promote a particular mask and caveats all her content on this technology by saying she uses it alongside a consistent skincare routine.",
      "\"Getting red light or LED therapy in a clinic is not immediately transferable to a mask, which a lot of consumers don't realise - I'm OK with that because I have the right expectations,\" she adds.",
      "Part of the appeal of LED masks is that they are easy to use and therefore have a low barrier to entry for potential buyers.",
      "Laurence Newman is the chief executive of CurrentBody, whose at-home LED mask is one of the world's best sellers.",
      "He started selling professional equipment to clinics more than 25 years ago and began developing an at-home LED mask in 2009, bringing out the company's first device just under 10 years later.",
      "\"We see that people use it for 10 minutes and get an instant glow afterwards,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "Newman says that women in particular \"are moving towards totally non-invasive skincare\" and looking for ways to improve their skin without botox and fillers.",
      "Newman says the masks his company sells have been developed using the same technology as medical devices, which have a minimum requirement light wavelengths.",
      "He emphasises that the at-home LED mask market and indeed at-home beauty technology market are in their infancy, with \"a real movement of education\" growing.",
      "'This is a lot of money to spend'",
      "Dr Kentley concludes that \"PBM is mostly considered safe, even at high levels\" so using any form of LED technology is unlikely to \"cause damage to cells\", however more research into how exactly PBM works is needed to understand what it can do.",
      "\"There have been many experimental and clinical studies into the use of PBM for various dermatologic conditions, however they have varied in the parameters of the device and treatment protocols,\" he adds.",
      "\"Many of these studies were small and unstandardised and often paid for by the manufacturers so it is difficult to draw concrete conclusions\".",
      "He says if someone is keen to buy a device they should make sure they choose one that has EU safety certifications and a high density of LED bulbs on the mask to ensure enough energy is being delivered to the skin.",
      "Dr Kluk also says that she does not \"want to discourage anyone\" who is intrigued by the technology but wants \"them to understand that this is a lot of money to spend on a device, which could potentially support a good skincare routine, or if it's severe like acne, a good prescription regimen and some lifestyle measures - but it's unlikely to do enough on its own.\"",

      "\"The one thing I love about myself is trying to help as many people as I can in any way, shape or form,\" he said.",

It cited a case of a man who had sexually assaulted a child while taking the drug for Parkinson's.",

A \"common\" side effect of any medicine can be considered to only affect as few as 1% of people who take it, according to the NHS.",

      "Michael Gove has told the Covid inquiry it was \"ludicrous\" to suggest he tried to force through a deal for a new ventilator made by the electronics giant Dyson without proper safety checks.",
      "Emails show a senior official at the health watchdog warned that the former cabinet office minister was trying to \"circumvent the regulatory process\" in March 2020.",
      "Messages between staff at the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said Mr Gove did not \"appreciate the level of risk involved\" and was working to a \"totally unrealistic\" timescale.",
      "A provisional order for 10,000 machines was placed at the time, but the deal was scrapped after Dyson failed to win regulatory approval.",
      "No public money was spent on the prototype.",
      "Dyson said it never intended to make a profit from the venture and wrote off around \u00a320m in research and development costs.",
      "Ventilator Challenge",
      "In March 2020, as Covid was spreading across northern Italy, there was a frantic attempt by health authorities to get hold of ventilators to help patients breathe.",
      "The NHS had between 6,000 and 8,000 in stock but modelling suggested it needed 30,000 by the end of June and 90,000 by November to cope with a predicted influx of patients.",
      "On 16 March 2020, the government launched the 'Ventilator Challenge' - a drive to encourage domestic UK suppliers to develop new machines or modify existing designs.",
      "The project was overseen by cabinet office officials and involved the MHRA, which helped draw up initial specifications and squeezed an approval process that would usually take 18-24 months into just weeks.",
      "A number of major companies were involved, including the carmakers Ford and McLaren, and the electronics giant Dyson.",
      "At the time, the company's founder Sir James Dyson held a number of telephone conversations with government officials, including the then Prime Minister Boris Johnson.",
      "The Covid inquiry was shown WhatsApp messages then sent between ministers and government advisers suggesting Sir James was concerned about the pace of project.",
      "On 20 March 2020, Mr Johnson wrote that \"Dyson [was] freaking\" and called for \"Action this day\".",
      "Minutes later ex health secretary Matt Hancock replied, \"I have also received the same. I will talk to Dyson and Michael [Gove] and sort it.\"",
      "Asked about the deal at the inquiry, the government's then chief commercial officer, Sir Gareth Rhys Williams, said it was the only example he could recall in the pandemic where he was asked to put a contract in place \"against commercial guidance\".",
      "Five days later, on 25 March, Boris Johnson wrote another WhatsApp message to the same group saying that: \"Dyson has a ventilator ready to go\u2026 It's safe, effective and loses less oxygen. Rhys Williams has blocked it under the misapprehension that oxygen passes through the motor. That is total b****cks.\"",
      "He accused officials of \"fiddling while Rome burns\" and added: \"Sorry but I'm on a mission. Dyson knows what he's doing and won't risk his global brand reputation delivering dodgy ventilators.\"",
      "'Totally unrealistic'",
      "Sir Gareth said, at that point, the Dyson prototype pushed air from a fan directly into the lungs of patients, something that could cause safety concerns.",
      "The Dyson team did subsequently \"fix\" that part of the design, he added.",
      "Later on 25 March, Sir Gareth wrote to Sir John Manzoni, a top civil servant in the cabinet office, saying that Michael Gove was \"INSISTENT we place an order with Dyson\u2026 contingent on passing clinical and passing MHRA approvals.\"",
      "A provisional \u00a3100,000 order was then placed for the Dyson prototypes, and an email from Michael Gove's private office set out a number of actions that needed be taken quickly including: \"The MHRA and Sir Gareth Rhys Williams to ensure by the end of Friday, [that] the Dyson product has been tested and approved by MHRA\u2026 [and] the final product has started to be manufactured.\"",
      "The following day Graeme Tunbridge, the director of devices for the MHRA, wrote to colleagues warning that Michael Gove was \"keen to press forward with Dyson's proposal to a timescale that is totally unrealistic.\"",
      "He added that Mr Gove \"did not appreciate the level of risk involved in the manufacture and use of ventilators\" and \"wanted to circumvent the expedited regulatory process that has been put in place\".",
      "\"MHRA are doing everything we can to support this but absolutely will not cut any corners when it comes to the issues of critical patient safety,\" he wrote.",
      "Giving evidence to the inquiry, Mr Gove denied he had tried to pressure the MHRA in any way, or that the focus on Dyson meant resources could not be devoted to bids from other companies.",
      "\"Just imagine the situation, if you will, a minister \u2013 Matt Hancock, I, Boris Johnson \u2013 says we want to have a potentially lethal machine in hospitals deliberately so that we can meet an arbitrary deadline. It's inconceivable,\" he said.",
      "The former minister said that the Dyson prototype ultimately \"did not get through testing\" and \"whenever confronted with brute facts about safety or otherwise, I would always accept them.\"",
      "He denied that his private office was instructing the regulator to approve the device saying the language used was simply \"shorthand for 'we would hope that it had been tested and if tested satisfactorily [then] approved by the MHRA to that timescale'\".",
      "In the end the government said the Ventilator Challenge helped scale up the production of three existing models, and approved one new design by the medical devices firm Penlon.",
      "In total, an extra 14,000 devices were delivered over three months, fewer than the government originally planned for as doctors identified other ways of treating the most severe Covid cases.",
      "In a statement, Dyson said Sir James Dyson responded to a personal call from Boris Johnson to \"develop and make a medical-grade ventilator in 30 days during the national emergency\".",
      "\"Far from receiving any commercial benefit, there was significant commercial cost to Dyson which diverted 450 engineers away from commercial projects,\" added a company spokesperson.",
      "\"Uniquely amongst the many businesses involved, [Sir] James Dyson did not seek payment for any of the \u00a320m the company spent on the project \u2013 rather this was its contribution to the national effort to save lives.\""

      "He promised to cut the costs of regulation for businesses by 25% to boost economic growth.",

    "summary": "Sir Keir's argument overlaps with the former PM's - that the proliferation of arm's length bodies slow down change.",
    "story": [
      "It is a comparison neither would likely welcome, but look closely and the arguments of Sir Keir Starmer and Liz Truss about why government doesn't work well enough are remarkably similar.",
      "Neither are the first to grumble about the machinery of government.",
      "More than 20 years ago, Sir Tony Blair gave a speech much of which Sir Keir could give today.",
      "\"Sometimes we can be so frightened of the process of accountability, we opt for inertia,\" Sir Tony said in 2004, adding that too often the civil service had acted as \"a shock absorber in order to maintain the status quo\".",
      "So claims about a lack of nimbleness and pace are not new.",
      "But a core strand of Sir Keir's argument overlaps with Liz Truss's.",
      "Perhaps the person the prime minister has to thank the most for his whopping majority has been making the case he is now making for a while.",
      "Their language and emphases may be different, but the diagnosis is the same.",
      "Starmer and Dominic Cummings now agree on one thing - the civil service is a problem",
      "Starmer pledges to tackle 'flabby' state",
      "Starmer pitches reform to 'shackled' civil servants",
      "Sir Keir Starmer says the state has become \"overcautious\" and \"flabby\" and government has become bigger, but weaker.",
      "By weaker, he means a growing inability to make stuff happen and a big reason for that, he reckons, is the proliferation of arm's length bodies \u2013 taxpayer funded organisations with independence from the government and considerable power.",
      "There has been a growing sense in Downing Street as the prime minister and his team have adjusted to life in government that organisations dreamt up as a wheeze by previous governments so they don't get blamed for this or that all too often now stand in the way of a minister being able to do what they want.",
      "The recent row about the Sentencing Council in England and Wales is seen as a case in point.",
      "And now, scrapping NHS England is, ministers will argue, the ultimate case study in scrapping unaccountable bureaucracy.",
      "Scale of challenge",
      "So what did Liz Truss argue after her time in government?",
      "She talked of the \"tyranny of the technocracy\", the \"power of the administrative state\" and argued that \"there is something rather undemocratic about this\".",
      "She said that \"Blair and Brown had imposed a web of legalistic architecture that added process and put more power in the hands of technocrats\", which granted is a point where you might think Truss and Starmer would depart and no doubt do in many instances.",
      "But strikingly, given that recent row about the Sentencing Council, when was it set up?",
      "In April 2010, when Gordon Brown was prime minister.",
      "\"For any challenge faced, for too long the answer has been more arm's length bodies, quangos and regulators which end up blocking the government,\" Sir Keir writes in the Daily Telegraph, without reference to any particular such body.",
      "It is also true that this new-ish government has itself created new arms-length bodies, such as GB Energy and Skills England.",
      "Perhaps it is human nature - that your own arm's length bodies don't feel as pernicious as ones dreamt up by a predecessor.",
      "Beyond the comparisons, the reason all this matters is the government is up against a pervasive sense that nothing works any more.",
      "Think the 8am scramble for an appointment with the doctor and the waiting lists for an operation for a start.",
      "Some senior Labour figures fret privately that their talk of \"missions\" and a \"Plan for Change\" might seem puny to many in comparison with the scale of that challenge.",
      "The prime minister said: \"Every pound that we spend, every regulation, every decision must deliver for working people. And I don't just mean efficiency...I mean something else which is allowing the state, the government, to operate what I call maximum power.\"",
      "The prime minister's speech is both a symptom of his early frustration at the capacity of government to get stuff done - and an acknowledgement of the urgency to do just that.",

      "But the key announcement was the abolition of the \"world's largest quango\", NHS England, which works with the government to agree funding and priorities, and oversees the delivery of services.",
      "He announced the government was bringing it back under the control of the Department of Health.",
      "Incoming governments have often sought to cut the number of quangos - but what are they and what do they do?",
      "What is a quango?",
      "Quango stands for Quasi-Autonomous Non-Governmental Organisation, but the government calls them \"arm's length bodies\". They are organisations such as regulators, cultural institutions and advisory bodies, which are funded by taxpayers but not directly controlled from Whitehall.",
      "They range from huge organisations like NHS England, to smaller ones like the Gambling Commission and the British Film Institute.",
      "How many quangos are there?",
      "The number of quangos has fallen by more than half since 2010 but there are still more than 300 across the UK.",
      "Under the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition, nearly 300 were axed - dubbed the \"bonfire of the quangos\" - in an attempt to improve accountability and cut costs.",
      "Despite Sir Keir indicating he would also like to reduce the role of quangos, the new Labour government has set up more than 20 since winning power.",

      "Asked earlier this week if the government was planning another \"bonfire of the quangos\", Downing Street said the PM wanted to see a more \"active and agile state\", rather than \"outsourcing\" decisions to other bodies.",
      "How much do they cost?",
      "Almost 60% of day-to-day government spending is channelled through quangos, with 90% of this going to the largest 10 bodies.",
      "The total budget for quangos in 2022/23 - the latest published figures - was \u00a3353.3bn.",
      "Why are they controversial?",
      "Campaign groups like the TaxPayers' Alliance have long criticised quangos, claiming they allow ministers to dodge responsibility for mistakes and can be inefficient and costly.",
      "The Institute for Government think tank says in some cases scrapping public bodies can save money and improve how services are delivered.",
      "It gives the example of how absorbing JobCentre Plus into the Department for Work and Pensions helped cut the department's workforce and office space by a third.",
      "But the think tank argues abolitions also cost money and time in the short term, with services disrupted when powers are transferred.",

      "The meetings are focussing on the principles of reform \u2013 not the detail.",
      "The escalating costs and numbers of people designated as unfit for work were set out in a slideshow presentation.",

      "The full scale of the cuts won't be set out until the Spring Statement, while Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall will give a major speech next week and publish a \"Green Paper\".",
      "Despite the name, that's a blueprint for reform.",
      "There are those on the Left of the party who don't believe any cuts should be made.",
      "At Prime Minister's Questions Richard Burgon \u2013 a frontbencher under Jeremy Corbyn \u2013 urged Sir Keir Starmer to consider a wealth tax rather than a welfare cut.",
      "Unsustainable welfare",
      "Broadly speaking, though, the parliamentary party has accepted the argument that \u2013 without reform \u2013 the welfare bill is going to become unsustainable in years to come.",
      "And Labour strategists believe that appearing to get a handle on welfare is an essential weapon in the anti-Reform UK armoury.",
      "The strongest argument the government can muster in favour of reform is that too many people who are regarded as long-term sick are in effect thrown on the unemployment scrapheap when, with the right help, they could engage in the world of work.",
      "And it's understood that the Treasury won't swallow up all of the welfare savings.",
      "Kendall will be able to redirect a significant sum \u2013 perhaps as much as \u00a31bn \u2013 into the kind of intensive support which some claimants would need to get off benefits.",
      "This, of course, would be expected to lead to savings in due course but won't bring instant rewards.",
      "Starmer urged to protect disability benefit claimants",
      "Starmer says benefit system unfair and indefensible",
      "How big is the welfare budget and where might cuts fall?",
      "Another argument being made is that the system currently provides a perverse incentive which encourages sickness over work.",
      "If you were to be assessed as having a limited capacity to work or undertake work-related activity you could be paid around \u00a3400 more a month than someone who is unemployed actively looking for work.",
      "That gap is likely to be narrowed.",
      "Where the government has a bigger challenge is to convince its own MPs that the level of Personal Independence Payments (PIP) - which are not means tested and are made to people who have a long-term physical or mental health condition - ought to change, and future eligibility restricted.",
      "At PMQs Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey asked Sir Keir to \"calm anxieties\" by giving an assurance that disability benefits for those who can't work wouldn't be cut.",
      "He didn't receive it.",
      "Here, the politics are tricky.",
      "PIP cuts don't fit in to the narrative of providing opportunities to people who are languishing on the dole.",
      "Some of those who receive PIP payments are in work and would argue that these provide essential support which enables them to remain in employment.",
      "The Department for Work and Pensions has consulted with charities, but even before the Green Paper has seen the light of day some of those organisations have been firing off denunciatory press releases.",
      "The state of the public finances means the Treasury needs to rein in spending if the chancellor is to meet her own fiscal rules, including having debt fall as a share of national income on a five-year horizon.",
      "The expectation is that PIP payments will be frozen next year \u2013 so their value will erode - and that some of those in receipt of PIP are likely to face re-assessment and may lose their payments entirely.",
      "Loyalty tested to the limit?",
      "It's here in particular that some the usually loyal MPs - not associated with the party's Left -  are expressing concerns.",
      "We have spoken to some of them who listened to the PM make the case for welfare reform at a private meeting on Monday, or who attended the private meetings on Wednesday.",
      "An attendee said there was too little detail to reach a definitive view but cutting disabled benefits was likely to be a red line. Others were more outspoken.",
      "One told us: \"People won't wear it. The costs of being disabled aren't going down.",
      "\"They cant just force this through like the winter fuel cut.\"",
      "Another said: \"If we're freezing PIP that is unforgivable.",
      "\"Some people have very complex disabilities. Part of the social contract is they are supported.\"",
      "And a usual supporter of Sir Keir said: \"Most of us broadly agree that there are lots of people who don't work but should, and have no problem with getting them into work.",
      "\"But punishing those who are especially vulnerable and have severe disabilities is unacceptable.\"",
      "Another added: \"The government needs to stop talking about everyone who is on disability benefits as if they are all the same because they are not.\"",
      "We were told some \"heartfelt conversations\" were had with the No 10 team on Wednesday and there is a hope that the potential PIP freeze can be thawed.",
      "\"This is still a live conversation,\" one MP said.",
      "Some MPs also felt that the timing of the welfare cuts was wrong.",
      "For example, they said NHS waiting lists needed to come down first \u2013 which should also bring savings in PIP and incapacity benefits - and should be done against the backdrop of a growing, not stagnant, economy.",
      "It is worth remembering, though, that the government has a large majority and the prime minister himself is hugely determined not to duck difficult decisions on welfare.",
      "And that recently-formed Get Britain Working Group of Labour MPs \u2013 most of who are from the 2024 intake -  will vocally support the need for radical welfare reform.",
      "However one of the 36 signatories to the group's supportive letter to Kendall has withdrawn her name.",
      "Stoke South MP Allison Gardner said on social media that her name should not have been included, because the letter didn't do enough to  reflect the needs of those with severe disabilities who simply can't work.",

      "Asked at the time if the prime minister had convinced him not to impose trade tariffs on the UK, Trump said \"he tried\", adding: \"He was working hard, I'll tell you that. He earned whatever the hell they pay him over there.\"",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg18p812ggo",
    "published": "Tue, 11 Mar 2025 12:57:08 GMT",
    "summary": "The measure is part of the Planning and Infrastructure Bill, which has been introduced to Parliament.",
    "story": [
      "Councils are to be given greater powers to seize land, under government plans to boost housebuilding.",
      "The measure is part of the flagship Planning and Infrastructure Bill, which has been introduced in Parliament and aims to speed up building.",
      "Housing Minister Matthew Pennycook said he wanted greater use of compulsory purchase orders (CPOs), which allow public authorities to acquire land without the consent of the owner.",
      "Currently, councils buying sites through CPOs must factor in the \"hope value\" - the potential value if planning permission for development is secured  - and this is set to be axed to allow land to be bought at a lower price.",
      "However, rural campaign groups raised concerns farmers could be forced to sell at knock-down prices and that green spaces could be lost.",
      "Victoria Vyvan, president of the Country Land and Business Association said the \"expensive, slow and bureaucratic planning system\" was what was preventing land sales by her members, who \"strongly believe that a small number of homes should be built in a large number of villages\".",
      "She added: \"In removing hope value from compulsory purchases, the government wants farmers to pay for a housing crisis they didn't create.",
      "\"We doubt house builders contracted by councils will be taking a lower profit, so once again farmers will be the only part of the supply chain to lose out.\"",
      "Paul Miner, head of planning and policy at CPRE, the countryside charity, said the group supported the use of CPOs to build genuinely affordable homes on previously developed land.",
      "But he added: \"Compulsory purchase shouldn't be used to enable the development of valued countryside and local green spaces.\"",
      "New homes fall again in government's first six months",
      "Where does the government want 1.5 million new homes?",
      "Labour would build on green belt to boost housing",
      "Responding to such fears, Pennycook told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he was \"somewhat mystified\" by this interpretation, saying CPOs would be used \"far more often\" for regenerating brownfield - or previously developed - land.",
      "\"We think it's right these powers are more widely used and it will be for local authorities to make the decisions about what land is appropriate for those powers to be used on,\" he added.",
      "A requirement for the secretary of state to sign off on CPOs will be removed \"in certain instances\", he said, adding that the legislation would be \"transformative\" in unlocking construction for new homes, roads, rail and renewable energy projects.",
      "The bill also aims streamline the planning process, with more decisions made directly by officers rather than councillors.",
      "However, councils have raised concerns this could mean they will be shut out of the democratic planning process.",
      "Richard Clewer, housing and planning spokesperson at the Country Councils Network, said he welcomed changes to CPOs as a \"useful tool\".",
      "However, he said changes to the planning process could \"dilute and bypass the role of councillors\", particularly with rural developments where a few new homes could make a significant impact.",
      "Defending the plans, Pennycook said \"expert planning officers\" would support elected councillors with technical detail and allow councillors to focus on larger, more controversial applications.",
      "The government has promised to build 1.5 million new homes in England over the next five years, with the pledge key to boosting economic growth.",
      "However, the number of new homes continued to fall during the first six months that Labour was in power, with the construction industry warning the country does not have enough workers to deliver on the target.",
      "Pennycook said the inheritance from the previous Conservative government was \"dire\" but there were \"very positive signs\" and \"green shoots coming forward\" in the number of planning applications being submitted.",
      "Other measures in the bill include:",
      "Up to \u00a32,500 off energy bills for people living within 500m of new pylonsStreamlining the process for approving key projects like wind farms, roads or railways and banning multiple \"meritless\" legal challenges.Allowing \"ready-to-go\" energy projects to jump to the front of the queue for grid connections, replacing the current \"first come, first served process\" which the government says has clogged up the system",

      "Officials will consult on removing Sport England, the Theatres Trust and the Garden History Society from the list of \"statutory consultees\", who are legally required to provide advice on decisions.",
      "The government said in some cases organisations were slowing down building, giving the example of a housing development in Bradford which was delayed because the application was thought to have not adequately considered the speed of cricket balls from a nearby club.",
      "\"We can't have nonsensical approaches that mean people's houses can't be built because of a stray cricket ball,\" Rayner said, adding: \"We need to have a common sense approach.\"",

      "Currently employees are eligible for parental bereavement leave if they or their partner have a stillbirth after 24 weeks of pregnancy.",
      "Labour MP Sarah Owen, who chairs the Women and Equalities Committee, has been calling for this right to be extended in cases where miscarriages take place before 24 weeks.",
      "Speaking in the House of Commons, Madders said: \"Bereavement is not an illness, it's not a holiday and it does need its own special category.\"",
      "He added: \"I am grateful to the work of the Women and Equalities Committee for raising the important issue of miscarriage leave.",
      "\"The loss of a baby at any stage is an incredibly difficult personal experience and the inquiry they conducted demonstrated a clear gap in support for those who experience pregnancy loss and need time to recover and grieve.\"",
      "He said Owen had shown \"great bravery\" in speaking about her own experience of having a miscarriage.",
      "In 2021, Owen told MPs that after her own miscarriage she felt physically better in a few days but had \"all the classic signs\" of grieving.",
      "\"I could not eat, I could not sleep. I really did not hold much hope that life would ever get brighter,\" she said.",
      "Owen and her committee have proposed changes to the Employment Rights Bill which would ensure parents bereaved as a result of a pregnancy loss are entitled to two weeks of leave.",
      "During a debate on the bill on Tuesday, Madders said: \"We fully accept the principle of bereavement leave for pregnancy loss, as raised in the amendments, and we look forward to further discussions with [Owen] and [peers] as the Bill moves on to its next stages in the Lords.\"",
      "Owen said she was \"so pleased\" to hear the minister's commitment.",
      "Introducing a legal right to miscarriage bereavement leave would be \"a leading light in a world which seems to be taking a backward step in women's rights,\" she added.",
      "Vicki Robinson, CEO of the Miscarriage Association, said: \"We are extremely pleased to see, that for the first time ever, those experiencing pre-24-week pregnancy loss will be officially recognised in bereavement leave legislation.",
      "\"While we had been seeking paid leave, and the present commitment appears to be for unpaid leave, it nevertheless represents a significant step forward and provides long-overdue validation that this type of loss can be experienced as a bereavement like any other.\"",
      "Paid leave for bereaved parents is 'crucial'",
      "'I went back after 3 days': Calls for miscarriage bereavement leave",
      "How will the changes to workers' rights  affect you?",
      "The bill aims to strengthen workers' rights in areas including unfair dismissals, flexible working and sick pay.",
      "Opening the debate, Madders said it was a \"landmark bill\" that would \"tackle low pay, poor working conditions and poor job security\".",
      "Greg Smith, the Conservative shadow business minister, said he backed the government on bereavement leave for pregnancy loss but added that in the \"vast majority\" of the bill the government had got the balance between the rights employees and employers \"wrong\".",

      "Former Labour minister Louise Haigh and Lib Dem MP Layla Moran have proposed an amendment which would ban non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) in cases of sexual misconduct, abuse, harassment and discrimination in the workplace.",

      "\"But they are frequently misused in order to bully people into silence when they have already suffered at work.\"",
      "Madders said it was \"an important issue that warrants further consideration\" but did   not commit to accepting their amendment.",
      "Stella Creasy, Labour MP for Walthamstow, is trying to amend the bill to provide greater protections for paternity or parental partner leave.",
      "The bill currently gives workers the right to paternity leave from day one of their employment, instead of the current 26 weeks.",
      "Creasy's amendment would compel the government to review and consult on the period of protected paternity and parental partner leave, which currently stands at two weeks.",
      "She said that was not long enough, adding that the UK had \"the worst\" paternity leave entitlement in the whole of the EU.",
      "Madders said the government would be holding a review of the parental leave system, which would be separate from the bill.",

      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has told his ministers they should take more responsibility for decisions rather than \"outsourcing\" them to regulators.",

      "He said the Labour government \"must go further and faster to reform the state\", including reviewing regulations with no role its plans.",
      "The prime minister spoke to his top team ahead of a speech on Thursday, when he is expected to announce an overhaul of how the government works.",
      "In the meeting, Sir Keir did not give examples of decisions made by regulators instead of ministers.",

      "Some - such as the Environment Agency, or the broadcasting regulator Ofcom - have powers to make decisions without ministerial input.",
      "When asked whether the government was planning a \"bonfire of the quangos\", a Downing Street spokesperson said the prime minister wanted to see a more \"active and agile state\".",
      "\"The state has become larger, but it hasn't become more effective,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "The spokesperson said regulators had \"not been focused enough on growth\" and that would be a theme of the prime minister's speech on Thursday.",

      "On Monday, Sir Keir wrote to civil servants to promise reforms that would unshackle them from bureaucracy and stop their talent being \"constrained\".",

      "Io Hadjicosta, the charity's climate and energy policy manager, said: \"This announcement is deeply concerning and is yet another case of the Scottish government flip flopping when it comes to tackling the climate emergency.",
      "\"Reducing emissions from Scotland's housing stock by improving insulation and fitting renewable heat pumps would lift people out of fuel poverty - not increase it.",
      "\"By delaying the introduction of the Heat in Buildings Bill further all the government is doing is condemning the poorest in our society to increasingly high fossil fuel costs and damp, unhealthy homes.\"",
      "Douglas Lumsden, the Scottish Conservatives' spokesperson on net zero and energy, said the plans were \"completely unrealistic\".",

      "But she told MSPs the government must act to chart a course reach net zero by 2045 at a pace and scale which was feasible, fair and just.",
      "The Heat in Buildings Bill was once described to me as \"game changing\" legislation designed to reduce the massive carbon footprint that comes from heating our homes.",
      "Our gas boilers are the main culprit; lots of individual devices inefficiently burning fossil fuels to create the heat.",
      "At least a million of them needed to be replaced by 2030 to meet the Scottish government's now abandoned interim climate change targets.",
      "The legislation would have meant anyone buying a home would have had to change to a green heating system \u2013 like a heat pump \u2013 within, say, two years of the sale being completed. The exact time frame had not been decided.",
      "But with the 2030 target now scrapped, and a much delayed energy strategy still not forthcoming, the pressure is off.",

    "summary": "Former cabinet minister says it would be ludicrous to suggest he tried to shortcut safety checks in the pandemic.",
    "story": [
      "Michael Gove has told the Covid inquiry it was \"ludicrous\" to suggest he tried to force through a deal for a new ventilator made by the electronics giant Dyson without proper safety checks.",
      "Emails show a senior official at the health watchdog warned that the former cabinet office minister was trying to \"circumvent the regulatory process\" in March 2020.",
      "Messages between staff at the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said Mr Gove did not \"appreciate the level of risk involved\" and was working to a \"totally unrealistic\" timescale.",
      "A provisional order for 10,000 machines was placed at the time, but the deal was scrapped after Dyson failed to win regulatory approval.",
      "No public money was spent on the prototype.",
      "Dyson said it never intended to make a profit from the venture and wrote off around \u00a320m in research and development costs.",
      "Ventilator Challenge",
      "In March 2020, as Covid was spreading across northern Italy, there was a frantic attempt by health authorities to get hold of ventilators to help patients breathe.",
      "The NHS had between 6,000 and 8,000 in stock but modelling suggested it needed 30,000 by the end of June and 90,000 by November to cope with a predicted influx of patients.",
      "On 16 March 2020, the government launched the 'Ventilator Challenge' - a drive to encourage domestic UK suppliers to develop new machines or modify existing designs.",
      "The project was overseen by cabinet office officials and involved the MHRA, which helped draw up initial specifications and squeezed an approval process that would usually take 18-24 months into just weeks.",
      "A number of major companies were involved, including the carmakers Ford and McLaren, and the electronics giant Dyson.",
      "At the time, the company's founder Sir James Dyson held a number of telephone conversations with government officials, including the then Prime Minister Boris Johnson.",
      "The Covid inquiry was shown WhatsApp messages then sent between ministers and government advisers suggesting Sir James was concerned about the pace of project.",
      "On 20 March 2020, Mr Johnson wrote that \"Dyson [was] freaking\" and called for \"Action this day\".",
      "Minutes later ex health secretary Matt Hancock replied, \"I have also received the same. I will talk to Dyson and Michael [Gove] and sort it.\"",
      "Asked about the deal at the inquiry, the government's then chief commercial officer, Sir Gareth Rhys Williams, said it was the only example he could recall in the pandemic where he was asked to put a contract in place \"against commercial guidance\".",
      "Five days later, on 25 March, Boris Johnson wrote another WhatsApp message to the same group saying that: \"Dyson has a ventilator ready to go\u2026 It's safe, effective and loses less oxygen. Rhys Williams has blocked it under the misapprehension that oxygen passes through the motor. That is total b****cks.\"",
      "He accused officials of \"fiddling while Rome burns\" and added: \"Sorry but I'm on a mission. Dyson knows what he's doing and won't risk his global brand reputation delivering dodgy ventilators.\"",
      "'Totally unrealistic'",
      "Sir Gareth said, at that point, the Dyson prototype pushed air from a fan directly into the lungs of patients, something that could cause safety concerns.",
      "The Dyson team did subsequently \"fix\" that part of the design, he added.",
      "Later on 25 March, Sir Gareth wrote to Sir John Manzoni, a top civil servant in the cabinet office, saying that Michael Gove was \"INSISTENT we place an order with Dyson\u2026 contingent on passing clinical and passing MHRA approvals.\"",
      "A provisional \u00a3100,000 order was then placed for the Dyson prototypes, and an email from Michael Gove's private office set out a number of actions that needed be taken quickly including: \"The MHRA and Sir Gareth Rhys Williams to ensure by the end of Friday, [that] the Dyson product has been tested and approved by MHRA\u2026 [and] the final product has started to be manufactured.\"",
      "The following day Graeme Tunbridge, the director of devices for the MHRA, wrote to colleagues warning that Michael Gove was \"keen to press forward with Dyson's proposal to a timescale that is totally unrealistic.\"",
      "He added that Mr Gove \"did not appreciate the level of risk involved in the manufacture and use of ventilators\" and \"wanted to circumvent the expedited regulatory process that has been put in place\".",
      "\"MHRA are doing everything we can to support this but absolutely will not cut any corners when it comes to the issues of critical patient safety,\" he wrote.",
      "Giving evidence to the inquiry, Mr Gove denied he had tried to pressure the MHRA in any way, or that the focus on Dyson meant resources could not be devoted to bids from other companies.",
      "\"Just imagine the situation, if you will, a minister \u2013 Matt Hancock, I, Boris Johnson \u2013 says we want to have a potentially lethal machine in hospitals deliberately so that we can meet an arbitrary deadline. It's inconceivable,\" he said.",
      "The former minister said that the Dyson prototype ultimately \"did not get through testing\" and \"whenever confronted with brute facts about safety or otherwise, I would always accept them.\"",
      "He denied that his private office was instructing the regulator to approve the device saying the language used was simply \"shorthand for 'we would hope that it had been tested and if tested satisfactorily [then] approved by the MHRA to that timescale'\".",
      "In the end the government said the Ventilator Challenge helped scale up the production of three existing models, and approved one new design by the medical devices firm Penlon.",
      "In total, an extra 14,000 devices were delivered over three months, fewer than the government originally planned for as doctors identified other ways of treating the most severe Covid cases.",
      "In a statement, Dyson said Sir James Dyson responded to a personal call from Boris Johnson to \"develop and make a medical-grade ventilator in 30 days during the national emergency\".",
      "\"Far from receiving any commercial benefit, there was significant commercial cost to Dyson which diverted 450 engineers away from commercial projects,\" added a company spokesperson.",
      "\"Uniquely amongst the many businesses involved, [Sir] James Dyson did not seek payment for any of the \u00a320m the company spent on the project \u2013 rather this was its contribution to the national effort to save lives.\""

      "The UK tax authority has been heavily criticised for its failure to answer tens of thousands of calls, and for long delays on phonelines.",
      "James Murray, Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury, said HMRC was trialling a system used by banks to use voice recognition to improve call handling.",

      "This was because HMRC's system could not cope with the volume of calls, but customers were not warned they were about to be cut off, nor were they called back, the report added.",
      "The committee claimed HMRC was running a \"deliberately poor\" phone service in an attempt to push taxpayers to seek help online instead.",
      "However, that claim was described as \"completely baseless\" by HMRC bosses who said they had made huge improvements to service standards.",
      "In March last year, HMRC announced its phone line would be closed between April and September, but was forced to reverse its decision within 24 hours."

    "published": "Wed, 12 Mar 2025 16:13:02 GMT",
    "summary": "How much will the UK be hit by US tariffs and what happens next?",
    "story": [
      "Despite the government's hopes, the UK has not, in the end, been exempted from President Trump's 25% steel and aluminium tariffs.",
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer has said the UK will \"keep all options on the table\", but has not announced immediate retaliation.",
      "BBC Verify looks at how big the impact on the UK could be and what might happen next.",
      "Starmer says 'all options on table' on US tariffs",
      "Metal products",
      "The value of the UK's raw steel and aluminium exports to the US in 2024 was around \u00a3470m.",
      "But it's important to note that these latest US tariffs - taxes on imports - also cover products made with steel and aluminium, which covers everything from gym equipment, to furniture, to machinery.",
      "It's estimated by the Global Trade Alert think tank that the UK's exports of these products to the US in 2024 was around \u00a32.2bn.",
      "So the total annual value of UK exports affected would be around \u00a32.7bn.",
      "For context, the UK exported around \u00a358bn of goods to the US on an annual basis in 2024 - so the share of goods hit by these new Trump tariffs represents just under 5%.",
      "The UK hopes to conclude a free trade deal with the Trump administration, which could mean these tariffs being removed.",
      "But we have no way of knowing if - or how soon - such an agreement could be concluded.",
      "Trump has also threatened to impose reciprocal tariffs on all the United States' trading partners, including the UK, from next month.",
      "These are taxes on imports to the US which are set at a similar rate to taxes other countries put on goods they import from the US.",
      "And the White House has said that, in deciding what level to set them, it will take into account countries' Value Added Tax rates.",
      "The US government regards VAT as a tax that discriminates against US imports - even though it applies equally to imports and domestically-produced goods.",
      "The UK has a 20% standard VAT rate, which could potentially mean the UK being hit by a substantial reciprocal tariff from the US.",
      "While the UK is not yet retaliating, the European Union has already confirmed it plans to impose tariffs on 26bn euros (\u00a322bn) a year worth of goods imported from America.",
      "And the EU is targeting US goods including Bourbon whiskey, jeans and Harley-Davidson motorcycles, which are considered to be politically sensitive in America because of their iconic status and because of which US states some of them are  produced in.",
      "Notwithstanding the hope for a free trade deal, in the wake of any reciprocal tariffs imposed by the US, which are perceived to be unfair and punitive, the UK government could find itself under growing pressure to retaliate in a similar way to the EU.",
      "Why is Trump imposing tariffs?",
      "The US President has a long - and often shifting - list of justifications for imposing these import taxes.",
      "One is that he claims to want to restore fairness to America's trading relations with the rest of the world.",
      "Trump complains that some other countries have higher tariffs on the goods they import from the US, than the other way round.",
      "The US had an average external tariff of 3.3% in 2023.",
      "That was slightly lower than the UK's average tariff of 3.8%.",
      "It was also below the European Union's average tariff of 5% and China's average tariff of 7.5%.",
      "However, America's average tariff was considerably lower than those of some of its other trading partners such as India (17%) and South Korea (13.4%).",
      "Broadly speaking, it is legitimate for Trump to point out that some countries have a higher average tariff on imports than America does.",
      "Replacing income tax?",
      "Another justification for tariffs from the president is raising more tax revenue for the US government. At one stage during the presidential election campaign in 2024, he suggested that tariff revenue could entirely replace the federal income tax.",
      "This is not only implausible given the $3 trillion a year value of US imports and the $2 trillion a year raised by income tax - but it needs to be seen in the context of the fact that tariffs would push up US consumer prices.",
      "Trump also wants to put pressure on other countries to change some of their policies. This has been the explicit rationale for US tariffs on Canada and Mexico, with the White House saying it wants to pressure those countries to stamp out cross-border Fentanyl smuggling.",
      "Another key goal articulated by the president is wanting to encourage multinational manufacturing companies to invest and produce more in America to create domestic jobs.",
      "Some of these justifications are inconsistent.",
      "Tariffs cannot be a both a major permanent tax revenue raiser as well as a way to bring manufacturing back to America on a large scale as the latter implies imports - and therefore tariff revenues - slumping.",
      "Moreover, the vast majority of economists are also extremely sceptical about the likelihood of tariffs achieving many of these goals.",

      "That was partly drawn from her mandate - an extraordinary run of election wins that made her leader of the third placed party at Westminster.",
      "That gave her a voice in debates about Brexit and offered the UK media a political contrast with a succession of Conservative prime ministers, including Boris Johnson.",
      "She was also seen as a persistent threat to the continuation of the UK state, pushing the boundaries of devolution in pursuit of her ambition to hold another independence referendum.",
      "In the end, neither the forces of her personality or argument were able to bring that about.",
      "Her strategy collapsed when the UK Supreme Court ruled that any future vote must be agreed with the UK government.",
      "Subsequent talk of using a UK general election as a substitute referendum lacked credibility.",
      "This was a significant factor in what brought her leadership to a close, as was her focus on the politics of switching gender identity - ironically the subject of an opposition debate at Holyrood today.",
      "There were also the divisions in the SNP and the wider independence movement caused by the spectacular fallout Sturgeon had with her predecessor, Alex Salmond, when the Scottish government mishandled harassment complaints against him.",

      "What is the Spring Statement and when is it?",
      "The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which monitors the government's spending plans and performance, will publish its forecast on the UK economy on Wednesday 26 March.",
      "It will also provide estimates on the cost of living for households and whether it thinks the government will stick to its self-imposed rules on borrowing and spending.",

      "Reeves has committed to one major economic event - the Budget - each year, to \"give families and businesses stability and certainty on tax and spending changes\".",
      "That means no big policy announcements are made on 26 March, but that's not stopping them being made beforehand.",
      "With the economy seen to be underperforming and global factors, such as US trade tariffs, indirectly impacting the UK, there is growing speculation over whether the chancellor will break her self-imposed rules on borrowing.",
      "The OBR's forecast is expected to confirm that the \u00a39.9bn financial buffer to meet her budget rule by the 2029/30 financial year, has been wiped out.",
      "Reeves has repeatedly said her rules are \"non-negotiable\". Her two main rules are:",

      "A debateable tax hiking policy could be announced, however, if Reeves decides to extend the freeze on the thresholds at which people start to pay different rates of income tax.",
      "The policy is known as a hidden tax rise or stealth tax, as it takes effect over time as people are dragged into paying more tax as their pay goes up, without the tax rate rising at all.",
      "Thresholds were frozen by the previous Conservative government until April 2028, but the chancellor could decide to extend the freeze beyond this to raise about \u00a37bn a year, according to consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics and investment bank Citi.",

      "Whether any other spending cuts are announced in the Spring Statement or in the Spending Review in June, or even delayed until the next Budget, remains to be seen.",
      "How is the UK economy doing?",
      "Recent figures show UK economic growth has been sluggish - not shrinking, but not growing as desired.",
      "The economy grew by just 0.1% between October and December 2024, according to the latest official figures.",
      "When an economy grows, more businesses can employ extra workers or give pay rises. Firms making higher profits also pay more in tax to the government, which can be spent on public services.",
      "In addition to slow growth, prices are also rising faster than wanted.",
      "The current inflation rate of 3% is higher than the Bank of England's 2% target, and is forecast to go higher. Inflation could dictate whether interest rates are lowered further from their current 4.5%.",
      "Higher rates mean higher borrowing costs for loans, credit cards and mortgage deals, but it also provides better returns on savings.",
      "Costs for businesses are expected to jump further in April, when National Insurance contributions paid by employers rise. These could be passed on to consumers.",
      "Pressure has also increased on the chancellor's tax and spending plans after a surplus in government finances missed official forecasts, prompting speculation from economists that she could break her fiscal rules as things stand.",
      "Borrowing costs for the UK surged in January in part due to concerns over the UK's economic outlook, threatening Reeves's economic plans. The costs have since fallen back but remain higher than this time last year.",
      "Reeves has also warned that a potential global trade war, despite tariffs not directly targeting the UK, would lower growth and raise inflation."

    "story": [
      "\"Trump may be the best thing to happen to Starmer,\" says a diplomat, suggesting the brash property tycoon busy upending the world order might be just what the strait-laced prime minister - who's been dragging in the polls - needs.",
      "One of Labour's business backers calls it \"the PM's finest hour\" - a Remainer leader putting Britain at the heart of international action as Trump rattles the Western world's cage.",
      "Sir Keir Starmer has certainly been incredibly visible \u2013 in the White House, leading a European summit at Lancaster House last weekend, hugging Zelensky, plotting a peacekeeping path with Macron.",
      "It's hard for the Conservatives and other opponents to compete with the prime minister's international moves dominating the news.",
      "Moments of crisis like the one we're living through are often when the public tunes into politics and looks to their leaders. With a shaky global situation, does No 10 look more solid than before?",
      "Some of his colleagues are certain. One government source tells me all the international activity is \"almost Blair-esque\", or even a moment like Thatcher and the Falklands which enabled the 80s Conservative prime minister to burnish her reputation and win successive election victories.",
      "Another minister suggests other leaders \"get their knickers in a twist\" publicly reacting to Trump's unpredictable comments and actions - \"but Keir has spent his whole career dealing with extreme circumstances. What he is able to do is get people to focus on the things that really matter.\"",
      "But impressive-looking diplomacy doesn't mean the UK is getting what it wants \u2013 missiles are still falling, overnight again in Donetsk and Kharkhiv. Donald Trump's commitment to guaranteeing Ukraine's security, even NATO's future, is shaky too.",
      "So let's take a calm look. Polling suggests there has been a nudge upwards for Sir Keir's personal ratings and for Labour, after a dreadful start in office and a steep, fast drop in the polls.",
      "His government would not be the first to be swept away by the intensity and glamour of global diplomacy which, however difficult or worthy, doesn't necessarily translate into significant brownie points at home.",
      "Perhaps in these wild times, we're seeing the prime minister carve out a role as \"reassurer in chief\". In political circles it's long been common to find criticisms of Sir Keir Starmer for, frankly, being a bit dull, and not willing to play the minute-by-minute political game. But with Trump in the White House stoking drama the PM's colleagues believe his steadiness has become an asset.",
      "And he's shown willingness to take action \u2013 increasing defence spending, albeit after months of pressure, getting European leaders together and drawing up military plans for after a peace deal. A senior government source says: \"The global crisis means people looking at us again, and the government has been making an argument that people are responding to: that we have got their backs.\"",
      "But aligning yourself with an American president doesn't always work out. Tony Blair's chinos weren't the only thing that became uncomfortable about his relationship with George W Bush.",
      "So while there's evidence the public are looking at Sir Keir a touch more favourably since his White House trip, as one union leader warns, \"for it to count he has to show the same mojo at home\".",
      "Take the row over sentencing this week. Or forthcoming arguments over cutting welfare, which ministers have been falling over themselves to soften the ground for.",
      "But overshadowing everything, priority number one: the grisly state of the economy and getting it to grow.",
      "In around a fortnight Rachel Reeves will be on her feet in Parliament, probably announcing cuts to public spending running to billions. Government sources point to some better statistics on wages, and cuts to interest rates, but Reeves is under enormous pressure to explain how the economy is going to escape the doldrums it has been stuck in for ages.",
      "All the Kodak moments, and grip and grins with international leaders in the world won't change that. The PM \"can walk and talk at the same\" time, one ally says. But there are, they acknowledge, \"only so many hours in the day\".",
      "Helping Ukraine against Putin's Russia has a clear moral story the prime minister finds easy to tell, and compelling to try to shape. In contrast, \"how do you bring prosperity to the regions? That's a real puzzle.\"",
      "In the next few days, starting with the PM's right-hand man Pat McFadden in the studio tomorrow, you will see the government try to kick up the pace of what is happening at home. First up - perhaps not a box-office hit - they'll be looking at making the Whitehall machine work better, including making it easier to get rid of civil servants.",
      "Ministers tell me Downing Street is being run more effectively than before Christmas and has a clearer sense of direction, after early embarrassment over being far less prepared than promised.",
      "Sir Keir chairs regular meetings with individual cabinet ministers in charge of the government's \"missions\". I'm told he \"cross-examines\" them and their officials - and if their answers aren't up to snuff, they get called in for another meeting. \"He is a very nice man, but he is a hard man too,\" one of them confides.",
      "As well as slimming down parts of the civil service, there'll be more on the government's plans to cut billions off the welfare bill. Labour will argue it's for good reason, to help people stuck on benefits - while critics will say it's a way for the government to save money off the backs of some of the most vulnerable people in the country.",
      "On Thursday, the prime minister is expected to make his own speech in an attempt to weave it all together into a grand narrative about safety abroad and at home. One government source said the last few weeks had galvanised Sir Keir's thinking on this: when things are uncertain on the international stage, \"everything feels a bit wobbly\" and domestic security is amplified: you look around and feel your job isn't secure, your street isn't safe.",
      "This thinking has been a long time coming. \"Security\" was a word and concept used by Reeves and Sir Keir in opposition - but recently he's been making a more ideological argument than those close to him are used to hearing.",
      "As well as making the case that what happens around the world is inextricably linked to what happens at home, he holds that the old international consensus among Western leaders has failed for millions of voters.",
      "That argument was crystallised into a long memo he sent to his cabinet ministers and political team in the middle of February. In it he wrote: \"The government's challenge was to shape this new era. Not to defend institutions that are broken or old ideas that have failed, but to be the voice of working people who more than anything want security in their lives, and a country that is on the up again.\"",
      "He wrote that politicians were wrong to think markets had solutions for almost everything. \"We were cowed by the market - we came to act as if it always knew best and the state should sit it out.\"",
      "He also said governments had failed on immigration, failed to understand the public's concerns and also - to tell the truth. \"We ended up treating all immigration as an untrammelled good. Somehow, politics ended up being too scared to say what is obvious - that some people are genuine refugees and some aren't; that people coming here to work can be a positive, but that an island nation needs to control its borders.\"",
      "Some extracts from the letter have been revealed before. But what is notable, reading the whole document, is the prime minister closes his letter to colleagues with a call to provide \"security\" for the country, alongside renewing public services. He writes: \"Now is our moment to be bigger and bolder - to put pedal on metal on wholescale reform and change our politics and our country. Security and renewal are our twin tasks - we must now deliver them.\"",
      "You'll hear more of that argument from ministers in the coming days - we had a glimpse of it in the studio last Sunday morning too.",
      "The profound uncertainty Donald Trump's arrival in the White House has given the prime minister a moment to step into the spotlight on the world stage.",
      "And his government is now much more overtly weaving an argument that working to establish security round the world is fundamentally connected to sorting out security at home.",
      "There is a reason why, fresh from all the diplomatic handshakes, Sir Keir was back in the more familiar hi-vis and hard hat announcing defence jobs in Belfast.",
      "No 10 wants you to see and believe that crisis abroad can mean opportunity at home. This spasm in global security has given a prime minister sometimes accused of being a blank page a clearer story to tell.",
      "But in the end, for any prime minister, it is what happens on home turf, not foreign adventures that matter the most. A sceptical public will take a lot of convincing to believe government can improve their situation \u2013 make it easier to manage the bills, buy a house, or for their kids to find a decent job.",
      "As as a senior figure in the Labour movement concludes, \"he likes the statesman role but the bottom line is, change in people's lives will be the decider.\"",

    "story": [
      "Early-rising UK stargazers are in for a celestial treat on Friday as a lunar eclipse takes place just before dawn.",
      "For most of the UK the eclipse will be partial as the Earth's shadow will not cover all of the Moon. For some far western regions, and across the Americas, the eclipse will be total, weather permitting",
      "As the Moon moves into Earth's shadow, it will gradually darken before turning a dusky red, resulting in a stunning \"blood moon\". A weather front will bring some cloud overnight but there is a good chance skies will be clear enough to see it.",
      "The last total lunar eclipse in the UK occurred in 2022.",
      "When is the lunar eclipse?",
      "The penumbral phase (when the Moon first enters Earth's outer shadow) will begin at 03:57 on Friday.",
      "The partial eclipse - when the Moon starts moving into the darker part of Earth's shadow - will begin at 05:09.",
      "Lunar eclipses are visible from anywhere on Earth where the Moon is above the horizon at the time.",
      "At 06:58 the eclipse will reach its true maximum; however, in almost all of the UK, the Moon will have already set below the horizon, so we won't be able to see this.",
      "Very western areas like the Scottish highlands, west Cornwall and the very western parts of Northern Ireland may get a brief glimpse of total eclipse.",
      "For those in North America, most of South America, and western Greenland, the eclipse will be total.",
      "\"Even if you have to get up super early to see it, I would definitely recommend that you try because seeing it in real life is really, really cool,\" says Imo Bell, astronomer at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich.",
      "What is a lunar eclipse and a blood moon?",
      "A lunar eclipse happens when Earth moves directly between the Sun and the Moon, blocking sunlight and casting a shadow on the Moon's surface.",
      "There are three main types:",
      "Total lunar eclipse \u2013 The entire Moon moves into Earth's shadow and turns red.",
      "Total lunar eclipse \u2013 The entire Moon moves into Earth's shadow and turns red.",

      "Penumbral lunar eclipse \u2013 A subtle event where the Moon passes through Earth's outer shadow, causing a slight dimming.",
      "People sometimes refer to a lunar eclipse as a \"blood moon\" because of the way the Moon can turn a deep, coppery red during the eclipse.",
      "This is caused by a process known as \"Rayleigh scattering\" which also makes the sky blue and our sunsets red. It scatters more of the shorter blue wavelength light, allowing the longer red wavelength light to remain visible.",
      "During a lunar eclipse, all of the light shining onto the Moon has come through Earth's atmosphere. It's as if every sunrise and sunset in the world is projected onto the lunar surface.",
      "How to see it?",
      "To get the best view of the eclipse, head to a clear, dark location.",
      "\"My top tip would be to make sure you have a good view of the western horizon, because the Moon will be in the west and it will be setting towards the western horizon,\" advises Imo Bell of the Royal Observatory.",
      "Another top tip from Imo: it'll be dark so bring a light to help get around, but use a red torch if you can get hold of one. It helps keep your eyes adjusted to the dark.",
      "Also, of course, check the weather forecast.",
      "\"Even though some people might say it's not that unusual to get a lunar eclipse, as we can see one every few years, next time it comes around, it might be cloudy. So, if you can, definitely do get out and try and have a look,\" said Imo.",
      "The next lunar eclipse visible in the UK will be on 7 September 2025.",
      "Will the skies be clear enough to see it?",
      "We've seen a change to colder more unsettled weather and northerly winds over recent days.",
      "A weather front will sink south overnight on Thursday into the early hours of Friday, bringing cloud, rain or hill snow to northern parts of the UK and obscuring the view of the sky for some.",
      "However, there is a chance of the skies being clear enough to view the partial eclipse early on Friday, especially in the north of Northern Ireland and Scotland as well as the south of England and Wales.",

      "The government said it was still committed to paying \u00a35bn over two years for such sustainable farming and nature recovery work.",
      "'Biggest budget'",

      "But Mr Bradshaw said the closure of the current SFI scheme had \"slammed shut\" the door for funding for thousands of farmers.",
      "He said the closure was \"delivered yet again with no warning, no understanding of the industry and a complete lack of compassion or care\".",
      "Victoria Vyvyan, the president of the Country Land and Business Association (CLA), which represents thousands of rural landowners, said that closing the scheme was the \"most cruel\" betrayal.",
      "She added that the decision \"actively harms nature. It actively harms the environment. And, with war once again raging in Europe, to actively harm our food production is reckless beyond belief\".",
      "Martin Lines, chief executive of the Nature Friendly Farming Network (NFFN), said the gap before a new SFI scheme is in place would leave some farmers \"in a really difficult financial position\".",

      "Prof Alastair Hay, emeritus professor of environmental toxicology at the University of Leeds said: \"The priority, I imagine, for the crews trying to contain the damage, will be to extinguish the fires and keep vessels afloat. This will reduce the quantity of chemicals entering the water and the risk for wildlife downstream.\"",

      "In terms of mitigation, Dr Karen Purnell, former director of ITOPF - which advises governments on maritime pollution, said the first approach would be to let the jet fuel \"dissipate naturally where possible and avoiding deliberate containment.\"",
      "If any jet fuel did make it to shore, she said: \"Flushing the shoreline to remobilise the fuel and perhaps directing it into absorbent booms or mats for later disposal could be an option.\" But she said the approach would differ depending on the different types of environment, for example whether there were wetlands.",

      "The Food Standards Agency (FSA) is looking at how it can speed up the approval process for lab-grown foods.",
      "Such products are grown from cells in small chemical plants.",
      "UK firms have led the way in the field scientifically but feel they have been held back by the current regulations.",
      "Dog food made from meat that was grown in factory vats went on sale in the UK for the first time last month.",
      "In 2020, Singapore became the first country to authorise the sale of cell-cultivated meat for human consumption, followed by the United States three years later and Israel last year.",
      "However, Italy and the US states of Alabama and Florida have instituted bans.",
      "The FSA is to develop new regulations by working with experts from high-tech food firms and academic researchers.",
      "It says it aims to complete the full safety assessment of two lab-grown foods within the two-year process it is starting.",
      "But critics say that having the firms involved in drawing up the new rules represents a conflict of interest.",
      "The initiative is in response to concerns by UK firms that they are losing ground to competition overseas, where approvals processes take half the time.",
      "Prof Robin May, the FSA's chief scientist, told BBC News that there would be no compromise on consumer safety.",
      "\"We are working very closely with the companies involved and academic groups to work together to design a regulatory structure that is good for them, but at all costs ensures the safety of these products remains as high as it possibly can,\" he said.",
      "But critics such as Pat Thomas, director of the campaign group Beyond GM, are not convinced by this approach.",
      "\"The companies involved in helping the FSA to draw up these regulations are the ones most likely to benefit from deregulation and if this were any other type of food product, we would be outraged by it,\" she said.",
      "The science minister, Lord Vallance, took issue with the process being described as \"deregulation\".",
      "\"It is not deregulation, it is pro-innovation regulation,\" he told BBC News.",
      "\"It is an important distinction, because we are trying to get the regulation aligned with the needs of innovation and reduce some of the bureaucracy and duplication.\"",
      "Lab-grown foods are grown into plant or animal tissue from tiny cells. This can sometimes involve gene editing to tweak the food's properties. The claimed benefits are that they are better for the environment and potentially healthier.",
      "The government is keen for lab-grown food firms to thrive because it hopes they can create new jobs and economic growth.",
      "The UK is good at the science, but the current approvals process is much slower than in other countries. Singapore, the US and Israel in particular have faster procedures.",
      "Ivy Farm Technologies in Oxford is ready to go with lab-grown steaks, made from cells taken from Wagyu and Aberdeen Angus cows.",
      "The firm applied for approval to sell its steaks to restaurants at the beginning of last year. Ivy Farm's CEO, Dr Harsh Amin, explained that two years was a very long time to wait.",
      "\"If we can shorten that to less than a year, while maintaining the very highest of Britain's food safety standards, that would help start-up companies like ours to thrive.\"",
      "Dr Alicia Graham has a similar story. Working at Imperial College, London's Bezos centre in west London, she has found a way to grow an alternative to sugar. It involves introducing a gene found in a berry into yeast. This process enables her to produce large amounts of the crystals that make it taste sweet.",
      "It doesn't make you fat, she says, and so is a potential sweetener and healthy substitute in fizzy drinks.",
      "In this case I am allowed to taste it. It was incredibly sweet and slightly sour and fruity, reminding me of lemon sherbet. But Dr Graham's firm, MadeSweetly, is not allowed to sell it until it gets approval.",
      "\"The path to getting approval is not straightforward,\" she tells me.",
      "\"They are all new technologies, which are not easy for the regulator to keep up with. But that means that we don't have one specific route to product approval, and that is what we would like.\"",
      "The FSA says it will complete a full safety assessment of two lab-grown foods within the next two years and have the beginnings of a faster and better system for applications for approvals of new lab-grown foods.",
      "Prof May of the FSA says the purpose of working with experts from the companies involved as well as academics is to get the science right.",
      "\"It can be quite complex, and it is critical that we understand the science to make sure the foods are safe before authorising them.\"",
      "But Ms Thomas says that these high-tech foods may not be as environmentally friendly as they are made out to be as it takes energy to make them and that in some cases their health benefits are being oversold.",
      "\"Lab-grown foods are ultimately ultra-processed foods and we are in an era where we are trying to get people to eat fewer ultra-processed foods because they have health implications,\" he said.",
      "\"And it is worth saying that these ultra-processed foods have not been in the human diet before.\"",

      "Athena touched down on the lunar South Pole shortly after 1730GMT (1230EST) on Thursday, but it later was revealed the craft had landed on its side.",
      "It was supposed to spend 10 days searching for water ice, but the position of its solar panels and the cold temperatures of the rocky region mean it cannot recharge.",
      "Intuitive Machines partnered with US space agency Nasa to explore whether humans can live on the Moon.",
      "\"With the direction of the sun, the orientation of the solar panels, and extreme cold temperatures in the crater, Intuitive Machines does not expect Athena to recharge,\" the company said in a statement about the mission called IM-2.",
      "Last year Intuitive Machines' first spacecraft also landed on its side, breaking a leg.",
      "It is unlikely that the instruments on board can now be used, including a drill to penetrate the lunar soil, a hopping robot to explore a shadowed crater, and the first lunar antenna.",
      "\"Clearly the mission can only have achieved a fraction of its science goals,\" says Dr Simeon Barber, lunar scientist at the Open University.",
      "But the ambitious mission still achieved milestones in ongoing exploration of the Moon.",
      "Athena made it further south than any other lander, reaching the Mons Mouton region which is a flat-topped mountain about 100 miles (160km) from the South Pole.",
      "It is considered a difficult and risky area to land in.",
      "The sun is low in the sky and casts shadow that can confuse landers trying to touch down. And the amount of sunlight reaching the craft can limit how much electricity it produces in its solar panels.",
      "Radio communications from Earth are also more difficult.",
      "And Dr Barber says some of the instruments are likely to have been turned on briefly on Thursday, including the drill and a mass spectrometer that could identify chemicals in gases released from the lunar soil.",
      "That is likely to generate some useful scientific information, he says.",
      "The shortcomings of IM-2 are in contrast to the successful landing of a different private craft on Sunday by the company Firefly Aerospace in a different area of the Moon.",
      "Nasa wants to send four astronauts to the Moon in 2027 in its Artemis programme. Its long-term goal is to take humans to Mars, using the Moon as a stepping stone.",
      "It is working with private companies to drive down the cost of space exploration, but that means accepting a higher risk of failure.",
      "\"In face of setbacks, it requires a steady hand on the tiller and the vision to see the bigger picture\", says Dr Barber, saying that knee-jerk responses to failures could \"cause damage and delay\"."

      "Parents who are worried about their children being on Roblox should not let them use it, the chief executive of the gigantic gaming platform has said.",
      "The site, which is the most popular in the UK among young gamers aged eight to 12, has been dogged by claims of some children being exposed to explicit or harmful content through its games, alongside multiple reported allegations of bullying and grooming.",
      "But its co-founder and CEO Dave Baszucki insisted that the company is vigilant in protecting its users and pointed out that \"tens of millions\" of people have \"amazing experiences\" on the site.",
      "When asked what his message is to parents who don't want their children on the platform, Mr Baszucki said: \"My first message would be, if you're not comfortable, don't let your kids be on Roblox.\"",
      "\"That sounds a little counter-intuitive, but I would always trust parents to make their own decisions,\" he told BBC News in an exclusive interview.",

      "When we showed the Roblox boss these findings, he argued that our example highlighted the comparative safety of Roblox: that people felt they had to take content which might breach Roblox's rules to other platforms.",
      "\"We don't condone any type of image-sharing on our own platform, and you'll see us getting more and more, I think, way beyond where the law is on this type of behaviour,\" Mr Baszucki says.",
      "He admits there is a delicate balance between encouraging friendships between young people, and blocking opportunities for them come to harm, but says he is confident Roblox can manage both.",
      "We also put to him some Roblox game titles that the BBC has discovered were recommended by the platform to an 11 year-old recently, including:",
      "'Late Night Boys And Girls Club RP''Special Forces Simulator'''Squid Game''Shoot down planes\u2026because why not?'",
      "'Late Night Boys And Girls Club RP'",
      "'Special Forces Simulator''",

      "When we asked whether he thought they were appropriate, he said he puts his faith in the platform's age rating systems.",
      "\"One thing that's really important for the way we do things here, is it's not just on the title of the experience, it's literally on the content of the experience as well,\" he says.",

      "How can you keep your child safe online?",
      "Plan to make phone use safer for teens watered down",
      "Mr Baszucki founded the platform with Eric Cassel in 2004 and released it to the public in 2006 \u2013 a year before the first Apple iPhone appeared, heralding the start of the smartphone era.",
      "Mr Baszucki describes his younger self as \"less of a gamer, and more of an engineer\", and the pair's first company was an education software provider called Knowledge Revolution. But they soon noticed that kids weren't only using the product to do their homework.",
      "\"They wanted to play and build stuff. They were making houses or ships or scenery, and they wanted to jump in, and all of that learning was the germination of Roblox,\" he says.",
      "The name Roblox was a mash-up of the words \"robot\" and blocks\" \u2013 and it stuck. The platform grew quickly in popularity \u2013 and there were also early warning signs of its future issues.",
      "Mr Cassel noticed some players \"starting to act out\" and not always behaving in a \"civilised\" way a couple of months after it launched, recalls Mr Baszucki.",
      "He says the roots of building a \"trust and safety system\" therefore began \"very, very early\" and that in those earlier days there were four people acting as safety moderators.",
      "\"It kind of is what launched this safety civility foundation,\" he adds.",
      "But despite attracting decent numbers, it was a year later, when the firm launched its digital currency Robux, that it really started to make money.",
      "Players buy Robux and use it to purchase accessories and unlock content. Content creators now get 70% of the fee, and the store operates on dynamic pricing, meaning popular items cost more.",
      "Mr Baszucki says there was some initial resistance among the leadership team about Roblox becoming more than a hobby for its players, with the introduction of a digital economy.",
      "Robux stayed, and the firm is now worth $41bn (\u00a331bn).",
      "Its share price has fluctuated since it went public in 2021, but overall Roblox shares are worth about one third more than they were six months ago, at the time of writing. Like many big tech firms its value peaked during Covid, when lockdowns meant millions of people were indoors.",
      "Mr Baszucki compares his experience of building Roblox with how Walt Disney may have felt about his creations.",
      "He describes his job as \"a little like having the opportunity he had a long time ago when he was designing the Magic Kingdom\", and is focused on Roblox's ongoing evolution into a Metaverse-style experience where people go about their daily lives in a virtual world, in avatar form.",
      "They have also been public in their ambitions to eventually attract 10% of the world's gamers.",
      "Asked to describe Roblox in three words, he replies: \"The future of communication.\"",

      "Deena Ghazarian had only been in business for a year when the trade policies of President Donald Trump's first term of office sent her company into a tailspin.",
      "It was 2019 and her California-based firm, Austere, had just agreed to supply several big US retailers with its high-end audio and video accessories that are largely manufactured in China.",
      "Then Trump imposed sweeping tariffs on China, and overnight Deena found herself paying a 25% surcharge on every cable and component she imported \u2013 up from zero previously.",
      "She was forced to absorb the costs and for a while thought she would go bust.",
      "\"I literally thought I am going to start and end a business in less than a year,\" she says. \"I had spent all this time, money and effort, and to have something like this blindside you was shocking.\"",
      "The firm pulled through, but like numerous other US businesses it now finds itself in a strikingly similar situation.",
      "Since returning to office in January, Mr Trump has raised tariffs on all goods imported from China by 20%, and put taxes of 25% on Canadian and Mexican products, only to delay some of them until April.",
      "The president says he wants to force these countries to do more to stop flows of illegal drugs and migrants into America, to bring more manufacturing back to the US, and to address what he sees as unfair trade imbalances.",
      "But the duties are much broader in scope than last time, when they were phased in gradually and many products were granted exemptions.",
      "Goods like smartphones, desktop computers and tablets are now incurring tariffs for the first time, while taxes on others have climbed higher.",
      "\"US importers have to pay these taxes not the exporters,\" says Ed Brzytwa, vice president of international trade at the Consumer Technology Association (CTA), a North American trade body that represents more than 1,200 tech firms.",
      "\"It's American businesses and consumers who will suffer.\"",
      "Businesses like Ms Ghazarian's are particularly exposed. China is still the number one supplier of electronic products to the US, with imports totalling $146bn (\u00a3112bn) in 2023, according to official data.",
      "Meanwhile, 87% of US video game console imports came from China that year, 78% of smartphones, 79% of laptops and tablets, and two-thirds of monitors, says the CTA.",
      "Stocks slide as Trump warns of US economy 'transition'",
      "'I will have to raise prices by 10%' - toymakers warn of tariff pain",
      "China retaliates against US tariffs - but it also wants to talk",
      "While many American companies like Austere have diversified their supply chains away from China since Mr Trump's first term, countries such as Thailand, Taiwan and Vietnam still do not offer the same manufacturing capabilities and expertise.",
      "At the same time, the US president is now targeting Mexico - another major electronics supplier. And while domestic manufacturing in the US has increased, partly due to tariffs, it is still limited by higher costs and stricter regulations.",
      "\"Yes, Apple now makes some iPhones in India and [the Taiwanese chipmaker] TSMC has been diversifying to Arizona,\" says Mary Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute in Washington DC.",
      "\"But China is still a massive part of the supply chain. Relationships with new suppliers take time to develop, they are costly to develop.\"",
      "Research suggests that companies pass on a large proportion of the costs of tariffs by putting up prices. Earlier this month Corie Barry, boss of US electronics retailer Best Buy, said that the \"the vast majority\" of the new tariffs will \"probably be passed on to the consumer\" because vendors in the industry have such small margins.",
      "In February, Taiwanese firm Acer said the price of its laptops would likely rise by 10% based on the 10% duties in place on China at the time, while US group HP has warned its profits would be lower because of the tariffs.",
      "Ms Ghazarian says she may have to raise her prices this year, but worries it could backfire. \"There is a price point where the customer is satisfied with the value of goods provided.",
      "\"The moment I shift above that I start to lose customers. High inflation has squeezed Americans.\"",
      "During Mr Trump's first term, companies such as Apple successfully secured exemptions for products, and we may yet see carve-outs.",
      "Insiders have also suggested Mr Trump views tariffs as a negotiating tactic and could ease them if he wins concessions, as he did when China agreed to buy more American goods in a deal reached in 2020.",
      "Fears of a US economic slowdown could also make him change course.",
      "For the time being, though, tensions look likely to escalate. China, Mexico and Canada have vowed to retaliate against any US duties imposed on them, and this week Mr Trump threatened to double tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminium only to row back at the last minute.",
      "He plans to impose \"reciprocal tariffs\" on the rest of the world soon, and threatened tariff increases of up to 60% on Chinese goods while on the campaign trail.",
      "There is a risk this could drive up the price of tech goods around the world if China is forced to relocate manufacturing to countries where labour costs are higher. Moreover, countries may hit back with tariffs on imported US technology.",
      "Ms Ghazarian says she is worried but at least she's prepared this time. Like many other US business-owners she bulk-ordered extra inventory before Mr Trump took office, and is storing it in her east coast warehouse.",
      "She hopes that will get the company through the next year until it can \"pivot\" again.",
      "\"That might mean finding a more cost-effective way to produce the product or doing something completely different. It's frustrating I have to focus on survival rather than growing my business.\"",

      "The Act allows it to covertly compel firms to provide information to law enforcement agencies.",
      "ADP allows users with iCloud accounts and storage to secure photos, notes, voice memos and other data with end to end encryption, meaning no-one but the user - not even Apple - can access it.",

      "\"As we have said many times before, we have never built a backdoor or master key to any of our products, and we never will,\" a spokesperson told the BBC.",
      "Later in February the row escalated, as Apple announced it was pulling ADP in the UK.",
      "Shortly after that, the BBC learnt Apple was taking legal action by appealing to the Investigatory Powers Tribunal to try to overturn the government's demand.",
      "On its website, the Tribunal lists a hearing to be held before its president Lord Justice Singh on Friday afternoon.",
      "The listing makes no mention of Apple or the government, nor has the Tribunal confirmed if they are the parties involved - however a source familiar with the matter has indicated that is the case, as was first reported by Computer Weekly.",
      "In the statement it issued in February, Apple said it regretted the action it felt it had been forced to take.",
      "\"Enhancing the security of cloud storage with end-to-end-encryption is more urgent than ever before,\" it said.",
      "\"Apple remains committed to offering our users the highest level of security for their personal data and are hopeful that we will be able to do so in future in the UK.\"",
      "In a previous statement, a Home Office spokesperson said: \"The UK has a longstanding position of protecting our citizens from the very worst crimes, such as child sex abuse and terrorism, at the same time as protecting people's privacy.",
      "\"The UK has robust safeguards and independent oversight to protect privacy and privacy is only impacted on an exceptional basis, in relation to the most serious crimes and only when it is necessary and proportionate to do so.\""

      "Shipments of Apple Watches fell by 19% in that period, Counterpoint says.",
      "It blames the slump on a lack of new features in Apple's latest devices, and the fact a rumoured high-end Ultra 3 model never materialised.",
      "\"The biggest driver of the decline was North America, where the absence of the Ultra 3 and minimal feature upgrades in the S10 lineup led consumers to hold back purchases,\" said Counterpoint senior research analyst Anshika Jain.",
      "Apple was also hit with sales and import bans in the US in late 2023 and early 2024 over a disputed patent regarding blood oxygen level monitoring - which Ms Jain says also contributed to lower sales figures in the first half of 2024.",
      "It retained 22% of market share in the final three months of 2024, down from 25% a year earlier.",
      "\"We've been through a period where the smartwatch has gone from being a new and exciting gadget, to something now that's stabilising - the feature set isn't changing very dramatically year over year,\" said Leo Gebbie, principal analyst at CCS Insight.",

      "Sales in China also grew from 19% of the market to 25% in the year from the last quarter of 2023.",
      "This was the first time it recorded more smartwatch sales than India or North America, according to Counterpoint.",
      "The Chinese manufacturers also appeared to tap into another trend - the growing popularity of smartwatches for children, the only segment of the market to grow in 2024.",
      "Imoo, known in China as \"Little Genius\", specialises in children's smart watches and saw a 22% rise in shipments.",
      "\"The kids' smart watch segment is gaining traction as parents are concerned for their children's safety, and they desire to track and stay constantly connected with their children,\" Counterpoint's Balbir Singh said.",

      "Its Smart Band activity trackers sell for a fraction of the price of rivals made by Apple and Samsung.",
      "\"We're seeing the large consumer electronics players like Apple and Samsung really just look to drive a way higher margin and not engage in the price war,\" said Mr Gebbie.",
      "\"Xiaomi has done a really good job of selling devices, particularly in regions like southern and eastern Europe where that greater affordability tends to resonate a lot more strongly with customers.\"",
      "Another large contributor to the global sales drop was India, which fell from 30% of the market to 23%.",
      "He said this was partly because of a \"bubble\" in ultra-cheap devices from Indian manufacturers which has now burst.",
      "\"We read and saw a lot in terms of complaints about the quality of devices, with people being unhappy with them,\" he said.",

      "So the engineering challenge is how to make more, for less. \"This was our Mission Impossible,\" Mr Tang said. His company found that the robotic arm used to move chess pieces was hugely expensive to produce and would drive the price up to around $40,000.",
      "So, they tried using AI to help do the work of engineers and enhance the manufacturing process. Mr Tang claims that has driven the cost down to $1,000.",
      "\"This is innovation,\" he says. \"Artificial engineering is now integrated into the manufacturing process.\"",

    "summary": "Despite opposition investors are still looking at deep-sea mining technology.",
    "story": [
      "There's one. And another. This robot was hunting for rocks. A three-pronged claw descended from above and plucked a stone off the seabed.",
      "All the while, the autonomous machine's on-board camera scanned for creatures that might be resting on those rocks, to avoid snatching an innocent lifeform from its habitat.",
      "The test, carried out in a harbour in November, demonstrated one approach to mining for polymetallic nodules, potato-sized lumps containing metals scattered on the seabed in vast quantities, in much deeper parts of the ocean.",
      "Such metals are sought-after for use in renewable energy devices and batteries, for example. But deep-sea mining is a controversial means of obtaining them because of its potentially significant environmental impacts.",
      "\"We felt that a vehicle that used AI to look for life and avoid it could have much less of an environmental footprint,\" explains Oliver Gunasekara, co-founder and chief executive of Impossible Metals.",
      "The firm's system is 95% accurate at detecting lifeforms of 1mm or greater in size, he says.",
      "The robot's arms are similar to those that pick and place items in automated warehouses \u2013 they are optimised for speed. Plus, each claw kicks up a relatively small puff of sediment as it plucks its target off the seafloor. Impossible Metals aims to further reduce this disturbance.",
      "Such a system is not likely to convince everyone that deep-sea mining is a good idea, however.",
      "\"Mining would by its nature remove the very substrate of life in and on the deep seafloor, no matter the technology,\" says Jessica Battle, who leads the global no deep-seabed mining initiative at the WWF.",
      "Deep-sea mining is highly controversial partly because the deep seabed is more or less untouched and still relatively poorly understood. \"If you're not sure what's down there, then leave it alone,\" says John Childs at Lancaster University. \"That's been the widespread position from science [to date].\"",
      "Scars left by mining experiments in the past, using older, highly disruptive technologies, have been severe.",
      "In 1979, deep-sea mining equipment made large tracks in one part of the Pacific Ocean seabed and these remain there today, researchers say. Wildlife has reportedly still not fully returned to the area 40 years later.",
      "Opposition to deep-sea mining has been fierce enough to scupper entire companies.",
      "Nautilus Minerals sought to begin deep-sea mining work in the late 2010s. After protests and financial upsets, the company went bankrupt in 2019.",
      "Minerals found on the deep seabed including manganese, nickel, cobalt, gold and silver are all considered important materials for the green energy transition.",
      "Currently, such metals are sourced from mines on land, which themselves have a significant environmental impact.",
      "No commercial deep sea mining operations are underway today, though that could change this year if the first set of international regulations governing these activities is published, possibly in July.",
      "Mr Gunasekara's firm is currently building a larger version of its robot in a 20-foot shipping container, big enough to carry out commercial-scale operations. It will have 12 robot arms with grabbing claws.",
      "He adds that \"hundreds\" of such bots would need to harvest the seabed at a time, bringing the spoils to a ship on the surface. The recovered nodules would then be transported to processing sites on land.",
      "Unlike some other methods, in which heavy subsea equipment is tethered to support ships, Impossible Metals' vessel would not have to remain in a precise spot for a long period, meaning its engines would not create as much noise. This would lessen the impact on wildlife, claims Mr Gunasekara.",
      "He also argues that deep-sea mining would reduce the need for mining on land: \"Anyone that doesn't want to do deep-sea mining is implicitly saying we need to do more land-based mining.\"",
      "Jovana Jovanova at Delft University of Technology in The Netherlands is working on a different robot arm system that could gather metals from the seafloor. She stresses that those working in this field should seek to develop technology \"in sync\" with the environment.",
      "Some deep-sea materials might be removed using more invasive methods, however. Seabed Solutions, a Norwegian firm, is working on a saw-based device to extract mineral-containing crusts or layers. The company says it is trying to reduce the volume of sediment disturbed by this process.",
      "\"You shield the cutting area and you ensure that it is under pressure,\" says managing director B\u00e5rd Brekke J\u00f8rgensen. \"You have a suction head interface [on] your cutting tool.\"",
      "The Metals Company, a firm launched by former Nautilus Minerals investor Gerard Barron, is working on a different technique.",
      "Mr Barron, chief executive, is bullish about the company's prospects, despite the protests and lawsuits his firm has faced.  Among the problems is a class action lawsuit filed by investors over the company's reporting of proceeds from a partner company in 2023 -  Mr Barron says \"there's absolutely nothing in it\".",
      "Those calling for a moratorium on deep-sea mining are \"virtue signalling\" he says, adding that the new Trump administration in the US may help his company.",
      "\"We have many of our best supporters assuming very important roles in the new administration,\" says Mr Barron.",
      "The Metals Company intends to file an application for deep-sea mining in the Pacific Ocean with the International Seabed Authority (ISA) later this year. The ISA is yet to confirm how it would regulate such activities.",
      "Dutch company Allseas, which is working with Mr Barron's firm, has developed mining machinery for scooping polymetallic nodules off the seabed and sending them to a support ship on the surface.",
      "Trials of the system in 2022 retrieved more than 3,000 tonnes of nodules, The Metals Company says.",
      "The Metals Company's own tests suggest that the debris plumes created by this process would spread for hundreds of metres from the mining area, rather than many kilometres, and that deposited sediment gradually clears over time.",
      "Claims that sediment would be distributed many kilometres from the mining area were \"total nonsense\", says Mr Barron.",
      "Jeroen Hagelstein, a spokesman for Allseas, says his firm has adjusted the force of waterjets used to dislodge nodules in an attempt to minimise sediment disturbance.",
      "Some sediment brought to the surface with the nodules gets dumped back into the ocean.  Mr Hagelstein says his colleagues are considering whether to return it at a depth of three or four kilometres rather than discarding it at the surface, though he adds that this may require too much energy to adequately reduce the overall environmental impact.",
      "Mr Barron acknowledges that his firm's machinery might affect lifeforms living on or around the nodules. \"If you're a sponge sitting on a nodule and we come and collect you, there will be an impact,\" he says. Though he points out that many nodules would also be left behind.",
      "Ann Vanreusel at Ghent University has studied deep-sea wildlife. She says the sought-after polymetallic nodules are themselves home to some creatures, which use them as a substrate. So even if mining machinery created zero sediment disturbance, pollution and noise, removing nodules would still impact the ecosystem.",
      "Dr Childs also mentions the importance of the deep sea to many indigenous cultures. Mining could interfere with this, he suggests.",
      "And there's another issue. The market for metals metals sought by deep-sea mining firms is notoriously volatile, meaning the business case for deep-sea mining may not be as strong as some hope, says Lea Reitmeier at the London School of Economics.",

      "Russia is ready for a halt in fighting, says Vladimir Putin, but \"there are nuances\". Those nuances that he laid out ahead of talks with US envoys at the Kremlin are so key to his thinking they could scupper any hope of a 30-day ceasefire.",
      "They are demands that he has had throughout Russia's full-scale invasion. And for Ukraine and its Western partners. many of them are going to prove unacceptable or impossible to fulfil.",
      "\"We agree with the proposals to cease hostilities,\" he started positively, only to add: \"This cessation must be such that it would lead to long-term peace and eliminate the root causes of this crisis.\"",
      "Nobody would disagree with the need for long-term peace, but Putin's idea of the root causes of the war revolve around Ukraine's desire to exist as a sovereign state, beyond Russia's orbit.",
      "Ukraine wants to be part of Nato and the European Union - so much so, it is enshrined in the constitution.",
      "President Trump has already cast doubt on Nato membership, but Putin has repeatedly dismissed the idea of Ukraine as a state at all.",
      "And that underpins many of the nuances he sketched out.",
      "He wants to stop Ukraine from reinforcing its army and replenishing its weapons supply - so there would be no more deliveries from the West. He wants to know who would ensure that was verified.",
      "From the start of this war, Putin has demanded the \"demilitarisation\" of Ukraine, which is anathema to Kyiv and its allies.",

      "Ukraine in maps: Tracking the war in Russia",
      "Would Russia agree to halt rearming or mobilising its forces? That seems implausible and there was no hint of any concession on his part, as he addressed reporters in the Kremlin.",
      "Putin has just come back in bullish mood from the front line in Kursk, a Russian border region that has been partially occupied since last August by Ukraine.",
      "Russia has the upper hand in Kursk. Putin clearly feels he is negotiating from a position of strength and doesn't want to lose it.",
      "\"If we stop military actions for 30 days, what does that mean? Will everyone who is there leave the battle?\"",
      "Russia's defence ministry announced on Thursday that its forces had now taken full control of the biggest city the Ukrainians had managed to seize, Sudzha. Putin says all the Ukrainians have left is a wedge, so why would Russia stop now?",
      "\"If a physical blockade occurs in the coming days, no-one will be able to leave at all. There will be only two options \u2013 to surrender or die.\"",
      "The same applied to the whole of the 1,000km (620-mile) front line, where he claimed the situation on the ground was changing rapidly, with Russian troops \"advancing in practically all areas\".",
      "That is not the case, as most of the front is at a stalemate, even if Russia has had some recent success in the east.",
      "Putin believes a 30-day ceasefire would deprive Russia of its advantage and enable the Ukrainians to regroup and rearm.",
      "\"What are our guarantees that nothing like that will be allowed to happen,\" he asked rhetorically.",
      "As yet, no mechanism has been offered to ensure that the terms of any ceasefire would hold.",
      "Although 15 Western countries have tentatively offered peacekeeping troops, they would only come in the event of a final peace deal, not a ceasefire.",
      "Not that Russia would allow that arrangement anyway.",
      "Given all these \"nuances\", Putin appeared to be sceptical of how a ceasefire could benefit Russia, especially when his troops were on the front foot. His entire outlook was \"based on how the situation on the ground develops\".",
      "Putin was meeting Trump's envoys on Moscow late on Thursday, notably Steve Witkoff.",
      "Whatever happens in those talks, Putin knows that ultimately, his most important conversation will be with the president.",
      "\"I think we need to talk to our American colleagues\u2026 maybe have a phone call with President Trump and discuss this with him,\" he said.",
      "But Putin was setting out his stall ahead of those conversations, with a message that the road to a ceasefire was littered with conditions that would be almost impossible to meet."

      "Shortly before he landed in the Netherlands, the 79-year-old unapologetically defended his bloody \"war on drugs\" for which the ICC says there are \"reasonable grounds\" to charge him with murder as a crime against humanity.",

      "The official toll stands at 6,000, though activists believe the real figure could run into the tens of thousands.",

      "His supporters allege that the ICC is being used as a political tool by the country's current president Ferdinand Marcos who has publicly fallen out with the powerful Duterte family.",
      "The ICC is a court of last resort designed to hold the most powerful to account when domestic courts are unable or unwilling to do so. But this case is a reminder of the extent to which it depends on state co-operation in order to fulfil its mandate - it effectively has no power to arrest people without the co-operation of the countries they are in, which is most often refused.",
      "In the case of Duterte, chances that he would ever be prosecuted by the ICC seemed unthinkable even in 2022, when his daughter, Vice-President Sara Duterte, allied with Marcos to create the powerful \"uniteam\" that swept presidential elections.",
      "Up until a few months ago, Marcos had dismissed the idea of co-operating with the ICC.",
      "But the pace at which Duterte was served an arrest warrant and extradited shows that when political winds shift, those once considered untouchable can find themselves touching down in The Hague.",
      "The whole process of his extradition -  from his detention in Manila to his arrival in The Hague - has been documented on social media by his daughter Kitty and Duterte himself through his aide. His plane was the most tracked on flight radar.",

      "Duterte's arrest now sends a strong signal that even powerful individuals may be held accountable for their actions, potentially deterring future abuses.",
      "His case has also reignited debate about the ICC's role in relation to national sovereignty, a concern often raised by non-member states like the United States, Russia, and China.",
      "The court depends on its 128 members to fund and be the operational arm of this judicial body.",
      "So Duterte's headline-making arrival, followed by his first night in custody at The Hague, offer the court a much-needed win.",
      "After serving two high-profile arrest warrants \u2013 one for the Russian president Vladimir Putin, and another for Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the war in Gaza \u2013 which are unlikely to be enforced, the arrival of Duterte will be put forth as proof the court is capable of bringing those accused of the gravest atrocities to face justice.",
      "It is a litmus test for the ICC's ability to function effectively in an increasingly polarised climate.",
      "ICC prosecutor Karim Khan was recently sanctioned by Donald Trump over the arrest warrant issued for Benjamin Netanyahu.",

      "The book, Careless People by Sarah Wynn-Williams, who used to be the company's global public policy director, includes a series of critical claims about what she witnessed during her seven years working at Facebook.",
      "Facebook's parent company, Meta, says the ruling - which orders her to stop promotions \"to the extent within her control\" - affirms that \"the false and defamatory book should never have been published\".",
      "The UK publisher Macmillan says it is \"committed to upholding freedom of speech\" and Ms Wynn-Williams' \"right to tell her story\".",
      "It told the BBC that she had been due to do \"extensive media\" in the UK and internationally and \"has been prevented from doing so\".",

      "All previous disparaging comments \"to the extent within her control\" must also be retracted, the ruling also said.",
      "The book is former New Zealand diplomat Ms Wynn-Williams' account of joining Facebook in 2011 and watching it grow from a \"front row seat\".",
      "Her allegations include that executives had worked \"hand in glove\" with the Chinese government on potential ways of allowing Beijing to censor and control content in exchange for access to the lucrative market.",
      "Meta disputes the allegations contained in the book. Regarding China, it says it is \"no secret we were once interested\" in operating services there. \"We ultimately opted not to go through with the ideas we'd explored.\"",
      "Ms Wynn-Williams has also filed a whistleblower complaint with the US markets regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), alleging Meta misled investors - which Meta also denies. The BBC has reviewed the complaint.",
      "During the emergency hearing the arbitrator, Nicholas Gowen, found Meta had provided enough evidence that Ms Wynn-Williams had potentially violated her severance contract. She did not personally attend Thursday's hearing.",
      "In his ruling, Mr Gowan said Meta would suffer \"immediate and irreparable loss\" in the absence of a temporary ruling in the case.",

      "Following the decision, Meta spokesperson Andy Stone said in a post on X: \"This ruling affirms that Sarah Wynn-Williams' false and defamatory book should never have been published.\"",
      "Careless People was released in the US, where it is number six on the Amazon chart, on Tuesday. It was published in the UK on Thursday.",
      "In a statement, a spokeswoman for Macmillan said: \"As publishers, we are committed to upholding freedom of speech and her right to tell her story. Due to legal process instituted by Meta, the author has been prevented from continuing to participate in the book's publicity.\""

      "\"Given the level of scrutiny that will happen if she ever applies for a visa again, I'll be surprised if she even bothers,\" Burke said in a statement.",
      "Ms Jones's \"appalling\" behaviour could have caused severe harm to the wombats, conservationists say.",
      "The Wombat Protection Society said it was shocked to see the \"mishandling of a wombat joey in an apparent snatch for 'social media likes'\".",
      "\"[She] then placed the vulnerable baby back onto a country road - potentially putting it at risk of becoming roadkill,\" it noted in its statement, adding that it remains unclear if the joey reunited with its mother.",

      "Wombats, which are native to Australia, are a legally protected species across the country. Baby wombats share a strong bond with their mothers, and any separation can be distressing and harmful, conservationists say.",

      "\"It's just unacceptable, and we're glad she's being called to account. Snatching a screaming baby wombat from their mother is not just appalling, it's very possibly illegal under state or national laws,\" Ms Milthrope said.",
      "Some experts believe Ms Jones broke the law because Australia prohibits people from harming or taking native wildlife.",

      "The intelligence service had indications that the Wuhan Institute of Virology had been carrying out experiments where viruses are modified to become more transmissible to humans for research, they say.",

      "Why Covid lab-leak theory is so disputed",
      "CIA says lab leak most likely source of Covid outbreak",
      "The WHO investigation in early 2021 saw a team of scientists fly to Wuhan on a mission to look into the source of the pandemic.",
      "After spending 12 days there, which included a visit to the laboratory, the team concluded the lab-leak theory was \"extremely unlikely\".",
      "But many have since questioned their findings, with one prominent group of scientists criticising the WHO report for not taking the lab-leak theory seriously enough - it was dismissed in a few pages of a several-hundred-page report.",
      "Supporters of the natural origin hypothesis - which was backed in the WHO report - say Covid-19 emerged in bats and then jumped to humans, most likely through another animal, or \"intermediary host\".",
      "This hypothesis was widely accepted at the start of the pandemic, but as time has worn on, scientists have not found a virus in either bats or another animal that matches the genetic make-up of Covid-19, leading some to doubt the theory."

    "summary": "Ukrainian soldiers on the battlefield say they don't expect to see the war end any time soon.",
    "story": [
      "While Moscow considers a temporary ceasefire, its military machine continues to press its advantage on the front line. Diplomatic negotiations can be slow and difficult. But on the battlefield, they can be measured in lost lives.",
      "At a military hospital in eastern Ukraine, the injured arrive by ambulance in waves.  Here, there's an obvious disconnect between diplomacy taking place, far from the fighting, and the brutality of battle \u2013 where human bodies are still being smashed, shredded and scarred by bombs and bullets.",
      "We watch another two dozen injured Ukrainian soldiers being loaded on to a bus to be taken to a hospital in Dnipro \u2013 some walking wounded, others carried on stretchers. The bus is  fitted out with medical equipment to monitor the injured as they're driven fast over potholed roads.",
      "The men on board are the less severely wounded. Most have been hit by shrapnel. The cause is often what's now the most prolific and feared weapon on the front line \u2013 drones.",
      "None of those we talked to believe this war will be ending any time soon. Thirty-year-old Maksym is on a stretcher with an IV drip to relieve some of the pain from several shrapnel wounds across his body. He says he'd heard the talk of a temporary 30-day ceasefire, but adds: \"I consider Putin a murderer and murderers don't agree so easily.\"",
      "Vova, who's sitting up nearby, says: \"I don't believe it.\" He says that near the besieged city of Pokrovsk, they were facing Russian storm attacks every single day. \"I doubt there will be a truce,\" he tells me.",
      "Another soldier named Maksym says this is the second time he has been injured. \"I don't believe there will be a ceasefire,\" he says. \"I had a lot of friends who are not with us any more.",
      "\"I would like to believe that all will be good. But you can't trust Russia. Never.\"",
      "The large medical bus is operated by Ukraine's Volunteer Army Medical Battalion \u2013 known as the Hospitallers. They transport scores of injured soldiers every day.",
      "Sofiia, a 22-year-old medical student, has been working with the team for the last 18 months. She too is sceptical about the chances of a ceasefire: \" I cannot believe it, but I really wish it would happen,\" she says.",
      "She tells me that when she first heard the news that the US and Ukraine had agreed to press for a ceasefire, Russian drones were flying over their base, being engaged by Ukrainian air defences. To her, talk of peace is from a parallel universe.",
      "Sofiia says \"at least it's good that Ukraine and America are talking again\".  But as for hopes of any ceasefire, she points to the recent past.",
      "\"Looking at all the ceasefire calls that we had in the past, those didn't work. How is this going to work?\" she asks.",
      "Her fellow medic, Daniel, joined the Hospitallers from Sweden. He says he understands what it's like when a smaller nation is attacked by its giant neighbour. His grandfather fought for Finland against Russia during World War Two. History counts.",
      "When Daniel first arrived in Ukraine, he used to ask injured soldiers  what they would do after the war. He doesn't any more. \"No-one wants to answer that,\" he says, \"because they don't want to be disappointed. They don't dare to hope.\"",
      "Daniel's not ruling out a ceasefire. But he adds: \"You can't trust Putin to do anything that's not beneficial to Putin.\"",
      "Ukraine has plenty of bitter experience of negotiating with Russia. France and Germany brokered ceasefires in 2014 and 2015, when Russian-backed forces first took parts of eastern Ukraine and Crimea. They didn't work. Nor did they deter Russia from carrying out its full-scale invasion of Ukraine eight years later.",
      "Why did Putin's Russia invade Ukraine?",
      "Why did Putin's Russia invade Ukraine?",
      "There may be talk of peace, but the men of Ukraine's 68th Jaeger Brigade are still preparing for war. We watch as they rehearse their drills to evacuate an injured soldier under fire. Most have already had to do it for real.",
      "In the distance, we can hear the rumble of artillery. It's just 10 miles to the frontline where they'll soon be returning soon.",
      "They've heard little positive news in recent days. Ukrainian forces are being overrun in Kursk. In August last year, that surprise offensive into Russian territory seemed like a move of tactical brilliance \u2013 boosting morale. Now it's in danger of becoming a major strategic setback.",
      "Kursk may soon no longer be a bargaining chip for future negotiations, but a heavy burden, with the loss of prized Ukrainian equipment and life.",
      "One of the few positives is that the US resuming its military support. That matters to the 67th Brigade, who operate American made equipment. They're conducting  their drills with a US-supplied MaxxPro armoured vehicle.",
      "Ivan, the driver, who wears a small American patch on his uniform, says he's relieved the Trump administration has now agreed to reverse the block. His vehicle needs regular repairs. \"I would like them to keep helping,\" he says.",
      "But Ivan is still unsure as to whether President Trump can be trusted.",
      "\"I have doubts,\" he says.  As for trusting President Putin, he replies: \"No. Never.\" Here, even a temporary ceasefire feels like a long way off."

    "published": "Thu, 13 Mar 2025 01:16:05 GMT",
    "summary": "Zimbabwe's leader faces a backlash from key allies over efforts to extend his time in office.",
    "story": [
      "A long convoy of armoured personnel tanks rolling through a Harare neighbourhood sparked concerns - for a brief moment - that a military coup was afoot in Zimbabwe.",
      "\"What's going on in Zimbabwe?\" one person posted on social media. Another said: \"The last time this happened there was a coup.\"",
      "Government spokesman Nick Mangwana was quick to allay the public's fears, explaining the tanks were in the capital that mid-February morning as part of a scheduled exercise to test equipment and were \"nothing to be concerned about\".",
      "Yet the chatter and speculation continued, revealing much about the state of the country.",
      "Ahead of the routine military drill, President Emmerson Mnangagwa had, for the first time since becoming president in 2017, faced harsh criticism about his leadership from within his Zanu-PF party with calls for him to step down.",
      "The accusations evoked memories of the lead-up to the coup that toppled his predecessor, long-time leader Robert Mugabe.",
      "He had come to power in 1980 as the revolutionary hero who ended decades of white-minority rule. But his demise was heralded when veterans of the 1970s war of independence withdrew their support for him.",
      "It was a war veteran and senior Zanu-PF member named Blessed Geza, also known as \"Bombshell\", who launched a verbal offensive against Mnangagwa.",
      "He became angered when some within the party began pushing to change the country's laws to allow for the president to seek a third term.",
      "In a series of often expletive-laden press conferences, gritty-voiced and with a furrowed forehead, he repeatedly called on the 82-year-old president to go or face being removed.",
      "\"I must apologise for helping him come into office,\" said Geza in one press conference aired on social media about the president, who goes by the nickname \"The Crocodile\".",
      "\"As soon as he [Mnangagwa] had the taste of power, he escalated corruption, forgot the people and only remembered his family,\" said the outspoken war veteran, who was then a member of Zanu-PF's powerful central committee.",
      "\"Mnangagwa has also surrendered state power to his wife and children. We sadly see history repeating itself. We can't allow that to happen.\"",
      "Zanu-PF was outraged by his \"disloyal\" remarks - later described as \"amounting to treason\" - forcing Bombshell into hiding from where, through his representatives, he continues to make taunts via social media, hinting at protests.",
      "He is wanted by the police on four charges, including vehicle theft, undermining the authority of the president and inciting public violence.",
      "Blessed Mhlanga, the journalist who first interviewed Bombshell back in November, has also been arrested on charges of transmitting a message that incites violence.",
      "Trouble began brewing over Mnangagwa's ambitions to stay in office during Zanu-PF rallies last year. The president is currently serving his second and final term, which expires in 2028.",
      "The slogan \"2030 he will still be the leader\" began to be uttered by his supporters despite Zimbabwe's constitution limiting presidential terms to two five-year terms.",
      "They argued that he would need to remain in office to complete his \"Agenda 2030\" development programme as he was doing such great work.",
      "A motion was then adopted unanimously at Zanu-PF's conference in December that did not explicitly speak of a third term but sought to extend Mnangagwa's existing term until 2030.",
      "Despite a recent assurance from Mnangagwa that he did intend to step down in three years, the influential Roman Catholic bishops have become involved.",
      "In a pastoral letter last week, Zimbabwe's Catholic Bishops Conference warned that the 2030 debate was a distraction from the things that truly mattered - business closures, high unemployment, rampant corruption and economic policies that favour the wealthy at the expense of ordinary Zimbabweans.",
      "Presidential spokesman George Charamba expressed his disappointment about the clerics' pronouncement, telling the state-run Herald newspaper the matter was now \"dead and buried\".",
      "Nonetheless, Bombshell's message seems to have landed. It has resulted in a purge in Zanu-PF, with the expulsion of Geza and some of his allies.",
      "Yet political analyst Takura Zhangazha says Geza's outburst is unlikely to galvanise crowds to his cause.",
      "These days people are less interested in such political spectacles, he says, unlike at the time of Mugabe's downfall when Zimbabweans, including opposition party supporters, turned out en masse to support the coup - thanking the military and the war veterans.",
      "\"Even that attempt by Geza to talk about corruption and the plight of the workers - it's not going to get people riled up, organising, mobilising. They don't have that capacity or interest any more,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "\"I can promise you there's no repeat of 2017 before 2028,\" he said, adding that Zimbabweans feel they were used in the ousting of Mugabe  and would not be brought out on the streets again for Zanu-PF's internal battles.",
      "This is also because there are splits across the political landscape, including a weak opposition.",
      "Even the war veterans do not represent a united front, Mr Zhangazha says.",
      "Geza has previously voiced support in the succession debate for Vice-President Constantine Chiwenga, the 68-year-old former army chief, but other war veterans are known to back the 2030 agenda.",
      "Political analyst Alexander Rusero says it is important to understand the war veterans' influential role in both Zimbabwe and Zanu-PF.",
      "\"They see themselves as caretakers, so you can't wish away their sentiments,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "However, he believes that the current grievances aired by the likes of Bombshell are prompted more by self-regard than public interest.",
      "\"They feel as if they are excluded from the cake that they should otherwise be enjoying,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "Mr Zhangazha agrees that those who show loyalty within the governing party are likely to benefit from things like tenders, government contracts, access to housing, land and agricultural inputs such as fertiliser and seeds.",
      "For Jameson Timba, the leader of a faction of the main opposition party, the Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC), it all sums up the state of politics in Zimbabwe.",
      "\"You have a country where the economic situation is deteriorating. People can hardly afford more than one meal a day,\" he told the BBC.",
      "\"We have major supermarket chains which are literally closing down,\" he said, referencing the economic woes facing OK Zimbabwe, one of the country's biggest retailers that has been forced to close several big branches with empty shelves in others.",
      "Mr Zhangazha noted the forecast for the fragile economy looks even more grim thanks to the fallout from the recent suspension of USAID.",
      "Timba is still recovering from a five-month stint in jail, spending most of his incarceration sitting on a concrete floor, sharing a cell and toilet with 80 people.",
      "He was arrested in June, along with more than 70 others, for hosting an \"unlawful meeting\" at his private residence when he held a barbeque to mark the International Day of the African Child.",
      "His treatment - and those of his fellow detainees - reflected how opposition politics was being criminalised, he told the BBC.",
      "\"The country is facing challenges. Any leader or government worth his salt would actually call for an early election, to check and determine whether they still have the mandate of the people,\" he said.",
      "\"To do the opposite represents a joke essentially [when] you're talking about extending a term of office.\"",
      "However, there is little chance of an early vote.",
      "For now, Bombshell remains in hiding and the elections are years away - but the succession debate will keep cooking.",

    "summary": "The price of China-made smartphones, TVs and laptops could rise in the US and elsewhere, experts warn.",
    "story": [
      "Deena Ghazarian had only been in business for a year when the trade policies of President Donald Trump's first term of office sent her company into a tailspin.",
      "It was 2019 and her California-based firm, Austere, had just agreed to supply several big US retailers with its high-end audio and video accessories that are largely manufactured in China.",
      "Then Trump imposed sweeping tariffs on China, and overnight Deena found herself paying a 25% surcharge on every cable and component she imported \u2013 up from zero previously.",
      "She was forced to absorb the costs and for a while thought she would go bust.",
      "\"I literally thought I am going to start and end a business in less than a year,\" she says. \"I had spent all this time, money and effort, and to have something like this blindside you was shocking.\"",
      "The firm pulled through, but like numerous other US businesses it now finds itself in a strikingly similar situation.",
      "Since returning to office in January, Mr Trump has raised tariffs on all goods imported from China by 20%, and put taxes of 25% on Canadian and Mexican products, only to delay some of them until April.",
      "The president says he wants to force these countries to do more to stop flows of illegal drugs and migrants into America, to bring more manufacturing back to the US, and to address what he sees as unfair trade imbalances.",
      "But the duties are much broader in scope than last time, when they were phased in gradually and many products were granted exemptions.",
      "Goods like smartphones, desktop computers and tablets are now incurring tariffs for the first time, while taxes on others have climbed higher.",
      "\"US importers have to pay these taxes not the exporters,\" says Ed Brzytwa, vice president of international trade at the Consumer Technology Association (CTA), a North American trade body that represents more than 1,200 tech firms.",
      "\"It's American businesses and consumers who will suffer.\"",
      "Businesses like Ms Ghazarian's are particularly exposed. China is still the number one supplier of electronic products to the US, with imports totalling $146bn (\u00a3112bn) in 2023, according to official data.",
      "Meanwhile, 87% of US video game console imports came from China that year, 78% of smartphones, 79% of laptops and tablets, and two-thirds of monitors, says the CTA.",
      "Stocks slide as Trump warns of US economy 'transition'",
      "'I will have to raise prices by 10%' - toymakers warn of tariff pain",
      "China retaliates against US tariffs - but it also wants to talk",
      "While many American companies like Austere have diversified their supply chains away from China since Mr Trump's first term, countries such as Thailand, Taiwan and Vietnam still do not offer the same manufacturing capabilities and expertise.",
      "At the same time, the US president is now targeting Mexico - another major electronics supplier. And while domestic manufacturing in the US has increased, partly due to tariffs, it is still limited by higher costs and stricter regulations.",
      "\"Yes, Apple now makes some iPhones in India and [the Taiwanese chipmaker] TSMC has been diversifying to Arizona,\" says Mary Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute in Washington DC.",
      "\"But China is still a massive part of the supply chain. Relationships with new suppliers take time to develop, they are costly to develop.\"",
      "Research suggests that companies pass on a large proportion of the costs of tariffs by putting up prices. Earlier this month Corie Barry, boss of US electronics retailer Best Buy, said that the \"the vast majority\" of the new tariffs will \"probably be passed on to the consumer\" because vendors in the industry have such small margins.",
      "In February, Taiwanese firm Acer said the price of its laptops would likely rise by 10% based on the 10% duties in place on China at the time, while US group HP has warned its profits would be lower because of the tariffs.",
      "Ms Ghazarian says she may have to raise her prices this year, but worries it could backfire. \"There is a price point where the customer is satisfied with the value of goods provided.",
      "\"The moment I shift above that I start to lose customers. High inflation has squeezed Americans.\"",
      "During Mr Trump's first term, companies such as Apple successfully secured exemptions for products, and we may yet see carve-outs.",
      "Insiders have also suggested Mr Trump views tariffs as a negotiating tactic and could ease them if he wins concessions, as he did when China agreed to buy more American goods in a deal reached in 2020.",
      "Fears of a US economic slowdown could also make him change course.",
      "For the time being, though, tensions look likely to escalate. China, Mexico and Canada have vowed to retaliate against any US duties imposed on them, and this week Mr Trump threatened to double tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminium only to row back at the last minute.",
      "He plans to impose \"reciprocal tariffs\" on the rest of the world soon, and threatened tariff increases of up to 60% on Chinese goods while on the campaign trail.",
      "There is a risk this could drive up the price of tech goods around the world if China is forced to relocate manufacturing to countries where labour costs are higher. Moreover, countries may hit back with tariffs on imported US technology.",
      "Ms Ghazarian says she is worried but at least she's prepared this time. Like many other US business-owners she bulk-ordered extra inventory before Mr Trump took office, and is storing it in her east coast warehouse.",
      "She hopes that will get the company through the next year until it can \"pivot\" again.",
      "\"That might mean finding a more cost-effective way to produce the product or doing something completely different. It's frustrating I have to focus on survival rather than growing my business.\"",

    "summary": "As the president tries to force Mexico to stop the flow of drugs, cartel members tell Quentin Sommerville they will not be deterred.",
    "story": [
      "The fentanyl dealer from Los Angeles stands to the side watching carefully as a Mexican drugs cartel operative prepares his latest shipment. The synthetic opioid drug is wrapped in foil, sealed in plastic, then dropped with an oily splash into the petrol tank of the trafficker's nondescript car.",
      "Jay, not his real name, had crossed earlier from the US to this cartel-run safe house on the Mexican side of the border. The house looks like any other in this neighbourhood. We are told to drive in quickly and an iron gate closes firmly behind us. They don't cook the drug here, but still they are wary of attracting attention. The men all speak in hushed voices and work quickly.",
      "Their lethal business has become the centre of a global economic dispute. The White House has used fentanyl smuggling through US borders as a key justification for raising tariffs on other nations. US President Donald Trump has also vowed to \"wage war\" on the drug cartels.",
      "The BBC gained rare access to a cartel's operation along the border and travelled to the US to meet their ultimate customers, to see if the international row was doing anything to halt the illegal flow of narcotics.",
      "The men we meet at the safe house are foot-soldiers of a well-known cartel. Two of them loading the car admit to fleeting moments of remorse. But when I ask the man packing the drugs into the fuel tank if he feels guilty about the deaths the pills cause, he sniggers. \"We have family too, of course we feel guilty. But if I stop, it's going to continue. It's not my problem,\" he tells me with a shrug.",
      "The men keep their faces covered while they remove the back seat of the car to gain access to the tank, taking care not to spill petrol. The smell inside the car could alert customs officers on the other side of the border that the fuel tank has been tampered with.",
      "The light green pills, 5,000 in total and marked with an M, are packed tightly - a fraction of what Jay says he sells every week in LA and across the American northwest.",
      "\"I try to get 100,000 pills a week, every week,\" the softly spoken dealer tells me. \"I don't send them in one vehicle. I try to spread it in different cars. That way I minimise my risk of losing all my pills.\"",
      "A 25% tariff on all goods from Mexico was introduced in response to what President Donald Trump said was the unacceptable flow of illegal drugs and illegal immigrants into the US. Some of those tariffs have since been delayed until 2 April.",
      "Defeating the fentanyl trade is one of President Trump's top policy goals, but Jay doesn't rate his chances.",
      "\"Last time he was in office, he tried to do the same thing, and it never happened. There's always going to be a demand. And where's the biggest demand? United States, lucky for us. We're here in the border,\" says Jay with a smile.",
      "There is so much of the drug flowing into the US, most of it coming from Mexico, that according to Jay the price he sells it for in LA has fallen from about $5 or $6 per pill a year ago, to $1.50 now (\u00a31.16).",
      "Mexican police say cartels switched in a big way to fentanyl, which is 50 times more potent than heroin, because unlike other opiates - which are made from the opium poppy - it is completely synthetic and much easier to make and transport.",
      "Fentanyl's strength and addictiveness has left a deep scar on American society: drug overdoses kill more people in the US than guns or car crashes. Fatalities have started to decline, perhaps due in part to the greater availability of Naloxone, a drug that reverses the effects of overdoses of opioids. But the latest figures are still stark: 87,000 overdose deaths (mostly from opioids) from October 2023 to September 2024, down from 114,000 the year before.",
      "In an attempt to stave off punitive tariffs from the White House, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has pledged to send 10,000 National Guard troops to the border. The government has made more than 900 arrests since October in Sinaloa, a major drug trafficking hub. Back in December, Mexico announced its biggest ever fentanyl seizure in the state: more than a tonne of pills. In fact, the country has seized more fentanyl in the past five months than it did in the previous year.",
      "Mexico has also made it harder to import a key ingredient of fentanyl from China, prompting cartels to reduce the strength of each pill - and, in the process, making them less deadly.",
      "And at the end of February, 29 senior drug cartel figures were handed over to the United States, including members of five of the six Mexican crime syndicates that President Trump's administration recently designated as terrorist organisations.",
      "President Sheinbaum also said she had agreed to the CIA increasing surveillance drone operations over Mexican territory in search of fentanyl drugs labs, after the media revealed the covert missions.",
      "Jay acknowledges the dangers of his trade to himself and his customers, but is untroubled.",
      "\"They always try to blame us, that we are the ones that are poisoning American citizens. But they're the biggest users.\"",
      "He coolly insulates himself from responsibility and guilt for the deaths his drugs cause. He claims not to know anyone who has died using his product. \"I only deal with other suppliers,\" he tells me.",
      "The cartels mostly use American citizens to courier their drugs across the border, as they are less likely to be stopped by US Customs and Border Protection. The driver, who goes by the name Charlie, has a US passport. He, too, is mostly indifferent to the suffering the fentanyl epidemic has caused.",
      "\"I need the money,\" he says. When I ask him how many times he has made the drugs run, he replies: \"Too many.\" (I later learn that the 5,000 pills in the fuel tank made it across the border without incident.)",
      "President Sheinbaum has also recently emphasised the demand side of the crisis, saying the US fentanyl crisis began with the legal but \"irresponsible approval\" of painkillers, such as OxyContin, starting in the late 1990s. \"The US government should take responsibility for the opioid-consumption crisis that has caused so many deaths,\" she said at a daily news conference.",
      "On the other side of the border is Derek Maltz, who has spent a lifetime in US drug enforcement. He has been made the interim leader of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and spoke to me just before his appointment.",
      "\"The Mexican cartels need to know that we're coming down there,\" he tells me. \"We're going to have aggressive operations to go after you and your business because you are killing our American kids at record levels and it's not going to be tolerated.\"",
      "Mr Maltz agrees, though, that targeting the cartels alone will not solve the opioid crisis. \"The cartels are very bad guys,\" he tells me. \"They're transnational criminals. They're narco-terrorists. However, there is a bad demand problem in America, we have to address why our population is turning to drugs for help.\"",
      "In Philadelphia's Kensington neighbourhood - dubbed the largest open-air drugs market on the US east coast - Rosalind Pichardo of Operation Save Our City is on to her second Bible. She records in the book's back pages the number of times she has reversed an opioid overdose using the quick-acting drug Naloxone.",
      "For the past six years, the figure totals 2,931. She flicks through the pages and that number written in red comes alive with the memories of the individuals she saved, and the ones she lost.",
      "She begins to list: \"Male in his 60s\u2026 male 30s\u2026 female in her 30s, very thin, no hair.\" Beside each name in this roll-call of fentanyl victims, is the number of doses of Naloxone - sold under the name Narcan - she used to attempt to revive people.",
      "Ms Pichardo, who runs a drop-in centre called Sunshine House, operates what she calls a \"no-judgement zone\". She bristles at the terms like \"addict\", \"junkie\" or \"zombie\", which have been used to describe the people of her neighbourhood. Instead, she calls everyone \"sunshine\".",
      "Some she doesn't remember; others she will never forget.",
      "\"Look at this one, seven years old, two Narcans,\" she points out. Ms Pichardo had been called to a neighbour's house where a woman was holding in her arms a child who had turned blue. Ms Pichardo went inside and the girl was placed on the floor, but as she entered the child's father ran upstairs carrying a bag. \"I'm thinking if that was my child, I'd be running to help the child,\" she recalls.",
      "At first, she thought it might be epilepsy, but she spotted drug scales and plastic baggies on a nearby table. The kid's dad was a drug dealer; the seven-year-old had been poisoned by his stash and overdosed. \"I was livid,\" she says.",
      "Those two doses of Narcan were enough to save the child's life.",
      "On another page, a woman, six months pregnant, two doses of Narcan. She also survived.",
      "In Kensington, drugs are cheap and plentiful, and people shoot up in the open. As she walks the neighbourhood, Ms Pichardo finds people passed out on the pavement, a woman in a stupor with her trousers down, a man lying prone next to a metro turnstile, another man in a wheelchair, his eyes closed and money in his hands.",
      "He, like a growing number of opioid users, has had a limb amputated. A new drug on the street, the animal tranquilliser Xylazine, is being mixed with fentanyl. It leads to open wounds which become infected. The air is rank in places.",
      "John White is 56 years old, and for 40 of those years he has struggled with addiction. At Sunshine House, Ms Pichardo serves him a bowl of homemade soup.",
      "\"I've been in this city all my life,\" he says. \"The fentanyl and opioid epidemic is the worst I've ever seen. Fentanyl will get you so hooked that you have to get more. So they put it in everything.\"",
      "Mr White had a fentanyl overdose after smoking a joint laced with the drug: it is being added to all kinds of illicit drugs, including heroin, cocaine and marijuana.",
      "Ms Pichardo holds out little hope that even if the fentanyl trade is cut off from Mexico, it will improve people's lives in Kensington.",
      "\"The problem that we have with the war on drugs is - it didn't work then [and] I don't believe it's going to work now,\" she explains.",
      "When the supply of one drug is cut off, another replaces it, she says. \"Once there was heroin, now there's no more. Now there's fentanyl. When there's no fentanyl, now it's going to be Xylazine. So it's like they'll find a way to keep people addicted so that people can make money off of people, off the suffering of people,\" says Ms Pichardo.",
      "Directly across from Sunshine House, a young woman is found collapsed on the pavement, her body splayed across the concrete: she's unresponsive. Ms Pichardo is quickly on the scene, her medical kit by her side, yet again administering Naloxone. The woman is eventually revived - she will survive.",
      "Roz Pichardo returns to Sunshine House, another life saved and another digit to be added to the back pages of her tattered Bible.",

    "published": "Thu, 13 Mar 2025 08:34:22 GMT",
    "summary": "The finance minister's decision to push ahead with tax hikes puts him at odds with coalition partners.",
    "story": [
      "South Africa has entered uncharted waters following deep divisions in the coalition government over the national budget that has finally been tabled after a month-long delay.",
      "This is the view of analysts after Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana's budget drew a backlash from various quarters, including key partners in the coalition government rejecting his proposals for a second time.",
      "The African National Congress (ANC) formed a government of national unity (GNU) with nine other parties after losing its parliamentary majority in elections last year.",
      "And, without the support of its biggest coalition partner, the Democratic Alliance (DA), it will fail to pass the budget unless it rethinks its contentious policies or gets the backing of the biggest opposition parties.",
      "Godongwana was forced to postpone his budget presentation last month after fierce resistance to his plan to raise value-added-tax (VAT), which would have seen the prices of goods go up at a time when South Africans are hard-hit by the cost-of-living crisis.",
      "This delay sent shockwaves through South Africa at the time, as it was the first time this had happened since the end of white-minority rule in 1994.",
      "US cuts send South Africa's HIV treatment 'off a cliff'",
      "Coalition is a landmark moment for a humbled ANC",
      "Is it checkmate for South Africa after Trump threats?",
      "Following a series of meetings between the parties in government, Godongwana returned on Wednesday to present what he called a \"bold and pragmatic\" budget.",
      "In his revised budget, the minister tried to appease his GNU partners by announcing a reduced VAT increase, to be implemented over a two-year period.",
      "Godongwana had initially proposed increasing VAT from15% to 17%, but has now suggested raising it to 16% in two stages.",
      "The minister says that increasing taxes is necessary to tackle \"persistent spending pressures in health, education, transport and security\".",
      "\"They [other parties] have to make a choice - do we close schools, hospitals or clinics? They have to make that choice. Do we fire people? That is the choice we have to make and that is not a good choice to make,\" Godongwana said.",
      "The minister added that he had opted to target VAT rather than personal and corporate taxes, as the latter two would generate less revenue while \"potentially harming investment, job creation and economic growth\".",
      "Godongwana's revised budget has the support of his party, the ANC, but has failed to appease the DA, which said it would not \"support any increase in taxes, unless those increases were temporary and the ANC agreed to a series of major reforms\" that would grow the economy, reduce waste and create jobs within the next three years.",
      "The impasse has tarnished President Cyril Ramaphosa's much-vaunted reputation as a deal-maker, with only one of his coalition partners - the small Patriotic Alliance (PA) - supporting the budget.",
      "The latest tussle highlights deepening divisions in the fragile coalition government, as the two biggest parties have locked horns over key issues since its formation.",
      "This includes a controversial land law, which allows for private property to be seized by the government in certain cases, without any compensation offered to owners.",
      "The DA is challenging the law in court, arguing that it is unconstitutional and threatens property rights in South Africa.",
      "The two biggest opposition parties - former President Jacob Zuma's Umkhonto weSizwe (MK) and Julius Malema's Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) - have also rejected the budget, saying the proposed tax hikes would hit the poor the hardest.",
      "This leaves the ANC in a difficult situation, at it needs the support of at least one of the three other biggest parties to pass the budget.",
      "An analyst at South Africa's Wits University, Thokozile Madonko, says the deadlock over the budget has left South Africa in \"uncharted waters\".",
      "She tells the BBC that the role of parliament will now be \"absolutely critical\" as it either accepted, changed or rejected the budget.",
      "And while in the past the ANC could always push through its policies, this is no longer the case.",
      "This will force it to strike a deal with other parties or risk seeing the budget being voted down - something that could result in the collapse of the coalition government.",
      "Ms Madonko criticised Godongwana's decision to take the \"laziest option\" by proposing an increase in VAT, which will affect the entire population, rather than targeting the richest section of the population by introducing a \"wealth tax\" on them.",
      "Another expert, Adrian Saville, said the budget was a \"folly\" as the minister repeated many old promises to promote economic growth and create jobs in a country where unemployment is standing at more than 30%.",
      "\"Those are words. Give us the numbers [and] tell us what you intend to do so that when we meet again in a year's time, we know whether you've been successful or if you've fallen short,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "Godongwana has long been seen as a steady pair of hands, commanding the respect of both the business sector and the trade union movement.",
      "But his credibility has taken a knock following the crisis over the budget. He now faces the challenge of salvaging his reputation by steering the budget through parliament - or people would increasingly question his suitability for the post.",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y42125239o",
    "published": "Wed, 12 Mar 2025 14:18:41 GMT",
    "summary": "The US is expected to present a 30-day ceasefire proposal to Russia in the coming days.",
    "story": [
      "Hours of talks in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday ended with a joint US-Ukraine statement backing an American-proposed 30-day ceasefire in the war with Russia.",
      "Trump administration officials see this as a major breakthrough towards the foreign policy goals of a leader who campaigned on a promise to end the war.",
      "For Ukraine, the joint announcement amounts to a critical reprieve for President Volodymyr Zelensky after a humiliating attack in the Oval Office a fortnight ago by Trump and Vice-President JD Vance.",
      "For Moscow, it shifts the onus to them, while the war itself intensifies.",
      "But so far only one side in the war - the one dependent on the Americans - has signed up. And the proposal is only eight paragraphs long, with meagre details beyond the desire to rapidly press ahead.",
      "So does it make a ceasefire plausible? And if so, can it end the war after Russia's full-scale invasion three years ago in a just and sustainable way, and on terms that keep the region and the world safe?",
      "Statement: \"Ukraine expressed readiness to accept the U.S. proposal to enact an immediate, interim 30-day ceasefire, which can be extended by mutual agreement of the parties, and which is subject to acceptance and concurrent implementation by the Russian Federation. The United States will communicate to Russia that Russian reciprocity is the key to achieving peace.\"",
      "Analysis: The key word here is \"immediate,\" which doesn't leave any doubt: Trump wants the guns to fall silent now. His sense of urgency, however, has often led to concerns in Europe.",
      "Many fear that rushing the desired outcome without first working out the terms takes the military pressure off Moscow as the invading power and could lead to a truce being exploited.",
      "They argue it empowers the occupying force.",
      "The fear is of ultimately leading Ukraine into an effective surrender. The theory is that Russia - the bigger, more populous and militarily more self-sufficient power - could use a truce without first establishing concessions to consolidate its forces, string out a negotiation process and wait to see what happens politically for Trump during his term while it holds on to everything it seized; and even then try to take more ground, building on its current occupation and potentially using a fracture in the Western alliance to threaten more of Europe.",
      "The process of negotiating terms before a ceasefire in conflicts can be important to ensure the sides convert current military threats into meaningful strategic gains.",
      "Zelensky has previously tried to persuade the Americans that Russian President Vladimir Putin cannot be trusted, evidenced by the fact he broke the European-backed Minsk agreements after seizing Ukrainian territory in 2014.",
      "Trump dismisses these concerns, saying there will be security for Ukraine, but without saying how this will be assured. He has said Putin will be deterred and is in a difficult position with \"no choice\" but to make a deal for reasons that \"only I know\".",
      "Rubio said on Tuesday the US delegation had substantive discussions with the Ukrainians on a permanent end to the war, including \"what type of guarantees they're going to have for their long-term security and prosperity\", but again didn't elaborate.",
      "Statement: \"The United States will immediately lift the pause on intelligence sharing and resume security assistance to Ukraine.\"",
      "Analysis: This is the big win for Zelensky in this agreement and sees US weapons supplies being delivered at a rate of around $2bn (\u00a31.5bn)-worth a month, restored.",
      "Critically, it also means Washington will once again share its intelligence data and satellite pictures with Kyiv, which helps it target Russian positions. The White House said it suspended this aid because it felt Zelensky wasn't \"committed\" to Trump's peace plan.",
      "The Ukrainian leader had tried to voice his concerns based on some of the reasons above when he was ejected from the Oval Office. His reservations are likely being set aside while he welcomes the agreement in this form - a necessary price to pay to restore US security assistance.",
      "Ukraine ceasefire plan live updatesUS set to present 30-day ceasefire offer to Russia",
      "Ukraine ceasefire plan live updates",
      "US set to present 30-day ceasefire offer to Russia",
      "Statement: \"Both delegations agreed to name their negotiating teams and immediately begin negotiations toward an enduring peace that provides for Ukraine's long-term security. The United States committed to discussing these specific proposals with representatives from Russia. The Ukrainian delegation reiterated that European partners shall be involved in the peace process.\"",
      "Analysis: This paragraph is confusing because it's unclear whether it refers to negotiations between Ukraine and the US on establishing any security guarantees for Ukraine, or if it refers to negotiations between Ukraine and Russia to permanently end the war once a ceasefire is under way.",
      "If it is the former, it appears to suggest that Washington and Kyiv will hammer out any decisions on how to back up Ukraine's security and deter Russian breaches of a truce, and the US will then discuss these with Moscow.",
      "But it is all a far cry from the kind of security guarantee Zelensky ultimately wanted, which was membership of Nato, which Trump has said won't happen - a major long-term concession to Moscow's demands.",
      "The paragraph also contains a vague and lukewarm reference to the idea of European peacekeepers, which have been pitched by the UK and France, with the line attributed only to the Ukrainian delegation.",
      "It's notable that the US appears not to be putting its name to this part after Moscow categorically rejected the idea.",
      "Statement: \"\u2026both countries' presidents agreed to conclude as soon as possible a comprehensive agreement for developing Ukraine's critical mineral resources to expand Ukraine's economy and guarantee Ukraine's long-term prosperity and security.\"",
      "Analysis: This was the agreement that never got signed after Zelensky was told to leave the White House last month.",
      "It would give the US a future stake in some of Ukraine's state-owned mineral deposits, as well as oil and gas revenues.",
      "Trump sees it as an effective security guarantee for Ukraine, arguing it would deter Russian re-invasion because American companies would be on the ground.",
      "Opponents point out this is meaningless because US economic presence in Ukraine didn't deter Putin in 2014 or 2022.",
      "Statement: \"The Ukrainian delegation reiterated the Ukrainian people's strong gratitude to President Trump\u2026\"",
      "Analysis: This is a key line that might help explain Zelenky's rehabilitation in the eyes of the White House.",
      "Vance had castigated him in the Oval Office for not thanking Trump, even though the Ukrainian leader has thanked the US dozens of times for its military support.",

    "story": [
      "A columnist who has worked at The Washington Post for four decades resigned on Monday after she said the newspaper's management decided not to run her commentary critical of owner Jeff Bezos' new editorial policy.",
      "\"It breaks my heart to conclude that I must leave,\" Ruth Marcus, who has\u00a0worked\u00a0at the newspaper since 1984, wrote in a resignation letter.",
      "Her exit is the latest fallout from the billionaire owner's directive that the Post narrow the topics covered by its opinion section to personal liberties and the free market. The newspaper's opinions editor, David Shipley, had already resigned because of the shift.",
      "The storied newspaper has been in a free fall, financially and editorially, over the past year. Marcus, who worked in the news and opinion departments during her career, is \"the bedrock of The Washington Post, embodying the history of the place as well as the talent and accomplishments of its journalists,\" said Paul Farhi, a former media reporter there.",
      "Marcus, who was a finalist for the\u00a0Pulitzer Prize for Commentary\u00a0in 2007, said that the Post's publisher, Will Lewis, declined to run her column, which she described as \"respectfully dissenting\" from Bezos' edict. It was the first time in nearly 20 years of writing columns that she's had one killed, she said.",
      "The decision \"underscores that the traditional freedom of columnists to select the topics they wish to address and say what they think has been dangerously eroded,\" she wrote. Her resignation letter was first reported by The New York Times.",
      "A Post spokesperson said Monday that \"we're grateful for Ruth's significant contributions to The Washington Post over the past 40 years. We respect her decision to leave and wish her the best.\"",
      "While Bezos and Lewis have the right to make such decisions \u2014 they're the bosses \u2014 \"that has not been the tradition,\" Farhi said. He likened it to how the Justice Department, while technically under White House control, has generally operated independently. Editorial writers and columnists, paid to give their opinions, usually decide what to write, he said.",
      "The danger is that a decision by the publisher not to allow a column to go forward can make readers question whether the viewpoints of writers are truly their own, he said. Worse yet, it could taint the news department, which by most accounts is aggressively covering the new administration.",
      "Shortly after the editorial page decision was announced nearly two weeks ago, another Post story on the issue, by media columnist Erik Wemple, was scrapped, according to the Gene Pool, a blog written by former Post writer Gene Weingarten. Wemple declined comment on Monday.",
      "In January, editorial cartoonist Ann Telnaes resigned after her work depicting Bezos and other billionaires genuflecting before a statue of President Donald Trump was rejected, a decision Shipley explained at the time was because it was repetitive of other opinion pieces.",
      "Under executive editor Matt Murray, the Post has also said it would refrain from having its journalists write about issues involving the newspaper, a decision Wemple said in a chat with readers in January that \"I couldn't possibly dissent (from) more strongly.\"",
      "The Post's opinion section on Monday included an editorial opposing Mexico's $10 billion lawsuit against firearms manufacturers, a case before the U.S. Supreme Court. Columnists Max Boot wrote about Trump and Russia, Perry Bacon Jr. about Democratic resistance to Trump centering in the states, Phillip Bump on whether Trump would pay a political price for unpopular policies and Jim Geraghty about violence in Syria.",
      "The Post, which made money during the first Trump administration, has been losing money in recent years and its internal strife largely began last June, when Sally Buzbee resigned as executive editor rather than accept a newsroom reorganization. Several prominent Post journalists \u2014 among them Ashley Parker, Josh Dawsey, Philip Rucker, Matea Gold, Jackie Alemany, Michael Scherer and Will Sommer \u2014 have left for other jobs.",
      "Bezos' decision last fall that the Post would not endorse a presidential candidate \u2014 after the editorial staff had prepared to support Democrat Kamala Harris \u2014 led to an exodus of subscribers that the newspaper is fighting to recover from.",
      "Marty Baron, the Post's executive editor when Bezos bought the paper in 2013, wrote last week in the Atlantic that Bezos \"handled his ownership admirably for more than a decade. But his courage failed him when he needed it the most.\"",
      "Marcus' resignation on Monday overshadowed a newsroom reorganization plan introduced by Murray, including separating workflows for the Post's digital and print products.",

      "Griffin's memoir explores how keeping secrets can lead to shame and how revealing those secrets can be empowering. The book details Griffin's experience with childhood sexual abuse by a teacher, trauma she had suppressed for years.",
      "\"This book is going to help so many other people, particularly people who have suffered any kind of sexual abuse or any kind of shame, reveal for themselves,\" Winfrey said.",
      "Griffin described writing the memoir as a lengthy process, but said it was \"freeing.\" She explained that she had built \"walls and castles and moats\" in her life thinking they would keep her safe, but found liberation through sharing her story.",

      "Griffin described how her children helped her recognize she needed to address her past, recalling her daughter saying, \"Mom, you are here, but you're not really here.\"",

    "story": [
      "Discussion Questions",
      "1. Amy Griffin spent much of her adult life determined to move forward, never letting herself stop to look back. What do you think eventually motivated her to want to revisit her past and then to tell her story? Talk about the courage it takes to confront one's past\u2014and to share it with the world. Have you ever decided to divulge something about yourself that you once felt was impossible to share?",
      "2. Amy was a star student in her small Texas town, and she became a high-achieving businesswoman after arriving in New York. Talk about ambition as a trauma response. Do you think Amy believed she could outwork (and outrun) her past? How can \"The Tell\" serve as a reminder that people who appear to \"have it all\" are not always as they seem?",
      "3. A physical therapist tells Amy: \"There's something your body is telling you that you don't want to hear.\" How did her body's message manifest? What messages has your body sent you over the years? What makes it hard for you to listen to the messages your body sends?",
      "4. John supports Amy's decision to try therapy with Olivia and he works to keep the family's life afloat at home while she takes time to process what she's uncovered. But John also understands his own limits, telling Amy when she needs to find outside support so he can just be her husband. How does he know when to place this boundary? How does Amy react to this? Have you ever had to place a difficult boundary to preserve a relationship?",
      "5. Would you try psychedelic-assisted therapy? Why or why not?",
      "6. \"I needed to find the evidence that would confirm my memories,\" Amy writes in her journal. Why do you think Amy needs others to confirm what she knows to be true?",
      "7. What did you learn from \"The Tell\" and from Amy's sessions with Lauren about how memory works? Consider the distinction between memory storage and memory recall, for instance. What did you find most surprising?",
      "8. \"My daughters were asking me to participate in life, and in our relationship, in a way that I could not.\" How do Amy's children both trigger her memories\u2014and help her heal?",
      "9. For years, Amy remembers so many details around the abuse, but not the abuse itself. She saw clues, but not the full picture of her trauma. How did \"The Tell\" make you consider\u2014or reconsider\u2014your own life events and memories? Is there anything you might be unable or unwilling to remember? Have you ever surprised yourself by \"unlocking\" an unexpected memory?",
      "10. Amy begins to feel that justice will bring her closure. How was Paul's story both a helpful\u2014and unfortunately rare\u2014example for Amy? How does it affect her when she realizes her own story might not have such a tidy or satisfying outcome?",
      "11. What was it like for her to tell her parents? Have you ever had to have a difficult conversation with your parents about your childhood? What did you learn through that conversation\u2014about yourself or about them?",
      "12. Amy was raised in a traditional patriarchal Texas culture. Children were expected to both respect and obey their elders. How do the environments of our childhoods\u2014and the cultures in which we are raised\u2014inform our adult choices? How can our backgrounds influence what we can and cannot face in our personal histories?",
      "13. Amy recognizes the resources and time she was able to devote to both her healing and pursuing her legal case. How are situations of abuse and survival different for those without the same resources? In what ways might financial and class privileges insulate you from pain, or not?",
      "14. At the beginning of her journey, Amy can't \"tell\" her secret to herself. By the end, she's realized \"the telling is the medicine.\" How does telling her story help Amy heal?",
      "15. How does Amy give herself the closure she needs?",
      "16. Who do you think wrote the postcard? Does the writer's identity matter?",
      "17. What was your biggest takeaway from \"The Tell\"?",

The Broadway version is a stand-in for the city's corroded grandeur, and for the studio where, in 1996, a group of old, mostly forgotten Cuban musicians recorded the album.",
      "Justin Cunningham, as Juan de Marcos: \"What follows is the story of a band. Not ours, though we will do our best. Some of what follows is true. Some of it only feels true.\"",
      "The true part: the real person this actor is playing, Juan de Marcos Gonzalez, had already located and brought together the old musicians before music producers Ry Cooder and Nick Gold showed up in Havana. When their plan to make an album pairing Cuban and West African performers fell through, they went with Plan B, and recorded with the group Juan de Marcos had assembled.",
      "\"I was so happy, because they were my idols,\" Juan said. \"You know, I grew up with, you know, listening to their music. And then suddenly, I was the bandleader.\"",
      "I asked, \"Did any of the people involved, including you, have any idea that what became 'Buena Vista Social Club' would be something big?\"",
      "\"No,\" he replied. \"They became pop stars. It was like an unbelievable thing.\"",
      "The unexpected and irresistible phenomenon that resulted is the subject of the Oscar-nominated 1999 Wim Wenders documentary.",
      "\"It was just ubiquitous; I mean, you would hear this music everywhere,\" said music journalist and Substack contributor Judy Cantor-Navas, the author of \"Cuba on Record.\" \"To say that, 'Yes, we're listening to this old Cuban music that is suddenly selling millions of albums,' seemed like something that was very unlikely.\"",
      "I asked, \"Why do you think people loved the music so much?\"",
      "\"Cuban music has really appealed to so many different kinds of people,\" said Cantor-Navas. \"They say that it has, you know, the perfect combination of the Afro-Cuban rhythms and the Spanish melodies that came together in Cuba. It's just this very infectious music that, like, gets in your soul.\"",
      "It wasn't just the music they loved. It was who the musicians were \u2013 the improbable last act of their careers. The album won a Grammy, and has sold more than 8 million copies worldwide.",
      "\"And they were so happy, you know, because they came back to the stage,\" said Juan de Marcos. \"Because if you are a musician, and you are an artist, you are always an artist, you know? And even when you're retired, you have this small candle in your heart.\"",
      "Singer-dancer Omara Portuondo was 67; singer Ibrahim Ferrer was 70. Other band members were as old as 90. They began touring the world, even singing to me for a \"Sunday Morning\" story 25 years ago. \"I still have to pinch myself to make sure I'm not asleep and dreaming,\" Ferrer said then. \"I never thought I'd have so much success.\"",
      "From the archives: Buena Vista Social Club on its U.S. tour (2000)",
      "The play tells the imagined origin story of the musicians, their careers, and their personal struggles, with hints of romance, decades before their fame late in life.",
      "Marco Ramirez wrote the Broadway show. \"I'm Cuban American. I was born and raised in Miami, but my parents and my family's Cuban,\" he said. \"And so, for me what brought me to this was the music. It was music that I was raised around my entire life.",
      "He was 14 when the album came out: \"This was a moment of intense pride, of us realizing that the world cared about our music, and that these songs that I was used to hearing on my grandfather's little yellow Sony boom box above the washing machine, these were songs that suddenly the whole world cared about. That meant everything to me.\"",
      "Saheem Ali, the director of the show, grew up in Kenya. His father, an airline pilot, brought the album home. He became obsessed with it. \"I kept listening to it on repeat,\" he said. \"Something about the lyrics spoke to me. I learned the lyrics without knowing what I was talking about, 'cause Swahili's my first language.",
      "\"I knew nothing about their stories, absolutely nothing. The first time I knew about the stories was reading Marco's script. That's what excited me about this musical. People are gonna know about them now in a way that young people like me never had a chance to.\"",
      "Brought to life on a Broadway stage, the old songs as they were played in the 1940s and '50s at the actual Buena Vista Social Club, a members-only Havana nightclub for working class Black Cubans. It was shut down after Fidel Castro came to power in 1959. The events of the Cuban Revolution lurk at the edges of the show.",
      "Playing yesterday's Cuban music on Broadway are some of today's finest Cuban musicians, most of whom now live outside Cuba, because making a living there is tough.",
      "Juan de Marcos said, \"The people going to see the real Cuba, they are going to get a piece of our country when they attend the musical. We have nothing in our country. We don't have oil, we don't have gold, but we have the music, beautiful ladies, good coffee, the best cigars, and the best rum. And the music, which is the most important thing, like food for us.\"",

Bud Light's parent company, Anheuser-Busch, saw its revenue fall by more than 10% after the campaign was released.",
      "\"It took a lot to not feel guilty about that experience because I felt like it was my fault. And that me taking this one brand deal was affecting trans people globally,\" Mulvaney said. \"I think extremists and transphobic media needed a poster child, but I would've never done anything or taken any deal that I thought could negatively impact me or the community.\"",
      "The experience affected her mental health, she said.",
      "\"It resulted in a lot of suicidal ideation and dissociation,\" Mulvaney said. \"I'm still battling with some of that guilt and that shame, and that dysphoria that was projected onto me during that time.\"",
      "Her new book comes amid renewed debate over transgender rights in the U.S. Last month, a group of transgender people filed a lawsuit challenging President Trump's executive order that halted gender marker changes on passports.",
      "For Mulvaney, the executive order doesn't change how she feels.",
      "\"I'm a woman no matter what my passport says. We are not hurting anyone,\" she said. \"We're less than 1% of the population. And the way that they speak about us so often is as if we're taking over cities like Godzilla.\"",
      "\"I am now realizing that this is life or death for a lot of people,\" she added. \"I want every trans person in this country to have the opportunity to thrive. And unfortunately, we're living in a time where it is very hard to do so.\"",

      "\"Now, I don't know if you've been following the news but I've been keeping my ears open, and it seems like everyone everywhere is super-mad about everything all the time.\"",
      "But for his new job, the stand-up is sitting down. Mulaney is hosting a talk show on Netflix, complete with a couch and celebrity guests. And the whole thing is live, in part because he likes it better that way. \"It feels like there's more at stake,\" he said. \"I love that. It's the best.\"",
      "I asked, \"Explain that feeling \u2013 it's like coming up against a cliff and kind of dangling over it?\"",
      "\"No,\" he replied. \"It's dangling over it all the time.\"",

Now the show is back with a broader focus, and a new name, \"Everybody's Live With John Mulaney.\" It will go live every Wednesday night, starting this week. \"It's a fun feeling to know that hopefully a lot of people are watching,\" he said, \"and it's live, globally, with no delays, and you could really damage your career!\"",

Asked if he has a memory of when he realized that he was funny, Mulaney said, \"Always interesting in these things, 'cause you don't want to sound egotistical, but I don't remember a time when I didn't think I was funny.\"",
      "Not long after graduating from Georgetown, he joined \"SNL,\" and a career was launched. He made his mark in New York, but he's fascinated with Southern California, where he now lives year-round.",

      "\"A little bit,\" he said. \"My joke is that I'm like Louis Farrakhan: I mean a lot to a small group of people.\"",
      "Truth is, Mulaney is a lot bigger than he'll admit. In his most recent special, \"Baby J,\" he played to a sold-out crowd and focused on his drug addiction, and recovery. He describes a 2020 intervention on his behalf staged by friends like Seth Meyers and Fred Armisen: \"Let me just call this out now, I don't mean to be weird, it was a star-studded intervention.\"",
      "It's funny now, of course: Mulaney says he's been clean for more than four years.",
      "Asked if sobriety is something he thinks about every day, Mulaney replied, \"Well, that's a good question. I don't think about cocaine, opioids, and benzodiazeprine every day. I'll acknowledge that I understand the vigilance I need. I do not think about it every day. I just don't. I do think about the ways that I can lead my life to perhaps never feel the kind of strain that got me there. So, yeah, sobriety maybe being, like, a bigger term than just abstaining from the chemicals, I definitely think about it every day.\"",
      "Mulaney credits his wife, actress Olivia Munn, with helping him navigate his recovery. You might remember her from Aaron Sorkin's \"The Newsroom,\" or \"X-Men: Apocalypse,\" in which she played Psylocke.

    "title": "Lindsey Vonn on skiing the comeback trail",
    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/lindsey-vonn-on-skiing-the-comeback-trail/",
    "published": "Sun, 09 Mar 2025 09:58:42 -0400",
    "summary": "In the world of alpine skiing, few have been more decorated. Fast, fearless and resilient, Lindsey Vonn fought her way back after every crash, until she retired at 34. But now, with a titanium knee replacement, she is eyeing one more trip to the Olympics.",
    "story": [
      "For Lindsey Vonn, it was a reluctant farewell \u2013 the last run of her stellar career, at the Alpine World Ski Championships in Are, Sweden, in 2019. In the world of alpine skiing, few have been more decorated. She's won almost every major title, from World Cup Championships to Olympic medals, as the trophy case in her home proves.",
      "She says when she's racing, she doesn't think about the achievements: \"I think you just have a different perspective. You're focused on the next one, racing and performance, and you never really get to look back and say, 'Hey, good job,' you know?\"",
      "She was fast, reaching speeds of up to 85 mph. She was also fearless, and resilient. Crash after terrible crash, she always fought her way back. But 2013 was one of her hardest seasons. Vonn's right knee bore the brunt of a crash in the World Cup Super-G, and it was never the same. Flash forward almost six years, on the day of her last race \u2013 bum knee and all \u2013 she still managed to take home the bronze.",
      "At 34, Lindsey Vonn was retired.",
      "\"Skiing was always my sun, and everything in my life revolved around it: What time I woke up, what I ate, when I went to bed. It was all dictated around what's best for my skiing career,\" she said. \"And then, I woke up one day and my sun is gone.\"",
      "Ski racing is all Vonn ever wanted. Her dad, a former alpine skier himself, moved the family from Minnesota to Vail, Colorado, just so that Lindsey could train for the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. Those same slopes she now sees from her home in Park City, Utah.",
      "\"This is kind of just where I go to, you know, re-group and recharge my batteries,\" she said. \"And the dogs love it.\"",
      "In retirement, Vonn has kept many of her corporate sponsors, which helped her buy homes in Miami and Beverly Hills. She continued to wow red carpets, and not racing gave her more time to pour into her foundation, helping under-served girls achieve their own athletic dreams.",
      "But that knee kept getting worse. \"I just couldn't do the things I love to do anymore,\" she said. \"It was really bad. I couldn't straighten it all the way. I couldn't flex it all the way. And so, I was just stuck in this half-state that ended up causing hip pain, back pain, neck pain. It wasn't just my knee, unfortunately. It was kind of everything. It's like you get to the end of your rope and you gotta make a decision. So, I did.\"",
      "A knee replacement \u2013 the outer portion of her right knee is now titanium.",
      "But she didn't do it just to get back into skiing. \"I don't need to ski,\" she said. \"I am Lindsey. I am not a skier; I'm a person that loves to ski. And that's a really big distinction for me, in my mind, in my heart.\"",
      "I asked, \"How soon afterwards did you wonder how far you could push it?\"",
      "\"It was pretty quickly after!\" she laughed.",
      "Only four months, in fact. She took her coaches to New Zealand to acquaint her new knee with her old sport. \"It just was such a drastic difference that I thought, well, if I can do all of these things that used to hurt me before, where would that take me? And my mind starts to wander, and here we are.\"",
      "And where she is, is back on the U.S. ski team, hoping to qualify for one more trip to the Olympics: Italy 2026.",
      "\"I will be at a disadvantage,\" Vonn said. \"I am 40, and at that time next year I will be 41. But I know my skiing is there. I think I'm actually skiing better now than I was last few years of my career.\"",
      "She admits there has been some good-natured ribbing: \"For sure. There's one girl that calls me Grandma, which I don't exactly appreciate! But there's definitely some jokes around the team that, you know, I raced in my first Olympics before one of the girls was born.\"",
      "She knew there would be some raised eyebrows, but she got more than that, with some critics going so far as to question her sanity. \"These past few weeks have been tough,\" she posted on Instagram last month. \"I know they are only a few voices out of many\u2026 But it still hurts.\"",
      "A post shared by L I N D S E Y  \u2022  V O N N (@lindseyvonn)",
      "She told us, \"What I didn't expect was people to criticize me as a person and why I'm doing it, and that I can't handle life outside of ski racing.\"",
      "She dismisses most of it, choosing to concentrate on training smarter, not harder. \"It's not like I'm preparing for another ten years of my skiing career,\" she said. \"I'm just preparing for one year, for literally two races.\"",
      "She's put the rest of her life on hold for the moment \u2013 a single goal does require a singularity of focus, much like making her banana bread does. And there's a purpose to that: \"I need to put on weight, man,\" she said. \"I'm about 20 pounds less than when I was racing before.\"",
      "That brand of determination, she says, came from her mom, Lindy Lund. \"She would have given anything to play tennis, to play squash, to ride a bike, and she couldn't,\" Vonn said.",
      "Her mom suffered a stroke while pregnant with Lindsey in 1984. It was debilitating, but she soldiered on without complaint. When she was diagnosed with ALS (once known as Lou Gehrig's Disease), she \u2013 like her daughter \u2013 wasn't about to give up. \"She thought that she could beat the odds, and she could be the one that would live 20 more years, and she lasted one,\" Vonn said. \"Man, it was hard. I still got her number in my phone. I still message her.\"",
      "She said her mom would want her to be flying high once again, even though winning another downhill will be an uphill battle. In a sport measured in hundredths of a second, the difference between first and last can be miniscule. But on this second go-around, Lindsey Vonn is taking time to savor the view just as much as the chase.",
      "\"The fact that I'm even talking about going to the Olympics right now is something I never thought I would ever do,\" she said. \"So, I'm already winning!\"",

      "Daffodils",
      "Sprouting in beautiful shades of yellow, orange, peach, white, cream, and even pink, daffodils\u2014known by their botanical name Narcissus\u2014are an early sign that spring has sprung.",
      "Some tried-and-true cultivars are the 'Golden Ducat', 'Rip Van Winkle', and 'Petit Four'\u2014all examples of the double daffodil, featuring one or more flowers to a stem. Another common variety is the trumpet daffodil, which has a center that is as long or longer than its petals. Large-cupped daffodils are defined by their prominent cups, while small-cup iterations have short cups that are less than one-third the length of the petals.",
      "Don't worry about recognizing all the different varieties; just choose what you like from your local garden center or online resource. Because no matter the type, daffodils (and other small bulbs) are so rewarding. The blooms last for two or three weeks in the garden and bring such color to your landscape. They are also low maintenance.",
      "Here are some tips to help you make the most of these perennial crowd-pleasers.",
      "Daffodils are winter-hardy in zones 3 through 8 and will return to bloom again year after year so long as they are planted in full or partial sun and in any soil that's not soggy.If your goal is to have drifts of daffodils, include varieties recommended for naturalizing and forming carpets on lawns and into woodlands. That way, the 100 bulbs you plant this fall will gradually multiply to 300, then 600, then 1,000, and so on.When planting en masse, it helps to create a planting \"map\" in advance on paper that can be transferred onto the ground with granular lime, as Martha does (see photo).Daffodil bulbs should be planted about two to three times as deep as the bulbs are high, so if you have one that's 2 inches tall, plant it 4 to 6 inches below the top of the soil.When harvesting for arrangements, grasp the stem at the base and pull rather than cutting, as viruses in bulbs can be passed along to other plants when using pruners to trim stems.Don't cut back daffodils too soon. Once the flowers bloom and fade, allow the whole plant to die back to the ground to create food for the bulbs so they can multiply.After removing spent foliage, apply a balanced 10-10-10 fertilizer over the entire area, and then add a layer of mulch. Fertilize the area again in the fall.",

      "It is nowhere you chose to be, and yet here you are. Papa steers your shoulders into the heart of the jack drive. Hundreds of rabbits stare at you through the wire around the fence posts. It feels like looking into the mirror. They do not want to be in this story either. Men have been working since dawn to herd the wild jacks into this pen. The town has gathered to solve the problem of the rabbits, who chew through rangeland and cropland, who eat the golden wheat your papa turns into money. Worse than the locusts, says Papa. Every hide brings a penny bounty. So many turnipy sweating bodies and a festive feeling in the air like a penny rubbed between two fingers, like blood shocked into a socket. A smell that reminds you of the room where babies are born. When you try to turn and run away, Papa grabs you. There's Mr. O'Malley, Mr. Waldowko, Mr. Zalewski, Mrs. Haage. You can't remember any more names. A hundred jointed arms come swinging into the pen that is alive with jackrabbits, the place of no escape. Now there is only madness. Terror of cudgels, terror of ax handles and hammers, terror of being trampled. \"Papa! Help! Stop!\" Rabbits run over your feet. \"Settle down, Harp\u2014\u00ad \" Papa is angry. He pours your name over your head like scalding water. The rabbits are angry. The rabbits are crying and dying, the clubs coming down, down, down. \"If you ain't gonna help, stay clear of us, boy\u2014\u00ad \" You are six today. Your family will have a party after supper. The cake was cooling when you left for town. You feel sick thinking about it. Cherries come slopping out of the rabbits. Gray skins are splitting, slipping under bootheels and wooden bats. Papa shows you what to target: the skulls and the spines of the screaming jacks. It's the fastest way to stop their screaming. There is another way, a voice cries out inside you. Smash it flat. You watch Papa click into his rhythm and begin to kill alongside the rest of the men.",
      "You meet your baby sister's gaze through the fan of her clean fingers. Lada is sitting on your mother's lap. Three girls you know are watching from outside the fence. The girls are allowed to squeal and shield their faces. You wish you were a girl with them. Down, down, down come the clubs and the planks. Your stomach bulges and flattens. You are screaming with the rabbits. Your birthday wish is to get to the end of this sound. Quiet comes at last. The men's arms rest against their sides like tools in a shed. Women are hanging the dead jacks to dry by their long ears. Every twitching rabbit's foot has stilled. Inside of you, the screaming continues. It goes on and on and on. Papa finds you where you have hidden your eyes behind your hands, your tears inside your palms. \"We can't let the jacks overrun the whole prairie. No one likes it, Son.\" This is a lie. Many had liked it. You shut your eyes along with the dead rabbits, because you did not want to see whose faces were smiling.",
      "\"Here,\" says Papa. \"One is still living. You cannot be softhearted, Harp.\"",

    "summary": "A White House official confirmed that the administration is pulling Dave Weldon's nomination to be director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The White House is withdrawing former Florida Rep. Dave Weldon's nomination to be the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a White House official confirmed Thursday.",
      "An administration official who was asked about why Weldon's nomination was withdrawn responded, \"It was clear he did not have the votes in the Senate.\"",
      "Weldon, a vaccine critic, was set to appear before the Senate's health committee on Thursday for his confirmation hearing, and news of the withdrawal of his nomination came less than an hour before the hearing was to begin. Axios first reported news of Weldon's nomination being pulled.",
      "The committee was expected to question him about his long record of criticizing vaccines and the agency he was nominated to lead. Weldon is a physician and a former Republican member of Congress.",
      "In a statement obtained by CBS News, Weldon said that Health and Human Services Secretary\u00a0Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u00a0was \"very upset\" at his nomination being pulled. Weldon said he had received a call from the White House 12 hours before the scheduled hearing, informing him that the nomination would be withdrawn.",
      "\"Bobby Kennedy is a good man who really is passionate about improving the health of the American people,\" Weldon said. \"President Trump did a good thing in making him secretary of HHS.  Hopefully they can find someone for CDC who can survive the confirmation process and get past pharma and find some answers.\"",
      "Weldon said that Maine Sen. Susan Collins had told Kennedy she had reservations about his nomination and said the Republican senator's staff had been \"very hostile\" in a meeting with him.",
      "Collins' staff repeatedly accused him of being against vaccines, Weldon said, \"even though I reminded them that I actually give hundreds of vaccines every year in my medical practice.\"",
      "Speaking with reporters Thursday, Collins said Weldon's withdrawal came as a surprise to her and that she had planned to give him a chance to respond at the hearing.",
      "\"I did not express concerns to the White House. I had some reservations, but I certainly had not reached a final judgment,\" Collins said.",
      "Multiple people familiar with Weldon's Senate meetings said Republicans had been concerned over his answers when asked about his priorities for the agency. Weldon wanted to detail his priorities for the CDC after being confirmed and learning more about the agency as director.",
      "Weldon was unfamiliar with the CDC's current budget and workforce, telling congressional staffers he was busy with his medical practice and did not want to waste time reading up on an agency he might not be confirmed to lead, they said.",
      "Two people said Collins' staff had only asked Weldon how he would address the perception that he was against vaccines, but denied accusing him of being \"anti-vaccine.\"",
      "Weldon said that over 20 years ago, while in Congress, he raised concerns about childhood vaccine safety, and \"for some reason Collins staff suddenly couldn't get over that.\"",
      "He also claimed that another senator, Louisiana Republican Dr. Bill Cassidy, had also said he was anti-vaccine and had once asked for his nomination to be withdrawn.",
      "A spokesperson for Cassidy denied that he had asked the White House for Weldon's nomination to be withdrawn. Cassidy had been \"looking forward\" to Thursday's hearing with Weldon, the spokesperson said.",
      "The CDC has faced mounting questions from senators in recent weeks over moves to reopen studies into whether vaccines are linked to autism and also over an abruptly canceled meeting of the agency's outside immunization advisers, which has yet to be rescheduled.",
      "Kennedy has also faced criticism this week for inflating the risks of measles vaccines when discussing the\u00a0record outbreak\u00a0in Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma. Kennedy, whose department oversees the CDC, also has a history of\u00a0criticizing vaccines.",
      "After a meeting with Sen. Patty Murray last month, the Washington Democrat said she was \"deeply disturbed to hear Dr. Weldon repeat debunked claims about vaccines.\"",
      "\"As we face one of the worst measles outbreaks in years thanks to President Trump, a vaccine skeptic who spent years spreading lies about safe and proven vaccines should never have even been under consideration to lead the foremost agency charged with protecting public health,\" Murray said in a statement Thursday.",
      "Weldon would have been the first CDC director nominee to face Senate confirmation, after a change passed by Congress in 2022. Previous picks to head the Atlanta-based public health agency were able to assume their posts without the Senate's votes.",

      "The IRS is drafting plans to cut its workforce by as much as half through a mix of layoffs, attrition and incentivized buyouts as part of President Trump's efforts to shrink the size of the federal workforce. The administration is closing agencies, laying off nearly all probationary employees who have not yet gained civil service protection and offering buyouts to almost all federal employees through a \"deferred resignation program\" to quickly reduce the government workforce.",
      "Already, roughly 7,000 probationary IRS employees with roughly one year or less of service were laid off from the organization in February.",
      "But the mass layoffs of probationary workers are now in doubt after a federal judge in California on Thursday ruled that their terminations by the Office of Personnel Management were unlawful and ordered six federal agencies to reinstate\u00a0the employees. The decision by U.S. District Judge William Alsup in San Francisco followed a legal challenge brought by a group of unions against the Trump administration.",
      "Paul was named acting chief counsel to the IRS in January, replacing Marjorie A. Rollinson, and has served in various roles at the IRS since the late 1980s.",
      "Paul is not the first government official to be demoted after voicing concern about access to sensitive systems and taxpayer data.",

      "After 30 years of service, Michelle King, the SSA's acting commissioner, stepped down from her role in February after refusing to provide DOGE access Social Security recipient information, according to two people familiar with the official's departure who were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. King was replaced by Leland Dudek, who oversaw the SSA's fraud investigation office.",
      "\"The series of IRS officials who have put the law above their personal job security join a line of public servants, stretching back to Treasury and IRS leaders during the Nixon era, who have resisted unlawful attempts by elected officials to weaponize taxpayer data and systems,\" Chye-Ching Huang, executive director of the Tax Law Center at New York University School of Law, said in a statement.",

Supporters of DOGE see its efforts as a way to rein in bloated federal spending.",

The EU announced the measures in response to U.S. tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum taking effect on Wednesday.",

The index, which rose in the weeks following Mr. Trump's re-election in November, has given up those gains and is now down roughly 10% from its high of 6,147 on Feb. 19.

      "On Wednesday morning, Mr. Trump imposed a blanket 25% tariff on foreign steel and aluminum, significantly impacting Canada, the largest foreign supplier of these metals to the U.S. An additional 25% tariff on most Canadian goods is set to go into effect on April 2.",
      "Experts warn these hikes could lead to increases in consumer prices, but Mr. Trump has justified them in part by saying he's protecting American manufacturers and incentivizing Canada to crack down on drug crime.",
      "However, in interviews and social media posts, Mr. Trump has exaggerated the size of the U.S.trade deficit with Canada and the amount of fentanyl coming over the northern border. The president also misrepresented Canada's tariffs on U.S. dairy and lumber products.",
      "Here's a breakdown of some of these claims:",
      "Trump's misleading claim that Canada has tariffs above 200% on U.S. dairy products",
      "President Trump said March 7: \"In Canada, we find that they're charging us over 200% for dairy products\u2026 And when I left, we had that well taken care of, but under Biden they just kept raising it.\"",
      "Details: President Trump has suggested Canada unfairly put tariffs of over 200% on American dairy products during President Biden's term, but the level has been unchanged since before Biden took office.",
      "The over 200% tariffs on U.S. dairy products are only triggered if U.S. dairy exports exceed certain yearly duty-free limits, and U.S. dairy manufacturers say they have never been close to exceeding these limits.",
      "Additionally, these tariffs were negotiated during the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which Mr. Trump signed during his first term. Canada's published tariff lists for 2020 and 2025 show tariffs on U.S. dairy products have remained unchanged from the end of his first term through the end of President Biden's term. For example, both lists show the same tariff rate of 245.5% for any cheese products above the duty-free limit.",
      "Canadian Ambassador to the U.S. Kirsten Hillman told told CBS News the dairy tariffs are in place to \"protect our farmers and families.\" Canada is the second-largest importer of U.S. dairy, purchasing about $1.1 billion worth in 2024.",
      "The U.S. sold roughly double the amount of dairy to Canada as Canada sold to the U.S. last year, according to trade data from the U.S. Census Bureau.",
      "Trump's misleading claim that Canada has a \"tremendously high tariff\" on lumber while the U.S. charges \"a tiny fraction of that\"",
      "President Trump said March 7: \"They have a tremendously high tariff, give you the exact numbers in a little while coming out, on lumber. So, they sell us lumber, they have a tremendous tariff. They make it impossible for us to sell lumber or dairy products into Canada, but our numbers are a tiny fraction of that, almost non-existent.\"",
      "Details: On March 4, Canada imposed a tariff of 25% on softwood lumber from the U.S., a rate that is high compared to recent history.",
      "But Mr. Trump did not mention these tariffs are part of Canada's response to the 25% levies on most Canadian goods, including lumber, that the Trump administration initially announced in early March, which are now expected to take effect on April 2.",
      "Before this trade escalation, Canada had imposed zero tariffs on U.S. softwood lumber for years, according to Dustin Jalbert, a senior economist at Fastmarkets who covers wood products.",
      "\"It's certainly true that right now there are tariffs in place, but that was not the case before the kickoff of the trade war. These are retaliatory to what the U.S. instigated, if you will, in early March,\" Jalbert said.",
      "The U.S. had previously placed duties on imported softwood lumber, with tariffs on Canadian lumber rising from 8% to 14.5% in 2024.",
      "Trump's false claim that the U.S. has a $200 billion trade deficit with Canada",
      "President Trump\u00a0said\u00a0March 13:\u00a0\"In the case of Canada, we're spending $200 billion a year to subsidize Canada.\"\u00a0And on Feb. 26 he said: \"The tariffs will make it impossible for them to sell lumber or anything else into the United States. And all I'm asking to do is break even or lose a little bit, but not lose $200 billion.\"",
      "Details: Mr. Trump has repeatedly exaggerated the U.S.-Canada trade deficit, claiming it's as large as $200 billion.",

      "For goods alone, the U.S. bought $70.6 billion more in goods from Canada than it sold in 2024, down from $72.3 billion in 2023.",
      "The overwhelming driver of the deficit with Canada is that the U.S. buys a lot of unrefined oil from the country, according to Julian Karaguesian, a lecturer at the department of economics at McGill University.",
      "\"A lot of Canadian economists say if you take out energy, Canada is running a small deficit with the United States,\" Karaguesian said.",

But even more importantly, they have allowed fentanyl to come into our country at levels never seen before, killing hundreds of thousands of our citizens.\"",

In 2024, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol seized 43 pounds of fentanyl at the U.S.-Canada border, accounting for roughly 0.2% of all fentanyl seized by CBP that year.

      "According to the Distilled Spirits Council, a retaliatory tariff imposed in 2018 during Mr. Trump's first term, caused exports of U.S.-made whiskey to drop 20%. But over the last three years, exports to the EU grew nearly 60% from $439 million in 2021 to $699 million in 2024, the trade group said.",
      "Since returning to the White House for a second term, Mr. Trump has made tariffs a key area of his economic agenda, though the levies have sparked concerns of a recession and roiled the stock market. The president declined to rule out the possibility of an economic downturn, telling Fox News in an interview that aired Sunday that \"there is a period of transition because what we're doing is very big.\"",
      "In an interview with CBS News, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Tuesday that Mr. Trump's economic policies are \"the most important thing America has ever had\" when asked whether they would be worth it if they lead to a recession. \"It's worth it.\"",
      "Lutnick added, \"The only reason there could possibly be a recession is because the Biden nonsense that we had to live with. These policies produce revenues. They produce growth. They produce factories being built here.\"",
      "The president's trade war escalated this month with 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, as well as an additional 10% tax on goods imported from China, taking effect last week. Beijing imposed retaliatory measures that went into force Monday that target U.S. farmers with levies of 15% on chicken, wheat and corn, and 10% on soybeans, pork, beef and fruit.",
      "The president, however, swiftly reversed course on the levies on imports from Mexico and Canada, pausing the tariffs covered under a 2020 trade deal negotiated during his first administration until April 2. That agreement, the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, covers the majority of goods imported from Mexico. Those that are not subject to the deal, however, still face tariffs.",
      "Mr. Trump has also exempted other products from his planned tariffs, including providing a one-month exemption to U.S. automakers that were bracing to be hit hard\u00a0by the levies on vehicle parts and components imported from Canada, Mexico and China.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture is cutting two federal programs that provided about $1 billion in funding to schools and food banks to buy food directly from local farms, ranchers and producers, part of what the agency said was a decision to \"return to long-term, fiscally responsible initiatives.\"",
      "The move cancels about $660 million in funding this year for the Local Food for Schools program, which is active in 40 U.S. states, as well as about $420 million for a second program called the Local Food Purchase Assistance Cooperative Agreement, which helps food banks and other local groups provide food to their communities.",

      "The decision comes as the Trump administration and Elon Musk's\u00a0Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, say they are slashing federal spending to reduce government waste. The USDA programs were funded through the agency's Commodity Credit Corporation, a Depression-era fund created to buy products directly from farmers.",
      "\"Unlike the Biden Administration, which funneled billions in [Commodity Credit Corporation] funds into short-term programs with no plan for longevity, USDA is prioritizing stable, proven solutions that deliver lasting impact,\" a USDA spokesperson said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "In recent days, schools were alerted that they were set to lose $660 million in federal funding for the current year, according to Diane Pratt-Heavner, director of media relations for the School Nutrition Association, which represents thousands of school meal employees. The withdrawal of funding will affect schools across the U.S. at a time when they're already grappling with high food costs, she said.",
      "\"It's a pretty big hit\"",
      "One of those school districts said the USDA's decision will wipe out $100,000 in funding that it had planned to spend on local beef and produce for students' school meals.",
      "\"It's a pretty big hit, and that's mostly fresh fruits and vegetables,\" said Patti Bilbrey, director of nutrition services at the Scottsdale Unified School District in Arizona. \"It wasn't just about keeping food costs low \u2014 it meant supporting your community and your local farmers in your state.\"",
      "While the $100,000 represents about 2% of the school district's roughly $6 million in annual spending on food, Bilbrey noted that it allowed the district to buy food ffrom small farmers and introduce produce like microgreens to their students. She added that the funding loss comes as her district, like many others, are struggling to keep school meals affordable amid rising food and labor costs.",
      "The Local Food for Schools program \"was a godsend to us,\" Bilbrey said. \"It keeps our meal costs down, and we're helping our community, which improves the perception of school meals.\"",

Katie Carlson, president of Carlson Orchards in Harvard, Massachusetts, said the Worcester Regional Food Hub, which connects school districts with food from local farmers through the USDA program, had been a reliable customer.",

Staff members who resigned for other reasons also have not been replaced due to a government hiring freeze, he said.",
      "The Amazon trial had been scheduled to start in September. The FTC is seeking to relax some of the deadlines in the case and a delay akin to a two-month continuance. The agency does not want to \"move the trial back more than a couple of months,\" Cohen said.",
      "Currently, the agency's legal team is \"racing at considerable cost\" to meet a late April deadline for discovery while at the same time dealing with restrictive rules on purchasing court documents and travel, Cohen explained.",
      "Other factors could hamper staffers' preparations for the trial, he said. In April, FTC employees will have to spend time packing up and vacating their office building so they can potentially move into \"an abandoned USAID facility,\" Cohen said.",

      "The Consumer Price Index was forecast to rise 2.9% last month, according to economists polled by financial data firm FactSet. The CPI, a basket of goods and services typically bought by consumers, tracks the change in those prices over time.",
      "February's data comes after inflation accelerated in January, when it rose 3% on an annual basis.",
      "What economists say",
      "The report shows \"further signs of progress on underlying inflation, with the pace of price increases moderating after January's strong release,\" said Kay Haigh, global co-head of fixed income and liquidity solutions in Goldman Sachs Asset Management.",
      "Despite the lower-than-expected inflation, the Federal Reserve is still likely to hold off on cutting rates at its March 19 meeting, Haigh noted. \"[The] combination of easing inflationary pressures and rising downside risks to growth suggest that the Fed is moving closer to continuing its easing cycle,\" Haigh said.",
      "Grocery prices are continuing to rise, with groceries increasing 2.6% in February from a year earlier, the CPI report said. The ongoing rise of food costs is creating a financial pinch for many households, economists note.",
      "Egg prices were a driver of last month's grocery inflation, with the cost of eggs jumping 58.8% from a year earlier, the report said. Coffee rose 6% on an annual basis, while restaurant meals jumped 3.7% from a year ago.",
      "Food inflation has been \"gradually accelerating since mid-2024, reaching almost 5% on a 3-month annualized basis\" in January, according to Morgan Stanley economists in a March 6 research note.",
      "Other items that saw price hikes in February include car insurance, which rose 11.1% on an annual basis, and medical care, which rose 3% from a year ago. Meanwhile, President Trump's tariff barrage has the potential to boost prices for many products, from food imports to automobiles, adding to an uncertain outlook for inflation, economists say.",
      "\"Good news on inflation, but good news pre-tariffs,\" said Robert Frick, corporate economist with Navy Federal Credit Union. \"Unfortunately, three main pain points for consumer budgets \u2014 shelter, medical care and car insurance \u2014 had substantial increases.\"",
      "What it means for your money",
      "Even though the inflation data came in lighter than expected, price increases are still pacing well above the Fed's 2% annual goal. Because of that, economists say it's unlikely the Fed will cut rates at its meeting next week.",
      "That means consumers and businesses will continue to face higher borrowing costs for longer, while still grappling with elevated price hikes, economists say.",
      "\"The Federal Reserve will remain firmly planted on the sidelines at next week's meeting,\" Bankrate Chief Financial Analyst Greg McBride said on Wednesday. \"Inflation readings still need to show sustained progress toward 2%, and the recent economic uncertainty will make them ever more data-dependent in the coming weeks and months.\"",

      "Sweeping 25% tariffs on all U.S. steel and aluminum imports\u00a0could cause prices on a range of consumers foods, including cars and washing machines, to rise. Components used in manufacturing and for construction such as nails, could also become more expensive.",
      "Anything that's made with metal, from homes and cars to canned foods and beverages could soon get a new and higher price tag.",
      "\"All manufacturing that uses steel or aluminum, or uses something that uses steel and aluminum will be affected,\" international trade expert Christine McDaniel, senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Dr. Wayne Winegarden, a senior fellow and director at the Pacific Research Institute, a right-leaning think tank, called the forthcoming tariff impact \"a barn burner,\" leading to higher prices and an economic slowdown.",
      "He added that all \"broad-based core commodities\" are vulnerable to price hikes as a result of the levies. In addition to automobiles and electronics, which rely heavily on metals, that includes less obvious goods like canned goods, whose prices could rise if packaging costs jump.",
      "\"We are going to see it in places you don't expect it,\" Winegarden said.",
      "American consumers likely to see higher prices on cars and more",
      "Car, truck, bus and tractor parts were the largest import category by volume last year, that will be covered under the tariffs, according to the United States International Trade Commission.",
      "American Automotive Policy Council, which represents Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, said the new tariffs \"will add significant costs for automakers, suppliers and consumers\" in a statement to CBS News.",
      "Inevitably, some of those added costs will be passed along to consumers.",
      "\"It is not easy for American companies that use steel and aluminum in production to find it elsewhere, so we'll see increases in prices. Makers of vehicles will face higher costs, which will be passed on to consumers,\" Layna Mosley, politics and international affairs professor at Princeton School of Public and International Affairs, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Metal parts on doors, window frames and other hardware used in the construction of housing will also be subject to the levies, leading to growing costs for homebuilders.",
      "Jim Tobin, CEO of the National Association of Home Builders, pointed to estimates showing that the metal tariffs could add up to $10,000 to the cost of a home, although he noted it is likely to take months for the impact to become clear. \"Those costs are going to be passed on to the ultimate homeowner or renter,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Machine parts, including steel wires, screws and more are also likely to be hit, raising the price of a broad range of appliances from dishwashers and dryers to garbage disposals and air conditioners.",
      "\"Just look around the house. Anything that has steel or aluminum in it will be exposed to tariffs,\" McDaniel said.",
      "Gym and sports equipment will also be tariffed, though manufacturers may have stockpiled some materials in anticipation of the tariffs going into effect, enabling them to head off price hikes for a short period, Mosley noted.",
      "Higher price for aluminum cans",
      "In addition to automakers, construction projects and possibly defense contractors, the tariffs would also increase costs to \"food processing and packaging including can manufacturers,\" Satyam Panday, chief economist, U.S. and Canada, S&P Global Ratings, said in a recent report.",
      "Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey said in an earnings call last month said that the company imports aluminum for its cans, and that if tariffs make them more expensive, it could start selling more beverages in plastic bottles.",
      "\"As it relates to our strategies around ensuring affordability and ensuring consumer demand, if one package suffers some increase in input costs, we continue to have other packaging offerings that will allow us to compete in the affordability space,\" Quincey said. \"For example, if aluminum cans become more expensive, we can put more emphasis on PET [plastic] bottles, et cetera.\"",
      "\"Tariffs and non-tariff barriers tend to disproportionately burden the small and midsize businesses,\" added Panday. \"Profits are likely to be squeezed at the margin. To the extent businesses can pass on the rising cost, consumers would also eventually see their prices increase. Overall, pressure on inflation would rise just as markets and consumers are appearing to be sensitive to inflationary expectations.\"",
      "For Brooklyn-based brewery Talea, the tariffs on aluminum, which the company uses for its beer cans, could lead to higher operating costs, co-founder LeAnn Darland recently told CBS News' Kelly O'Grady.

    "published": "Wed, 12 Mar 2025 12:31:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Consumers, businesses and investors are increasingly jittery about the risks of a protracted slump. So what exactly is a recession?",
    "story": [
      "President Trump sparked concerns this week when he declined to rule out the possibility of a U.S. recession this year. Asked on Fox news if he expects such a slump, Mr. Trump said, \"I hate to predict things like that. There is a period of transition because what we're doing is very big.\"",
      "U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick also seemed to leave open the possibility of a downturn, telling CBS News in an interview on Tuesday that Mr. Trump's economic policies are \"worth it\" even if they lead to a recession.",
      "While it is notoriously hard to predict a recession, there are definitive criteria that must be met in order for a business cycle to be considered recessionary. Here's what to know.",
      "What is a recession, and who decides if we're in one?",
      "A recession is generally defined as a broad-based, persistent decline in economic activity. The more popular metric is that a recession is two straight quarters of negative economic growth, although in fact there's more to it than.",
      "Recessions are identified by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), a non-profit, nonpartisan research group that dates U.S. business cycles. To determine if the economy has entered a recession, NBER evaluates six key indicators: real personal income; non-farm payroll employment; employment as measured by the household survey; personal consumption; manufacturing and trade sales; and industrial production.",
      "More specifically, NBER looks at the depth of the changes in these indicators, how broadly a slump is affecting different industries and how long a downturn lasts. The upshot: In a recession, the decline in economic activity must be significant, sustained and widespread, rather than limited to a particular sector.",
      "Could the U.S. tumble into a recession anytime soon?",
      "For now, economic data suggest that's unlikely. Although layoffs around the country are rising, the U.S. labor market continues to create jobs at a decent clip. Despite economic growth slowing, it's not expected to fall off a cliff. In fact, Julia Pollack, chief economist at career site ZipRecruiter, notes that four of the six signals tracked by the NBER point to continued economic expansion.",
      "\"Right now, things feel uncomfortable given the significant amount of policy uncertainty, the federal layoffs, and we've seen business, consumer and investor sentiment fray,\" Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"So to some it feels like the economy is in a recession, but we are not there yet.\"",
      "Still, cracks are appearing that could portend a sharper downturn down the road. Retail spending, which is the lifeblood of the economy, is\u00a0waning, while measures of consumer confidence show a\u00a0sharp deterioration of late. Investor concerns about the Trump administration's barrage of tariffs on other nations has also slammed stock prices, which could further pressure spending.",
      "\"Negative consumption is concerning because consumer spending is backbone of U.S. economy,\" Pollack said. \"And it's not just that spending fell. Sentiment has fallen, household budgets are squeezed and consumers are more vulnerable to shocks, which has heightened recession fears.\"",
      "Sweet added, \"Right now, your traditional causes of a recession aren't flashing red, but we just have this suffocating effect of all the uncertainty around trade and fiscal policy and immigration.\"",
      "Lutnick, the Commerce Department chief, defends Mr. Trump's economic policies, saying they will boost economic activity.",
      "\"The only reason there could possibly be a recession is because the Biden nonsense that we had to live with. These policies produce revenues. They produce growth. They produce factories being built here,\" he told CBS News on Tuesday.",
      "What signals would point to a recession?",
      "The clearest sign would be a steady increase in job losses and a jump unemployment. In a recession, consumers pare spending and businesses pull back on investment. That typically leads to a slowdown in hiring and rise in layoffs.",
      "The nation's unemployment rate did tick up last month, to 4.1% from 4%, though that is still quite low. But employers added 151,000 jobs, a sign that businesses are still seeking to hire workers and enough payroll gains to keep unemployment in check.",
      "Many economists monitor the number of people who seek unemployment benefits each week, a gauge that indicates whether layoffs are worsening. Weekly jobless claims\u00a0remain low.",
      "Who is most vulnerable in a recession?",
      "Most Americans would feel the impact of a recession in one way or another, for weaker hiring to tepid wage gains. Among people who are employed, those who entered the labor market last tend to be the first to lose their job in a recession, noted Alex Jacquez, chief of policy and advocacy at the Groundwork Collective, a left-leaning economic think tank.",
      "\"So you see the people who are hardest to reach as we reach full employment are the first to get laid off. That includes lower wage workers, black workers, Latino workers. Those who have the hardest time getting a job when times are good are first to lose jobs when times are bad,\" he said.",
      "Americans who carry debt on their homes and can't make minimum payments also can face foreclosure in a downturn, locking a generation out of building household wealth.",
      "\"That's one reason why recessions are so damaging, because it's the least among us that get hurt the most when downturns come,\" Jacquez said.",

The 8% drop in the S&P 500 stock index over the past month on fears of deteriorating growth appears unlikely to dissuade him, as Mr. Trump argued that higher tariff rates would be more effective at bringing back factories.",
      "\"The higher it goes, the more likely it is they're going to build,\" Mr. Trump told the group. \"The biggest win is if they move into our country and produce jobs. That's a bigger win than the tariffs themselves, but the tariffs are going to be throwing off a lot of money to this country.\"",
      "Mr. Trump on Tuesday threatened to put tariffs of 50% on steel and aluminum from Canada, but reversed course and\u00a0chose to stay with the 25% rate after the province of Ontario suspended plans to put a surcharge on electricity sold to Michigan, Minnesota and New York.",
      "Trump tariffs history",
      "In many ways, the president is now addressing what he perceives as unfinished business from his first term. Mr. Trump meaningfully increased tariffs, but the revenues collected by the federal government were too small to significantly increase overall inflationary pressures.",
      "Mr. Trump's 2018 tariffs on steel and aluminum were eroded by exemptions. After Canada and Mexico agreed to his demand for a revamped North American trade deal in 2020, they avoided the import taxes on the metals. Other U.S. trading partners had import quotas supplant the tariffs. And the first Trump administration also allowed U.S. companies to request exemptions from the tariffs if, for instance, they couldn't find the steel they needed from domestic producers.",
      "While Mr. Trump's tariffs could help steel and aluminum plants in the U.S., they could raise prices for the manufacturers that use the metals as raw materials. Economists also say the gains to the steel and aluminum industries were more than offset by the cost they imposed on \"downstream'' manufacturers that use their products.",
      "At these downstream companies, production fell by nearly $3.5 billion because of the tariffs in 2021, a loss that exceeded the $2.3 billion uptick in production that year by aluminum producers and steelmakers, the U.S. International Trade Commission found in 2023.",
      "Mr. Trump sees the tariffs as leading to more domestic factories, and the White House has noted that Volvo, Volkswagen and Honda are all exploring an increase in their U.S. footprint. But the prospect of higher prices, fewer sales and lower profits might cause some companies to refrain from investing in new facilities.",

      "\"Today, United States Secretary of Commerce\u00a0@howardlutnick\u00a0and Premier of Ontario Doug Ford had a productive conversation about the economic relationship between the United States and Canada,\" Ford's account said in a post to X. \"Secretary Lutnick agreed to officially meet with Premier Ford in Washington on Thursday, March 13 alongside the United States Trade Representative to discuss a renewed USMCA ahead of the April 2 reciprocal tariff deadline. In response, Ontario agreed to suspend its 25 per cent surcharge on exports of electricity to Michigan, New York and Minnesota.\"",
      "Moments after the Ford-Lutnick joint statement was issued, the president told reporters he's considering dialing back the 50% tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum imports he announced earlier, saying he's \"looking at it\" and could \"make a different decision.\"",
      "On Tuesday morning, Mr. Trump said he would double the levy on all steel and aluminum imports beginning Wednesday, citing Ontario's electricity surcharge as the reason for the price hike.",
      "\"Based on Ontario, Canada, placing a 25% Tariff on 'Electricity' coming into the United States, I have instructed my Secretary of Commerce to add an ADDITIONAL 25% Tariff, to 50%, on all STEEL and ALUMINUM COMING INTO THE UNITED STATES FROM CANADA, ONE OF THE HIGHEST TARIFFING NATIONS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD,\" the president wrote on Truth Social Tuesday morning.",
      "The president also called on Canada to drop tariffs on various U.S. dairy products, and said he will be declaring a \"national emergency on electricity\" in the areas affected by Canada's electricity surcharge. New York, Minnesota and Michigan, which border Canada, were targeted by Ontario's surcharge.",
      "The president also reiterated his desire for Canada to become the United States' 51st state, a proposal Canadians oppose, suggesting the northern neighbor won't face tariff pressure if they acquiesce.",
      "\"The only thing that makes sense is for Canada to become our cherished Fifty First State,\" Mr. Trump wrote. \"This would make all Tariffs, and everything else, totally disappear. Canadians taxes will be very substantially reduced, they will be more secure, militarily and otherwise, than ever before, there would no longer be a Northern Border problem, and the greatest and most powerful nation in the World will be bigger, better and stronger than ever \u2014 And Canada will be a big part of that.\"",
      "Stocks\u00a0tumbled again\u00a0on Tuesday amid uncertainty over the president's tariffs regime and fears that the U.S. economy could slip into a recession.",

That's a big thing, and there are always periods of, it takes a little time. It takes a little time, but I think it should be great for us.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's tariff announcements on Canada, Mexico and China have rocked the stock markets and fueled concerns of an economic downturn. Canada received some welcome news Tuesday, after Lutnick told CBS News that the U.S. no longer plans to double tariffs against its northern neighbor on aluminum and steel.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-to-roll-over-an-old-401k/",
    "published": "Tue, 11 Mar 2025 17:38:30 -0400",
    "summary": "If deciding what to do with an old 401(k) plan has been on your to-do list, here are the key steps you should take to get it done.",
    "story": [
      "Aging 401(k)s are a little like the old clothes in the back of your closet. You know you should do something about them, but there they sit, mostly out of sight and mind.",
      "And so it is with your old 401(k). If deciding what to do with an old 401(k) plan has been on your to-do list for a while, here are the key steps you should take to get it done.",
      "Step 1: See how much you have saved",
      "If your balance in your former employer's 401(k) plan is over $7,000, you can leave the money behind in the old plan or roll the assets into an IRA or your new employer's 401(k).",
      "But if your balance falls below that $7,000 threshold, some of the decision-making may be out of your hands.",
      "Step 2: Decide whether to roll the money or leave it alone",
      "Assuming your balance is over $7,000, your next task is to decide whether to roll the money into an IRA or keep it inside a 401(k).",
      "I often recommend rolling over the assets from a former 401(k) into a no-fee IRA with a topnotch mutual fund company or discount broker. But some people value the extra creditor protections that can accompany 401(k) assets versus IRA assets, while others may prize 401(k)-specific investment options.",
      "If you think you will be better off leaving your money inside a 401(k) rather than rolling it over to an IRA, the next job is to conduct some research on your own 401(k) options.",
      "Even if you do decide to stay with a 401(k), you may need to decide whether you're better off staying put in your former employer's plan or that of your new employer.",
      "Step 3: If rolling over into an IRA, find the right options",
      "If a rollover to an IRA is the way to go, the next step is to identify the right brokerage firm or mutual fund company. Look for a firm that offers a breadth of high-quality investment options with no additional layers of fees for IRA investors. Target-date funds are an elegant, low-maintenance, and underutilized option.",
      "If you decide to roll Roth 401(k) contributions to an IRA or your current employer's 401(k), your new account will be Roth, too, meaning that you won't owe tax on qualified withdrawals.",
      "If you have traditional 401(k) assets, a rollover is also a good time to consider whether to convert those assets to a Roth account at the same time.",
      "Step 4: Fill out the necessary paperwork",
      "If you've decided to roll over your assets to an IRA, fill out the paperwork or online form to open the IRA. You'll then request a direct rollover from your 401(k) plan to the new IRA provider.",
      "The process may be a bit more cumbersome if you're rolling over to your current employer's 401(k).",
      "In both cases, make sure your 401(k) provider makes the check payable to the provider and sends it directly to them, rather than to you. If the check is made out to you, 20% of the balance will be withheld for income tax. You'll then have 60 days to get that money deposited into an IRA or another 401(k); if that deadline comes and goes, the distribution will count as a withdrawal and you'll owe ordinary income tax and a 10% early withdrawal penalty if you're not 55 or older.",
      "If you've decided to roll over your assets from an old 401(k) to another 401(k) or IRA, you'll also have to determine how you'll allocate those assets.",
      "If all of your retirement assets were in your old 401(k), a sturdy target-date fund is a one-stop, low-maintenance choice that you can hold into retirement. If your old 401(k) is just one of several accounts geared toward retirement, a rollover can be an ideal time to check up on how all the pieces fit together\u2014and where you have holes.",

    "published": "Tue, 11 Mar 2025 17:24:16 -0400",
    "summary": "The policy could lead to hardship for some elderly Americans, Social Security advocates say. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "Getting overpaid by Social Security will soon come at a high cost, with the agency saying Friday it's reinstating a plan to take 100% of a beneficiary's monthly check to claw back the money, up from the current 10% rate.",
      "The policy change highlights an issue that had caused financial hardship for some beneficiaries in years past, prompting the Social Security Administration under the Biden administration to limit clawbacks to 10% of a person's monthly benefit check.",
      "But the Trump administration's reversal could lead to deep financial strain for some senior citizens who find themselves caught up in the overpayment issue. While overpayments are rare, they are often the result of Social Security's own miscalculations \u2014 and can come as a surprise to beneficiaries, given that it can be difficult to know if you have been overpaid.",
      "\"People generally do not know they are overpaid \u2014 you were receiving benefits, assuming that the government was giving you the proper amount,\" Nancy Altman, president of Social Security Works, an advocacy group for the benefit, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"People are really desperate when they get a letter from the government saying, 'You owe $10,000' that they don't have.\"",
      "The Social Security Administration didn't respond to requests for comment.",
      "Here's what to know.",
      "How many people get overpayments from Social Security?",
      "Fewer than 1% of the Social Security Administration's payments are what the agency terms as \"improper,\" which can include both over- and underpayments, according to a 2024 report from its inspector general. As the report noted, while it's a small share of the overall $1.6 trillion in benefits paid each year, it still adds up to billions of dollars.",
      "From fiscal year 2015 to 2022, the Social Security Agency paid about $72 billion in improper payments, most of which were overpayments, the report noted. That represents 0.84% of total Social Security payments during that time.",
      "How do overpayments occur?",
      "The agency says that they are usually due to two issues:",
      "Beneficiaries don't update their earnings data or alert the agency to other changesSocial Security employees don't update beneficiaries' records in a timely way",
      "Beneficiaries don't update their earnings data or alert the agency to other changes",
      "Social Security employees don't update beneficiaries' records in a timely way",
      "Sometimes beneficiaries may not understand that they need to update the agency with new information, partly due to the complexity of the Social Security system, which has more than 20,000 pages of rules, the inspector general said in its 2024 report.",
      "And sometimes SSA employees, who must in some cases manually calculate complex benefits, also make mistakes, the report added.",
      "However, there are cases where seniors receive \"strategic overpayments,\" said Ed Weir, a former Social Security manager who runs a YouTube channel about the benefit.",
      "In a recent webcast about the issue, Weir noted that sometimes seniors who are under the full retirement age but who are still working after having claimed Social Security aren't sure if they'll bump up against the earnings limit of $23,400. Under its rules, Social Security will hold back $1 in benefits for every $2 in earnings above that threshold.",
      "Some seniors decide, \"'I'll let it ride, because I won't know until November or December if I'm going over\" that limit, Weir said.",
      "But seniors who now opt for a \"strategic overpayment\" could end up losing one or two months of benefits due to the new clawback policy, Weir added.",
      "When will the new policy go into effect?",
      "The SSA said it will start claiming 100% of benefit checks to cover new cases of overpayments starting on March 27.",
      "The withholding rate for people who had been overpaid before March 27 will remain at 10%, as will the rate for overpayments for Supplemental Security Income, a program for low-income seniors and disabled Americans.",
      "What happens to Medicare if your Social Security check is clawed back?",
      "Medicare coverage could be another pitfall for seniors whose benefit checks are subject to the 100% clawback, experts said. That's because most seniors pay for their Medicare Part B premiums by having it automatically deducted from their Social Security monthly checks.",
      "The Social Security Administration didn't respond to requests for clarification about the issue.",
      "It's unclear if seniors would have to arrange to pay for their Medicare premiums through another payment system, or if the SSA would allow them to pay for their health care first before clawing back the remaining money, Altman of Social Security Works said.",
      "\"If you are on Medicare, it means you might not pay your Medicare possibly, so you might lose your Medicare,\" Weir said. \"It's a trickle down effect.\"",
      "What if the clawback causes financial hardship?",
      "Prior to the Biden reform to pare clawbacks to 10% of a person's benefit check, some Americans had encountered financial hardship after receiving shock bills amounting to\u00a0thousands of dollars. Some people were even driven into homelessness after their benefits were stripped away, KFF reported in 2023.",
      "Beneficiaries have the right to request a waiver of overpayment recovery through\u00a0SSA form 632, Weir noted.",
      "\"Two things have to be met for the payment to be waived: No. 1, it's not your fault, and No. 2, you don't have the ability to pay,\" he said.",
      "You can also appeal the overpayment, in case you think the overpayment amount is incorrect or you disagree that you were overpaid, through SSA form 561.",
      "Lastly, you can also request a different payment amount if you can't meet your living expenses due to the repayments, the SSA says.",
      "\"With Social Security, if you disagree with the decision, appeal it,\" Weir said on his webcast. \"Always appeal everything.\"",

    "story": [
      "A columnist who has worked at The Washington Post for four decades resigned on Monday after she said the newspaper's management decided not to run her commentary critical of owner Jeff Bezos' new editorial policy.",
      "\"It breaks my heart to conclude that I must leave,\" Ruth Marcus, who has\u00a0worked\u00a0at the newspaper since 1984, wrote in a resignation letter.",
      "Her exit is the latest fallout from the billionaire owner's directive that the Post narrow the topics covered by its opinion section to personal liberties and the free market. The newspaper's opinions editor, David Shipley, had already resigned because of the shift.",
      "The storied newspaper has been in a free fall, financially and editorially, over the past year. Marcus, who worked in the news and opinion departments during her career, is \"the bedrock of The Washington Post, embodying the history of the place as well as the talent and accomplishments of its journalists,\" said Paul Farhi, a former media reporter there.",
      "Marcus, who was a finalist for the\u00a0Pulitzer Prize for Commentary\u00a0in 2007, said that the Post's publisher, Will Lewis, declined to run her column, which she described as \"respectfully dissenting\" from Bezos' edict. It was the first time in nearly 20 years of writing columns that she's had one killed, she said.",
      "The decision \"underscores that the traditional freedom of columnists to select the topics they wish to address and say what they think has been dangerously eroded,\" she wrote. Her resignation letter was first reported by The New York Times.",
      "A Post spokesperson said Monday that \"we're grateful for Ruth's significant contributions to The Washington Post over the past 40 years. We respect her decision to leave and wish her the best.\"",
      "While Bezos and Lewis have the right to make such decisions \u2014 they're the bosses \u2014 \"that has not been the tradition,\" Farhi said. He likened it to how the Justice Department, while technically under White House control, has generally operated independently. Editorial writers and columnists, paid to give their opinions, usually decide what to write, he said.",
      "The danger is that a decision by the publisher not to allow a column to go forward can make readers question whether the viewpoints of writers are truly their own, he said. Worse yet, it could taint the news department, which by most accounts is aggressively covering the new administration.",
      "Shortly after the editorial page decision was announced nearly two weeks ago, another Post story on the issue, by media columnist Erik Wemple, was scrapped, according to the Gene Pool, a blog written by former Post writer Gene Weingarten. Wemple declined comment on Monday.",
      "In January, editorial cartoonist Ann Telnaes resigned after her work depicting Bezos and other billionaires genuflecting before a statue of President Donald Trump was rejected, a decision Shipley explained at the time was because it was repetitive of other opinion pieces.",
      "Under executive editor Matt Murray, the Post has also said it would refrain from having its journalists write about issues involving the newspaper, a decision Wemple said in a chat with readers in January that \"I couldn't possibly dissent (from) more strongly.\"",
      "The Post's opinion section on Monday included an editorial opposing Mexico's $10 billion lawsuit against firearms manufacturers, a case before the U.S. Supreme Court. Columnists Max Boot wrote about Trump and Russia, Perry Bacon Jr. about Democratic resistance to Trump centering in the states, Phillip Bump on whether Trump would pay a political price for unpopular policies and Jim Geraghty about violence in Syria.",
      "The Post, which made money during the first Trump administration, has been losing money in recent years and its internal strife largely began last June, when Sally Buzbee resigned as executive editor rather than accept a newsroom reorganization. Several prominent Post journalists \u2014 among them Ashley Parker, Josh Dawsey, Philip Rucker, Matea Gold, Jackie Alemany, Michael Scherer and Will Sommer \u2014 have left for other jobs.",
      "Bezos' decision last fall that the Post would not endorse a presidential candidate \u2014 after the editorial staff had prepared to support Democrat Kamala Harris \u2014 led to an exodus of subscribers that the newspaper is fighting to recover from.",
      "Marty Baron, the Post's executive editor when Bezos bought the paper in 2013, wrote last week in the Atlantic that Bezos \"handled his ownership admirably for more than a decade. But his courage failed him when he needed it the most.\"",
      "Marcus' resignation on Monday overshadowed a newsroom reorganization plan introduced by Murray, including separating workflows for the Post's digital and print products.",

      "\"Regular maintenance checks are scheduled to ensure it is captured early and the right corrective actions are put in place in a timely manner to mitigate the situation,\" an Airbus spokeswoman told CBS News in a statement. \"The A220 fleet's airworthiness remains intact.\"",
      "Sources familiar with the problem said the corrosion has been found on some passenger seat fittings and certain wing components, including what's known as the wing-to-body fairing, which is designed to minimize drag where the wing and body of the plane meet. It essentially acts as an aerodynamic cover over that junction and is not structural in nature.",
      "\"The FAA is aware of the issue and is ensuring airlines address it,\" an agency spokesman confirmed to CBS News in a brief statement.",
      "Delta Air Lines, the world's largest A220 operator, told CBS News it has observed the issue with some passenger seat fittings that require additional inspection and lubrication.",
      "The Atlanta-based carrier said the issue is not impacting scheduled A220 flights and has not resulted in cancellations.",
      "\"Delta has a sophisticated aircraft maintenance apparatus that is always-on and has many layers to ensure that every aircraft in our fleet is safe to fly by meeting or exceeding standards governed by our regulators,\" a company spokesman told CBS News. \"There is broad consensus by our technical experts that these issues aren't surprising especially for a new, clean-sheet aircraft and pose no major concerns.\"",
      "The airline said while it is aware some A220 carriers may be finding corrosion in the wing-to-body fairing structure, so far Delta mechanics have not found it on their fleet.",
      "JetBlue and Breeze Airways also fly dozens of A220s along with a host of international carriers, including Air Canada, Air France and Swiss Air.",
      "\"We are aware that some areas of the A220 have experienced corrosion and are proactively taking measures to mitigate these concerns,\" a Breeze spokesman told CBS News. \"The safety of our Guests is our first priority, which is why Breeze performs regular maintenance inspections on all of its aircraft to ensure airworthiness.\"",
      "And a JetBlue spokesperson told CBS News, \"All JetBlue aircraft are regularly inspected and maintained to ensure their safety and reliability. JetBlue is working closely with Airbus to proactively address corrosion on certain areas of some A220 aircraft. This does not impact the reliability of our A220 fleet.\"",
      "The A220 was subject to a 2021 airworthiness directive to address corrosion and wear in wing components known as slat tracks that were likely caused by insufficient grease being applied to the component during production. The directive called for additional inspections to monitor the amount of grease applied to the slat tracks.",
      "Sources told CBS News the new issues go beyond the focus of that 2021 order from Transport Canada.",
      "The plane was originally developed by Bombardier as the C-series before being sold to Airbus due to financial headwinds facing Bombardier. The plane is built in Quebec and Mobile, Alabama.",
      "The A220 seats between 100 and 150 passengers with five-seat rows. It's seen as a replacement for larger regional jets like the Embraer 190 and aging Boeing 717 jets.",
      "Because the plane was developed in Canada, it was initially certified by regulators there. The FAA and European Union Aviation Safety Agency validated the certification but would not typically be the lead agency on an issue like this.",

    "published": "Tue, 11 Mar 2025 09:24:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Southwest Airlines is ending its free checked bags policy for many passengers. Some experts think customer loyalty could suffer.",
    "story": [
      "Southwest Airlines boasts that its passengers' \"bags fly free\" \u2014 but not for long.",
      "Starting May 28 \u2014 just in time for the busy summer travel season \u2014 only Southwest's most elite Rapid Rewards A-List Preferred members and passengers who book their top-tier Business Select fares will receive two free checked bags. Frequent flyer A-List Members, Southwest-branded credit card holders and other select customers will be allowed one checked bag.",
      "Everyone else will be charged for their first and second checked bags on flights booked on or after May 28, the carrier says.",
      "\"Just another airline\"?",
      "It's a break with Southwest's 54 year history \u2014 one that could undermine customer loyalty to the carrier, according to experts.",
      "\"This is how you destroy a brand. This is how you destroy customer preference. This is how you destroy loyalty. And this, I think, is going to send Southwest into a financial tailspin,\" airline industry analyst Henry Harteveldt, of Atmosphere Research Group, told CBS News senior transportation correspondent Kris Van Cleave. \"Southwest, with these changes, becomes just another airline.\"",
      "Just last September, Southwest CEO Bob Jordan told Van Cleave bags would continue to fly without charge.",
      "\"Bags will still fly free,\" Jordan said. \"It's the third thing customers look for after fare and schedule: Bags fly free, on us. Ninety-seven percent are people who are aware of our policies. So it's a huge consumer advantage. So bags will absolutely fly free.\"",
      "But when pressed if they'd always fly free, he acknowledged, \"Well, never say never. \u2026 It's like saying open seating would never change 20 years ago. Consumer preferences change, but from everything that we see, there's no reason to reconsider this at all, especially right now.\"",
      "\"When 97% of your customers say they fly you because of your 'bags fly free' policy and you make dramatic changes to it, you are telling almost all of your customers, 'Your business doesn't matter to us anymore,'\" Harteveldt said. \"We are watching an airline self-destruct. This is the equivalent of deliberately sailing a ship into an iceberg.\"",
      "The cost of a checked bag hasn't been announced but airline sources say it will be competitive with other carriers.",
      "In comments at a JPMorgan Chase online event, United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby said Tuesday that Southwest's baggage policy shift is like \"the slaying of a sacred cow,\" while adding that it could boost the discount carrier's profit margins.",
      "\"I view it as a big deal because it feels more a financially driven, results driven airline than it's ever been before,\" he said.",
      "Delta President Glen Hauenstein, who also spoke at the JPMorgan conference, added that he thinks some Southwest customers could now be \"up for grabs\" because of its move away from free bags.",
      "Mounting financial pressure",
      "The move comes as Southwest, the nation's fourth-largest airline, has been under intense pressure from an activist investor to improve its financial performance after struggling to keep pace with changing customer preferences post-pandemic.",
      "Southwest recently announced its first ever layoffs, launched its first redeye flights, and intends to end its long-running open seating policy next year. Instead, the airline will offer seat assignments and sell extra legroom seats for an additional fee.",
      "Also announced Tuesday are changes to Southwest's Rapid Rewards frequent flyer program \u2014 increasing the points flyers get for booking higher-priced Business Select fares while reducing the points earned on less expensive \"Wanna Get Away\" and \"Wanna Get Away Plus\" fares. The airline will also start dynamic or variable pricing for points redemption across higher and lower demand flights.",
      "What's more, starting May 28, Southwest will add a heavily discounted basic economy fare class that will guarantee a flyer a seat on a plane but will likely come with restrictions similar to other carriers' basic economy offerings.",
      "In a video statement Tuesday morning, Jordan said the changes \"will help us return to the levels of profitability we all expect, and to support our collective long term success. It's also about adapting to what our customers want.",
      "\"Many things have changed post-Covid: the loss of short-haul demand, a rise in premium demand, and a change in customer preferences.\"",
      "Jordan said the goal is to secure Southwest's future.",
      "\"We are more than the logo on our planes,\" he said. \"Our DNA isn't open seating, or even bags fly free. It's a dedication to service.\"",
      "Harteveldt says, \"More choice is always a good thing. More low fares are always a good thing. And Southwest is large enough that if they use their basic economy fares in the right way, and I believe they will, they may force other airlines to be more aggressive in their pricing.\"",
      "Southwest is the last major U.S. airline to offer a basic economy product, which carriers launched to compete with ultra-low cost airlines like Frontier and Spirit.",
      "While the offerings vary by airline, basic economy tickets often come without an advance seat assignment, tend to be in the last boarding group and may limit the number or size of carry-on luggage. Checked bags and other perks come with a cost. It's been a hit for airlines. United Airlines reported basic economy revenue jumped 20% last year.",
      "\"Southwest Airlines remains committed to its core tenets \u2014 amazing people who deliver great hospitality to all Southwest customers, a strong network with the most nonstop flights within the U.S., and a loyalty program that gives real value to Rapid Rewards Members,\" the carrier said in a statement.",
      "But is that the Southwest that people know?",
      "\"Yes,\" Harteveldt said. \"This change is just so unlike Southwest. And it really is something that I worry could be far more financially damaging to the airline than helpful.\"",

      "Virginia-based farmer John Boyd Jr., president of the National Black Farmers Association, told CBS MoneyWatch that Mr. Trump's trade conflict with China hits farmers like himself hard.",
      "For one, Mr. Trump's earlier flip-flopping on his tariff policy vis-a-vis Mexico and Canada \"has cast a web of uncertainty around agriculture,\" Boyd told CBS MoneyWatch. \"You are really shaking at the root of all the major commodities that we produce in the U.S., because we are a market-driven industry.\"",

      "He explained that farmers across the U.S. are grappling with high input costs, including the price of seeds, fertilizer, chemicals, fuel and equipment costs needed to run their farms. Meanwhile, commodity prices are low.",

      "Wayne-Sanderson Farms received more than $600,000 from the USDA's bird flu assistance program to replace three flocks the company culled after discovering bird flu cases in 2023 and 2024.",
      "Singleton says the checks are an important investment to help the farms his company sponsors get back on track.",
      "\"It's a partnership with the farmers, and the consumer, and our company, to make sure we can continue to feed America,\" he says. \"It would be very difficult to get a farmer to take a risk like that without a farm partner like Wayne-Sanderson Farms. So that's where we step in. We make sure that we do our part, our due diligence, help them get back up to speed, and work to make sure those funds are available to them.\"",
      "Culling flocks and shielding them from bird flu",
      "The process of culling is arduous. Singleton says his company sprays a foam agent over the affected chickens to kill them quickly.",
      "\"Different farms and different companies have different methods,\" he said. \"We use a humane method to euthanize all the birds. It's all supervised by regulatory folks and our teams.\"",
      "\"Ours is an approved, USDA-approved method where a foaming agent used, and it's very quick,\" Singleton continued. \"So, those birds have to be disposed of. The house itself has to be cleaned up and sanitized. So it's a long process, and it takes awhile for the farmer to get back up and running. So we work with them directly to make sure that happens.\"",
      "Singleton says there are several proactive measures his company is taking to protect farms from exposure in the first place.",
      "Biosecurity measures are so tight for Wayne-Sanderson Farms, our CBS News cameras were not allowed inside a farm or facility.",
      "\"It just takes one vector to infect a flock so, from the time people come to the farm, using disinfectant sprays, wearing coveralls, wearing personal protective gear, goggles, those kinds of things \u2014 limiting the type of people, the number of people,\" Singleton explained. \"We make sure our people have the equipment, they have the chemicals, the disinfectants, and they have the knowledge. ... It's very critical. Every individual has to do their part to make sure that this doesn't happen.\"",
      "His company supports a recent proposal from other egg and poultry industry leaders to allow broiler eggs \u2014 eggs typically used to hatch chicks \u2014 to be used in consumer products amid the national shortage of traditional eggs.",
      "After a law change in 2009 that stipulated that eggs must be refrigerated sooner if sold into the consumer market, broiler egg producers were no longer able to send excess broiler eggs to consumer companies needing them for things like cakes and pies, because broiler eggs are typically stored at a higher temperature during the first 48 hours prior to shipment.",
      "Singleton says his company throws out 560,000 broiler eggs a week \u2014 about 2% of the total 26 million broiler eggs Wayne-Sanderson Farms produces.",
      "If the Food and Drug Administration were to allow the broiler eggs to be used in consumer products, Singleton says, it would be a win-win.",
      "\"We certainly want to do our part to help feed the country and (solve) a need where a need is there; certainly (that) would help us from a waste standpoint and just from employees having to work on that particular aspect of it,\" Singleton said. \"So, it's really just a cost savings and an efficiency savings and putting food back into the marketplace for consumers.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News, the Food and Drug Administration says it is still considering the proposal.",
      "A smaller farm's approach in the bird flu saga",
      "Another company currently able to fill the need is a small independent farm in the northern Alabama city of Madison called Southard Farms.",
      "It has been in co-owner Keith Southard's family for five generations. Southard turned the farm into a pasture-raised poultry, egg and pork production operation in 2019 and never dreamed his business would be booming so soon.",
      "He says over the last month, his phone has been ringing off the hook with restaurants seeking eggs.",
      "\"It's been it's been crazy. It's been busy. My phone rings constantly,\" Southard said. \"Huge, huge opportunity for growth, and people are searching now ... not just to find eggs but something different \u2014 to find good eggs, fresh, local, that they don't just depend on a store to provide them; they know where it's coming from.\"",
      "Southard's father grows grows crops on the farm and they in turn use the crops as feed for his chickens.",
      "He has 900 laying hens for eggs and 700 broiler chickens \u2014 or chickens used for meat.",
      "Right now, Southard's hens lay about 400 eggs a week. A few weeks ago, Southard signed a contract with a restaurant in Birmingham to sell it 500 dozen eggs a week. Southard says he expects his total egg production in the next few months will be just under 1,000 dozen a week to meet the demand.",
      "Unlike in traditional egg farms, where laying hens are kept in an indoor warehouse, Southard's chickens live an outdoor lifestyle, rotating regularly onto fresh grass to graze. He says the pasture-raised format keeps his chickens' immune systems stronger.",
      "\"No medicines needed to keep them going. So, we just use nature's benefits,\" Southard says.",
      "However, the outdoor living could make them more susceptible to coming into contact with wild birds that could be carrying the avian (bird) flu.",
      "\"There's always that risk,\" Southard says. \"We just hope that it doesn't affect us.\"",
      "Last year, Southard had to cull his flock after chickens got hit with a bacterial infection, different than bird flu, called mycoplasma. He says the experience was devastating.",
      "\"I noticed a few symptoms, and then within three days, we went from a normal amount of eggs per day to almost zero, and it was very similar symptoms to the avian flu, so (we) immediately took the hens to the state lab for testing ... and once we got the results in, there really wasn't any answer but to just cull the flock and start over,\" Southard recalled.",
      "He said he and his farmhand had to personally kill each chicken by cutting their throats to make it as quick and painless for the birds as possible.",
      "\"Nothing I want to see again, that's for sure,\" Southard said.",
      "Because mycoplasma is not considered a \"highly-pathogenic\" disease, he did not qualify for the USDA's program to receive a check to help him finance the replacement of his chickens.",
      "\"We just bared through it and kept going,\" Southard says.",
      "And kept going he did.",
      "Southard took us to Farm Burger in Huntsville, Alabama, one of the restaurants that uses his chicken meat and eggs. The staff affectionately calls out, \"The Chicken Man's here!\" upon his arrival to deliver his product in person each week.",
      "The restaurant's co-owner and manager says Southard has been a blessing to his business because Southard has kept his prices low at a time when other restaurants in neighboring states have seen egg prices more than double in the last few months.",
      "Low prices for the restaurant also mean costs don't have to be passed on to customers.",
      "A CBS News analysis of federal data found some farms received large checks from the USDA indemnity and reimbursement program after culling their flocks last year \u2014 one egg producer received $10 million.",
      "Asked his thoughts about the taxpayer expense, Southard said, \"I think there's probably, there's definitely a question there about when USDA should get involved or not. So, I think that should be looked into to some more, because obviously we see still these big supply problems. So, I don't think we have the right answer yet, but it should be looked into some more.\"",
      "With supply issues and high egg costs expected at least another year, Southard says it's important to protect small farms.",
      "\"Small farmers like us, family farms, play a key role, because it takes away the big consolidation that's happened and spreads out the risk where you have more farms across the state or country and more farmers,\" Southard says. \"So, if one gets hit, it's not as big of an effect on the whole supply chain.\"",

      "The IRS is drafting plans to cut its workforce by as much as half through a mix of layoffs, attrition and incentivized buyouts as part of President Trump's efforts to shrink the size of the federal workforce. The administration is closing agencies, laying off nearly all probationary employees who have not yet gained civil service protection and offering buyouts to almost all federal employees through a \"deferred resignation program\" to quickly reduce the government workforce.",
      "Already, roughly 7,000 probationary IRS employees with roughly one year or less of service were laid off from the organization in February.",

    "summary": "The Senate plans to take up a House-passed bill to fund the government through September beginning on Friday, which needs the support of Democrats to move forward.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Senate Democrats are considering a plan that would pave the way for a GOP bill to keep the government funded for six months in exchange for a doomed-to-fail vote on their own 30-day alternative, facing an uncomfortable choice between allowing the Republican measure to pass or letting the government shut down.",
      "The Senate plans to take up the House-passed bill to fund the government through September beginning on Friday. Republicans need 60 votes to invoke cloture and advance the measure, meaning it will need the support of Democrats to get to a vote on final passage.",
      "With government funding set to expire on Friday night, Democrats find themselves in the position of being able to block the GOP bill, but also wary of the government shutdown that would ensue if they do so. Democratic leaders are instead pushing for a 30-day funding extension that would allow more time for negotiations on new spending bills \u2014 a nonstarter, given Republican control of the House and Senate.",
      "A possible solution began to emerge after Senate Democrats met on Capitol Hill on Wednesday. The plan would call for Democrats to provide the votes needed to advance the GOP bill in exchange for a vote on an amendment with their own one-month stopgap measure, which would almost certainly fail. Democrats who oppose the GOP version could then vote against its final passage. Some members see it as a way to save face while also avoiding a shutdown.",
      "\"I think we're going to all be 'no' on cloture unless we get an agreement to propose at least this 30-day clean [continuing resolution] amendment and maybe a couple of others,\" Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia told reporters Thursday morning. \"So we'll be 'no' on cloture unless we get an agreement to do that. I'm not aware of whether the Republicans have agreed to that yet, but we'll be 'no' on cloture if we don't get it, and I think that's a unified position.\"",
      "The House approved the six-month funding measure on Tuesday largely along party lines, sending the funding fight to the Senate.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters Thursday morning that his office has been in touch with Minority Leader Chuck Schumer's staff, but Democrats haven't made a formal offer. Thune noted that if Democrats want a vote on the 30-day continuing resolution in exchange for helping Republicans reach the 60-vote threshold on the House-passed bill, Republicans are \"open to that.\"",
      "\"We're waiting for them to decide what they want to do,\" he said. Thune filed cloture on the House-passed measure Thursday night, setting up a Friday vote.",
      "Democrats emerged from Wednesday's meeting touting their alternate plan that would fund the government until April 11. Schumer warned Republicans that they do not have the votes to approve the House-passed stopgap measure, which increases defense spending and funding for veterans' health care, while decreasing non-defense spending below 2024 levels.",
      "\"Funding the government should be a bipartisan effort. But Republicans chose a partisan path, drafting their continuing resolution without any input \u2014 any input \u2014 from congressional Democrats,\" Schumer said.",
      "Although efforts to fund the government usually find bipartisan support, Democrats widely oppose the measure and have expressed frustration with the spending reductions, while warning that it would give the Trump administration and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency even more latitude to carry out cost-slashing efforts. The possibility of forcing a shutdown is one of the few points of leverage Democrats have as the minority in both chambers.",
      "But Democrats also fear the fallout of a lapse in funding, which could serve as the pretext for the Trump administration to make even deeper cuts across the federal workforce. Some Senate Democrats see the plan to vote for cloture but against final passage as a way to thread the needle, while others have argued that a vote on the short-term continuing resolution isn't for show.",
      "Sen. Jeff Merkley, an Oregon Democrat, said the approach isn't a gimmick, noting the bipartisan work that has been done so far on new funding bills that would go by the wayside with the House-passed funding extension.",
      "\"What would be an absolute crime is to support a House bill written only by Republicans,\" Merkley said, adding, \"You don't stop a bully by handing over your lunch money, and you don't stop a president like Trump from being authoritarian by proceeding to give in and give him more power again.\"",
      "Frustrations appeared to mount among Democrats throughout the day on Thursday, as they met again behind closed doors on the issue. As the meeting let out, a number of Democrats released statements on social media announcing that they would vote no on the House-passed continuing resolution, while they otherwise remained tight-lipped about their intentions.",
      "Meanwhile, some outspoken progressives have denounced the plan, saying the party is capitulating to the president and Republicans while getting nothing substantive in return.",
      "\"I hope Senate Democrats understand there is nothing clever about setting up a fake failed 30 day CR first to turn around & vote for cloture on the GOP spending bill,\" New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez posted on X on Thursday. \"Those games won't fool anyone. It won't trick voters, it won't trick House members. People will not forget it.\"",
      "Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, the sole Democrat who publicly said he would back the House-passed measure, likewise criticized the idea of exchanging support for cloture for a vote on the short-term continuing resolution.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump has made a number of inaccurate claims about Canada in the past week as he imposed new tariff hikes on the country and touted his plans for more.",
      "On Wednesday morning, Mr. Trump imposed a blanket 25% tariff on foreign steel and aluminum, significantly impacting Canada, the largest foreign supplier of these metals to the U.S. An additional 25% tariff on most Canadian goods is set to go into effect on April 2.",
      "Experts warn these hikes could lead to increases in consumer prices, but Mr. Trump has justified them in part by saying he's protecting American manufacturers and incentivizing Canada to crack down on drug crime.",
      "However, in interviews and social media posts, Mr. Trump has exaggerated the size of the U.S.trade deficit with Canada and the amount of fentanyl coming over the northern border. The president also misrepresented Canada's tariffs on U.S. dairy and lumber products.",
      "Here's a breakdown of some of these claims:",
      "Trump's misleading claim that Canada has tariffs above 200% on U.S. dairy products",
      "President Trump said March 7: \"In Canada, we find that they're charging us over 200% for dairy products\u2026 And when I left, we had that well taken care of, but under Biden they just kept raising it.\"",
      "Details: President Trump has suggested Canada unfairly put tariffs of over 200% on American dairy products during President Biden's term, but the level has been unchanged since before Biden took office.",
      "The over 200% tariffs on U.S. dairy products are only triggered if U.S. dairy exports exceed certain yearly duty-free limits, and U.S. dairy manufacturers say they have never been close to exceeding these limits.",
      "Additionally, these tariffs were negotiated during the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which Mr. Trump signed during his first term. Canada's published tariff lists for 2020 and 2025 show tariffs on U.S. dairy products have remained unchanged from the end of his first term through the end of President Biden's term. For example, both lists show the same tariff rate of 245.5% for any cheese products above the duty-free limit.",
      "Canadian Ambassador to the U.S. Kirsten Hillman told told CBS News the dairy tariffs are in place to \"protect our farmers and families.\" Canada is the second-largest importer of U.S. dairy, purchasing about $1.1 billion worth in 2024.",
      "The U.S. sold roughly double the amount of dairy to Canada as Canada sold to the U.S. last year, according to trade data from the U.S. Census Bureau.",
      "Trump's misleading claim that Canada has a \"tremendously high tariff\" on lumber while the U.S. charges \"a tiny fraction of that\"",
      "President Trump said March 7: \"They have a tremendously high tariff, give you the exact numbers in a little while coming out, on lumber. So, they sell us lumber, they have a tremendous tariff. They make it impossible for us to sell lumber or dairy products into Canada, but our numbers are a tiny fraction of that, almost non-existent.\"",
      "Details: On March 4, Canada imposed a tariff of 25% on softwood lumber from the U.S., a rate that is high compared to recent history.",
      "But Mr. Trump did not mention these tariffs are part of Canada's response to the 25% levies on most Canadian goods, including lumber, that the Trump administration initially announced in early March, which are now expected to take effect on April 2.",
      "Before this trade escalation, Canada had imposed zero tariffs on U.S. softwood lumber for years, according to Dustin Jalbert, a senior economist at Fastmarkets who covers wood products.",
      "\"It's certainly true that right now there are tariffs in place, but that was not the case before the kickoff of the trade war. These are retaliatory to what the U.S. instigated, if you will, in early March,\" Jalbert said.",
      "The U.S. had previously placed duties on imported softwood lumber, with tariffs on Canadian lumber rising from 8% to 14.5% in 2024.",
      "Trump's false claim that the U.S. has a $200 billion trade deficit with Canada",
      "President Trump\u00a0said\u00a0March 13:\u00a0\"In the case of Canada, we're spending $200 billion a year to subsidize Canada.\"\u00a0And on Feb. 26 he said: \"The tariffs will make it impossible for them to sell lumber or anything else into the United States. And all I'm asking to do is break even or lose a little bit, but not lose $200 billion.\"",
      "Details: Mr. Trump has repeatedly exaggerated the U.S.-Canada trade deficit, claiming it's as large as $200 billion.",
      "In fact, the U.S. trade deficit in goods and services with Canada in 2024 was closer to $35.7 billion, according to the latest trade data released from the U.S. Census Bureau on March 6.\u00a0 That trade deficit narrowed from $40.6 billion in 2023.",
      "For goods alone, the U.S. bought $70.6 billion more in goods from Canada than it sold in 2024, down from $72.3 billion in 2023.",
      "The overwhelming driver of the deficit with Canada is that the U.S. buys a lot of unrefined oil from the country, according to Julian Karaguesian, a lecturer at the department of economics at McGill University.",
      "\"A lot of Canadian economists say if you take out energy, Canada is running a small deficit with the United States,\" Karaguesian said.",
      "Trump's misleading claim that large amounts of fentanyl come from Canada",
      "President Trump said in his address to Congress\u00a0March 4: \"Much has been said over the last three months about Mexico and Canada, but we have very large deficits with both of them. But even more importantly, they have allowed fentanyl to come into our country at levels never seen before, killing hundreds of thousands of our citizens.\"",
      "Details: Mr. Trump has cited Canada's failure to halt the flow of illicit drugs as a reason for imposing tariffs, saying that fentanyl has been coming from the country \"at levels never seen before.\" He claimed, \"The fentanyl coming through Canada is massive.\"",
      "However, Mr. Trump overstates the amount of fentanyl coming across the northern border. In 2024, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol seized 43 pounds of fentanyl at the U.S.-Canada border, accounting for roughly 0.2% of all fentanyl seized by CBP that year. By contrast, approximately 21,100 pounds \u2014 about 96.6% of the total \u2014 was seized at the southern border.",

      "The president's executive action sparked immediate legal challenges, including in the cases that have now arrived at the Supreme Court. The challengers all argue Mr. Trump's order violates the Citizenship Clause of the 14th Amendment.",
      "Four U.S. district judges \u2014 in Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Washington \u2014 issued orders blocking enforcement of the president's attempt to end birthright citizenship. Efforts by the Trump administration to have U.S. appeals courts restrict the scope of three of those decisions to apply only the parties \u2014 which include 22 states, members of two organizations and seven individuals \u2014 while legal proceedings move forward have not been successful.",
      "In its request to the Supreme Court, the Trump administration said it should clear the way for the president's birthright citizenship order to partially take effect. Harris, who represents the federal government before the court, largely criticized the scope of the relief \u2014 which extends nationwide \u2014 and warned that these injunctions harm the executive branch's ability to carry out its functions.",
      "\"District courts have issued more universal injunctions and [temporary restraining orders] during February 2025 alone than through the first three years of the Biden administration,\" she wrote. \"That sharp rise in universal injunctions stops the executive branch from performing its constitutional functions before any courts fully examine the merits of those actions, and threatens to swamp this court's emergency docket.\"",
      "She noted that the decisions arising out of challenges to Mr. Trump's birthright citizenship order cover all 50 states and \"millions of aliens across the country.\"",
      "\"This court should declare that enough is enough before district courts' burgeoning reliance on universal injunctions becomes further entrenched,\" the acting solicitor general wrote.",
      "On the issue of immigration, specifically, Harris said the lower court orders impede the president's efforts to address what she said is a crisis at the southern border.",
      "\"The district courts' universal injunctions threaten to perpetuate those problems by holding out a nationwide incentive for illegal immigration: the prospect of American citizenship for the unlawful migrants' children and of derivative immigration benefits for the migrants themselves,\" she argued.",
      "Republicans and Democrats alike have sought these nationwide orders when challenging the policies of a president from the opposing political party, and decisions granting that broad relief have been criticized by administrations on both sides of the political spectrum.",
      "Even several members of the Supreme Court have expressed concern about the soundness of these broad orders, which bar the government from enforcing the policy at issue against anyone, anywhere in the country. In a\u00a02018 concurring opinion\u00a0in a\u00a0case involving Mr. Trump's travel ban\u00a0issued during his first term, Justice Clarence Thomas noted that district courts in Hawaii and Maryland entered preliminary injunctions that barred the Trump administration from enforcing the policy, and said he was skeptical they have the authority to do so.",
      "\"If their popularity continues, this court must address their legality,\" he said.",

      "An administration official who was asked about why Weldon's nomination was withdrawn responded, \"It was clear he did not have the votes in the Senate.\"",
      "Weldon, a vaccine critic, was set to appear before the Senate's health committee on Thursday for his confirmation hearing, and news of the withdrawal of his nomination came less than an hour before the hearing was to begin. Axios first reported news of Weldon's nomination being pulled.",
      "The committee was expected to question him about his long record of criticizing vaccines and the agency he was nominated to lead. Weldon is a physician and a former Republican member of Congress.",
      "In a statement obtained by CBS News, Weldon said that Health and Human Services Secretary\u00a0Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u00a0was \"very upset\" at his nomination being pulled. Weldon said he had received a call from the White House 12 hours before the scheduled hearing, informing him that the nomination would be withdrawn.",
      "\"Bobby Kennedy is a good man who really is passionate about improving the health of the American people,\" Weldon said. \"President Trump did a good thing in making him secretary of HHS.  Hopefully they can find someone for CDC who can survive the confirmation process and get past pharma and find some answers.\"",
      "Weldon said that Maine Sen. Susan Collins had told Kennedy she had reservations about his nomination and said the Republican senator's staff had been \"very hostile\" in a meeting with him.",
      "Collins' staff repeatedly accused him of being against vaccines, Weldon said, \"even though I reminded them that I actually give hundreds of vaccines every year in my medical practice.\"",

      "\"I did not express concerns to the White House. I had some reservations, but I certainly had not reached a final judgment,\" Collins said.",

      "Two people said Collins' staff had only asked Weldon how he would address the perception that he was against vaccines, but denied accusing him of being \"anti-vaccine.\"",
      "Weldon said that over 20 years ago, while in Congress, he raised concerns about childhood vaccine safety, and \"for some reason Collins staff suddenly couldn't get over that.\"",
      "He also claimed that another senator, Louisiana Republican Dr. Bill Cassidy, had also said he was anti-vaccine and had once asked for his nomination to be withdrawn.",

    "summary": "U.S. District Judge William Alsup extended relief to fired workers at the Departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture, Defense, Energy, Interior and Treasury.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge in California ordered six federal agencies to reinstate probationary employees who were fired last month, finding that their terminations by the Office of Personnel Management were unlawful.",
      "U.S. District Judge William Alsup in San Francisco handed down his order in a challenge brought by a group of unions against the Trump administration from the bench. He said that neither OPM nor its Acting Director Charles Ezell had the authority to direct the terminations across agencies.",
      "The order extends relief to fired workers at the Departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture, Defense, Energy, Interior and Treasury.",
      "\"It is a sad, sad day when our government would fire some good employee and say it was based on performance when they know good and well that's a lie,\" Alsup said at the end of a hearing on the unions' request for a preliminary injunction. \"That should not have been done in our country. It was a sham in order to avoid statutory requirements.\"",
      "The judge, who was appointed by President Bill Clinton, noted that federal law allows for agencies to engage in a \"reduction-in-force,\" the government's name for mass layoffs, but doing so comes with several requirements.",
      "\"It can be done if it's in accordance with the law,\" he said. \"This case is not about that. What this case is about is really an attempt to do a reduction-in-force\" through OPM. He said that having OPM, the federal government's chief human resources agency, direct departments to fire probationary workers was an \"easy way to get a reduction-in-force underway\" and a \"gimmick.\"",
      "The judge also criticized President Trump's firing of former special counsel Hampton Dellinger and attempts to get rid of members of the Merit Systems Protection Board, which oversees the administrative appeals of federal workers challenging their firings. A federal judge in Washington ordered that Cathy Harris, a member of the MSPB removed by Mr. Trump, return to her role. The Trump administration has appealed that decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.",
      "Alsup said Mr. Trump's removals of Harris and Dellinger were likely part of efforts to \"decimate\" the MSPB and ensure \"these employees will have no recourse.\"",
      "Spokespeople for the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Interior declined to comment. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement that a \"single judge is attempting to unconstitutionally seize the power of hiring and firing from the executive branch.\"",
      "\"The president has the authority to exercise the power of the entire executive branch \u2014 singular district court judges cannot abuse the power of the entire judiciary to thwart the president's agenda. If a federal district court judge would like executive powers, they can try and run for president themselves,\" she said. \"The Trump administration will immediately fight back against this absurd and unconstitutional order.\"",
      "The hearing",
      "The judge's order came at the end of a roughly two-hour-long hearing on the unions' request for a preliminary injunction. He repeatedly condemned the Trump administration's efforts to keep key officials, namely Ezell, from testifying in the early stages of the litigation.",
      "Ahead of the hearing, the Justice Department had withdrawn a declaration from Ezell. Lawyers for the unions said the move was part of an effort to keep him from having to answer their questions. In an order issued Monday, Alsup said that if Ezell failed to appear, the court \"will have to decide the sanction.\"",
      "The judge told Kelsey Helland, a Justice Department lawyer, that allowing the acting OPM head to be questioned by lawyers representing the unions \"will reveal the truth.\"",
      "Noting his decades on the bench, Alsup said, \"I know how we get at the truth, and you're not helping me.\" He accused the government of frustrating his ability to find out whether OPM directed agencies to fire probationary workers, or whether the agency heads acted on their own.",
      "But in the end, Alsup concluded that the human resources agency directed departments to get rid of the workers, with the exception of those considered \"mission critical.\" He rejected the Justice Department's attempts to argue that press releases announcing the terminations show the agency heads themselves were the decisionmakers.",
      "The Trump administration last month fired thousands of probationary employees, generally those who were in their roles for less than a year, as part of the president's efforts to shrink the size of the federal government.",
      "The notices informed the affected federal employees that they were being terminated for performance reasons. Shortly after, a group of unions representing government workers, the state of Washington and nonprofit organizations challenged the mass firings, arguing that OPM lacked the authority to order agencies to carry them out.",
      "Danielle Leonard, a lawyer for the unions, said during Thursday's hearing that the firings were not done at the discretion of each agency and argued OPM deliberately targeted probationary employees because they cannot challenge their terminations. She pointed to a Jan. 20 memo from Ezell noting that those on probationary periods \"can be terminated during that period without triggering appeal rights to the Merit Systems Protection Board.\"",
      "\"That's how insidious this action was,\" she said, adding that the plan from the beginning of Mr. Trump's second term was to fire all probationary workers because they did not have a means of challenging their removals.",
      "\"It's profoundly unlawful,\" she said.",
      "Leonard noted that probationary employees are not just those who are new to the workforce, but also includes those who recently received promotions.",
      "\"This action made Swiss cheese of the federal agencies at every level,\" she said, adding that it targeted people with \"decades\" of federal service and experience. \"They're gone. Turn in your keys.\"",
      "But Helland, the government's lawyer, argued that press releases from agencies show that their political leadership was taking credit for the terminations. He acknowledged that while OPM had a role in coordinating the efforts, it was the departments who made the final determinations of whom to fire.",
      "Alsup's latest order comes after he said last month said in separate decision providing temporary relief that the mass firings were likely unlawful\u00a0and ordered OPM to inform certain agencies that it did not have the authority to order the terminations.",
      "On the heels of that decision, Ezell and OPM issued revised guidance\u00a0telling department leaders that they do not have to take any \"specific performance-based actions\" regarding probationary employees.",
      "\"Agencies have ultimate decision-making authority over, and responsibility for, such personnel actions,\" the revised memo stated.",
      "In addition to the mass firings, Mr. Trump's efforts to drastically cut the size of the federal government included a so-called deferred resignation program, through which government workers OPM also gave federal workers the option to resign their positions but retain full pay and benefits until Sept. 30.",
      "The White House said roughly 75,000 employees accepted the offer to leave their government jobs, far fewer than the\u00a0200,000 it expected\u00a0to take the so-called buyout.",

      "In a post to Truth Social, the social media company the president owns, Mr. Trump said the U.S. will retaliate against the European Union after it announced Wednesday that it would be increasing tariffs on U.S.-made whiskey to 50%.",
      "\"If this tariff is not removed immediately, the U.S. will shortly place a 200% tariff on all wines, champagnes, & alcoholic products coming out of France and other E.U. represented countries,\" he wrote. \"This will be great for the wine and champagne businesses in the U.S.\"",
      "Mr. Trump accused the EU of being \"one of the most hostile and abusive taxing and tariffing authorities in the world.\"",
      "Since returning to office, the president has threatened tariffs, and imposed the levies, on a host of major U.S. trading partners. On Wednesday, he increased tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports to 25%, prompting retaliatory action from the EU.",
      "European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement Wednesday that the countermeasures from the EU are worth 26 billion euros, or $28 billion. The tariffs, set to take effect April 1, target a range of U.S. exports, including beef, poultry, bourbon, jeans and peanut butter.",
      "\"We deeply regret this measure,\" von der Leyen said. \"Tariffs are taxes. They are bad for business, and worse for consumers. They are disrupting supply chains. They bring uncertainty for the economy. Jobs are at stake. Prices will go up.\"",
      "The U.S. exported $1.2 billion in wine and related products in 2024, including more than $167 million to the EU, according to the Department of Agriculture. It is the top importer of wine, bringing in nearly $4.9 billion worth in 2023. France and Italy were the top partners for importing both wine and Champagne into the U.S.",
      "Champagne is a sparkling wine from the Champagne region in northeast France. If it is made outside of that region, it is called sparkling wine.",
      "Chris Swonger, president and CEO of the Distilled Spirits Council, a trade group representing the U.S. spirits industry, called the EU's announcement to reimpose heightened tariffs on American whiskey \"deeply disappointing\"",
      "\"Reimposing these debilitating tariffs at a time when the spirits industry continues to face a slowdown in U.S. marketplace will further curtail growth and negatively impact distillers and farmers in states across the country,\" Swonger said in a statement. \"We urge the U.S. and EU governments to come to a resolution that gets our spirits industry back to zero-for-zero tariffs.\"",
      "According to the Distilled Spirits Council, a retaliatory tariff imposed in 2018 during Mr. Trump's first term, caused exports of U.S.-made whiskey to drop 20%. But over the last three years, exports to the EU grew nearly 60% from $439 million in 2021 to $699 million in 2024, the trade group said.",
      "Since returning to the White House for a second term, Mr. Trump has made tariffs a key area of his economic agenda, though the levies have sparked concerns of a recession and roiled the stock market. The president declined to rule out the possibility of an economic downturn, telling Fox News in an interview that aired Sunday that \"there is a period of transition because what we're doing is very big.\"",
      "In an interview with CBS News, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Tuesday that Mr. Trump's economic policies are \"the most important thing America has ever had\" when asked whether they would be worth it if they lead to a recession. \"It's worth it.\"",
      "Lutnick added, \"The only reason there could possibly be a recession is because the Biden nonsense that we had to live with. These policies produce revenues. They produce growth. They produce factories being built here.\"",
      "The president's trade war escalated this month with 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, as well as an additional 10% tax on goods imported from China, taking effect last week. Beijing imposed retaliatory measures that went into force Monday that target U.S. farmers with levies of 15% on chicken, wheat and corn, and 10% on soybeans, pork, beef and fruit.",
      "The president, however, swiftly reversed course on the levies on imports from Mexico and Canada, pausing the tariffs covered under a 2020 trade deal negotiated during his first administration until April 2. That agreement, the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, covers the majority of goods imported from Mexico. Those that are not subject to the deal, however, still face tariffs.",
      "Mr. Trump has also exempted other products from his planned tariffs, including providing a one-month exemption to U.S. automakers that were bracing to be hit hard\u00a0by the levies on vehicle parts and components imported from Canada, Mexico and China.",

      "The lawsuit, in Massachusetts federal court, claims the layoffs are unconstitutional and asks the court to halt the Trump administration's effort to dismantle the department. President Trump has said he intends for Education Secretary Linda McMahon \u2014 a former wrestling executive who served as Small Business Administrator during his first term \u2014 to be the last person to hold that job before shuttering the 45-year-old agency, which would require an act of Congress.",

      "Online, Reitz has for years been an active advocate for conservative views and an avid supporter of the MAGA movement.",
      "\"Friendly reminder that 'birthright citizenship' is not a thing,\" he tweeted in 2021. He has called for rolling back reforms to mandatory minimum sentences, posting, \"make mandatory minimums great again.\" And he has inveighed against the federal right to an abortion, saying that \"roe's finding that there's a const right to abortion is garbage.\" In 2022, the Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade, leaving the legality of abortion to the states.",
      "But Reitz's social media monologue has at times veered into more provocative terrain. Some of those views have attracted the attention of Democrats in Congress during the confirmation process.",
      "Among them are comments he made suggesting it may be permissible in certain instances to defy a court order.\u00a0 At his confirmation hearing last month, Reitz was grilled by Democrats about what they saw as his online taunt of Judge Yeakel about his abortion ruling, challenging him to \"enforce it.\"",
      "At his confirmation hearing, Reitz responded to questioning about the post, saying, \"There is no hard and fast rule in all instances in which a litigant must comply with all or some or various parts of a judicial decision. It is so fact-law- and case-specific that one cannot speak generally.\"",
      "Some of his most extreme social media posts have eluded scrutiny until now. A review of hundreds of Reitz's posts in the past few years reveal incendiary views on a number of legal, social and political issues. Ahead of his confirmation, at least 4,000 tweets were deleted from his X feed, though it is unclear when the scrubbing took place.\u00a0 The tweets cover a cross-section of hot-button issues, from abortion to the murder of George Floyd to false claims Reitz made about the 2020 election.",
      "One of Reitz's posts suggested openness to arranged marriages.",
      "\"The more one realizes that marriage is more of a public institution than a private one, the more 'arranged' marriages (rightly understood and coupled with some limited/guiding principles) makes a lot of sense,\" he wrote.",
      "And in September 2020, Reitz seemed to want to resurrect the reputation of McCarthy, the a American demagogue who launched a furious campaign to discover and blacklist suspected communists across American society and whose name became synonymous with political witch hunts.",
      "White House spokesman Harrison Fields said in a statement, \"Aaron Reitz is an eminently-qualified nominee, who will join our incredible Attorney General Pam Bondi to ensure the Department of Justice delivers for the American people.\"",

      "President Trump is planning to invoke a wartime law known as the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 as soon as Friday to authorize the summary deportation of some migrants, including to Guantanamo Bay, escalating his government-wide immigration crackdown, multiple U.S. officials familiar with the plan told CBS News.",
      "The 227-year-old law\u00a0gives presidents the extraordinary power to order the arrest, detention and deportation of noncitizens who are 14 years or older and come from countries staging an \"invasion or predatory incursion\" of the U.S.",

      "Officials have made preparations to send suspected gang members to the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, soon after Mr. Trump invokes the Alien Enemies Act, two of the U.S. officials said. At Mr. Trump's direction, officials have been detaining some migrants awaiting deportation at the naval base, though the holding facilities were left empty earlier this week.",
      "Those subject to the Alien Enemies Act would not be allowed to have a court hearing or an asylum interview since they would be processed under an emergency, wartime authority \u2014 not immigration law. Instead, they would be eligible to be detained and deported, with little to no due process, under Title 50, the section of the U.S. code housing America's war and defense laws.",
      "CNN first reported Mr. Trump's plans to invoke the law as early as Friday.",
      "The Alien Enemies Act has been invoked only a few times in U.S. history, including during World War II, when the government used it to surveil and detain Italian, German and Japanese immigrants in the U.S.",
      "Its invocation to target migrants from countries with which the U.S. is not actively at war is almost certain to face legal challenges.",
      "Mr. Trump previewed his invocation of the Alien Enemies Act in an executive order issued on his first day back at the White House. It directed the secretaries of state and homeland security to plan for the potential invocation of the law and prepare facilities \"necessary to expedite the removal\" of those subject to it.",

Staff members who resigned for other reasons also have not been replaced due to a government hiring freeze, he said.",
      "The Amazon trial had been scheduled to start in September. The FTC is seeking to relax some of the deadlines in the case and a delay akin to a two-month continuance. The agency does not want to \"move the trial back more than a couple of months,\" Cohen said.",

      "Other factors could hamper staffers' preparations for the trial, he said. In April, FTC employees will have to spend time packing up and vacating their office building so they can potentially move into \"an abandoned USAID facility,\" Cohen said.",

      "Even in the case of staff turnover, the government still lacks the grounds to seek a delay since changes in legal teams happen often, Hueston argued.

Lawyers said in court Wednesday he was first brought to a detention center in New Jersey before being flown to another site in Louisiana.",

Furman did not rule Wednesday on an effort by Khalil's lawyers to have him moved closer to his New York home. In the meantime, Khalil will remain in detention in Louisiana.",

      "Kelsey received a \"full and unconditional pardon\" for his case and authorities were ordered to release him from prison immediately, according to a copy of the president's action provided by Kelsey's attorney.",

      "The 47-year-old pleaded guilty in November 2022 to charges related to his attempts to funnel campaign money from his state legislative seat toward his failed 2016 congressional bid.",
      "Kelsey was indicted in October 2021. He initially labeled the prosecution a witch hunt and blamed the Democratic administration of then-President Joe Biden. But when a co-defendant pleaded guilty the following October, Kelsey quickly did as well.",
      "He repeated his attack on the Biden administration Tuesday, saying, \"God used Donald Trump to save me from the weaponized Biden DOJ,\" referring to the Department of Justice. In 2017, during Mr. Trump's first term, Kelsey's campaign finance dealings spurred a complaint by the nonprofit Campaign Legal Center with the Federal Election Commission and the Department of Justice.",
      "Kelsey was unsuccessful in his March 2023 attempt to rescind his guilty plea.",
      "Kelsey had argued he entered the plea with an \"unsure heart and a confused mind.\" He noted that he and his wife had twin sons born in September 2022, and his father had terminal pancreatic cancer, then died in February 2023.",
      "Kelsey also accepted the plea deal because his then-attorneys advised that he would likely receive probation, according to a statement Wednesday from an attorney now representing Kelsey.",
      "U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw in Nashville denied the change of plea in May 2023. He expressed disbelief that Kelsey, a Georgetown University-educated attorney and prominent former state senator, didn't understand the gravity of pleading guilty.",
      "Crenshaw later denied another challenge in which Kelsey accused prosecutors of violating his plea agreement. However, that September the judge also allowed Kelsey to stay out of prison until his appeal was decided. Kelsey's challenge ultimately failed.",
      "Last month, Crenshaw denied another motion to remain free by Kelsey, who argued he had ineffective legal counsel and that his claim of innocence is supported by recordings by two key witnesses \u2014 the co-defendant, Joshua Smith, and former GOP Rep. Jeremy Durham, who was not charged. The judge responded that Kelsey had given an \"unconditional admission of guilt\" under penalty of perjury.",
      "Kelsey had another appeal pending as he received the pardon.",
      "Smith, a Nashville social club owner, pleaded guilty to one count under a deal that required him to \"cooperate fully and truthfully.\" He was sentenced to five years of probation.",
      "The indictment alleges that Kelsey, Smith and others illegally concealed the transfer of $91,000 \u2014 $66,000 from Kelsey's state Senate campaign committee and $25,000 from a nonprofit that advocated about legal justice issues \u2014 to a national political organization to fund advertisements urging support of Kelsey's 2016 failed congressional campaign. The scheme caused the political group to file false campaign finance reports and make illegal, excessive campaign contributions to Kelsey, the indictment says.",
      "Although the indictment does not name the national political organization, the Campaign Legal Center's 2017 complaint said the American Conservative Union was making coordinated independent expenditures with Kelsey's campaign. The American Conservative Union has said it has cooperated with investigators.",
      "Saurav Ghosh, the Campaign Legal Center's director of federal campaign finance reform, said Mr. Trump's pardon of Kelsey \"demonstrates an open hostility and contempt for accountability and the rule of law.\"",
      "Kelsey, an attorney from Germantown, was first elected to the General Assembly in 2004 as a state representative. He was later elected to the Senate in 2009. He didn't seek reelection in 2022.",

      "Most cases occur because a green card holder commits a crime, including violent crimes, marriage fraud, controlled substance abuse and other offenses. If they are convicted, typically after they serve their sentence in the U.S., they would face removal proceedings that involve going before an immigration judge, Leopold said.",
      "A person can also lose their permanent resident status because of \"substantiated charges of immigration fraud in the immigration process,\" Elora Mukherjee, a Columbia Law School professor and director of the university's Immigrants' Rights Clinic, said.",
      "Mukherjee said people whose green cards are being revoked are typically given a notice to appear before an immigration judge.",
      "\"They have the opportunity to either contest why they should be allowed to keep their status or concede that their status can be taken away,\" she said. \"Lawful permanent residents can't be stripped of their status in the United States without any due process.\"",
      "The severity of the crime may affect the judge's decision. In cases of violent crimes, \"deportation becomes nearly automatic,\" Leopold said. In some cases, an individual may be able to ask a judge to cancel their deportation. The judge would have to decide whether the person's conviction is outweighed by other considerations, such as community ties, family ties or their work in the U.S., he explained, but added, \"that doesn't apply to every case.\"",
      "The procedure for how a green card holder's status could be revoked is set by the Immigration and Nationality Act, Mukherjee said.",
      "Under the act, green card holders do not need to be convicted of a crime to be deported, Jaclyn Kelley-Widmer, an immigration law professor at Cornell Law School, told The Associated Press. For example, if there are reasonable grounds to believe they engaged in, or are likely to engage in, terrorist activities, they could be deported, she said.",
      "Another reason a green card holder could lose their status is if they leave the United States for too long.",
      "\"Typically if they stay out of the United States for more than a year,\" their status will be challenged when they come back, Leopold said.",
      "Green card vs. citizenship",
      "A green card holder is not a citizen. To become a naturalized citizen, they would need to apply and meet various requirements.",
      "Do green card holders have the same rights as U.S. citizens?",
      "Everyone in the United States is protected by the U.S. Constitution. This includes green card holders, visa holders and undocumented immigrants.",
      "But, unlike citizens, green card holders are susceptible to being removed if they violate their status in the U.S., Leopold said.",
      "What is the Immigration and Nationality Act?",
      "The Immigration and Nationality Act is a set of immigration law provisions enacted in 1952.",
      "The act includes numerous grounds for deportation, including a provision that says a non-citizen \"whose presence or activities in the United States the Secretary of State has reasonable ground to believe would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States is deportable.\"",
      "A government document obtained by CBS News shows this is the provision the Trump administration is using to justify Khalil's arrest.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt alleged on March 11 that Khalil has distributed \"pro-Hamas\" flyers. Hamas, a U.S. designated terrorist group that has governed the Gaza Strip since 2007, is responsible for the deadly Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel that sparked the war in Gaza.",
      "Khalil's attorney, Amy Greer, said in a statement his detention was illegal.",
      "\"He was chosen as an example to stifle entirely lawful dissent, in violation of the First Amendment,\" she said.",
      "Matthew Boaz, an assistant professor at the University of Kentucky's J. David Rosenberg College of Law, wrote in a Lawfare article\u00a0that \"one cannot simply be stripped of their residency, even by Secretary of State Marco Rubio.\"",
      "Cases go before a federal immigration judge, who works for the Department of Justice, \"so it's not an independent judiciary,\" Leopold said.",
      "\"The law requires that the government make its proof by clear and convincing evidence,\" which is the highest standard in civil law, but not as high as beyond a reasonable doubt, required in criminal cases, Leopold explained.",
      "The particular foreign policy provision referenced by the administration is rarely used, Leopold said, calling it \"a vestige of the Cold War.\"",
      "Where is Mahmoud Khalil being held?",
      "Khalil was arrested in New York by federal immigration authorities. He was first brought to a detention center in New Jersey and then flown to another site in Jena, Louisiana, his lawyers said.",
      "\"Louisiana is home to several ICE detention facilities and it's fairly common for non-citizens who are facing removal proceedings to be transferred to places like Louisiana due to available detention space in that state,\" Robin Nunn, a legal analyst and trial attorney, told CBS News 24/7 on March 11.",
      "Khalil's attorneys are trying to reverse his transfer to Louisiana, calling it \"blatantly improper.\"",

      "In August 2021, Tamim Satari raced to the Kabul International Airport to evacuate Afghanistan after working with the American military as an intelligence officer, helping U.S. forces coordinate aerial bomb campaigns against the Taliban. But in the chaos of the U.S. withdrawal, his wife and newborn son were left behind.",
      "\"It was so hard, and we didn't want to lose our small son,\" Satari said.",
      "He was not alone. Thousands of Afghan families were separated in the rushed withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan. Babies were passed across throngs of people and over fences, and families scrambled to get through the gates to the airport.",
      "Three years later, more than 10,000 families remain separated, according to Shawn VanDiver, the founder of #AfghanEvac, a nonprofit that worked with the State Department to create a path to reunite separated Afghan families.",
      "\"There's all these moms or dads or young children who are stuck here without their family,\" said VanDiver. \"These people are in danger because of us. And the least we can do is help them reunite.\"",
      "He says the number of children separated from their parents includes 2,800 unaccompanied refugee minors \u2014 children who made it to the U.S. but whose parents did not, or who were left behind as their parents fled.",
      "VanDiver works with the Office of the Coordinator for Afghan Relocation Efforts, known as CARE, a State Department program that was established to assist wartime Afghan allies immigrate to the U.S.",
      "Since 2021, the CARE program has facilitated travel for nearly 200,000 Afghans, according to documents reviewed by CBS News.",
      "This includes those with special immigrant visas who were wartime allies typically paid by the U.S. government. It also includes Afghan refugees who assisted the U.S. mission in military roles, as civil society members, or those who are family members of those who served.",
      "\"The truth is, is that every single person in the refugee pipeline and every single person in the [special immigrant visa] pipeline are somebody who took action in our name and are now in danger,\" said VanDiver.",
      "\"And these Afghans deserve everything that we can give to them because they protected us.\"",
      "After trying unsuccessfully to bring his wife and son over on his own, Satari connected with CARE in 2023 to get help facilitating their visa process. His wife, Shiba, and their son had escaped to Pakistan after she was threatened by the Taliban for continuing her work as a midwife while her husband was in the U.S.",
      "On Jan. 18, the weekend before President Trump's inauguration, Shiba and her son were flown to JFK airport in New York and then driven to Newark, New Jersey, for an emotional reunion with her husband. Tamim had not seen his son, now nearly 4 years old, since he was a newborn.",
      "The Sataris' family reunion at Newark Liberty International Airport was one of the last refugee reunions to take place.",
      "Three days later, Mr. Trump signed an executive order suspending the U.S. refugee program, stating \"the United States lacks the ability to absorb large numbers of migrants, and in particular, refugees, into its communities in a manner that does not compromise the availability of resources for Americans that protects their safety and security, and that ensures the appropriate assimilation of refugees.\"",
      "A federal judge ordered the administration to stop the ban, but since then normal refugee processing has not continued. In a recent court filing, lawyers for the administration said it would\u00a0 take time to restart refugee programs, since agencies have already cut contracts, reduced the workforce and frozen funding.",
      "In addition to Mr. Trump's executive order, Secretary of State Marco Rubio froze all federal funding for the programs that were providing travel for Afghans who had already been approved to resettle in the U.S. This means that anyone vetted and approved for travel \u2014 including those already holding special immigrant visas \u2014 cannot leave Afghanistan unless they are able to pay for the trip themselves.",
      "According to government documents reviewed by CBS, more than 40,000 Afghans who have been vetted and approved to leave Afghanistan are now in limbo, with their lives at stake.",
      "\"I've heard countless horror stories of torture and murder of these allies of the United States,\" said Republican Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas, who voted for the CARE program.",
      "\"I would urge the administration to take a look at this and to honor the commitment that we made to [our allies], and not break our promise, but let them know that we are going to protect them.\"",
      "But Mr. Trump and other Republican lawmakers have expressed concern that allowing Afghans into the U.S. makes the country more vulnerable to terrorism.",
      "McCaul and others who advocate for the program say the vetting is already extremely effective.",
      "\"You want to vet them again? Go ahead. But they've already been vetted, and probably the most thorough vetting in American history,\" McCaul told CBS News.",
      "Afghans who come to the U.S are reviewed by the State Department, Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. They go through several in-person interviews and their biometrics are checked against government databases, in addition to extensive medical screening.",

    "story": [
      "A federal judge on Wednesday temporarily blocked President Trump's attempt to retaliate against a law firm that represented Hillary Clinton, ruling that an executive order the president\u00a0signed last week unlawfully targeted the Perkins Coie law firm and violated its First Amendment rights.",
      "U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell issued a temporary restraining order that stops three parts of the executive order from being implemented against Perkins Coie \u2014 provisions that ban the firm's attorneys from entering government buildings, that restrict contact between federal officials and the firm's attorneys and that subject the firm's contracts with federal contractors to review by Trump administration agency heads.",
      "Dane Butswinkas, an attorney representing Perkins Coie, argued in court that the executive order is a \"wrecking ball\" and a \"tidal wave\" that would significantly damage the firm's ability to do work in Washington, D.C., in cases involving the federal government. Attorneys say there are thousands of ongoing cases related to over 90 government agencies. Butswinkas said that about 25% of the firm's work is related to government work.",
      "Perkins Coie sued the Trump administration this week, arguing that the executive order violated the firm's constitutional protections of free speech and association. The firm represented Clinton during her 2016 presidential campaign against Mr. Trump, and in the course of the campaign, contracted with a research firm that produced the infamous \"Steele Dossier.\" The controversial dossier contained salacious and unproven allegations highlighting alleged links between Russia, Mr. Trump and his associates.",
      "Butswinkas also argued that the executive order would have a chilling effect in law firms across Washington, hampering their abilities to assist clients without fear of retaliation for litigating against the president or his administration.",
      "In an unusual move, Attorney General Pam Bondi's chief of staff, Chad Mizelle, argued on behalf of the Justice Department.",
      "Mizelle argued that Trump has the executive power to \"find that there are certain individuals or certain companies that are not trustworthy with the nation's secrets,\" and that Trump's decisions to go after the law firm are \"not reviewable\" by a court of law.",
      "\"That's a different Constitution than I am familiar with,\" Butswinkas retorted in his closing, adding, \"If left unchecked, we'll be left in a country we barely recognize.\"",
      "Howell criticized the Trump administration's actions in her ruling from the bench, saying that it \"sends little chills down my spine\" that the Trump administration claimed it has the executive power to label people as threats and bar them from engaging with the government. She noted that many of the lawyers who worked on the Trump-related cases have since departed the firm, and the language was overly broad in targeting the firm.",
      "The executive order also stripped the security clearances of attorneys at Perkins Coie, but the law firm did not challenge that section in its suit.",
      "Perkins Coie is just one law firm that the Trump administration has targeted so far during his presidency. Last month, Mr. Trump signed another executive order that targeted Covington & Burling attorneys representing former special counsel Jack Smith, the federal prosecutor who brought criminal charges against Mr. Trump in a case involving his handling of classified documents and another regarding his actions in attempting to overturn the 2020 election.",
      "In an interview that aired Sunday on Fox News, Trump mentioned Perkins Coie, saying his administration has \"a lot of law firms that we're going to go after because they were very dishonest people.\"",

      "Washington \u2014\u00a0Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer warned Republicans on Wednesday that they do not have the votes to approve a House-passed stopgap measure to keep the government funded through September, with a fast-approaching Friday deadline to avert a government shutdown.",
      "\"Funding the government should be a bipartisan effort. But Republicans chose a  partisan path, drafting their continuing resolution without any input, any input, from congressional Democrats,\" Schumer said, while pushing for a vote on a shorter-term funding measure following a lengthy lunch meeting with his caucus to determine the path forward.",
      "House Republicans\u00a0approved the six-month funding measure\u00a0with the support of just one Democrat on Tuesday. The bill, known as a\u00a0continuing resolution, increases defense spending and funding for veterans' health care, while decreasing non-defense spending below 2024 levels. It also includes more funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement.",
      "With the House passage, the measure is now in the hands of the Senate, where Republicans, with a 53-seat majority, need support from Democrats to reach a 60-vote threshold to propel the measure to passage.",
      "Funding the government is usually a bipartisan effort. But Democrats widely oppose the measure, warning that it would give the Trump administration and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency even more latitude to carry out cost-slashing efforts, while expressing frustration with the spending reductions.",
      "But Democrats aren't generally inclined to let the government shut down, either. And the House opted to cancel votes Wednesday and leave town, in hopes of preventing the Senate from changing the continuing resolution or passing a different version before Friday's deadline.",
      "Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky has also pledged to oppose the House-passed measure, making support from at least eight Democrats necessary to pass the measure and send it to the president's desk.

      "After their lunch meeting Wednesday, Senate Democrats said they want to see a vote on a shorter-term funding measure that would give appropriators more time to flesh out new spending bills. On Monday, the top Democratic appropriators, Sen. Patty Murray of Washington and Rep. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, introduced a continuing resolution that would fund the government through April 11.",
      "\"I think people want to see a vote on the 30-day CR to let the process finish,\" Sen. Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, said after the meeting. \"I think there's still a chance, I believe, to get something done.\"",
      "Schumer then took to the Senate floor to outline that Democrats are \"unified on a clean April 11 CR that will keep the government open and give Congress time to negotiate bipartisan legislation that can pass,\" saying \"we should vote on that.\"",
      "Still, Democrats have limited leverage in the funding fight, and the move to deny votes may be a face-saving measure. And Senate Majority Leader John Thune expressed opposition to the short-term continuing resolution Tuesday, saying it continues to \"punt the problem down the road.\"",
      "\"At this point there's really one solution on the table,\" Thune said, noting that the House-passed stopgap measure keeps the government open and addresses core issues. \"We think it represents the best solution at the moment.\"",

      "In the memo, dated Tuesday, March 11, Zeldin said this action is in response to President Trump's executive order on \"ending radical and wasteful government DEI programs and preferences,\" as well as two other executive actions.",
      "The EPA confirmed the closures at regional offices.",
      "\"President Trump was elected with a mandate from the American people,\" Zeldin said in a statement provided to CBS News. \"Part of this mandate includes the elimination of forced discrimination programs.\"",
      "\"Our goal at EPA is going to be to remediate these environmental issues directly,\" Zeldin told CBS News at a press availability. \"We're not going to discriminate. We're not going to make people give us 1000 questions about their their background in order to qualify for support, we want everyone to qualify for support.\"",
      "It's not yet clear exactly how many people will lose their jobs with the EPA as a result of the closures. Exact staffing levels across the country are unknown, but sources tell CBS News there were roughly 200 total people employed at environmental justice offices in DC and the 10 regional locations. The EPA confirmed to CBS News that all employees in these regional offices will be placed on administrative leave.",
      "\"Generations of progress are being erased from our federal government,\" said Matthew Tejada, who was the deputy assistant administrator at the Office of Environmental Justice for over a decade before leaving the EPA in December 2023. \"The individuals with institutional knowledge and have long developed connections and trust within these communities are being erased.\"",
      "The EPA established the Office of Environmental Justice and External Civil Rights in 1992 under former President George H.W. Bush to address \"disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects on minority and low-income populations.\"",
      "The Office of Environmental Justice and External Civil Rights has undergone several reorganizations throughout the years, but it was broadly expanded in 2022 under former President Joe Biden. In September 2022, the office received a $3 billion grant from the Inflation Reduction Act that allowed it to become a national program with regional offices in 10 locations to expand the department's work within impacted communities that are harmed by environmental pollution.",
      "\"It will be incredibly hard to attract individuals who are brave enough to show their faces to these communities,\" said Tejada, who now serves as the senior vice president of environmental health at the Natural Resources Defense Council.",
      "Many of the neighborhoods served by the regional Environmental Justice offices have a mistrust of the government and restoring that relationship will be nearly impossible, Tejada said.",
      "\"The government is being shut down right in front of us and it is catastrophic and no one is calling it out,\" he said.",

    "published": "Wed, 12 Mar 2025 10:12:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Lakshmi Chilukuri helped create a pilot course on race, ethnicity and gender in biology and medicine.",
    "story": [
      "As universities around the country race to assess new federal policies geared toward ending programs related to diversity, equity and inclusion, known as DEI, one college administrator is in a potentially tricky position.",
      "Lakshmi Chilukuri is the provost of the University of California San Diego's Sixth College. She is also Vice President JD Vance's mother-in-law. Chilukuri helped create a pilot course on race, ethnicity and gender in biology and medicine, served on the university's biological sciences diversity committee, and has written proudly of her school's commitment to diversity.",
      "The university features its diversity efforts prominently on its website and a letter from Chilukuri to incoming students emphasizes the school's \"steadfast adherence to principles that drive equity, inclusion, and an embrace of diversity.\"",
      "\"As we come into the new academic year with the pandemic not quite yet in the rearview mirror, with issues of equity and systemic racism, anti-Blackness and anti-Asian racism yet unresolved, we have before us both opportunity and responsibility,\" Chilukuri wrote in the undated letter. The Internet Archive shows the letter was first posted in late 2021, with minor edits made over the next year. It has since remained as the main body of text on the Sixth College's \"About\" page.",
      "A crackdown on what President Trump and Vance call \"wokeness\" has been a hallmark of their administration's first weeks. Widespread scalebacks of DEI programs in academia, government and across corporations have marked some of the administration's earliest marquee victories.",
      "Vance said in a statement, \"I don't like DEI, and I'm proud of what our administration has done on that front.\"",
      "\"But I love my mother-in-law. If she doesn't share my views on DEI I suppose I'll have to do what 99 percent of Americans do when confronted with a family member who doesn't always agree with them: get over it,\" Vance said. \"I'll choose instead to focus on her kindness and the fact that she's an incredible mother and loving grandmother to the most important people in my life.\"",
      "Vance added, \"This story exists because CBS has decided that harassing my mother in law is a reasonable price in order to attack President Trump.\" Chilukuri did not reply to emailed questions. A spokesperson for the university declined to comment.",
      "The Trump administration has attacked DEI on college campuses with particular zeal, threatening investigations, lawsuits and canceled federal funding. A Feb. 14 \"Dear Colleague\" letter from the Department of Education to schools across the country warned that they risked federal funding if they continued to take race into account when making scholarship or hiring decisions, or include race as a policy factor in any \"other aspects of student, academic and campus life.\"",
      "The administration's anti-DEI campaign led a U.S. attorney to warn the Georgetown Law School that its students wouldn't be considered for jobs at his office unless the school renounced its DEI programs. Mr. Trump's alma mater, the University of Pennsylvania, has removed from its websites most references to diversity and inclusion, and on March 7, the University of Virginia's governing board voted to dissolve its office of diversity, equity and inclusion.",
      "Many corporations have followed suit, including CBS News' parent company Paramount, which in late February ceased using hiring goals related to race, ethnicity, sex or gender, among other policy changes related to DEI.",
      "Vance has been vocal about combatting DEI, speaking about it frequently since his earliest days in politics. In a 2021 speech, Vance, quoting Richard Nixon, said professors are \"the enemy,\" and called on Americans to \"aggressively attack the universities in this country,\" saying \"they care more about diversity, equity and inclusion than they do their own society.\" That view is shared by the president, and the White House has backed it up, issuing executive orders that threaten to withhold federal funding from institutions operating what it calls \"illegal\" DEI programs. It has not clarified exactly what that means.",
      "The president also ordered federal agencies to identify colleges with endowments over $1 billion that might be susceptible to investigation or lawsuits due to their DEI policies. UCSD's endowment is more than $1.4 billion, according to the UC San Diego Foundation's website. Last fiscal year, UCSD received more than $500 million in federal funds for research.",
      "Vance married Chilukuri's daughter Usha in 2014, and the couple have three young children. Vance said in a 2020 podcast interview that Chilukuri took a yearlong sabbatical from her work as a professor to help care for one of her grandchildren. He described Chilukuri and her husband \u2014 also a professor \u2014 as classic, doting grandparents.",
      "\"You can sort of see the effect it has on him to be around them, like they spoil him and sort of all the classic stuff that grandparents do to grandchildren,\" Vance said. \"But it makes him a much better human being to have exposure to his grandparents, and the evidence on this, by the way, is like super clear.\"",
      "Chilukuri has worked at UCSD for decades, rising through the ranks to become provost in 2018.",
      "\"Professor Chilukuri has a demonstrated record of commitment to undergraduate education, equity, and diversity,\" wrote the university's chancellor and executive vice chancellor in an announcement of her promotion to provost. They called Chilukuri \"a creative and dynamic educator.\"",
      "The popular professor, who also goes by \"Provost Chill\" and \"Dr. C,\" championed DEI initiatives at the school. A 2019 article on the UCSD website examined BILD 60, a class that the school's 2024-2025 catalog lists as satisfying students' DEI course requirement.",
      "The course, called \"Exploring Issues of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion in Relation to Human Biology,\" was developed because members of the school's Division of Biological Sciences' Diversity Committee, including Chilukuri, \"recognized the need for a course that looked at DEI issues through a scientific lens,\" according to the article.",
      "Her commitment to inclusiveness was apparent long before she was a provost. Former student Kjeld Aamodt recalled fondly taking a freshman year lecture taught by Chilukuri nearly two decades ago.",
      "\"It was a huge class. It was probably 500 people in that class, but I remember feeling like she recognized me and made me feel special, and had a genuine interest in me,\" Aamodt said in an interview with CBS News.",
      "Aamodt, now an orthodontist, said Chilukuri was one of just a few professors to leave a lasting impact on him \u2014 repeating, \"verbatim\" he said, some of her teachings to his own children.",
      "\"I remember her being fairly consistent about [diversity and inclusion], even then we were a very diverse student population, a lot of different ethnicities, and all under one roof and one big auditorium, you know, 500 strong,\" Aamodt said. \"And I remember feeling welcomed and observing her being able to connect with people from very different backgrounds, and I got that feeling that she was practicing what she preached.\"",
      "That commitment to diversity is clear in Chilukuri's letter to incoming students. She wrote of the \"opportunity and responsibility\" to address systemic racism:",
      "\"How we embrace both will greatly influence who we are as a college and a community. Whether through our African Black Diaspora Living Learning Community, our Multi-Cultural Living Learning Community, programming through our Student Affairs, Residence Life, Academic Advising, Student Council, Student Organizations, or our Culture Art and Technology core academic program, I invite each of you to be part of the conversation and part of the solution.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 13 Mar 2025 10:33:29 -0400",
    "summary": "The Alaska Volcano Observatory said signs indicated a Mount Spurr eruption was likely, though not certain, in the weeks or months ahead.",
    "story": [
      "A volcano near Alaska's largest city is showing new signs of unrest, with experts saying the likelihood of an eruption at Mount Spurr in the next few weeks or months has increased.",
      "The Alaska Volcano Observatory said Wednesday\u00a0it had measured during recent overflights \"significantly elevated volcanic gas emissions,\" and said signs indicated an eruption was likely, though not certain, in the weeks or months ahead.",
      "\"We expect to see further increases in seismic activity, gas emissions and surface heating prior to an eruption, if one were to occur,\" the observatory said in a statement. \"Such stronger unrest may provide days to weeks of additional warning.\"",
      "However, the observatory warned that it was possible that an eruption could happen with little or no warning.",
      "\"While we expect additional changes to monitoring data prior to an eruption, it is also possible that an eruption could occur with little or no additional warning,\" the observatory wrote. \"This would be extremely hazardous for recreators on Mount Spurr or near its drainages as well as those overflying the volcano.\"",
      "What is Mount Spurr?",
      "Mount Spurr is one of 53 volcanoes in Alaska that have been active within the last 250 years. It has two main vents and is 11,070 feet (3,374 meters) tall. It is covered in ice and snow and is located roughly 80 miles (129 kilometers) northwest of Anchorage.",
      "When did Mount Spurr last erupt?",
      "The last known eruption from the summit vent was more than 5,000 years ago. The Crater Peak vent, meanwhile, erupted once in 1953 and three times in 1992, according to the observatory. The Crater Peak vent is about 2 miles (3 kilometers) south of the summit.",
      "There have been periods of increased earthquake or other activity since then, including between 2004 and 2006, but no other eruptions. Last October, the observatory raised its alert status for Mount Spurr from green to yellow when an increase in seismic activity became pronounced and a ground deformation was spotted in satellite data.",
      "The most likely outcome of the current unrest would be an eruption or eruptions similar to those in 1953 and 1992, the observatory said.",
      "\"It is also possible that no eruption occurs and the present activity slowly dies away or that a smaller eruption takes place,\" John Power, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey at the observatory, wrote in an email.",
      "What impacts could an eruption have?",
      "The eruptions during the last century lasted between three and seven hours, produced ash columns that rose more than 50,000 feet (15,240 meters) above sea level and deposited ashfall in south-central Alaska communities, according to the observatory.",
      "In 1992, ashfall of about a quarter-inch in Anchorage prompted residents to stay inside or to wear masks if going outside to avoid breathing ash. The cloud drifted as far as Greenland.",
      "CBS affiliate WGME-TV reported that the ash could drift all the way to the East Coast, but that would depend on the jet stream, and it probably would not have a major impact.",
      "Volcanic ash is angular and sharp and has been used as an industrial abrasive. The powdered rock can cause a jet engine to shut down.",
      "The 1992 eruptions prompted the temporary closures of airports in Anchorage and other communities.",
      "Closing airports can be more than an inconvenience in a state where most communities aren't connected to Alaska's main road system. Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport also is among the world's busiest cargo hubs.",

    "story": [
      "A new report on the state of birds in the United States has an urgent warning: bird populations across nearly every habitat are declining, with about one-third of U.S. bird species in critical need of conservation action.",
      "A total of 229 out of 718 bird species in the U.S. are now classified as high or moderate conservation concerns, according to the 2025 State of the Birds report, which was produced by a consortium of scientific and conservation organizations led by the North American Bird Conservation Initiative. This includes 112 \"tipping point\" species \u2014 those that have lost more than half their populations in the past five decades. Some, like the Allen's hummingbird, tricolored blackbird and saltmarsh sparrow, are at extreme risk without immediate intervention, says the report, released Thursday.",
      "The population of grassland birds in the U.S. has dropped by 43% since 1970, as row-crop production, drought and habitat loss take their toll, the report says. Aridland birds have declined 41% in the same period due to drought, wildfires and invasive species. Even forest birds, facing habitat degradation from fire suppression and industrial timber practices, are seeing widespread declines. Waterfowl, once considered a conservation success, have declined by 20% since 2014 from the loss of wetlands and grasslands.",
      "The findings continue a downward trend. A 2019 study published in Science, an academic journal, found that North America lost nearly 3 billion birds over the previous 50 years, including 90 \"tipping point\" species of 529 bird species that were examined.",
      "\"The 2025 State of the Birds report shows those losses are continuing, with declines among several bird trend indicators,\" the new report says. \"Notably duck populations\u2014a bright spot in past State of the Birds reports, with strong increases since 1970\u2014have trended downward in recent years.\"",
      "Conservationists have previously warned that bird populations are in steep decline due to habitat loss and climate change, and they're further alarmed after the U.S. Interior Department last month suspended a legal opinion from the Biden administration that held companies accountable for accidentally killing birds through industrial activities like oil and gas drilling, wind energy production and construction \u2013 in a victory for the energy sector.",
      "Birds play a critical role in maintaining healthy ecosystems. They help control pests, disperse seeds and pollinate plants, contributing to crop yields and supporting biodiversity, says Amanda Rodewald, faculty director of the Cornell Lab of Ornithology's Center for Avian Population Studies",
      "And declining bird populations signal larger environmental problems, experts say.",
      "\"There's a really long history and a lot of evidence that shows that birds can be excellent indicators of environmental conditions,\" Rodewald told CBS News. \"We share the same environments with birds, if they're not healthy for bird populations, they're not likely to be healthy for us either.\"",
      "Beyond their ecological role, birds bring significant economic and mental health benefits. Birdwatching contributes $279 billion to the U.S. economy and supports 1.4 million jobs, according to the report. Encounters with birds have also been linked to reduced stress and improved mental well-being, further underscoring their importance.",
      "Experts stress that conservation efforts can succeed when adequately funded. The bald eagle, once nearly wiped out by the pesticide DDT, has rebounded thanks to concerted efforts. In December, the species even gained bipartisan recognition as the official U.S. bird.",
      "Strategic habitat conservation efforts \u2014 such as conservation ranching, coastal restoration and seabird translocation \u2014 are already making a difference in some regions.",
      "The new report calls for increased investment in conservation programs, stronger habitat protections, and policies that promote sustainable land management. Without swift action, scientists warn, the next State of the Birds report could bring even graver news.",
      "\"Birds unite us across the hemisphere and across the political spectrum,\" said Marshall Johnson, chief conservation officer at the National Audubon Society. \"There should be no hesitation in moving to protect them today and in the future.\""

    "summary": "The prehistoric facial bones were found buried in 50 feet of mud and silt, and are believed to be 1.1 to 1.4 million years old, researchers said.",
    "story": [
      "Researchers in Spain have unearthed a fossil from a potential new prehistoric member of the human family tree, and they say it's the earliest known remnants of a face discovered in Western Europe.",
      "The facial bones from an adult were found at the Atapuerca archaeological site in northern Spain in 2022. Since then, a team of scientists has been working to learn more about the hominin, whom they nicknamed Pink. The researchers shared their findings in a study in the journal\u00a0Nature, which was published on Tuesday.",
      "Pink's remains have been dated as between 1.1 and 1.4 million years old, the researchers said.",
      "The research \"introduces a new actor in the history of human evolution in Europe,\" study author Rosa Huguet, of Spain's University of Rovira i Virgili, said at a news conference, according to the AFP news agency.",
      "The discovery suggests that early humans settled in Europe, traveling from the east side of the continent to the west, about 1.4 million years ago, the researchers said. Until now, the oldest-known human species in Western Europe was the\u00a0Homo antecessor. Experts have found Homo antecessor remains that are around 850,000 years old.",
      "The oldest human ancestor found in any area of Europe is the Dmanisi people, or Homo georgicus, a group that lived in what is now the nation of Georgia. Remains of that species have been dated back to 1.8 million years ago. They are the first members of the human family known to have traveled from Africa to Europe.",
      "The face of \"Pink\"",
      "The fossilized upper jawbone and partial cheekbone were excavated from a 52-foot-deep layer of silt and mud at Sima del Elefante, or the \"elephant pit,\" a site less than 1,000 feet from where the fossils of\u00a0Homo antecessor were discovered in 1994. The bones were not enough for researchers to determine Pink's age or gender.",
      "From those fossilized bones, researchers were able to use 3D imaging techniques to create a model of Pink's face. The face is more \"projected forward and more robust\" than a modern human face or a\u00a0Homo antecessor face, Maria Martinon-Torres, director of Spain's National Research Center on Human Evolution, told the AFP.",
      "Pink's face bears some similarities to the human ancestor Homo erectus,\u00a0researchers said. That species spanned nearly 2 million years and was the first human species to evolve more familiar human body proportions and use fire and tools. Remains of the species have been found in Africa, Asia and Europe.",
      "But the similarities weren't strong enough for the scientists to confirm that Pink was a member of that species. Instead, they have proposed that Pink could belong to a new possible species, which they called Homo 'affinis' erectus.",
      "\"This is the most honest proposal we can make with the evidence we have,\" Martinon-Torres said, according to AFP.",
      "The scientists were also able to analyze small stone tools and animal bones found at the excavation site to learn more about how Pink lived. The environment at the time was a humid forest landscape, and the early human population lived alongside horses, ancient cattle, monkeys and hippos, the researchers said. The area also likely had plenty of water, which would have made it an \"ideal\" place for the species to settle, Huguet said in the news conference.",
      "The researchers suggested that the species may be a bridge between the\u00a0Homo georgicus species and the\u00a0Homo antecessor species. Study co-author Jose Maria Bermudez de Castro told the AFP that it's likely the species \"probably disappeared\" during a severe global cooling era that occurred nearly 900,000 years ago.",

      "Launched Feb. 26 atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, the Athena lander carried 10 science instruments and technology demonstrations funded by a NASA program that pays commercial spacecraft operators to deliver the agency's payloads to the moon. The goal is to collect data needed before astronauts return to the moon in the 2027-28 timeframe.",
      "In this case, NASA agreed to pay Intuitive Machines $62.5 million to deliver a drill and a mass spectrometer, known as Prime-1, to the moon. NASA's \"tipping point\" technology development program paid $15 million for Nokia cellular communications equipment and another $41 million to help finance an innovative rocket-powered \"hopper\" designed to jump into and out of a permanently shadowed crater in search of ice.",
      "Athena performed flawlessly from launch to lunar orbit and most of the way to the lunar surface. But shortly before touchdown, the lander's autonomous guidance and navigation system began steering to one side, presumably to avoid boulders or some other hazard on the surface, and ended up coming down in a crater some 820 feet from the intended target.",
      "The spacecraft may have tipped over after hitting the ground at an angle or due to some residual sideways motion. Intuitive didn't address the final seconds of the landing, but said that even resting on its side, Athena remained functional, acknowledging commands from the ground, downlinking data and attempting to recharge its batteries. But it was not enough.",
      "\"This southern pole region is lit by harsh sun angles and limited direct communication with the Earth,\" Intuitive Machines said on its web page. \"This area has been avoided due to its rugged terrain and Intuitive Machines believes the insights and achievements from IM-2 will open this region for further space exploration.\"",
      "The landing mishap was the second such disappointment for Intuitive Machines. The company's first moon lander, named Odysseus, touched down on the moon last year, but it hit the surface harder than expected and a landing leg failed. The vehicle ended up on its side and unable to complete its mission.",
      "Athena's arrival was preceded by the successful touchdown of a commercial lander built by Austin, Texas-based Firefly Aerospace that also carried NASA-sponsored payloads to the surface. That spacecraft, known as Blue Ghost, landed Sunday in a different region of the moon with much more forgiving terrain.",
      "A third privately-built lander, this one from Tokyo-based ispace, was launched atop the same Falcon 9 that boosted Blue Ghost into space. The Japanese Resilience lander is taking a longer, low-energy route to the moon and is expected to land in June.",

    "summary": "Viewers across North America will get to enjoy a full Blood Worm Moon during a total lunar eclipse on March 13 into March 14.",
    "story": [
      "Astronomy fans are in for a treat this March as the full moon will appear to turn red during a total lunar eclipse.",
      "March's full moon, known as the Worm Moon, will pass into Earth's shadow on the night of March 13, or early on March 14, depending on the time zone, according to NASA. This eclipse will be visible from Earth's Western Hemisphere.",
      "The Old Farmer's Almanac details specific moonrise times for ZIP codes across the U.S. Local forecasts also include detailed information on how clear the night sky will be in various locations.",
      "What is a lunar eclipse?",
      "A lunar eclipse happens when the sun, Earth and moon all align so that the moon passes into the Earth's shadow. During a total lunar eclipse, like the one happening this March, the entire moon will fall within the darkest part of Earth's shadow.",
      "Each lunar eclipse is visible from half of Earth.",
      "There are also partial and penumbral eclipses, which are when the sun, Earth and moon are not perfectly aligned.",
      "Why does the moon look red during the lunar eclipse?",
      "With the moon in the shadow of the Earth, it will appear red-orange, according to NASA. Lunar eclipses are sometimes called blood moons because of the phenomenon.",
      "During a lunar eclipse, the moon gets its red coloration because any sunlight that's not blocked by the Earth is filtered through a \"thick slice of Earth's atmosphere\" as it heads toward the moon's surface, according to NASA. The more dust or clouds in Earth's atmosphere during the total lunar eclipse, the redder the moon will appear.",
      "\"It's as if all the world's sunrises and sunsets are projected onto the Moon,\" NASA explains in a blog post.",
      "This is the same phenomenon that makes the sky appear blue during the day.",
      "Why is March's full moon called the worm moon?",
      "The Worm Moon nickname may have come from the earthworms typically found as spring nears, according to the\u00a0Old Farmer's Almanac. Other research suggests the name may date back to writings from the 1760s about worms, or beetle larvae, coming out from bark as trees thaw from the winter.",
      "There are also other names for March's full moon related to the transition from winter to spring. The first day of spring will be on March 20, just days after the Worm Moon.",
      "Other names for March's full moon are the Eagle Moon, Goose Moon, Crow Comes Back Moon, Sugar Moon, Wind Strong Moon and Sore Eyes Moon.",
      "What else can you see during the full Blood Worm Moon?",
      "If there's a bit of rain during the full moon, there may be a rare moonbow, according to the Old Farmer's Almanac. It's like a rainbow, but created by moonlight, rather than sunlight. Moonbows only happen when the full Moon is fairly low in the sky, so the phenomenon would be most apparent in the hours after sunset when the sky is dark.",
      "Viewers can also look to the western sky on the night of the total lunar eclipse to catch a glimpse of Jupiter and Mars, according to NASA. Constellations may also be easier to spot than usual as Earth's shadow dims the Moon's glow.",

The Old Farmer's Almanac details specific moonrise times for ZIP codes across the U.S. Local forecasts also include detailed information on how clear the night sky will be in various locations.",
      "The \"Blood Moon\" phenomenon will start before the full moon reaches peak illumination. As the lunar eclipse begins, the moon will start moving through Earth's shadow on Thursday at 11:57 p.m. ET. However, the moon's gradual dimming won't be noticeable until around 1:09 a.m. on Friday. The moon will be fully shaded from around 2:26 to 3:31 a.m., with the peak viewing opportunity for the red moon happening around 2:59 a.m.",

      "How can I observe the eclipse?",
      "The moon will still be visible during the eclipse, even though it will be in full shadow of the Earth, according to NASA.",

    "story": [
      "Those who glance up at the sky tonight will have an opportunity to catch the March 2025 \"Blood Moon,\" a phenomenon that colors the full moon in shades of red, orange and yellow during a total lunar eclipse.",
      "This month's full moon is due to pass through the shadow of Earth either late tonight, March 13, or very early tomorrow morning, March 14, depending on the viewer's time zone. It should be visible to people in the Americas and elsewhere in the Western Hemisphere.",
      "Dubbed the \"Worm Moon\" by the Farmer's Almanac, which has been assigning names to full moons for almost a century, this one is expected to start taking shape Wednesday evening and is supposed to last through Saturday morning, according to NASA. The full moon will technically rise in its totality early Friday.",
      "Here's what to know about the event \u2014 and why the moon will bear a new hue when it happens.",
      "Why will the moon be red, orange and yellow tonight?",
      "The moon will appear to turn red late tonight or early tomorrow morning, depending on skywatchers' locations, as Earth passes directly between it and the sun in what's known as a total lunar eclipse. Their perfect alignment darkens the moon, from the perspective of folks looking up, because our planet's position blocks most sunlight from reaching it.",
      "Some light still makes its way to the moon's surface, but only certain shades of it. The colors that wind up there are longer wavelengths of light \u2014 red, orange, yellow \u2014 which withstood the journey through \"a thick slice of Earth's atmosphere,\" NASA said.",
      "Shorter wavelengths of the color spectrum, like blue, scatter easily when they hit the atmosphere. That's why a vast sky can look blue in the middle of the day, when sunlight can shine straight down from overhead. Longer wavelengths materialize on Earth when sunlight hits from more of a perpendicular angle, so its route through our atmosphere can be more extensive. Short wavelengths are essentially filtered out by the atmosphere over such a protracted distance, and only the longer reds, oranges and yellows remain.",
      "What is a \"Blood Moon\"?",
      "\"Blood Moon\" is a nickname that refers to the moon's reddish appearance during a total lunar eclipse.",
      "The full moon will take on several shades of red, orange and yellow when it's nearer the outer edges of Earth's shadow \u2014 when it first intersects with the path of Earth's shadow, for example, and as it's on its way out. But shades of deep red will become more pronounced as the moon enters the darkest part of the shadow.",
      "What exactly causes a \"Blood Moon\"?",
      "A \"Blood Moon\" happens during a total lunar eclipse, when the sun, Earth and the moon align in that order. Long wavelengths of sunlight are refracted through Earth's atmosphere before reaching the moon, which reflects them in reddish hues that may resemble the color of blood.",
      "How to see the \"Blood Moon\" lunar eclipse",
      "The upcoming \"Blood Moon\" will begin before the full moon reaches its brightness point tonight.",
      "As the lunar eclipse gets underway, the moon will start moving through Earth's shadow at 11:57 p.m. EDT. It will become steadily dimmer over the next several hours as it travels toward the darkest part of the shadow and, eventually, appear fully darkened from around 2:26 p.m. to 3:31 a.m. in the early hours of Friday. The most ideal opportunity to see the reddish moon is during the minutes leading up to 3 a.m. EDT, as the moon should be situated in the center of Earth's shadow around then.",

    "story": [
      "A space probe flying past Mars captured images of the red planet's small, mysterious moon.",
      "The space probe, named Hera, was launched on Oct. 7, 2024, and is on a mission to gather close-up data about the Dimorphos asteroid, the European Space Agency said in a news release. The asteroid was the first to have its orbit altered by human action, when it was impacted by NASA's DART spacecraft in 2022\n. The goal of Hera is to learn more about asteroid deflection so the technique can be refined and used again\n.",
      "While on a flyby of Mars, Hera was able to use three of its imaging instruments to capture images of Deimos, the smaller of Mars' two moons, the ESA said. Deimos is about 15,000 miles from Mars. Scientists have previously speculated that it may actually be a piece of asteroid, not a moon.",
      "Hera got as close as 1,000 kilometers, or about 620 miles, to Deimos. It used its various instruments to capture the images, characterize the mineral makeup on the moon and chart surface temperatures. These features combined will help scientists learn more about the lunar body, the ESA said.",
      "\"These instruments have been tried out before, during Hera's departure from Earth, but this is the first time that we have employed them on a small distant moon for which we still lack knowledge \u2013 demonstrating their excellent performance in the process,\" ESA Hera mission scientist Michael Kueppers said in the news release.",
      "The ESA's Mars Express, which has been orbiting the red planet for over 20 years, also contributed observations of the moon. Results from the encounter should help guide operational planning for a mission set to explore Martian moons\n in 2026, the ESA said. That mission, in conjunction with NASA and French and German space agencies, will collect detailed measurements of Mars' two moons and land on Phobos\n, the larger lunar body, to collect a sample that can be returned to Earth for analysis.",
      "Hera also used the flyby of Mars to adjust its trajectory through deep space. That maneuver shortened Hera's travel time to Dimorphos, the ESA said. Hera will also collect information about Didymos, the asteroid that Dimorphos orbits around. Hera is expected to reach the Didymos in December 2026, the ESA said.",
      "\"This has been the Hera team's first exciting experience of exploration, but not our last,\" said Hera mission manager Ian Carnelli in the news release. \"In 21 months the spacecraft will reach our target asteroids, and start our crash site investigation of the only object in our Solar System to have had its orbit measurably altered by human action.\"",

    "story": [
      "With the countdown within 45 minutes of launch, NASA called off an attempt to send the next crew to the International Space Station Thursday evening to allow more time to troubleshoot a ground system hydraulics issue. If the problem can be resolved in time, NASA and SpaceX will make another attempt to launch the crew Friday evening.",
      "The scrub will add at least two more days to the eventual return to Earth of Starliner commander Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and pilot Sunita Williams, along with two other outgoing space station crew members.",
      "Crew-10 commander Anne McClain, pilot Nichole Ayers, Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi and Russian cosmonaut Kirill Peskov were strapped in and ready for blastoff from historic pad 39 at the Kennedy Space Center at 7:48 p.m. EDT Wednesday.",
      "But throughout the final few hours of the countdown, SpaceX engineers were troubleshooting an apparent problem with one of two clamp arms that hold the Falcon 9 rocket to its launch support gantry. Hydraulics are used to retract the two clamps prior to launch, and while the system appeared to be working normally, it wasn't clear whether one of the arms would retract fully.",
      "A launch opportunity Thursday was ruled out due to expected high winds and to give engineers more time to assess data and determine what, if any, repairs are needed. If the hydraulics problem can be resolved in time, NASA and SpaceX could be ready to press ahead with a launch attempt at 7:03 p.m. Friday.",
      "Whenever Crew-10 takes off, rendezvous and docking with the space station is expected the following day.",
      "Standing by to welcome them aboard will be Crew-9 commander Nick Hague, cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov, Wilmore and Williams, along with cosmonauts Alexsey Ovchinin, Ivan Vagner and NASA astronaut Don Pettit, who were launched last September aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft.",
      "McClain and her crewmates will spend two days getting briefed by Crew-9 on the intricacies of space station operations before Hague, Gorbunov, Wilmore and Williams undock on March 19\u00a0for their return to Earth. The normal \"handover\" period is five days or so, but mission managers shortened it this time around to maintain the lab's food reserves.",
      "While the ongoing saga of the \"stranded\" Starliner astronauts has overshadowed the Crew-10 mission, McClain said she and her crewmates began training for their mission in 2023 and they were all eager to finally get into space. McClain and Onishi are space station veterans while Ayers and Peskov are making their first flight.",
      "All four are veteran military or commercial pilots. Before joining NASA, McClain, an active-duty Army colonel, served as a combat helicopter pilot while Ayers, an Air Force major, is a veteran F-22 Raptor pilot. Onishi served as a commercial pilot in Japan, flying Boeing 767 jetliners, and Peskov is an experienced commercial 757 pilot.",
      "\"We're going to have planned and unplanned maintenance to keep the space station running,\" McClain said. \"We have a plethora of science experiments, both inside and outside of the space station. We have spacewalks. We have visiting vehicles (and) the potential of (hosting) private astronaut missions.\"",
      "\"They're ready to come home\"",
      "As for Wilmore and Williams, McClain said, \"honestly, I'm kind of most looking forward to breaking bread with those guys, talking to them, giving them big hugs. We go way back. ... We're ready to go up there. They're ready to come home.\"",
      "\"This is a huge mission for us on Crew 10,\" said Steve Stich, manager of the commercial crew program that oversees SpaceX Crew Dragons and Boeing's Starliner. \"They're all big, but this started all the way back to Crew 9 when we launched that mission with two empty seats, and we had those seats reserved for Butch and Suni.\"",
      "The Starliner astronauts have \"just done a phenomenal job,\" Stich said, \"and so we're excited to bring them back.\"",
      "Given an on-time launch for Crew 10 Friday, Hague, Gorbunov, Wilmore and Williams could undock on March 19 and land as early as March 20 or 21. If so, the Starliner astronauts will have logged 288 days or so \u2014  9.5 months \u2014  \u00a0in space on a flight originally expected to last a little longer than one week. Hague and Gorbunov's time in space will come to about 173 days.",
      "The U.S. record for longest single spaceflight is held by astronaut Frank Rubio, who spent 371 days in space because of problems with the Soyuz spacecraft that carried him to orbit. Like the Starliner crew, he was forced to extend his mission and come home on a different Soyuz.",
      "In any case, what would normally be a relatively routine crew rotation, sending up four crew members to replace four others wrapping up a five- to six-month station visit, has turned into political theater, fueled by repeated criticism from President Trump and Elon Musk blaming the Biden administration for the Starliner crew's predicament.",
      "Musk said in a post on his social media platform X that he offered to \"go get\" Wilmore and Williams earlier, but the offer was turned down. He did not say who turned the proposal down or even whether it was someone at NASA or the White House.",
      "\"Biden left them up there,\" Mr. Trump told reporters from the Oval Office on March 6. \"We have two astronauts that are stuck in space. I have asked Elon, I said, do me a favor, can you get 'em out? He said yes. He is preparing to go up I think in two weeks.\"",
      "But the Crew Dragon he was referring to will not be bringing Wilmore and Williams back to Earth. It will be carrying the Crew-10 fliers and will remain docked at the outpost for the next five months. Their arrival does, however, clear the way for Crew-9, including Wilmore and Williams, to finally return to Earth aboard their own Crew Dragon.",
      "That Crew Dragon, which carried Hague and Gorbunov to the station last September for a normal tour of duty, has been docked at the lab ever since. It was launched with two empty seats for Wilmore and Williams so their ride home has been at the station for the past five-and-a-half months.",
      "NASA could have brought Crew-9 down earlier, but that would have left a single astronaut, Pettit, aboard the lab to operate and maintain the U.S. segment of the space station. Research would have ground to a halt and he would have had difficulty in a variety of emergency scenarios.",
      "\"Sure, it could have taken us home, but that leaves only three people on the space station from the Soyuz crew, two Russians and one American,\" Williams told CBS News in an in-flight interview. \"And, you know, the space station is big. It's a building, you know, it's the size of a football field. Things happen.",
      "\"So things can go wrong, and you need to be able to fix it, either inside and outside. And so having additional people to be able to do that is really important.\"",
      "\"We don't feel stranded\"",
      "Both Wilmore and Williams have repeatedly said they are not \"stranded\" and have not been \"abandoned\" in space.",
      "\"That's been the narrative from day one, stranded, abandoned, stuck, and I get it, we both get it,\" Wilmore told a reporter during a recent interview. \"But that is, again, not what our human space flight program is about. We don't feel abandoned, we don't feel stuck, we don't feel stranded.",
      "\"We come prepared. We come committed. That is what your human space flight program is. It prepares for any and all contingencies that we can conceive of, and we prepare for those. ... Let's change (the narrative) to 'prepared' and 'committed.'\"",
      "And so, NASA's plan to bring the Starliner astronauts home, a plan managers said minimized disruption to the space station crew rotation schedule, has been in place since last August. Even so, the president has repeatedly blamed the Biden administration for the extended mission.",
      "NASA managers have not openly challenged the president's comments and have generally downplayed their responses to questions about Musk's claim to have offered to launch another Crew Dragon to bring Wilmore and Williams home.",
      "Last August, Stich was asked about the possibility of launching a mission specifically to bring the Starliner crew back to Earth. He told reporters during a news conference that the agency \"really never considered that option.\"",
      "\"From the very beginning, we liked the option of modifying Crew-9 or Crew-8,\" he said, referring to the option of adding Williams and Wilmore to Hague's crew or whether to shoehorn them into a Crew Dragon that brought four other station fliers back to Earth last October.",
      "\"We looked at both of those and bringing them back on either one of those vehicles,\" Stich said at the time. \"We're trying to lay out the rest of our manifest to make sure we have vehicles available for all the flights. It just didn't make sense to go ahead and accelerate a flight to return Butch and Suni earlier.\"",
      "What went wrong with Boeing's Starliner?",
      "Wilmore and Williams were launched aboard a Boeing Starliner capsule last June 5 for the spacecraft's first piloted test flight. They successfully docked with the International Space Station the next day, but the Starliner experienced multiple helium propulsion system leaks and several maneuvering jets that did not produce the expected thrust.",
      "NASA carried out weeks of tests and analysis to determine whether the Starliner could be trusted to safely bring its crew back to Earth.",
      "By August, Boeing managers were convinced engineers understood the problems and the crew could safely come home in the Starliner. But NASA managers disagreed and ruled that option out. Instead, as Stich described, they decided to keep the astronauts aboard the station until early this year\u00a0when they could hitch a ride back aboard the Crew-9 Dragon.",
      "The Starliner astronauts took the news of a lengthy mission extension in stride.",
      "\"Butch, and I knew this was a test flight, we knew that we would probably find some things (that did not work as expected), and we found some stuff,\" Williams told CBS News. \"And so that was not a surprise. The discussion went over the summer, and as things started unrolling, unraveling, we sort of understood that, hey, we might be up here a little bit longer.",
      "\"And that's what our job is. We have both been in the military, both Navy guys, our deployments have been extended. You do what's right for the team, and what was right for the team is to stay up here and be expedition crew members for the International Space Station.\"",
      "Last September, Boeing successfully brought the Starliner down by remote control and NASA launched the Crew-9 mission aboard a Crew Dragon carrying just two crew members, Hague and Gorbunov, along with two empty seats for Wilmore and Williams.",
      "The Starliner astronauts joined the Crew-9 expedition and originally expected to return to Earth in February after arrival of the next Crew Dragon in the crew rotation sequence. But the Crew-10 Dragon, a new vehicle making its first flight, ran into problems that delayed launch, and Crew-9's return, to the end of March.",
      "NASA eventually decided to switch Crew-10 to a different Dragon, enabling a launch on March 12, a few weeks earlier than the previous late March target. Stich said the capsule swap and slightly earlier launch date were not the result of any outside pressure.",
      "The decision \"really was driven by a lot of other factors,\" Stich said. \"We were looking at this before some of those statements were made by the President and Mr. Musk.\"",
      "Said Ken Bowersox, NASA's chief of spaceflight operations at agency Headquarters: \"I can verify that Steve had been talking about how we might need to juggle the flights and switch capsules a good month before there was any discussion outside of NASA.\"",

    "summary": "Intuitive Machines says its Athena lunar lander was unable to recharge its batteries while resting on its side, bringing the moon mission to an early end.",
    "story": [
      "A dramatic photograph from Intuitive Machines' Athena moon lander shows it touched down Thursday in a crater near the lunar south pole and tipped over on its side. Given a low sun angle and the orientation of the lander's solar cells, the spacecraft's battery quickly drained, bringing the mission to an early end, company officials said Friday",
      "\"Images downlinked from Athena on the lunar surface confirmed that Athena was on her side,\" the company said on its website.",
      "\"After landing, mission controllers were able to accelerate several program and payload milestones, including NASA's PRIME-1 (drill) suite, before the lander's batteries depleted,\" the statement continued. \"With the direction of the sun, the orientation of the solar panels, and extreme cold temperatures in the crater, Intuitive Machines does not expect Athena to recharge. The mission has concluded and teams are continuing to assess the data collected throughout the mission.\"",
      "Launched Feb. 26 atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, the Athena lander carried 10 science instruments and technology demonstrations funded by a NASA program that pays commercial spacecraft operators to deliver the agency's payloads to the moon. The goal is to collect data needed before astronauts return to the moon in the 2027-28 timeframe.",
      "In this case, NASA agreed to pay Intuitive Machines $62.5 million to deliver a drill and a mass spectrometer, known as Prime-1, to the moon. NASA's \"tipping point\" technology development program paid $15 million for Nokia cellular communications equipment and another $41 million to help finance an innovative rocket-powered \"hopper\" designed to jump into and out of a permanently shadowed crater in search of ice.",
      "Athena performed flawlessly from launch to lunar orbit and most of the way to the lunar surface. But shortly before touchdown, the lander's autonomous guidance and navigation system began steering to one side, presumably to avoid boulders or some other hazard on the surface, and ended up coming down in a crater some 820 feet from the intended target.",
      "The spacecraft may have tipped over after hitting the ground at an angle or due to some residual sideways motion. Intuitive didn't address the final seconds of the landing, but said that even resting on its side, Athena remained functional, acknowledging commands from the ground, downlinking data and attempting to recharge its batteries. But it was not enough.",
      "\"This southern pole region is lit by harsh sun angles and limited direct communication with the Earth,\" Intuitive Machines said on its web page. \"This area has been avoided due to its rugged terrain and Intuitive Machines believes the insights and achievements from IM-2 will open this region for further space exploration.\"",
      "The landing mishap was the second such disappointment for Intuitive Machines. The company's first moon lander, named Odysseus, touched down on the moon last year, but it hit the surface harder than expected and a landing leg failed. The vehicle ended up on its side and unable to complete its mission.",
      "Athena's arrival was preceded by the successful touchdown of a commercial lander built by Austin, Texas-based Firefly Aerospace that also carried NASA-sponsored payloads to the surface. That spacecraft, known as Blue Ghost, landed Sunday in a different region of the moon with much more forgiving terrain.",
      "A third privately-built lander, this one from Tokyo-based ispace, was launched atop the same Falcon 9 that boosted Blue Ghost into space. The Japanese Resilience lander is taking a longer, low-energy route to the moon and is expected to land in June.",

    "published": "Sun, 09 Mar 2025 16:47:34 -0400",
    "summary": "Faced with the need to cut carbon emissions, and an increasing energy demand to power AI, companies like Microsoft, Google and Amazon are investing in nuclear, from restarting Three Mile Island, to creating \"small modular reactors.\"",
    "story": [
      "It might have seemed like one of the weirder headlines of 2024: Microsoft is paying $1.6 billion to restart Three Mile Island. That's the nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania whose reactor #2 had a partial meltdown in 1979. There were no injuries, and nobody died, but it set the nuclear industry back years. Only two new plants have been started since that accident.",
      "\"This is hallowed ground in the nuclear industry,\" said Joe Dominguez, the CEO of Constellation Energy, which owns about half of America's 54 nuclear plants (including Three Mile Island). \"This is a place where we learned and got better.\"",
      "He says that, as a result of the 1979 accident, there have been thousands of changes in protocols and procedures regarding nuclear power. \"The thing that people forget is that there was another reactor at the site,\" he said. \"That site, that reactor, continued to operate until 2019, when it was closed for economic reasons. Cheap natural gas, low demand, subsidization of different technologies in the business, [and] no policy supporting nuclear caused plants to start retiring.\"",
      "So, what is Microsoft's interest?",
      "All  of the Big Tech companies have ambitious goals to fight the climate  crisis. That includes Google and Microsoft, which have each  pledged to reach net zero carbon emissions. They were making progress, too; each has invested billions in wind and solar energy.",
      "And then, then artificial intelligence came along. AI data centers require huge amounts of electricity. \u00a0Big Tech realized that they wouldn't make their emissions goals without taking power into their own hands.",
      "Dominguez said, \"Microsoft is going to enjoy the benefit of the reliable, clean energy for 20 years.\"",
      "He says reopening the existing Three Mile Island facility would be quicker and less expensive than constructing a brand-new nuclear plant. \"At least 10 times cheaper than building a new plant,\" he said. \"And we think we could get it going in about three years, versus the last plant that was built, [which] took almost 10 years.\"",
      "But if you're a tech company, what do you do if you don't have a recently-retired nuclear plant handy? You develop new ones. Only weeks after Microsoft's announcement, both Amazon and Google announced major investments in nuclear power.",
      "Google turns to nuclear energy for AI electricity demand",
      "Google turns to nuclear energy for AI electricity demand",
      "Google is supplementing its already enormous green energy investments with a new kind of nuclear, called small modular reactors. \"These are not the nuclear power plants of yesterday, with the very large cooling towers,\" said Michael Terrell, who heads Google's decarbonization efforts. \"These are much smaller facilities. But because they're modular, you can stack them together to make bigger power plants.",
      "He anticipates the first advanced nuclear reactor will be online by 2030. \"And we're not going to do just one reactor, but we hope to buy from what will be a series of reactors that follow that,\" Terrell said.",
      "Nuclear power still isn't perfect; it still produces waste that has to be safely stored. But unlike solar and wind, nuclear power is always on, which is essential to those AI data centers.",
      "So, Google is funding a company called Kairos Power to design and build this new generation of reactors. Kairos is building three small demonstration plants in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, on the very spot where uranium was processed for the first atomic bomb.",
      "CEO Mike Laufer says that his reactors don't use fuel rods; they use fuel pebbles, about the size of golf balls \u2013 mostly graphite, with tiny kernels of uranium. And each pebble has as much power capacity as four tons of coal.",
      "And how much carbon dioxide emissions, compared to coal? \"Zero,\" Laufer said.",
      "The Kairos reactors also run at lower power and lower pressure than traditional reactors, which means lower risk.",
      "Well, this all sounds great! But what's the catch?",
      "\"There's only one problem with small modular reactors: They don't really exist,\" said George Washington University professor Sharon Squassoni, who spent 15 years researching nuclear safety for the government. She thinks Big Tech companies might be in over their heads. \"I think they're going to find out pretty quickly that it takes way too long and it's way too expensive,\" she said. \"I think we're going to see just how strong their commitments are to clean energy futures.\"",
      "\"So, you're saying they may have to turn to burning stuff [for power]?\" I asked.",
      "\"I'm pretty sure they will,\" Squassoni replied.",
      "\"Do you think there's a little bit of tech-bro overconfidence therein?\"",
      "\"Oh, completely, completely!\" she laughed.",
      "Kairos' Mike Laufer admitted, \"Yes, it's really hard. I will totally agree with anyone. But we're doing it at smaller scale to start, and then building on that in the future.\"",
      "Joe Dominguez's team is getting Three Mile Island ready for Microsoft, including renaming the plant the Crane Clean Energy Center. And if AI is igniting a renaissance in American nuclear, he says: full steam ahead.",
      "I asked, \"Why do all new plants take so much longer and cost so much more than projected?\"",
      "\"Honest answer? We don't build enough of them,\" Dominguez said. \"You don't want to build a unique design; you want to do kind of a cookie-cutter, one-after-another design.\"",
      "\"Is it well understood in government and the industry that if you start doing the same design over and over, we can get there faster and cheaper?\"",
      "\"It's probably the best understood idea,\" Dominguez said. \"It's understood by both Republicans and Democrats, which is a hard thing to say about anything! Everybody understands that if you build a common design, you build a bunch of them.\"",
      "\"So, you think we'll get there?\"",
      "\"I do.\"",
      "Google's Michael Terrell agrees, and believes his company will make its zero-carbon goal by 2030. \"It is an incredibly ambitious goal: 24/7 carbon-free energy everywhere we operate every way around the world,\" he said. \"But it's something we're working very hard to achieve, and we hope to get there.\"",

      "The IRS is drafting plans to cut its workforce by as much as half through a mix of layoffs, attrition and incentivized buyouts as part of President Trump's efforts to shrink the size of the federal workforce. The administration is closing agencies, laying off nearly all probationary employees who have not yet gained civil service protection and offering buyouts to almost all federal employees through a \"deferred resignation program\" to quickly reduce the government workforce.",

      "\"You look at the economy today, you see a weakening,\" JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said on Wednesday at a retirement event in Washington, D.C., held by asset management giant BlackRock and the Bipartisan Policy Center. \"Consumer still spending money. Jobs are still plentiful. Wages are still going up. CPI has kind of leveled off a little bit, but you do see a weakening in sentiment and certain kinds of spending that people consider more discretionary.\"",
      "Signs of slowing growth, along with stubbornly elevated\u00a0prices for food, rent and other staples, has aroused concerns that the U.S. could eventually face \"stagflation,\" or when economic activity sinks even as inflation remains high.",
      "The crosscurrents buffeting the economy are complicating life for policymakers at the Federal Reserve, who must balance their ongoing effort to douse inflation with their mandate to keep the economy on track. Analysts with Morgan Stanley predicted Thursday that the central bank will leave its benchmark interest rate unchanged at its next meeting on March 18-19.",

    "summary": "The Senate plans to take up a House-passed bill to fund the government through September beginning on Friday, which needs the support of Democrats to move forward.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Senate Democrats are considering a plan that would pave the way for a GOP bill to keep the government funded for six months in exchange for a doomed-to-fail vote on their own 30-day alternative, facing an uncomfortable choice between allowing the Republican measure to pass or letting the government shut down.",
      "The Senate plans to take up the House-passed bill to fund the government through September beginning on Friday. Republicans need 60 votes to invoke cloture and advance the measure, meaning it will need the support of Democrats to get to a vote on final passage.",
      "With government funding set to expire on Friday night, Democrats find themselves in the position of being able to block the GOP bill, but also wary of the government shutdown that would ensue if they do so. Democratic leaders are instead pushing for a 30-day funding extension that would allow more time for negotiations on new spending bills \u2014 a nonstarter, given Republican control of the House and Senate.",
      "A possible solution began to emerge after Senate Democrats met on Capitol Hill on Wednesday. The plan would call for Democrats to provide the votes needed to advance the GOP bill in exchange for a vote on an amendment with their own one-month stopgap measure, which would almost certainly fail. Democrats who oppose the GOP version could then vote against its final passage. Some members see it as a way to save face while also avoiding a shutdown.",
      "\"I think we're going to all be 'no' on cloture unless we get an agreement to propose at least this 30-day clean [continuing resolution] amendment and maybe a couple of others,\" Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia told reporters Thursday morning. \"So we'll be 'no' on cloture unless we get an agreement to do that. I'm not aware of whether the Republicans have agreed to that yet, but we'll be 'no' on cloture if we don't get it, and I think that's a unified position.\"",
      "The House approved the six-month funding measure on Tuesday largely along party lines, sending the funding fight to the Senate.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters Thursday morning that his office has been in touch with Minority Leader Chuck Schumer's staff, but Democrats haven't made a formal offer. Thune noted that if Democrats want a vote on the 30-day continuing resolution in exchange for helping Republicans reach the 60-vote threshold on the House-passed bill, Republicans are \"open to that.\"",
      "\"We're waiting for them to decide what they want to do,\" he said. Thune filed cloture on the House-passed measure Thursday night, setting up a Friday vote.",
      "Democrats emerged from Wednesday's meeting touting their alternate plan that would fund the government until April 11. Schumer warned Republicans that they do not have the votes to approve the House-passed stopgap measure, which increases defense spending and funding for veterans' health care, while decreasing non-defense spending below 2024 levels.",
      "\"Funding the government should be a bipartisan effort. But Republicans chose a partisan path, drafting their continuing resolution without any input \u2014 any input \u2014 from congressional Democrats,\" Schumer said.",
      "Although efforts to fund the government usually find bipartisan support, Democrats widely oppose the measure and have expressed frustration with the spending reductions, while warning that it would give the Trump administration and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency even more latitude to carry out cost-slashing efforts. The possibility of forcing a shutdown is one of the few points of leverage Democrats have as the minority in both chambers.",
      "But Democrats also fear the fallout of a lapse in funding, which could serve as the pretext for the Trump administration to make even deeper cuts across the federal workforce. Some Senate Democrats see the plan to vote for cloture but against final passage as a way to thread the needle, while others have argued that a vote on the short-term continuing resolution isn't for show.",
      "Sen. Jeff Merkley, an Oregon Democrat, said the approach isn't a gimmick, noting the bipartisan work that has been done so far on new funding bills that would go by the wayside with the House-passed funding extension.",
      "\"What would be an absolute crime is to support a House bill written only by Republicans,\" Merkley said, adding, \"You don't stop a bully by handing over your lunch money, and you don't stop a president like Trump from being authoritarian by proceeding to give in and give him more power again.\"",
      "Frustrations appeared to mount among Democrats throughout the day on Thursday, as they met again behind closed doors on the issue. As the meeting let out, a number of Democrats released statements on social media announcing that they would vote no on the House-passed continuing resolution, while they otherwise remained tight-lipped about their intentions.",
      "Meanwhile, some outspoken progressives have denounced the plan, saying the party is capitulating to the president and Republicans while getting nothing substantive in return.",
      "\"I hope Senate Democrats understand there is nothing clever about setting up a fake failed 30 day CR first to turn around & vote for cloture on the GOP spending bill,\" New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez posted on X on Thursday. \"Those games won't fool anyone. It won't trick voters, it won't trick House members. People will not forget it.\"",
      "Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, the sole Democrat who publicly said he would back the House-passed measure, likewise criticized the idea of exchanging support for cloture for a vote on the short-term continuing resolution.",
      "\"The House GOP CR will then pass the Senate because it only needs 51 votes,\" Fetterman said in a post on X. \"Total theater is neither honest with constituents nor a winning argument.\"",

    "summary": "The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to limit three lower court orders that blocked enforcement of his birthright citizenship executive order nationwide.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Thursday asked the Supreme Court to limit for now the scope of three lower court orders that broadly blocked enforcement of his executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship.",
      "The Trump administration asked the high court for emergency relief in three separate requests, which arise out of cases brought in Maryland, Massachusetts and Washington state. In all three disputes, U.S. district court judges issued orders blocking nationwide enforcement of Mr. Trump's executive order, which was issued his first day in office.",
      "Acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris is now asking the high court to limit the sweep of those orders to cover only those individuals who are directly involved in the cases.",
      "\"These cases \u2014 which involve challenges to the president's January 20, 2025 Executive Order concerning birthright citizenship \u2014 raise important constitutional questions with major ramifications for securing the border,\" she wrote in the requests. \"But at this stage, the government comes to this court with a 'modest' request: while the parties litigate weighty merits questions, the court should 'restrict the scope' of multiple preliminary injunctions that 'purpor[t] to cover every person in the country,' limiting those injunctions to parties actually within the courts' power.\"",
      "Trump's birthright citizenship order",
      "Mr. Trump issued his executive order seeking to terminate birthright citizenship on his first day in office, part of a broad, long-promised crackdown on illegal immigration across the U.S.-Mexico border. The order denies U.S. citizenship to children born to mothers who are in the country unlawfully or temporarily on visas, and whose fathers are neither citizens nor lawful permanent residents.",
      "The president's executive action sparked immediate legal challenges, including in the cases that have now arrived at the Supreme Court. The challengers all argue Mr. Trump's order violates the Citizenship Clause of the 14th Amendment.",
      "Four U.S. district judges \u2014 in Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Washington \u2014 issued orders blocking enforcement of the president's attempt to end birthright citizenship. Efforts by the Trump administration to have U.S. appeals courts restrict the scope of three of those decisions to apply only the parties \u2014 which include 22 states, members of two organizations and seven individuals \u2014 while legal proceedings move forward have not been successful.",
      "In its request to the Supreme Court, the Trump administration said it should clear the way for the president's birthright citizenship order to partially take effect. Harris, who represents the federal government before the court, largely criticized the scope of the relief \u2014 which extends nationwide \u2014 and warned that these injunctions harm the executive branch's ability to carry out its functions.",
      "\"District courts have issued more universal injunctions and [temporary restraining orders] during February 2025 alone than through the first three years of the Biden administration,\" she wrote. \"That sharp rise in universal injunctions stops the executive branch from performing its constitutional functions before any courts fully examine the merits of those actions, and threatens to swamp this court's emergency docket.\"",
      "She noted that the decisions arising out of challenges to Mr. Trump's birthright citizenship order cover all 50 states and \"millions of aliens across the country.\"",
      "\"This court should declare that enough is enough before district courts' burgeoning reliance on universal injunctions becomes further entrenched,\" the acting solicitor general wrote.",
      "On the issue of immigration, specifically, Harris said the lower court orders impede the president's efforts to address what she said is a crisis at the southern border.",
      "\"The district courts' universal injunctions threaten to perpetuate those problems by holding out a nationwide incentive for illegal immigration: the prospect of American citizenship for the unlawful migrants' children and of derivative immigration benefits for the migrants themselves,\" she argued.",
      "Republicans and Democrats alike have sought these nationwide orders when challenging the policies of a president from the opposing political party, and decisions granting that broad relief have been criticized by administrations on both sides of the political spectrum.",
      "Even several members of the Supreme Court have expressed concern about the soundness of these broad orders, which bar the government from enforcing the policy at issue against anyone, anywhere in the country. In a\u00a02018 concurring opinion\u00a0in a\u00a0case involving Mr. Trump's travel ban\u00a0issued during his first term, Justice Clarence Thomas noted that district courts in Hawaii and Maryland entered preliminary injunctions that barred the Trump administration from enforcing the policy, and said he was skeptical they have the authority to do so.",

    "story": [
      "Those who glance up at the sky tonight will have an opportunity to catch the March 2025 \"Blood Moon,\" a phenomenon that colors the full moon in shades of red, orange and yellow during a total lunar eclipse.",
      "This month's full moon is due to pass through the shadow of Earth either late tonight, March 13, or very early tomorrow morning, March 14, depending on the viewer's time zone. It should be visible to people in the Americas and elsewhere in the Western Hemisphere.",
      "Dubbed the \"Worm Moon\" by the Farmer's Almanac, which has been assigning names to full moons for almost a century, this one is expected to start taking shape Wednesday evening and is supposed to last through Saturday morning, according to NASA. The full moon will technically rise in its totality early Friday.",
      "Here's what to know about the event \u2014 and why the moon will bear a new hue when it happens.",
      "Why will the moon be red, orange and yellow tonight?",
      "The moon will appear to turn red late tonight or early tomorrow morning, depending on skywatchers' locations, as Earth passes directly between it and the sun in what's known as a total lunar eclipse. Their perfect alignment darkens the moon, from the perspective of folks looking up, because our planet's position blocks most sunlight from reaching it.",
      "Some light still makes its way to the moon's surface, but only certain shades of it. The colors that wind up there are longer wavelengths of light \u2014 red, orange, yellow \u2014 which withstood the journey through \"a thick slice of Earth's atmosphere,\" NASA said.",
      "Shorter wavelengths of the color spectrum, like blue, scatter easily when they hit the atmosphere. That's why a vast sky can look blue in the middle of the day, when sunlight can shine straight down from overhead. Longer wavelengths materialize on Earth when sunlight hits from more of a perpendicular angle, so its route through our atmosphere can be more extensive. Short wavelengths are essentially filtered out by the atmosphere over such a protracted distance, and only the longer reds, oranges and yellows remain.",
      "What is a \"Blood Moon\"?",
      "\"Blood Moon\" is a nickname that refers to the moon's reddish appearance during a total lunar eclipse.",
      "The full moon will take on several shades of red, orange and yellow when it's nearer the outer edges of Earth's shadow \u2014 when it first intersects with the path of Earth's shadow, for example, and as it's on its way out. But shades of deep red will become more pronounced as the moon enters the darkest part of the shadow.",
      "What exactly causes a \"Blood Moon\"?",
      "A \"Blood Moon\" happens during a total lunar eclipse, when the sun, Earth and the moon align in that order. Long wavelengths of sunlight are refracted through Earth's atmosphere before reaching the moon, which reflects them in reddish hues that may resemble the color of blood.",
      "How to see the \"Blood Moon\" lunar eclipse",
      "The upcoming \"Blood Moon\" will begin before the full moon reaches its brightness point tonight.",
      "As the lunar eclipse gets underway, the moon will start moving through Earth's shadow at 11:57 p.m. EDT. It will become steadily dimmer over the next several hours as it travels toward the darkest part of the shadow and, eventually, appear fully darkened from around 2:26 p.m. to 3:31 a.m. in the early hours of Friday. The most ideal opportunity to see the reddish moon is during the minutes leading up to 3 a.m. EDT, as the moon should be situated in the center of Earth's shadow around then.",

      "Weldon, a vaccine critic, was set to appear before the Senate's health committee on Thursday for his confirmation hearing, and news of the withdrawal of his nomination came less than an hour before the hearing was to begin. Axios first reported news of Weldon's nomination being pulled.",
      "The committee was expected to question him about his long record of criticizing vaccines and the agency he was nominated to lead. Weldon is a physician and a former Republican member of Congress.",
      "In a statement obtained by CBS News, Weldon said that Health and Human Services Secretary\u00a0Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u00a0was \"very upset\" at his nomination being pulled. Weldon said he had received a call from the White House 12 hours before the scheduled hearing, informing him that the nomination would be withdrawn.",
      "\"Bobby Kennedy is a good man who really is passionate about improving the health of the American people,\" Weldon said. \"President Trump did a good thing in making him secretary of HHS.  Hopefully they can find someone for CDC who can survive the confirmation process and get past pharma and find some answers.\"",
      "Weldon said that Maine Sen. Susan Collins had told Kennedy she had reservations about his nomination and said the Republican senator's staff had been \"very hostile\" in a meeting with him.",
      "Collins' staff repeatedly accused him of being against vaccines, Weldon said, \"even though I reminded them that I actually give hundreds of vaccines every year in my medical practice.\"",
      "Speaking with reporters Thursday, Collins said Weldon's withdrawal came as a surprise to her and that she had planned to give him a chance to respond at the hearing.",
      "\"I did not express concerns to the White House. I had some reservations, but I certainly had not reached a final judgment,\" Collins said.",
      "Multiple people familiar with Weldon's Senate meetings said Republicans had been concerned over his answers when asked about his priorities for the agency. Weldon wanted to detail his priorities for the CDC after being confirmed and learning more about the agency as director.",
      "Weldon was unfamiliar with the CDC's current budget and workforce, telling congressional staffers he was busy with his medical practice and did not want to waste time reading up on an agency he might not be confirmed to lead, they said.",
      "Two people said Collins' staff had only asked Weldon how he would address the perception that he was against vaccines, but denied accusing him of being \"anti-vaccine.\"",
      "Weldon said that over 20 years ago, while in Congress, he raised concerns about childhood vaccine safety, and \"for some reason Collins staff suddenly couldn't get over that.\"",
      "He also claimed that another senator, Louisiana Republican Dr. Bill Cassidy, had also said he was anti-vaccine and had once asked for his nomination to be withdrawn.",
      "A spokesperson for Cassidy denied that he had asked the White House for Weldon's nomination to be withdrawn. Cassidy had been \"looking forward\" to Thursday's hearing with Weldon, the spokesperson said.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge in California ordered six federal agencies to reinstate probationary employees who were fired last month, finding that their terminations by the Office of Personnel Management were unlawful.",
      "U.S. District Judge William Alsup in San Francisco handed down his order in a challenge brought by a group of unions against the Trump administration from the bench. He said that neither OPM nor its Acting Director Charles Ezell had the authority to direct the terminations across agencies.",
      "The order extends relief to fired workers at the Departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture, Defense, Energy, Interior and Treasury.",
      "\"It is a sad, sad day when our government would fire some good employee and say it was based on performance when they know good and well that's a lie,\" Alsup said at the end of a hearing on the unions' request for a preliminary injunction. \"That should not have been done in our country. It was a sham in order to avoid statutory requirements.\"",
      "The judge, who was appointed by President Bill Clinton, noted that federal law allows for agencies to engage in a \"reduction-in-force,\" the government's name for mass layoffs, but doing so comes with several requirements.",
      "\"It can be done if it's in accordance with the law,\" he said. \"This case is not about that. What this case is about is really an attempt to do a reduction-in-force\" through OPM. He said that having OPM, the federal government's chief human resources agency, direct departments to fire probationary workers was an \"easy way to get a reduction-in-force underway\" and a \"gimmick.\"",
      "The judge also criticized President Trump's firing of former special counsel Hampton Dellinger and attempts to get rid of members of the Merit Systems Protection Board, which oversees the administrative appeals of federal workers challenging their firings. A federal judge in Washington ordered that Cathy Harris, a member of the MSPB removed by Mr. Trump, return to her role. The Trump administration has appealed that decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.",
      "Alsup said Mr. Trump's removals of Harris and Dellinger were likely part of efforts to \"decimate\" the MSPB and ensure \"these employees will have no recourse.\"",
      "Spokespeople for the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Interior declined to comment. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement that a \"single judge is attempting to unconstitutionally seize the power of hiring and firing from the executive branch.\"",
      "\"The president has the authority to exercise the power of the entire executive branch \u2014 singular district court judges cannot abuse the power of the entire judiciary to thwart the president's agenda. If a federal district court judge would like executive powers, they can try and run for president themselves,\" she said. \"The Trump administration will immediately fight back against this absurd and unconstitutional order.\"",
      "The hearing",
      "The judge's order came at the end of a roughly two-hour-long hearing on the unions' request for a preliminary injunction. He repeatedly condemned the Trump administration's efforts to keep key officials, namely Ezell, from testifying in the early stages of the litigation.",
      "Ahead of the hearing, the Justice Department had withdrawn a declaration from Ezell. Lawyers for the unions said the move was part of an effort to keep him from having to answer their questions. In an order issued Monday, Alsup said that if Ezell failed to appear, the court \"will have to decide the sanction.\"",
      "The judge told Kelsey Helland, a Justice Department lawyer, that allowing the acting OPM head to be questioned by lawyers representing the unions \"will reveal the truth.\"",
      "Noting his decades on the bench, Alsup said, \"I know how we get at the truth, and you're not helping me.\" He accused the government of frustrating his ability to find out whether OPM directed agencies to fire probationary workers, or whether the agency heads acted on their own.",
      "But in the end, Alsup concluded that the human resources agency directed departments to get rid of the workers, with the exception of those considered \"mission critical.\" He rejected the Justice Department's attempts to argue that press releases announcing the terminations show the agency heads themselves were the decisionmakers.",
      "The Trump administration last month fired thousands of probationary employees, generally those who were in their roles for less than a year, as part of the president's efforts to shrink the size of the federal government.",
      "The notices informed the affected federal employees that they were being terminated for performance reasons. Shortly after, a group of unions representing government workers, the state of Washington and nonprofit organizations challenged the mass firings, arguing that OPM lacked the authority to order agencies to carry them out.",
      "Danielle Leonard, a lawyer for the unions, said during Thursday's hearing that the firings were not done at the discretion of each agency and argued OPM deliberately targeted probationary employees because they cannot challenge their terminations. She pointed to a Jan. 20 memo from Ezell noting that those on probationary periods \"can be terminated during that period without triggering appeal rights to the Merit Systems Protection Board.\"",
      "\"That's how insidious this action was,\" she said, adding that the plan from the beginning of Mr. Trump's second term was to fire all probationary workers because they did not have a means of challenging their removals.",
      "\"It's profoundly unlawful,\" she said.",
      "Leonard noted that probationary employees are not just those who are new to the workforce, but also includes those who recently received promotions.",
      "\"This action made Swiss cheese of the federal agencies at every level,\" she said, adding that it targeted people with \"decades\" of federal service and experience. \"They're gone. Turn in your keys.\"",
      "But Helland, the government's lawyer, argued that press releases from agencies show that their political leadership was taking credit for the terminations. He acknowledged that while OPM had a role in coordinating the efforts, it was the departments who made the final determinations of whom to fire.",
      "Alsup's latest order comes after he said last month said in separate decision providing temporary relief that the mass firings were likely unlawful\u00a0and ordered OPM to inform certain agencies that it did not have the authority to order the terminations.",
      "On the heels of that decision, Ezell and OPM issued revised guidance\u00a0telling department leaders that they do not have to take any \"specific performance-based actions\" regarding probationary employees.",
      "\"Agencies have ultimate decision-making authority over, and responsibility for, such personnel actions,\" the revised memo stated.",
      "In addition to the mass firings, Mr. Trump's efforts to drastically cut the size of the federal government included a so-called deferred resignation program, through which government workers OPM also gave federal workers the option to resign their positions but retain full pay and benefits until Sept. 30.",
      "The White House said roughly 75,000 employees accepted the offer to leave their government jobs, far fewer than the\u00a0200,000 it expected\u00a0to take the so-called buyout.",

    "story": [
      "A 37-year-old man died after falling from a chairlift that was having a mechanical problem at a Montana ski area, according to local authorities and a spokesperson for Red Lodge Mountain.",
      "The man was riding alone in a three-person chair that carries skiers up the mountain when he fell from an unspecified height, they said. The accident happened Monday just before noon at the ski area southeast of Billings in the Beartooth Mountains.",
      "Jeffrey Zinne of Billings was taken to a Billings hospital where he was pronounced dead early Wednesday from injuries suffered in the fall, according to Carbon County Sheriff Josh McQuillan and Rich Hoffman with the Yellowstone County Coroner's Office.",
      "The lift, known as the Triple Chair, was stopped after the accident, Red Lodge Mountain spokesperson Troy Hawks said. More than 100 people who were on it at the time were evacuated by ski patrollers who used ropes to lower them to the ground.",
      "Hawks said the lift had a mechanical problem at the time Zinne fell, but declined to comment further and said the circumstances were being investigated. Weather conditions and the victim's actions also were being looked at, he said.",
      "On the morning of the accident, some other chairlifts at Red Lodge Mountain were not operating because of high winds. Wind gusts of about 50 miles per hour were recorded in the area shortly before and after the accident, according to the National Weather Service.",
      "Hawks said the Triple Chairlift, which is almost a mile long and was built in 1983, was operating within safety parameters. It will remain shut down until an engineer fully assesses it, he said.",
      "Staff at the ski area inspect its chairlifts daily, Hawks said. A professional inspection is conducted annually as required by Red Lodge Mountain's insurance carrier and the U.S. Forest Service, which leases land to the ski area, he said.",
      "\"We place a top priority on the safety of all of our lifts and lift operations, and perform daily, weekly, monthly, and annual safety measures to better ensure the safe operation of our lifts,\" the resort said in a statement\u00a0on social media.",

      "\"This unexpected loss has left his family, friends, and all who knew him heartbroken and in disbelief,\" the GoFundMe said.",
      "Fatal lift accidents at ski areas are relatively rare, according to the National Ski Areas Association. Between 1956 and 2024, 35 people died in accidents involving chairlifts and aerial ropeways. Sixteen of the deaths were linked to mechanical malfunctions, according to data collected by the group.",
      "The latest death during that time period was in 2020, when a man died at\u00a0Colorado's Vail resort\u00a0after his clothing got entangled in part of the chairlift, making him unable to breathe.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Thursday threatened to impose tariffs on wines, Champagnes and other alcoholic products imported to the U.S. from France and other European countries in response to raised tariffs the European Union placed on American whiskey.",
      "In a post to Truth Social, the social media company the president owns, Mr. Trump said the U.S. will retaliate against the European Union after it announced Wednesday that it would be increasing tariffs on U.S.-made whiskey to 50%.",
      "\"If this tariff is not removed immediately, the U.S. will shortly place a 200% tariff on all wines, champagnes, & alcoholic products coming out of France and other E.U. represented countries,\" he wrote. \"This will be great for the wine and champagne businesses in the U.S.\"",
      "Mr. Trump accused the EU of being \"one of the most hostile and abusive taxing and tariffing authorities in the world.\"",
      "Since returning to office, the president has threatened tariffs, and imposed the levies, on a host of major U.S. trading partners. On Wednesday, he increased tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports to 25%, prompting retaliatory action from the EU.",
      "European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement Wednesday that the countermeasures from the EU are worth 26 billion euros, or $28 billion. The tariffs, set to take effect April 1, target a range of U.S. exports, including beef, poultry, bourbon, jeans and peanut butter.",
      "\"We deeply regret this measure,\" von der Leyen said. \"Tariffs are taxes. They are bad for business, and worse for consumers. They are disrupting supply chains. They bring uncertainty for the economy. Jobs are at stake. Prices will go up.\"",
      "The U.S. exported $1.2 billion in wine and related products in 2024, including more than $167 million to the EU, according to the Department of Agriculture. It is the top importer of wine, bringing in nearly $4.9 billion worth in 2023. France and Italy were the top partners for importing both wine and Champagne into the U.S.",
      "Champagne is a sparkling wine from the Champagne region in northeast France. If it is made outside of that region, it is called sparkling wine.",
      "Chris Swonger, president and CEO of the Distilled Spirits Council, a trade group representing the U.S. spirits industry, called the EU's announcement to reimpose heightened tariffs on American whiskey \"deeply disappointing\"",
      "\"Reimposing these debilitating tariffs at a time when the spirits industry continues to face a slowdown in U.S. marketplace will further curtail growth and negatively impact distillers and farmers in states across the country,\" Swonger said in a statement. \"We urge the U.S. and EU governments to come to a resolution that gets our spirits industry back to zero-for-zero tariffs.\"",
      "According to the Distilled Spirits Council, a retaliatory tariff imposed in 2018 during Mr. Trump's first term, caused exports of U.S.-made whiskey to drop 20%. But over the last three years, exports to the EU grew nearly 60% from $439 million in 2021 to $699 million in 2024, the trade group said.",
      "Since returning to the White House for a second term, Mr. Trump has made tariffs a key area of his economic agenda, though the levies have sparked concerns of a recession and roiled the stock market. The president declined to rule out the possibility of an economic downturn, telling Fox News in an interview that aired Sunday that \"there is a period of transition because what we're doing is very big.\"",
      "In an interview with CBS News, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Tuesday that Mr. Trump's economic policies are \"the most important thing America has ever had\" when asked whether they would be worth it if they lead to a recession. \"It's worth it.\"",
      "Lutnick added, \"The only reason there could possibly be a recession is because the Biden nonsense that we had to live with. These policies produce revenues. They produce growth. They produce factories being built here.\"",
      "The president's trade war escalated this month with 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, as well as an additional 10% tax on goods imported from China, taking effect last week. Beijing imposed retaliatory measures that went into force Monday that target U.S. farmers with levies of 15% on chicken, wheat and corn, and 10% on soybeans, pork, beef and fruit.",
      "The president, however, swiftly reversed course on the levies on imports from Mexico and Canada, pausing the tariffs covered under a 2020 trade deal negotiated during his first administration until April 2. That agreement, the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, covers the majority of goods imported from Mexico. Those that are not subject to the deal, however, still face tariffs.",
      "Mr. Trump has also exempted other products from his planned tariffs, including providing a one-month exemption to U.S. automakers that were bracing to be hit hard\u00a0by the levies on vehicle parts and components imported from Canada, Mexico and China.",

      "The 227-year-old law\u00a0gives presidents the extraordinary power to order the arrest, detention and deportation of noncitizens who are 14 years or older and come from countries staging an \"invasion or predatory incursion\" of the U.S.",

      "Officials have made preparations to send suspected gang members to the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, soon after Mr. Trump invokes the Alien Enemies Act, two of the U.S. officials said. At Mr. Trump's direction, officials have been detaining some migrants awaiting deportation at the naval base, though the holding facilities were left empty earlier this week.",
      "Those subject to the Alien Enemies Act would not be allowed to have a court hearing or an asylum interview since they would be processed under an emergency, wartime authority \u2014 not immigration law. Instead, they would be eligible to be detained and deported, with little to no due process, under Title 50, the section of the U.S. code housing America's war and defense laws.",
      "CNN first reported Mr. Trump's plans to invoke the law as early as Friday.",
      "The Alien Enemies Act has been invoked only a few times in U.S. history, including during World War II, when the government used it to surveil and detain Italian, German and Japanese immigrants in the U.S.",

      "Mr. Trump previewed his invocation of the Alien Enemies Act in an executive order issued on his first day back at the White House. It directed the secretaries of state and homeland security to plan for the potential invocation of the law and prepare facilities \"necessary to expedite the removal\" of those subject to it.",

      "A volcano near Alaska's largest city is showing new signs of unrest, with experts saying the likelihood of an eruption at Mount Spurr in the next few weeks or months has increased.",
      "The Alaska Volcano Observatory said Wednesday\u00a0it had measured during recent overflights \"significantly elevated volcanic gas emissions,\" and said signs indicated an eruption was likely, though not certain, in the weeks or months ahead.",
      "\"We expect to see further increases in seismic activity, gas emissions and surface heating prior to an eruption, if one were to occur,\" the observatory said in a statement. \"Such stronger unrest may provide days to weeks of additional warning.\"",
      "However, the observatory warned that it was possible that an eruption could happen with little or no warning.",
      "\"While we expect additional changes to monitoring data prior to an eruption, it is also possible that an eruption could occur with little or no additional warning,\" the observatory wrote. \"This would be extremely hazardous for recreators on Mount Spurr or near its drainages as well as those overflying the volcano.\"",
      "What is Mount Spurr?",
      "Mount Spurr is one of 53 volcanoes in Alaska that have been active within the last 250 years. It has two main vents and is 11,070 feet (3,374 meters) tall. It is covered in ice and snow and is located roughly 80 miles (129 kilometers) northwest of Anchorage.",
      "When did Mount Spurr last erupt?",
      "The last known eruption from the summit vent was more than 5,000 years ago. The Crater Peak vent, meanwhile, erupted once in 1953 and three times in 1992, according to the observatory. The Crater Peak vent is about 2 miles (3 kilometers) south of the summit.",
      "There have been periods of increased earthquake or other activity since then, including between 2004 and 2006, but no other eruptions. Last October, the observatory raised its alert status for Mount Spurr from green to yellow when an increase in seismic activity became pronounced and a ground deformation was spotted in satellite data.",
      "The most likely outcome of the current unrest would be an eruption or eruptions similar to those in 1953 and 1992, the observatory said.",
      "\"It is also possible that no eruption occurs and the present activity slowly dies away or that a smaller eruption takes place,\" John Power, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey at the observatory, wrote in an email.",
      "What impacts could an eruption have?",
      "The eruptions during the last century lasted between three and seven hours, produced ash columns that rose more than 50,000 feet (15,240 meters) above sea level and deposited ashfall in south-central Alaska communities, according to the observatory.",
      "In 1992, ashfall of about a quarter-inch in Anchorage prompted residents to stay inside or to wear masks if going outside to avoid breathing ash. The cloud drifted as far as Greenland.",
      "CBS affiliate WGME-TV reported that the ash could drift all the way to the East Coast, but that would depend on the jet stream, and it probably would not have a major impact.",
      "Volcanic ash is angular and sharp and has been used as an industrial abrasive. The powdered rock can cause a jet engine to shut down.",
      "The 1992 eruptions prompted the temporary closures of airports in Anchorage and other communities.",

This includes 112 \"tipping point\" species \u2014 those that have lost more than half their populations in the past five decades. Some, like the Allen's hummingbird, tricolored blackbird and saltmarsh sparrow, are at extreme risk without immediate intervention, says the report, released Thursday.",
      "The population of grassland birds in the U.S. has dropped by 43% since 1970, as row-crop production, drought and habitat loss take their toll, the report says. Aridland birds have declined 41% in the same period due to drought, wildfires and invasive species. Even forest birds, facing habitat degradation from fire suppression and industrial timber practices, are seeing widespread declines. Waterfowl, once considered a conservation success, have declined by 20% since 2014 from the loss of wetlands and grasslands.",
      "The findings continue a downward trend. A 2019 study published in Science, an academic journal, found that North America lost nearly 3 billion birds over the previous 50 years, including 90 \"tipping point\" species of 529 bird species that were examined.",
      "\"The 2025 State of the Birds report shows those losses are continuing, with declines among several bird trend indicators,\" the new report says. \"Notably duck populations\u2014a bright spot in past State of the Birds reports, with strong increases since 1970\u2014have trended downward in recent years.\"",
      "Conservationists have previously warned that bird populations are in steep decline due to habitat loss and climate change, and they're further alarmed after the U.S. Interior Department last month suspended a legal opinion from the Biden administration that held companies accountable for accidentally killing birds through industrial activities like oil and gas drilling, wind energy production and construction \u2013 in a victory for the energy sector.",
      "Birds play a critical role in maintaining healthy ecosystems. They help control pests, disperse seeds and pollinate plants, contributing to crop yields and supporting biodiversity, says Amanda Rodewald, faculty director of the Cornell Lab of Ornithology's Center for Avian Population Studies",
      "And declining bird populations signal larger environmental problems, experts say.",
      "\"There's a really long history and a lot of evidence that shows that birds can be excellent indicators of environmental conditions,\" Rodewald told CBS News. \"We share the same environments with birds, if they're not healthy for bird populations, they're not likely to be healthy for us either.\"",
      "Beyond their ecological role, birds bring significant economic and mental health benefits. Birdwatching contributes $279 billion to the U.S. economy and supports 1.4 million jobs, according to the report. Encounters with birds have also been linked to reduced stress and improved mental well-being, further underscoring their importance.",
      "Experts stress that conservation efforts can succeed when adequately funded. The bald eagle, once nearly wiped out by the pesticide DDT, has rebounded thanks to concerted efforts. In December, the species even gained bipartisan recognition as the official U.S. bird.",
      "Strategic habitat conservation efforts \u2014 such as conservation ranching, coastal restoration and seabird translocation \u2014 are already making a difference in some regions.",
      "The new report calls for increased investment in conservation programs, stronger habitat protections, and policies that promote sustainable land management. Without swift action, scientists warn, the next State of the Birds report could bring even graver news.",
      "\"Birds unite us across the hemisphere and across the political spectrum,\" said Marshall Johnson, chief conservation officer at the National Audubon Society. \"There should be no hesitation in moving to protect them today and in the future.\""

    "summary": "Lawyer for the Federal Trade Commission says agency needs to seek trial delay in case against Amazon due to staffing and budgetary challenges.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Trade Commission asked a federal judge on Wednesday to delay a trial in a case accusing Amazon of using deceptive practices in its Prime subscription program, citing staffing and budgetary challenges at the government agency.",
      "Jonathan Cohen, a lawyer for the FTC, made the request before U.S. District Judge John Chun, who is overseeing the legal proceedings from a 2023 lawsuit the commission filed against the e-commerce giant in Washington state.",
      "\"Our resource constraints are severe and really unique to this moment,\" Cohen said during a status hearing on Wednesday. \"We have lost employees in the agency, in our division and on the case team.\"",
      "When the judge asked if the agency's challenges were due to recent cuts in the federal government, Cohen said it was, adding that some employees chose to leave the FTC following the \"Fork in the road\" email sent by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency in January. Staff members who resigned for other reasons also have not been replaced due to a government hiring freeze, he said.",
      "The Amazon trial had been scheduled to start in September. The FTC is seeking to relax some of the deadlines in the case and a delay akin to a two-month continuance. The agency does not want to \"move the trial back more than a couple of months,\" Cohen said.",
      "Currently, the agency's legal team is \"racing at considerable cost\" to meet a late April deadline for discovery while at the same time dealing with restrictive rules on purchasing court documents and travel, Cohen explained.",
      "Other factors could hamper staffers' preparations for the trial, he said. In April, FTC employees will have to spend time packing up and vacating their office building so they can potentially move into \"an abandoned USAID facility,\" Cohen said.",
      "Chun, the judge, asked how \"things are going to be different in two months\" with the issues the agency is experiencing.",
      "Cohen responded by saying he \"cannot guarantee if things won't be even worse.\"",
      "\"But there are a lot of reasons to believe ... we have been through the brunt of it, at least for a while,\" he said.",
      "During the hearing, John Hueston, an attorney representing Amazon, pushed back on the agency's request. He said most of the FTC attorneys assigned to the Amazon case were still employed by the agency.",
      "Even in the case of staff turnover, the government still lacks the grounds to seek a delay since changes in legal teams happen often, Hueston argued. Amazon executives and trial lawyers already cleared their schedules for a September trial, and the company has wanted to clear its name for more than two years, he said.",
      "\"We really want to keep the date\" for the trial, Hueston said.",
      "Amazon Prime enrollment",
      "The lawsuit, which was brought under former FTC Chair Lina Khan, alleged Amazon had enrolled consumers in the Prime program without consent and made it difficult for them to cancel their subscriptions.",
      "The agency filed the case months before it submitted an antitrust lawsuit against the retail and technology company, accusing it of having monopolistic control over online markets. Attorneys for that case, which is scheduled to go to trial in October 2026, presented economic arguments in court last week.",
      "Like other tech companies, Amazon has been attempting to forge friendlier ties with President Donald Trump, who repeatedly criticized the company during his first term.",
      "In December, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos said he was \"optimistic\" about Trump's second term. The same month, the company said it would donate $1 million to Trump's inauguration fund. Bezos, along with other tech leaders, was also a guest at the inauguration.",
      "This week, Amazon's Prime Video service began streaming \"The Apprentice,\" the long-running TV show that boosted Trump's profile before he ran for president. The company is also working on a documentary that offers an \"unprecedented behind-the-scenes look\" into the life of first lady Melania Trump.",
      "Meanwhile, Bezos has made changes to The Washington Post, which he owns, that some critics have cast as favorable to Trump.",
      "Before the election, Bezos defended the newspaper's decision not to endorse a presidential candidate as \"right\" and \"principled.\" He rejected speculation that he ordered the non-endorsement to protect his business interests.",

      "\"We are deeply saddened by the passing of Arkansas legend Oliver Miller,\" Arkansas said in a social media post. \"A key member of the 1990 Final Four team, an SWC Hall of Famer, a first-round NBA draft pick and a true embodiment of the Razorback spirit.

      "Latah County Prosecutor Bill Thompson made the claim in a motion filed in the case this week.",
      "\"Instead of challenging the conclusion that the DNA on the knife sheath belonged to Defendant, the defense's expert disclosures reveal that the defense plans to argue the DNA on the knife sheath does not prove Defendant was ever at the crime scene and the knife sheath itself could have been planted by the real perpetrator,\" Thompson wrote.",
      "Many of the court documents detailing both sides' plans for expert witnesses have been sealed, so it's not currently possible to compare Thompson's characterization of the defense plans against the defense team's own court filings.",

      "According to court documents released last week, two surviving roommates texted each other that morning about a masked man in the house. One roommate texted after 4 a.m. on Nov. 13, 2022, that they were \"freaking out\" about possibly seeing a man in the house wearing what appeared to be a ski mask. The messages also said the roommate had tried calling their other roommates but none had answered their phones.",
      "When asked to enter a plea last year, Kohberger stood silent, prompting a judge to enter a not guilty plea on his behalf. Prosecutors have said they will seek the death penalty if Kohberger is convicted.",
      "Prosecutors have said they matched \"touch DNA\" found on a knife sheath near one of the victims to DNA taken from Kohberger using investigative genetic genealogy, or IGG techniques. Defense attorney Anne Taylor pushed to have the investigative genetic genealogy thrown out of the case, but 4th District Judge Steven Hippler denied that request last month.",
      "Still, prosecutors say they don't intend to refer to the IGG evidence during the trial and will instead tell jurors that a \"tip\" led them to Kohberger as a suspect.",

    "story": [
      "March's full \"Blood Worm Moon,\" a phenomenon that makes the moon appear red during a total lunar eclipse, is visible this week for Americans and others in Earth's Western Hemisphere.",
      "The full moon reaches peak illumination at 2:55 a.m. ET on Friday, March 14. The total lunar eclipse will make the moon appear red on Thursday, March 13 into the following day, depending on the time zone, according to NASA.",
      "When and where to see the \"Blood Worm Moon\"",
      "While this month's full moon will rise early Friday, the appearance of a full moon started around Wednesday evening and will last through Saturday morning, according to NASA. The Old Farmer's Almanac details specific moonrise times for ZIP codes across the U.S. Local forecasts also include detailed information on how clear the night sky will be in various locations.",
      "The \"Blood Moon\" phenomenon will start before the full moon reaches peak illumination. As the lunar eclipse begins, the moon will start moving through Earth's shadow on Thursday at 11:57 p.m. ET. However, the moon's gradual dimming won't be noticeable until around 1:09 a.m. on Friday. The moon will be fully shaded from around 2:26 to 3:31 a.m., with the peak viewing opportunity for the red moon happening around 2:59 a.m.",
      "The moon will exit from Earth's full shadow between 3:31 and 4:48 a.m., and will leave the last of the partial shadow at 6 a.m., ending lunar eclipse.",
      "Viewers in North and South America will catch the best views of the \"Blood Worm Moon,\" though parts of Europe and Africa may catch a glimpse.",
      "How can I observe the eclipse?",
      "The moon will still be visible during the eclipse, even though it will be in full shadow of the Earth, according to NASA.",
      "You don't need any special equipment to observe a lunar eclipse, although binoculars or a telescope will enhance the view. Viewers should head to dark environment away from bright lights for the best moon viewing conditions.",
      "What is a lunar eclipse and why does it make the moon look red?",
      "When the sun, Earth and moon all align so that the moon passes into the Earth's shadow, there's a lunar eclipse. During a total lunar eclipse, like the one happening this week, the entire moon falls within the darkest part of Earth's shadow.",
      "The moon will appear red-orange when it's in the Earth's shadow. Any sunlight that's not blocked by the Earth during the eclipse will be filtered through a \"thick slice of Earth's atmosphere\" as it heads toward the moon's surface, according to NASA. This will make the moon appear red.",
      "Why is March's full moon called the worm moon?",
      "This month's full moon is also called the Worm Moon. The nickname may have come from the earthworms typically found as spring nears, according to the Old Farmer's Almanac.",

      "This month's full moon is due to pass through the shadow of Earth either late tonight, March 13, or very early tomorrow morning, March 14, depending on the viewer's time zone. It should be visible to people in the Americas and elsewhere in the Western Hemisphere.",
      "Dubbed the \"Worm Moon\" by the Farmer's Almanac, which has been assigning names to full moons for almost a century, this one is expected to start taking shape Wednesday evening and is supposed to last through Saturday morning, according to NASA. The full moon will technically rise in its totality early Friday.",
      "Here's what to know about the event \u2014 and why the moon will bear a new hue when it happens.",
      "Why will the moon be red, orange and yellow tonight?",
      "The moon will appear to turn red late tonight or early tomorrow morning, depending on skywatchers' locations, as Earth passes directly between it and the sun in what's known as a total lunar eclipse. Their perfect alignment darkens the moon, from the perspective of folks looking up, because our planet's position blocks most sunlight from reaching it.",
      "Some light still makes its way to the moon's surface, but only certain shades of it. The colors that wind up there are longer wavelengths of light \u2014 red, orange, yellow \u2014 which withstood the journey through \"a thick slice of Earth's atmosphere,\" NASA said.",
      "Shorter wavelengths of the color spectrum, like blue, scatter easily when they hit the atmosphere. That's why a vast sky can look blue in the middle of the day, when sunlight can shine straight down from overhead. Longer wavelengths materialize on Earth when sunlight hits from more of a perpendicular angle, so its route through our atmosphere can be more extensive. Short wavelengths are essentially filtered out by the atmosphere over such a protracted distance, and only the longer reds, oranges and yellows remain.",
      "What is a \"Blood Moon\"?",
      "\"Blood Moon\" is a nickname that refers to the moon's reddish appearance during a total lunar eclipse.",
      "The full moon will take on several shades of red, orange and yellow when it's nearer the outer edges of Earth's shadow \u2014 when it first intersects with the path of Earth's shadow, for example, and as it's on its way out. But shades of deep red will become more pronounced as the moon enters the darkest part of the shadow.",
      "What exactly causes a \"Blood Moon\"?",
      "A \"Blood Moon\" happens during a total lunar eclipse, when the sun, Earth and the moon align in that order. Long wavelengths of sunlight are refracted through Earth's atmosphere before reaching the moon, which reflects them in reddish hues that may resemble the color of blood.",
      "How to see the \"Blood Moon\" lunar eclipse",
      "The upcoming \"Blood Moon\" will begin before the full moon reaches its brightness point tonight.",
      "As the lunar eclipse gets underway, the moon will start moving through Earth's shadow at 11:57 p.m. EDT. It will become steadily dimmer over the next several hours as it travels toward the darkest part of the shadow and, eventually, appear fully darkened from around 2:26 p.m. to 3:31 a.m. in the early hours of Friday. The most ideal opportunity to see the reddish moon is during the minutes leading up to 3 a.m. EDT, as the moon should be situated in the center of Earth's shadow around then.",

    "story": [
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin said Thursday that he agrees in principle with a U.S. proposal for a 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine, but that the terms need to be worked out, and he emphasized that it should pave the way to lasting peace.",
      "\"The idea itself is correct, and we certainly support it,\" Putin said during a news conference in Moscow.",
      "\"But there are issues that we need to discuss, and I think that we need to discuss it with our American colleagues and partners,\" he said, adding that he could discuss those details in another phone conversation with President Trump.",
      "Putin noted that Ukrainian troops are encircled in their last foothold in Russia's Kursk region, and said it would be necessary to determine before a ceasefire whether they will lay down weapons and surrender. He also noted the need to develop a mechanism to control possible breaches of the truce, though the Kremlin has repeatedly ruled out Western troops being deployed to Ukraine as peacekeepers.",
      "\"We agree with the proposals to halt the fighting, but we proceed from the assumption that the ceasefire should lead to lasting peace and remove the root causes of the crisis,\" said Putin, who has always blamed the war and his full-scale invasion that sparked it on Ukraine.",
      "He said that while the U.S. had apparently persuaded Ukraine to accept a ceasefire, Kyiv was interested in a truce because of the battlefield situation.",
      "\"In these conditions, I believe it would be good for the Ukrainian side to secure a ceasefire for at least 30 days,\" he said.",
      "Putin spoke hours after a senior U.S. envoy arrived in Moscow to discuss the U.S.-proposed 30-day ceasefire, and less than a day after he made a first visit to his commanders in Kursk, wearing military fatigues and promising the full recapture of the region.",
      "On Wednesday, a U.S. official confirmed to CBS News that Russian troops had made \"significant gains\" in Kursk over the past week. Russia has been maneuvering to surround the Ukrainian forces who launched a surprise incursion into Kursk months ago, and they have succeeded in doing so to the extent that the Ukrainians will likely soon have to decide whether to withdraw back into Ukraine, or be cut off from their supply lines, the American official told CBS News a day before Putin made essentially the same assertion.",
      "The renewed Russian military push and Putin's high-profile visit to his troops in Kursk came amid Mr. Trump's push for a rapid diplomatic end to the war sparked by Russia's full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022. The U.S. on Tuesday lifted its March 3 suspension of military aid and intelligence sharing for Kyiv after senior U.S. and Ukrainian officials made progress on how to stop the fighting during talks held in Saudi Arabia.",
      "\"It's up to Russia now,\" Mr. Trump said Wednesday, as his administration presses Moscow to agree to the ceasefire. The U.S. president has made veiled threats to hit Russia with new sanctions if it refuses to engage with his peace efforts, saying Wednesday that, \"in a financial sense, we could do things very bad for Russia. It would be devastating for Russia. But I don't want to do that because I want to see peace.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed that Mr. Trump's special envoy for Russia and Ukraine, Steve Witkoff, was heading to Moscow for talks with Russian officials, possibly including Putin. His plane touched down in Moscow on Thursday morning, but his schedule was not revealed.",
      "Kremlin foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov said after meeting Thursday with U.S. national security adviser Mike Waltz, who was with Witkoff in Moscow, that the U.S. proposal for a one-month ceasefire failed to take into account Russia's position, and would need reworking, according to Russian media.",
      "\"The document, it seems to me, has a hasty character,\" Ushakov said, according to Russia's state-run RIA news agency \"Itwill be necessary to work, think and take into account our position, too. It outlines only the Ukrainian approach.\"",
      "The Kremlin has repeatedly ruled out accepting any agreement that sees Western forces deployed in Ukraine to help maintain a peace, something many European nations have said will be needed, though only Britain and France have suggested any willingness to do so.",
      "By signaling its openness to a ceasefire, Ukraine has presented the Kremlin with a dilemma at a time when the Russian military has the upper hand in the war \u2014 whether to accept a truce and abandon hopes of making new gains, or reject the offer and risk derailing a cautious rapprochement with Washington.",
      "The Ukrainian army's foothold inside Russia has been under intense pressure for months from a renewed effort by Russian forces, backed by North Korean troops. Ukraine's daring incursion last August led to the first occupation of Russian soil by foreign troops since World War II and embarrassed the Kremlin.",
      "But given the recent Russian advances, Putin did not look like a man who was interested in ordering his forces to lay down their weapons on Wednesday as he visited troops in Kursk, wearing military fatigues and talking strategy with his commanders. He said he expected the military \"to completely free the Kursk region from the enemy in the nearest future.\"",
      "Putin added that going forward, \"it's necessary to think about creating a security zone alongside the state border,\" in a signal that Moscow could try to expand its territorial gains by capturing parts of Ukraine's neighboring Sumy region. That idea could complicate a ceasefire deal.",
      "Ukraine launched the summer raid into Kursk in a bid to counter the increasingly glum news from the front line, as well as to draw Russian troops away from the battlefield inside Ukraine and gain a bargaining chip in any peace talks. But the incursion failed to significantly change the dynamic of the war.",
      "Ukraine's top military head, Gen. Oleksandr Syrskyi, said late Wednesday that Russian aviation had carried out an unprecedented number of strikes on Kursk and that as a result Sudzha had been almost completely destroyed. He did not comment on whether Ukraine still controlled the settlement but said it was \"maneuvering (troops) to more advantageous lines.\"",

    "summary": "Along with Arab nations backing an alternative to Trump's \"Riviera of the Mideast\" proposal, Hamas also cautiously welcomed his sharp change in rhetoric.",
    "story": [
      "During a meeting on Wednesday with Ireland's leader Michel Martin, President Trump made an offhand remark that was quickly picked up in the Middle East as a major change in his stance on the war-torn Gaza Strip and its roughly 2 million Palestinian inhabitants.",
      "\"Nobody is expelling any Palestinians,\" Mr. Trump told reporters.",
      "That came after he repeatedly said that under his own proposal to rebuild Gaza, all of its residents would be moved out, while the U.S. moved in to \"take over\" the coastal territory to turn it into a luxury real estate development. Just a month ago, Mr. Trump was clear that, in his mind, not only would Palestinians need to leave Gaza, they would not be permitted to return.",
      "That plan was roundly and clearly rejected by Arab countries, including Egypt and Jordan, which Mr. Trump had said would take in the displaced masses.",
      "Egypt, which has led efforts to present an alternative plan for Gaza that does not involve displacing Palestinians, welcomed the change in tone by Mr. Trump.",
      "\"Egypt expresses its appreciation for the statements made by U.S. President, Donald Trump\u2026 regarding the non-displacement of the residents of the Gaza Strip,\" the Egyptian Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Thursday. \"Egypt affirms that this position reflects an understanding of the importance of avoiding further deterioration of the humanitarian situation in the Strip and the necessity of working towards finding just and sustainable solutions to the Palestinian cause.\"",
      "Hamas, the U.S. and Israeli designated terrorist organization that sparked the war in Gaza with its brutal Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel, also cautiously welcomed the shift in Mr. Trump's rhetoric.",
      "\"If Trump's statements represent a retreat from the idea of Palestinian displacement, then they are welcomed,\" a statement from the group's spokesperson said.",
      "Mr. Trump's remarks came Wednesday after his senior envoy Steve Witkoff met with the foreign ministers of five Arab nations in Qatar to discuss Gaza's post-war future. That future, regardless of what reconstruction plan is eventually implemented, can only start taking shape once there is an official end to the war, however.",
      "A fragile truce between Israel and Hamas has largely kept the peace since January 19, but the two sides have not yet agreed on whether to extend the first phase of the agreement, or to move onto a second phase as originally envisioned. The dialogue in Doha, Qatar, involving delegations from the host-nation as well as Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Jordan and the U.S. is aimed at pushing the process forward \u2013 and keeping the guns silent in Gaza.",
      "The five Arab nations involved have pushed the Egyptian-crafted alternative to Mr. Trump's \"Riviera of the Mideast\" proposal in their talks with American officials.",
      "The Arab plan, the rough outline of which officials shared with CBS News earlier this month, carries a price tag of $53 billion and envisions all of the enclave's residents remaining in Gaza throughout the years-long reconstruction. The Trump administration initially rejected the plan, with U.S. National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes issuing a statement saying it failed to \" address the reality that Gaza is currently uninhabitable and residents cannot humanely live in a territory covered in debris and unexploded ordnance.\"",
      "\"President Trump stands by his vision to rebuild Gaza free from Hamas,\" Hughes said at the time, adding: \"We look forward to further talks to bring peace and prosperity to the region.\"",
      "It appeared on Wednesday, with Mr. Trump's remarks at the White House, that those further talks with America's regional partners may have convinced the White House that displacing the entire population of Gaza was not a tenable proposition.",
      "\"The Arab foreign ministers presented the Gaza reconstruction plan, which was approved at the Arab Summit held in Cairo on March 4, 2025,\" the five Arab nations that met in Doha said in a joint statement shared Wednesday. \"They also agreed with the U.S. envoy to continue consultations and coordination on this plan as a basis for the reconstruction efforts in the sector.\"",
      "That Egyptian plan has been adopted by the broad Muslim solidarity group of 57 countries known as the Organization of Islamic Cooperation. It envisions the Gaza Strip eventually being run by the Palestinian Authority, which currently administers parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, not by Hamas.",
      "That will likely prove an ongoing point of contention as the PA holds little support among Palestinians and has been dismissed as a potential future Gaza administrator by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, showing there's still much negotiation ahead if Mr. Trump is to make good on his vows to end the crisis in the heart of the Middle East.",

      "Duda's adviser for international affairs, Wojciech Kolarski, followed up on Duda's appeal with an interview on Poland's RMF FM radio Thursday morning in which he argued that nuclear protection would improve security for Poland, a NATO member along the alliance's eastern flank that shares borders with Ukraine, Belarus and the Russian territory of Kaliningrad.",
      "Prime Minister Donald Tusk, a political opponent of Duda's, said last week that Poland was in talks with France concerning President Emmanuel Macron's proposal to use France's nuclear deterrent to protect the continent from Russian threats. Moscow called that idea \"extremely confrontational.\"",
      "Tusk made his comment to parliament after Macron said he has decided to open a \"strategic debate\" on using France's nuclear deterrent to protect European allies amid concerns over potential U.S. disengagement. The French president described Moscow as a \"threat to France and Europe\" in a televised address to the nation.",
      "France is the only nuclear power in the European Union.",
      "Macron met with President Trump in the White House late last month, a session Mr. Trump called \"an important step\" in ending the war between Russia and Ukraine, as his return to the White House indicated a likely tipping point in American support\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and a possible rift with France and other European allies.",
      "As Mr. Trump returned to the Oval Office in January, Macron\u00a0told his European counterparts\u00a0to \"wake up\" and spend more on the continent's defense to reduce its reliance on the United States for security.",
      "On Thursday, Mr. Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, and his team arrived in Moscow for meetings on the proposed 30-day ceasefire plan for Ukraine, a person familiar with the situation told CBS News. Russian outlets are also reporting his arrival.",

      "New species of shark, sea butterfly, mud dragon, bamboo coral, water bear, octocoral, and shrimp were just some of the findings that were registered in a directory after the collaborative conducted 10 global expeditions and hosted eight Species Discovery Workshops.",
      "\"The past two years have been transformative for the Ocean Census: we've pioneered new methods, forged key partnerships, established a global network of participating scientists, and overcome the hurdles of a truly global mission,\" said Oliver Steeds, director of the Ocean Census,\u00a0in a statement.",
      "While oceans cover most of our planet, not much has been done to protect its biodiversity, manage the conservation of ocean life and establish marine protected areas in the high seas. United Nations members\u00a0agreed on a unified treaty\u00a0in 2023 to protect biodiversity in the high seas. More than 100 nations, including the United States, have agreed to protect 30% of the world's oceans by 2030.",

      "The alliance was founded by Nippon Foundation and Nekton in April 2023; about 400 institutions participate in its activities, and 93 scientists were funded to participate in expeditions and research projects in an effort to speed up the identification and official registration of a new species, the Ocean Census\u00a0said\u00a0on its website. The process can take up to 13.5 years, some species may go extinct before they are even documented.",
      "Dave Ebert of the Pacific Shark Research Institute said in a video that knowing we have another new species, \"We can develop conservation methods for it - if it needs it.\"",
      "The recent flurry of expeditions launched by the Ocean Census used divers, submersibles and deep-sea robots up to 5000 meters below sea level to discover new species. The species were analyzed and confirmed in dozens of global laboratories.",
      "Some of the species discovered include:",
      "Guitar Shark",
      "Ebert, also known as the \"Lost Shark Guy,\" identified the guitar shark at 200m depths off Mozambique and Tanzania in Africa. This shark has 38 known species across the globe and shares characteristics of both sharks and rays. The guitar shark family is among the top 10 most threatened vertebrate groups and two-thirds are threatened.",

      "In August 2021, Tamim Satari raced to the Kabul International Airport to evacuate Afghanistan after working with the American military as an intelligence officer, helping U.S. forces coordinate aerial bomb campaigns against the Taliban. But in the chaos of the U.S. withdrawal, his wife and newborn son were left behind.",
      "\"It was so hard, and we didn't want to lose our small son,\" Satari said.",
      "He was not alone. Thousands of Afghan families were separated in the rushed withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan. Babies were passed across throngs of people and over fences, and families scrambled to get through the gates to the airport.",
      "Three years later, more than 10,000 families remain separated, according to Shawn VanDiver, the founder of #AfghanEvac, a nonprofit that worked with the State Department to create a path to reunite separated Afghan families.",
      "\"There's all these moms or dads or young children who are stuck here without their family,\" said VanDiver. \"These people are in danger because of us. And the least we can do is help them reunite.\"",
      "He says the number of children separated from their parents includes 2,800 unaccompanied refugee minors \u2014 children who made it to the U.S. but whose parents did not, or who were left behind as their parents fled.",
      "VanDiver works with the Office of the Coordinator for Afghan Relocation Efforts, known as CARE, a State Department program that was established to assist wartime Afghan allies immigrate to the U.S.",
      "Since 2021, the CARE program has facilitated travel for nearly 200,000 Afghans, according to documents reviewed by CBS News.",
      "This includes those with special immigrant visas who were wartime allies typically paid by the U.S. government. It also includes Afghan refugees who assisted the U.S. mission in military roles, as civil society members, or those who are family members of those who served.",
      "\"The truth is, is that every single person in the refugee pipeline and every single person in the [special immigrant visa] pipeline are somebody who took action in our name and are now in danger,\" said VanDiver.",
      "\"And these Afghans deserve everything that we can give to them because they protected us.\"",
      "After trying unsuccessfully to bring his wife and son over on his own, Satari connected with CARE in 2023 to get help facilitating their visa process. His wife, Shiba, and their son had escaped to Pakistan after she was threatened by the Taliban for continuing her work as a midwife while her husband was in the U.S.",
      "On Jan. 18, the weekend before President Trump's inauguration, Shiba and her son were flown to JFK airport in New York and then driven to Newark, New Jersey, for an emotional reunion with her husband. Tamim had not seen his son, now nearly 4 years old, since he was a newborn.",
      "The Sataris' family reunion at Newark Liberty International Airport was one of the last refugee reunions to take place.",
      "Three days later, Mr. Trump signed an executive order suspending the U.S. refugee program, stating \"the United States lacks the ability to absorb large numbers of migrants, and in particular, refugees, into its communities in a manner that does not compromise the availability of resources for Americans that protects their safety and security, and that ensures the appropriate assimilation of refugees.\"",
      "A federal judge ordered the administration to stop the ban, but since then normal refugee processing has not continued. In a recent court filing, lawyers for the administration said it would\u00a0 take time to restart refugee programs, since agencies have already cut contracts, reduced the workforce and frozen funding.",
      "In addition to Mr. Trump's executive order, Secretary of State Marco Rubio froze all federal funding for the programs that were providing travel for Afghans who had already been approved to resettle in the U.S. This means that anyone vetted and approved for travel \u2014 including those already holding special immigrant visas \u2014 cannot leave Afghanistan unless they are able to pay for the trip themselves.",
      "According to government documents reviewed by CBS, more than 40,000 Afghans who have been vetted and approved to leave Afghanistan are now in limbo, with their lives at stake.",
      "\"I've heard countless horror stories of torture and murder of these allies of the United States,\" said Republican Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas, who voted for the CARE program.",
      "\"I would urge the administration to take a look at this and to honor the commitment that we made to [our allies], and not break our promise, but let them know that we are going to protect them.\"",
      "But Mr. Trump and other Republican lawmakers have expressed concern that allowing Afghans into the U.S. makes the country more vulnerable to terrorism.",
      "McCaul and others who advocate for the program say the vetting is already extremely effective.",
      "\"You want to vet them again? Go ahead. But they've already been vetted, and probably the most thorough vetting in American history,\" McCaul told CBS News.",
      "Afghans who come to the U.S are reviewed by the State Department, Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. They go through several in-person interviews and their biometrics are checked against government databases, in addition to extensive medical screening.",
      "\"Afghans who come to this country via the CARE program are the most vetted immigrant population in our country's history,\" said a former State Department official.",
      "Satari remains hopeful he will not be one of the last to be reunited with his family. He has settled in New Jersey and is employed in a mechanical job while he studies for his real estate license.",

    "story": [
      "Researchers in Spain have unearthed a fossil from a potential new prehistoric member of the human family tree, and they say it's the earliest known remnants of a face discovered in Western Europe.",
      "The facial bones from an adult were found at the Atapuerca archaeological site in northern Spain in 2022. Since then, a team of scientists has been working to learn more about the hominin, whom they nicknamed Pink. The researchers shared their findings in a study in the journal\u00a0Nature, which was published on Tuesday.",
      "Pink's remains have been dated as between 1.1 and 1.4 million years old, the researchers said.",
      "The research \"introduces a new actor in the history of human evolution in Europe,\" study author Rosa Huguet, of Spain's University of Rovira i Virgili, said at a news conference, according to the AFP news agency.",
      "The discovery suggests that early humans settled in Europe, traveling from the east side of the continent to the west, about 1.4 million years ago, the researchers said. Until now, the oldest-known human species in Western Europe was the\u00a0Homo antecessor. Experts have found Homo antecessor remains that are around 850,000 years old.",
      "The oldest human ancestor found in any area of Europe is the Dmanisi people, or Homo georgicus, a group that lived in what is now the nation of Georgia. Remains of that species have been dated back to 1.8 million years ago. They are the first members of the human family known to have traveled from Africa to Europe.",
      "The face of \"Pink\"",
      "The fossilized upper jawbone and partial cheekbone were excavated from a 52-foot-deep layer of silt and mud at Sima del Elefante, or the \"elephant pit,\" a site less than 1,000 feet from where the fossils of\u00a0Homo antecessor were discovered in 1994. The bones were not enough for researchers to determine Pink's age or gender.",
      "From those fossilized bones, researchers were able to use 3D imaging techniques to create a model of Pink's face. The face is more \"projected forward and more robust\" than a modern human face or a\u00a0Homo antecessor face, Maria Martinon-Torres, director of Spain's National Research Center on Human Evolution, told the AFP.",
      "Pink's face bears some similarities to the human ancestor Homo erectus,\u00a0researchers said. That species spanned nearly 2 million years and was the first human species to evolve more familiar human body proportions and use fire and tools. Remains of the species have been found in Africa, Asia and Europe.",
      "But the similarities weren't strong enough for the scientists to confirm that Pink was a member of that species. Instead, they have proposed that Pink could belong to a new possible species, which they called Homo 'affinis' erectus.",
      "\"This is the most honest proposal we can make with the evidence we have,\" Martinon-Torres said, according to AFP.",
      "The scientists were also able to analyze small stone tools and animal bones found at the excavation site to learn more about how Pink lived. The environment at the time was a humid forest landscape, and the early human population lived alongside horses, ancient cattle, monkeys and hippos, the researchers said. The area also likely had plenty of water, which would have made it an \"ideal\" place for the species to settle, Huguet said in the news conference.",
      "The researchers suggested that the species may be a bridge between the\u00a0Homo georgicus species and the\u00a0Homo antecessor species. Study co-author Jose Maria Bermudez de Castro told the AFP that it's likely the species \"probably disappeared\" during a severe global cooling era that occurred nearly 900,000 years ago.",

      "Mick was undocumented for the first few years he lived in the U.S., but he is now a citizen and describes himself as a proud New Yorker. He said there was a \"much broader fear\" among immigrant communities now during the second Trump administration.",

      "Ciara, who arrived in the U.S. before President Trump took office, said she was on a J-1 visa, which allows for educational and cultural exchange, but working illegally on the side. \"There is a bit of a safety net\" for Irish people in the hospitality industry, she said.",
      "\"It definitely is a worry, but I think I am definitely very privileged as well. I'm a White Irish girl with a third-level [college] education, so I think I'm in a lot more secure position to a lot of other people who are undocumented.\"",
      "But immigration attorneys have told CBS News that it would be naive for Irish undocumented people to believe that they may be immune to deportation.",
      "\"When Irish people come here, they come on what we call the visa waiver program, so that allows them to come to the United States without going to the consulate in Dublin, and they can come in for 90 days and stay for 90 days, and so most of them [who are undocumented] overstay,\" John Foley, a Boston-based immigration attorney told CBS News.",
      "\"The waiver part means they waive all rights to judicial processing, meaning they can be removed or deported from the United States without going in front of a judge,\" Foley said. \"If you're an ICE officer and you need to get 40 people a week, it's Thursday and you're at 27, you don't care where the last 13 come from.\"",
      "Contribution to the American economy",
      "Tom, a New York bar owner and legal resident in Manhattan, told CBS News that he has employed many undocumented Irish workers as well as undocumented Central and South American staff in his pub over the years. He says he couldn't operate as a business owner without them.",
      "\"I'd say 90% of the restaurants and small businesses in this city would close down if you took away the [undocumented] immigrants,\" Tom said. \"The folks who want to do those jobs are people that don't have clear legal paths into America.\"",

      "Legal pathways for undocumented immigrants are limited",
      "Mary, in New England, arrived in the U.S. in 1999. In the 26 years that she has lived in America, she has become a property owner and is self-employed.\u00a0 For the past 14 years, she has been trying to obtain sponsorship for legal residency through a legal petition from her brother, who is an American citizen. That process is still pending with no end in sight.",
      "\"There isn't really any opportunities,\" she said. \"There isn't a path right now for me.\"",
      "It's an issue facing many undocumented immigrants working in the United States today, where few legal pathways exist, and where they do, massive backlogs and bureaucracy cause long processing delays.",
      "A 2023 policy analysis\u00a0from the conservative think tank the Cato Institute said that fewer than 1% of people who want to move permanently to the United States can do so legally.",
      "One young Irish woman who overstayed her visa waiver in New York and is now working in a bar in Manhattan told CBS News that she just wants to work, but the avenues are limited.",
      "\"I would prefer to be legal and have legal status, but it was hard in general to get a visa, and I feel like now, it's 10 times harder to even consider trying to get a visa,\" she said.",
      "Mick, who eventually obtained citizenship, said he would support amnesty for people without criminal convictions who are living illegally in the U.S. and contribute to communities.",
      "\"A lot of the people who are coming to our countries and our shores are coming here because of policies that we've allowed to happen and that have benefited us for decades,\" he said. \"I feel like we should be looking after people who need help the most.

    "published": "Wed, 12 Mar 2025 11:55:19 -0400",
    "summary": "Sarah al-Awady says an Israeli quadcopter shot her in the head, leaving a bullet lodged behind her eye for 4 excruciating months.",
    "story": [
      "Cairo \u2014\u00a0Sarah al-Awady says she was sitting with her family early on the morning of Oct. 22, 2024, in their tent in Al-Zawaida, the town in the central Gaza Strip where the displaced Palestinians had taken shelter, when she was struck in the head by a bullet fired by an Israeli quadcopter drone.",
      "\"Suddenly I felt pain in my head, like I had been hit with an iron bar or something,\" the 18-year-old Gazan told CBS News this week. \"My family started screaming, 'a bullet, a bullet!' Everyone was panicking and they carried me and rushed me to Shuhada al-Aqsa Hospital.\"",
      "CBS News has asked the Israel Defense Forces about its reported use of small-arms-equipped drones in Gaza, and about al-Awady's claim, specifically, that she was hit by one of the weapons in a camp for displaced civilians. In a statement sent Wednesday, the IDF said it \"follows international law, targeting only military objectives and takes feasible precautions to mitigate civilian harm.\"",
      "The military said it could not give details about the various aircraft it uses, \"as they are classified for security reasons, and to avoid compromising the operational capabilities of the IDF,\" and added that it could not provide information about al-Awady's claim without more precise information on the time and location of the shooting.",
      "The doctors did what they could with what little they had amid the devastation in Gaza, just over a year after Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist attack sparked the war in the Palestinian territory. They could see that the bullet was lodged in al-Awady's skull, behind her right eye, but they didn't have the capacity to remove it.",
      "Al-Awady was eventually told there was nothing more the doctors in Gaza could do, but she refused to give up hope and insisted on staying in the hospital. At the very least, she thought, inside the hospital her badly wounded eye would be protected from the dusty conditions in her family's makeshift home.",
      "So she remained, relying on painkillers to cope with the excruciating pain in her head, but without any plan for relief in sight.",
      "In early November, al-Awady was seen by a team of volunteer medics visiting the European Hospital near Khan Younis, in southern Gaza. Dr. Mohamed Tawfik, an Egyptian, was among the volunteers, and when he saw al-Awady, he thought of someone he believed could help.",
      "Tawfik called his father, a veteran ophthalmologist, to get his medical opinion.",
      "Dr. Ahmed Tawfik, the elder doctor, told CBS News he wanted to go to Gaza to try to help the young woman, but the southern Rafah border crossing between the enclave and Egypt was closed.",
      "\"I followed this case almost daily. I felt this was my case,\" Tawfik said.",
      "But he could not find a way to travel to Gaza and, at the time, with the war still raging, Israel was permitting very few people to leave the enclave, even for medical treatment.",
      "The doctor's son returned to Egypt, and al-Awady told CBS News she started giving up hope. For months she said she lived in fear that she would permanently lose sight in her right eye.",
      "\"I applied for treatment abroad, like many others. When people asked me, 'How long have you been waiting?' I'd say a month. They'd tell me, 'Forget it, we've been waiting for so much longer.'\"",
      "A glimmer of hope would finally come, about three months after the bullet lodged in al-Awady's head, with the news that Israel and Hamas had agreed to a ceasefire deal. It came into effect on Jan. 19, 2024, and al-Awady was able to return to her home in the decimated north of Gaza.",
      "She said she was relieved to find her family's home among the few buildings spared from the destruction. She stayed there for a week, until, on the evening of February 8, she received a call from the World Health Organization, telling her she would be leaving the following day for Egypt.",
      "\"There is no electricity, so I literally packed my luggage by candlelight,\" she recalled. Only her mother was permitted to travel with her, but the pair reached Egypt the next day, as planned.",
      "She was sent first to the city of Port Said, on Egypt's Mediterranean coast. A week later, Dr. Tawfik managed to get her moved to the hospital where he works in Al-Sharqia Governorate, in the Nile Delta.",
      "Three teams \u2014 ophthalmology, neurosurgery and radiology \u2014 worked together, debating the best approach to remove the bullet that had been lodged for months right next to al-Awady's optic nerve.",
      "\"We ran several simulations to find the best route to avoid the optic nerve,\" Dr. Mohamed Khaled Shawky, of the Al Nour Radiology Center, told CBS News. He helped guide the surgery remotely via a video link from his workstation at the separate facility.",
      "\"The bullet landed in the best possible place for the patient, but the worst place for a medical team,\" Shawky told CBS News. \"Had it moved a millimeter in any direction, it would have caused great damage.\"",
      "The doctors agreed the best option was to try to reach the bullet by entering through al-Awady's eye socket, to avoid damaging her brain.",
      "Tawfik was direct, telling al-Awady there was a 50% chance of success, a risk of internal bleeding, and she could lose her eye entirely or have her vision severely impaired.",
      "\"I cried. I was very scared, but I prayed and accepted the risk,\" she told CBS News.",
      "\"His amazing medical team tried their best to improve my spirit, to make me psychologically ready, and they did. I entered the operating room laughing and full of joy,\" al-Awady said",
      "The surgery was carried out last week, and it was a success. Tawfik told CBS News he was surprised by the amount of infection and abscess caused by the bullet, which had rusted over time inside al-Awady's head.",
      "Even with the bullet out, al-Awady is not fully out of the woods.",
      "\"Three hours later, I opened my eyes and they told me that, thanks to God, all went well,\" she recalled. \"I started crying again.\"",
      "\"She is very stable now, and she is taking her meds and getting better,\" Tawfik told CBS News. \"My goal was first to end the pain caused by the infection and, second, to preserve her current eyesight level. I am hoping that after we deal with the retinal detachment her sight will improve.\"",
      "The young woman's eye will never look \u2014 or see \u2014 the same way it did before she was shot.",
      "Like many Palestinians who have made it out of Gaza to receive desperately needed medical help, al-Awady told CBS News that her joy is incomplete. She misses the rest of her family, who she had to leave behind.",
      "Asked about the rusty bullet that lived in her head for four months, she said she planned to hold onto it.",
      "\"I am thinking of framing it,\" she told CBS News.",

    "published": "Wed, 12 Mar 2025 09:33:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The Trump administration appears to be back in Ukraine's corner, but it's unclear if Putin, while enjoying battlefield victories, can be convinced to halt his assault.",
    "story": [
      "It's a confusing time for American diplomacy. After yesterday's meeting in Saudi Arabia, the U.S. appeared on Tuesday to be back in Ukraine's corner \u2014 and calling on Russia to agree to a 30-day ceasefire in the war it started more than three years ago. It remained entirely unclear on Wednesday, however, whether Vladimir Putin might agree to a temporary ceasefire. His forces currently have the momentum on the battlefield but, like Ukraine, Russia is thought to have suffered hundreds of thousands of military casualties.",
      "\"We're going to tell (the Russians) this is what's on the table. Ukraine is ready to stop shooting and start talking, and now it'll be up to them to say yes or no,\" U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters after the meeting in Jeddah. \"If they say no, then we'll unfortunately know what the impediment is to peace here\u2026 The ball's now in their court.\"",
      "Russia hedges, but notes battlefield \"dynamics are good\" for Putin",
      "The Kremlin said Wednesday that it needed more details on the proposal and time to consider it. Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow assumed that Rubio, who led the U.S. delegation at the talks with Ukraine on Tuesday, would be briefing Russian counterparts \"on the details of the negotiations in Saudi Arabia,\" but that before such information was shared, \"Russia does not want to get ahead of itself on the issue of the proposed truce.\"",
      "\"Contacts are planned in the coming days,\" Peskov said.",
      "Mr. Trump's special envoy for Russia and Ukraine, Steve Witkoff, is expected to head to Russia for talks later this week. Peskov indicated those talks could lead to another telephone conversation between Putin and Mr. Trump. He said there were no concrete plans for such a conversation yet, but \"if necessary, [it] can be organized very quickly.\"",
      "The Kremlin spokesman hinted, however, that Russia's bargaining position in any looming ceasefire talks was only getting stronger with every passing day. Putin's forces have continued a slow but steady advance in recent weeks, retaking ground in Russia's western border region of Kursk, where Ukrainian forces staged a shock incursion last year.",
      "\"The Kremlin is closely monitoring information from the military in the Kursk region,\" Peskov said. \"The data shows that Russian forces are advancing successfully, the dynamics are good.\"",
      "Russia's military said Wednesday that forces had retaken five more small villages in Kursk from Ukrainian troops. Russia also unleashed a fresh rocket attack on Ukraine overnight, with the State Emergency Service reporting strikes on Zelenskyy's heavily bombarded hometown of Kryvyi Rih. The service said apartment buildings, administrative buildings, a shop, an educational institution, buses and other vehicles were damaged in the strikes, and it accused Russia of then shelling rescuers who had responded. Local media reports said at least nine people were wounded and one woman, a passerby, was killed.",
      "The White House's shifting Ukraine policy",
      "The White House's shift after the meeting in Saudi Arabia \u2014 clearly putting the onus back on Moscow to end the war that Putin launched more than three years ago \u2014 was the second dramatic turn by the Trump administration in less than a month as it steers America's policy on Ukraine. It stood in stark contrast to the meeting Zelenskyy had just weeks ago in Washington, when Mr. Trump called the elected Ukrainian president \"a dictator,\" said he didn't \"have the cards right now\" to negotiate the terms of a truce, and then publicly berated him in the Oval Office.",
      "Mr. Trump then ordered the suspension of U.S. security assistance and intelligence sharing with Ukraine \u2014 both of which are crucial to the country standing any chance of holding Russia's advancing forces at bay.",
      "The pause was lifted Tuesday upon news of the agreement between Washington and Kyiv on a framework for a 30-day ceasefire, immediately unblocking a consignment of weapons already promised to Kyiv \u2014 roughly $3.8 billion worth of air defense systems, HIMARS rockets, artillery and support for Ukraine's F-16 fighter jets.",
      "In Poland, a U.S. NATO ally that shares a long border with western Ukraine and has staunchly supported Zelenskyy throughout the war, Prime Minister Donald Tusk lauded the \"important step towards peace,\" as the country's defense ministry confirmed the transfer of U.S.-supplied weapons had resumed across the Polish border.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, both of whom have indicated a willingness to send peacekeeping forces to Ukraine as part of any eventual truce deal, both hailed the progress in Jeddah, with Starmer calling it a \"remarkable breakthrough,\" while Macron cautioned that Kyiv would still need \"robust\" security guarantees as part of a ceasefire, to ward off any future Russian aggression.",
      "Rubio, speaking to reporters Wednesday, appeared to add further nuance to the White House's stance on the position of Ukraine and its neighbors, saying European nations would \"have to be involved\" in reaching a ceasefire, and framing the ongoing discussions as being \"about deterrence for Ukraine against future aggression.\"",
      "Mr. Trump and other senior U.S. officials have for weeks played down the importance of security guarantees for Ukraine \u2014 and completely ruled out any suggestion of U.S. boots on the ground. They have insisted that a new economic deal between Kyiv and Washington, aimed at granting U.S. access to Ukraine's reserves of highly-sought after mineral resources, would bring American investment that would effectively deter Russia, without a clear U.S. military commitment.",
      "Rubio said Wednesday, according to the Reuters news agency, that he would not frame a U.S.-Ukraine minerals deal as a deterrent to Russia.",
      "\"There's different ways to construct a deterrent on the ground that prevents another war from starting in the future,\" Rubio said, stressing that the Trump administration wasn't approaching the concept of security guarantees \"with any sort of preconceived notion.\"",
      "\"The bottom line,\" he said, \"is it needs to be something that makes Ukraine feel as if they can deter and prevent a future invasion.\"",
      "During the first three years of war, the U.S. government committed well over $100 billion to support Ukraine, helping defend a young democracy against Russia's aggression.",
      "That cause has drawn many volunteers from around the world to help train and fight alongside Ukraine's forces, including Americans who've come as private citizens, risking their own personal safety. CBS News has met Americans helping train Ukrainian soldiers and evacuating civilians from front-line areas.",
      "It's believed that hundreds of American volunteers, many of them U.S. veterans, have signed up to serve with Ukraine's army. For some of them, the U.S. administration's recent actions and rhetoric \u2014 particularly remarks by Mr. Trump that echoed Kremlin talking points, suggesting the war is Kyiv's fault and that Zelenskyy is an illegitimate leader \u2014 have not sat well.",
      "One American fighting for Ukraine's survival posted a video on social media after that explosive meeting at the White House, describing it in no uncertain terms as \"basically Russian propaganda out of the mouth of an American president.\"",
      "\"It's shameful,\" said the man, who identified himself in the video as \"Nasty,\" an American volunteer fighting with a unit of the Ukrainian National Guard in the Kharkiv region. \"I voted for that man two times. I've always been a diehard Trump supporter, to the point of losing friends over standing up for that man and what he says on TV. But last night he crossed a line.\"",

      "After spending seven months on the wait list, Thomas opted to settle for one lung since that would be faster than waiting for two. His surgery was performed on Feb. 28, 2023.",
      "\"The flu and any other illness would be exacerbated because of the underlying scarring of the lung.\"",
      "Now, two years after his lung transplant, Thomas says he no longer needs oxygen supplementation and is back to performing his daily pastoral activities at his church in Queens Village, New York, albeit at a slower pace than before.",
      "The pastor has returned to long-distance driving and can now walk for about 30 minutes. He attributes his successful recovery to the efforts of his Mount Sinai medical team, his faith and prayers from his congregation.",
      "What is post-COVID fibrosis?",
      "A healthy lung allows for the normal exchange of gases, such as oxygen and carbon dioxide, when one breathes air,\u00a0Scheinin told Fox News Digital.",
      "The inflammatory response sparked by early mutations of the novel coronavirus led to scarring of lungs in many individuals.",
      "Testing for this condition is relatively non-invasive, typically including a cat scan or X-ray to check for structural lung damage, as well as blood tests and a pulmonary function test. (iStock)",
      "In certain cases, the doctor said, the lungs no longer function as well as they did before the infection.",
      "\"The normal gas exchange is impeded because now you have areas of the lung tissue that are scarred, and therefore they're not functioning normally,\" he said.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "\"If it's a small area, it may be insignificant and unnoticeable, but as more of the lung tissue becomes scarred, more of the normal lung function is destroyed, [and] the patient becomes short of breath.\"",
      "This could lead to future issues, especially if the patient is exposed to other respiratory ailments.",
      "\"The flu and any other illness would be exacerbated because of the underlying scarring of the lung,\" Scheinin said. \"I think it just makes the lungs more susceptible to injury.\"",
      "Symptoms, diagnosis and treatment",
      "Symptoms of post-COVID pulmonary fibrosis can mimic other types of interstitial lung diseases, which are disorders that\u00a0cause progressive scarring and inflammation of lung tissue.",
      "If a person who previously had a COVID infection continues to experience shortness of breath, chronic cough and change in their exercise tolerance \u2014 or if they smoke or have an underlying condition such as emphysema \u2014 they should see their physician or a pulmonologist, according to Scheinin.",
      "Risk factors for\u00a0post-COVID pulmonary fibrosis typically include an underlying chronic condition, older age, and the use of mechanical ventilation during the acute phase of COVID. (iStock)",

      "Not everyone infected with COVID will develop pulmonary fibrosis, and the condition can vary in severity and recovery, the lung specialist noted.",
      "In some cases, a person may have been susceptible to developing lung fibrosis due to an underlying condition and the COVID-19 infection may accelerate the fibrotic progression.",
      "It is important to get checked out by a medical professional if you have symptoms, a lung specialist said, especially shortness of breath. (iStock)",

      "Roy has been a key figure in government spending talks, acting as a liaison between conservative fiscal hawks and leaders in the House and White House.",
      "He and Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C., both agreed with Vought and Trump that the Impoundment Control Act \u2014 which was passed in response to Congress at the time believing President Richard Nixon was holding back lawful funding because he disagreed with it personally \u2014 was unconstitutional.",

He's the executive. So if that money is then spent properly to carry out the functions of government, why should you have to spend every dollar of it, right? It\u2019s literally unconstitutional,\" Roy said.",
      "Roy said he believed the same authority would apply to a Democratic president.",
      "\"By the way, I realize this means that would be true for Joe Biden or that would be true for some future Democrat, and I'm OK with that. There's always going to be some debate,\" Roy said. \"There's going to be some contours the courts would give us. Congress might step in and clarify the law, and that might be deemed constitutional\u2026 but to blanket to say the president can\u2019t impound, I think is facially unconstitutional.\"",
      "Norman told Fox News Digital, \"The 1974 impoundment act was against Richard Nixon. It\u2019s a different day now.\"",

      "The Impoundment Control Act provided a mechanism for the legislative and executive branches to enact spending cuts via specific rescissions. Such a bill would only require 51 votes in the Senate rather than the standard 60-vote threshold for passage, meaning Democrats in theory would not be needed.",

      "How the malicious polymorphic attack works",
      "Security researchers at\u00a0SquareX Labs have found a new attack that lets malicious Chrome extensions disguise themselves as legitimate ones, like password managers, crypto wallets and banking apps, to steal sensitive information. This \"polymorphic\" attack takes advantage of Chrome\u2019s extension system to trick users while staying under the radar.",
      "The attack starts with hackers uploading what looks like a harmless extension to the Chrome Web Store. It might even have real features, like an AI-powered marketing tool, to convince users to install and pin it to their browser.",
      "Once installed, the malicious extension scans the victim\u2019s browser for other extensions. It can do this in two ways. If it has permission to use the \"chrome.management\" API, it grabs a list of installed extensions directly. If not, it injects code into web pages to check for unique files or resources tied to certain extensions.",
      "If it finds a targeted extension, like 1Password, the malicious extension reports back to an attacker-controlled server. The attacker then tells it to impersonate the real extension by disabling it if permissions allow, changing its name and icon and displaying a fake login popup that looks just like the real thing.",
      "Fake extension page (SquareX)",
      "THE HIDDEN COSTS OF FREE APPS: YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION",
      "Social engineering makes things worse",
      "To steal user credentials, the malicious extension triggers a fake \"Session Expired\" prompt when the victim tries to log in to a website. This tricks them into thinking they need to reenter their credentials for their password manager or banking app. When they do, the stolen data is sent straight to the attackers.",
      "After collecting the credentials, the extension switches back to its original form. It restores the legitimate extension, making everything look normal so the victim doesn\u2019t suspect anything. This shows just how dangerous malicious Chrome extensions can be and why stronger security measures are needed to protect users.",

      "1.\u00a0Keep your browser and extensions up to date: Outdated software is a goldmine for cybercriminals. Bugs or security gaps in old versions of your browser or extensions can be exploited to inject malicious code, steal data or take control of your system. Updates patch these vulnerabilities, making them a critical line of defense. Turn on automatic updates for your browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge) so you\u2019re always running the latest version without thinking about it. See my guide on\u00a0keeping your devices and apps updated for more information.",
      "2. Install extensions only from trusted sources:\u00a0Official browser stores like the Chrome Web Store or Firefox Add-ons have rules and scans to catch bad actors, but they\u2019re not perfect. Extensions from random websites or third-party downloads are far more likely to hide malware or spyware. Stick to the official store for your browser; don\u2019t download extensions from sketchy links.",

Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

This can help you generate and store strong, unique passwords for all your accounts. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "5.\u00a0Invest in personal data removal services: If your personal data gets stolen by the extension, it\u2019s crucial to act quickly to reduce your risk of identity theft and scams. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "1. Have strong antivirus software: Install and regularly update strong antivirus software on all your devices. Antivirus software can help detect and prevent infostealer malware infections. Be sure to perform regular scans to identify and remove potential threats. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware potentially accessing your private information is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Use virtual cards for online payments: Instead of using your actual bank card, generate virtual cards through your bank or a service like Privacy.com. These temporary cards limit exposure in case of a data breach.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "3. Enable transaction alerts and spending limits:\u00a0Set up real-time alerts for transactions and daily spending limits on your cards. This way, you\u2019ll be notified immediately of any unauthorized activity.",
      "4. Never store card details in browsers:\u00a0Infostealers target autofill data in Chrome, Edge and Firefox. Always deny the pop-up that asks to \"save payment info\" and use a secure password manager instead. You may also want to take advantage of additional digital security measures such as\u00a0two-factor authentication. Newer types of authentication, such as Face ID and Touch ID, are slowly replacing passwords as a legitimate means to grant a person access to sensitive financial information.",
      "5. Be smart about passwords: Simply employing all the password rules won\u2019t prevent a breach, but since you don\u2019t know exactly what information thieves are looking for, it can\u2019t hurt. You should use strong passwords and change them frequently. I recommend using a password manager to generate and store strong passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "6. Invest in personal data removal services: While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Infostealers are a major threat to everyone online, and they are also quite common. However, since this malware often disguises itself as legitimate apps or uses social engineering tricks, it\u2019s easy to get fooled. Even the most cautious individuals can fall victim to a well-executed campaign. The best way to stay safe is to exercise caution when browsing online, downloading apps or making online transactions. Using tools like a password manager and antivirus software can also help enhance security and make your life easier.",

    "story": [
      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson joins \"Fox & Friends\" to warn of new cyberscams and give his tips on how to avoid them.",
      "SpyLoan apps are everywhere and\u00a0yet people keep falling for them. They promise easy loans with flexible repayment, but what they actually do is steal your personal data, including contacts, sensitive images and files. The moment you take a loan, they start blackmailing you using your own data against you.",
      "Some of these apps do not even bother giving loans. They just grab your data and start the harassment. One such app has been making the rounds on the Play Store, racking up more than 100,000 downloads and putting thousands of Android users at risk of blackmail and extortion.",

      "A man scrolling on his smartphone (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How SpyLend malware spreads and leads to scams and extortion",
      "SpyLend spread by posing as a credible financial management tool, \"Finance Simplified,\" on the Google Play Store, as reported by\u00a0BleepingComputer. It attracted financially vulnerable individuals by offering fast loans with minimal documentation.",
      "The app surged from 50,000 to 100,000 downloads in a single week despite red flags in user reviews about harassment and blackmail.",
      "Once downloaded, the app requested excessive permissions far beyond what a typical financial app would need, including access to contacts, SMS messages, call logs, photos and location data. This allowed the malware to silently collect personal information from users' devices.",
      "The stolen data fueled a vicious cycle of scams and extortion. SpyLoan apps like SpyLend lure users with attractive loan terms, only to exploit their data for predatory lending practices. If users fail to meet repayment demands, the operators weaponize their information by harassing them, blackmailing them with threats of leaking private photos or contacting their friends and family, and creating a climate of fear and coercion.",
      "In some cases, the extortion escalated to public shaming or even deepfake creation using stolen images, amplifying the psychological and financial toll on victims.",
      "We reached out about this incident, and a Google spokesperson told us, \"The app has been removed from Google Play. Android users are automatically protected against known versions of this malware by\u00a0Google Play Protect, which is on by default on Android devices with Google Play Services. Google Play Protect can warn users or block apps known to exhibit malicious behavior, even when those apps come from sources outside of Play.\"",
      "However, it is important to note that Google Play Protect may not be enough. Historically, it isn't 100% foolproof at removing all emerging malware from Android devices.",

      "SpyLend is a serious threat because it steals a huge amount of personal information. It digs into contact lists and call histories, reads text messages, including banking alerts, and grabs photos and videos from storage.",
      "It also collects device details like the model and OS version, tracks location in real time every three seconds, records past locations and IP addresses, and it even saves the last 20 copied texts from the clipboard. On top of that, it gathers financial data like loan histories and banking SMS messages.",
      "This stolen data is not just used for blackmail, as it is often sold to cybercriminals. By preying on people already struggling financially, SpyLend puts nearly every part of their digital lives at risk.",

      "1) Avoid suspicious loan apps: Stick to apps from well-known banks, credit unions or lenders registered with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau or other regulatory bodies.",
      "2) Install strong antivirus software: Use strong antivirus protection on all your devices to detect and prevent malicious apps. This can also protect against phishing emails and ransomware scams. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious apps is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3) Download apps from reliable sources: It\u2019s important to download apps only from trusted sources like the Google Play Store. You might say I am contradicting myself, but Play Store is still safer than other options out there. They have strict checks to prevent malware and other harmful software. However, even with the security measures provided by Google Play, downloading apps from the store does not guarantee 100% protection against malware or harmful software. Avoid downloading apps from unknown websites or unofficial stores, as they can pose a higher risk to your personal data and device. Never trust download links that you get through SMS.",
      "4) Review app permissions carefully: If an app asks for unnecessary permissions, like access to your contacts, call logs or storage, do not install it. A legitimate loan app should only require essential permissions related to financial transactions.",
      "5) Check reviews and red flags: Before installing any financial app, read user reviews carefully. If multiple people report harassment, blackmail or excessive permissions, avoid the app entirely.",
      "6) Report and uninstall suspicious apps: If you encounter a SpyLoan app, immediately\u00a0uninstall it and revoke its permissions. Report it to the Google Play Store, cybersecurity authorities and financial regulators to help prevent further victims.",
      "If you\u2019ve shared sensitive information, consider changing passwords and securing your accounts. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "THE HIDDEN COSTS OF FREE APPS: YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The promise of quick and easy money can be tempting, especially during tough times, making it easy to fall for these scams. However, there are safer and more reliable ways to take loans. As a general rule, it is best to avoid borrowing money through online apps unless they are from well-known financial institutions. Google also needs to take responsibility for allowing SpyLoan apps on the Play Store, even when user reviews clearly indicate they are malicious.",

If you do buy a new laptop, you'll probably want to transfer all of your data from your old laptop to the new one. Roger from Findlay, Ohio, emailed us asking for help with buying a new laptop and what software he can use to affordably move his data from his old laptop to his new one. Here's what he is asking:",
      "\"I am a retired 75-year-old living on a fixed income. I only use my laptop for emails, banking, and the occasional solitaire game. I currently have a Lenovo Ideapad 110. I need to buy a new laptop. What laptop would be a good replacement for me, keeping in mind the cost and the limited usage I would need? What is the most cost-effective way to transfer my data to the new laptop? I have received prices from $100.00 to $200.00 just for the transfer from old to new. I could use some direction that will help me move forward.\"",

      "Urgency as a weapon: Scammers exploit our fear of financial loss to prompt hasty actions. They use phrases like, in this case, \"Act now\" or \"Cancel Now\" and warn of dire consequences if immediate action isn't taken. This urgency is designed to bypass rational thinking and prevent you from verifying the legitimacy of the request.",
      "Suspicious links: Legitimate banks avoid sending security-sensitive links via text. These links could download viruses to your device or lead you to a fake website designed to steal your personal information. Always verify the URL before entering any sensitive data.",
      "Specific yet unfamiliar details: The mention of \"Bryana White\" and the precise amount of $950.44 is a clever tactic. Scammers often use specific details to create an illusion of legitimacy, even when these details are unfamiliar to the recipient. This approach aims to instill doubt and urgency, increasing the chances that the victim will act hastily.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Brand impersonation: Scammers often employ brand impersonation tactics, using similar logos, fonts and color schemes to create a facade of legitimacy. This deceptive strategy is designed to manipulate you into believing you are interacting with a trusted institution, thereby increasing the likelihood of falling for their scam.",
      "Unsolicited contact: Be wary of unexpected texts claiming to be from your bank, especially if you haven't signed up for text alerts.",
      "Spelling and grammatical errors: Look for mistakes in spelling, grammar or punctuation. Legitimate messages from banks are usually written by professionals and are free of errors.",
      "Requests for personal information: Scammers often ask you to \"confirm\" details like your account number or password. Legitimate banks never request sensitive information via text.",

This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.

      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "3. Contact your bank directly using official channels: Jane should call Kinecta's official number to verify if there's any real issue with her account, rather than responding to the text.",
      "4. Report the text to your bank and forward it to 7726 (SPAM): By reporting this text, Jane can help Kinecta and her mobile carrier protect other customers from similar scams.",
      "5. Enable two-factor authentication\u00a0(2FA) on your accounts: This extra layer of security could prevent scammers from accessing Jane's account even if they obtained her password.",
      "6. Use SMS filtering tools provided by your mobile carrier: These tools might have caught and flagged the suspicious \"Kinect\" text before it reached Jane's inbox.",
      "7. Invest in personal data removal services: This can help reduce the amount of personal information available online, making it harder for scammers to target Jane and you with personalized attacks in the future. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",

      "Cybercriminals are sending fake meeting invitations that seem legitimate.",
      "Cybercriminals are constantly finding new ways to exploit trusted apps and browser extensions.",
      "Since people tend to trust tools that seem legitimate, attackers use them to spread malware or steal sensitive data. A new report reveals that over 3.2 million users have been affected by a security breach involving malicious browser extensions.",
      "These extensions, which appeared genuine, were secretly embedding harmful scripts, stealing data and manipulating search results.",

      "How were the extensions compromised?",
      "GitLab Security has uncovered a major security breach affecting over 3.2 million users through a network of compromised browser extensions, including some linked to GitLab. The attack stemmed from a supply chain breach, where threat actors infiltrated legitimate extensions and pushed malicious updates. These updates embedded hidden scripts that allowed unauthorized data collection, altered HTTP requests and injected ads into web pages, all without users noticing.",
      "Originally built for tasks like ad blocking, emoji input and screen recording, these extensions were repurposed through covert updates that exploited the extensive permissions users had granted, enabling real-time manipulation of web activity.",
      "Typically, malicious extensions or apps are created solely to steal data, with their advertised functionality being an afterthought or simply a way to get listed in an official store. That was not the case here. These were legitimate extensions that became harmful only after attackers injected malicious updates into them.",

      "Which extensions are affected?",
      "Several of the compromised extensions are commonly utilized and may be present in your browser. For instance, ad blockers such as AdBlock are valued for eliminating disruptive advertisements and enhancing browsing privacy. However, in this breach, these tools were manipulated to deliver malicious payloads. The following extensions have been identified as affected:",

      "If any of these extensions are installed on your browser, it is recommended that you assess their permissions and consider their removal until official security updates are verified.",
      "The malicious extensions bypassed Content Security Policy protections, which are designed to prevent cross-site scripting attacks, allowing attackers to modify web content without detection. They also communicated with command-and-control servers to receive further instructions, showing a high level of coordination. The attackers exploited the trust users place in the Chrome Web Store and its automatic update system. Investigations suggest this activity has been ongoing since at least July 2024.",
      "Some of the compromised extensions listed above have generic names that may resemble well-known and legitimate tools, but they are not the same. For example, \"Password Manager\" in our list refers to a malicious extension identified in the breach,\u00a0not to reputable password manager services we mention here.\u00a0Similarly, extensions named \"AdBlock Plus\" or \"VPN Extension\" in this context are not necessarily the widely trusted versions but rather imitations or malicious variants.",
      "To ensure you're using a legitimate extension, follow these steps.",
      "Verify the developer \u2013 Always check the extension's publisher in the Chrome Web Store or Firefox Add-ons. Official brands like Norton, Google or Microsoft will be clearly listed.",
      "Check the reviews and downloads \u2013 Malicious extensions often have lower ratings, generic reviews or a small number of downloads compared to their legitimate counterparts.",
      "Avoid third-party sites \u2013 Only install browser extensions directly from trusted sources like the\u00a0Chrome Web Store,\u00a0Mozilla Add-ons or the official website of the developer.",

      "1.\u00a0Keep your browser and extensions up to date: Outdated software is a goldmine for cybercriminals. Bugs or security gaps in old versions of your browser or extensions can be exploited to inject malicious code, steal data or take control of your system. Updates patch these vulnerabilities, making them a critical line of defense. Turn on automatic updates for your browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge) so you\u2019re always running the latest version without thinking about it. See my guide on\u00a0keeping your devices and apps updated for more information.",
      "2. Install extensions only from trusted sources:\u00a0Official browser stores like the Chrome Web Store or Firefox Add-ons have rules and scans to catch bad actors, but they\u2019re not perfect. Extensions from random websites or third-party downloads are far more likely to hide malware or spyware. Stick to the official store for your browser. Don\u2019t download extensions from sketchy links.",
      "3. Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "4. Be skeptical of extensions requesting unnecessary access: Some extensions overreach on purpose. A calculator tool asking for your browsing history or a weather app wanting your login data is a huge red flag.",
      "Before installing, ask, \"Does this permission match the extension\u2019s job?\" If the answer is no, don\u2019t install it. Watch out for broad permissions like \"Read and change all your data on websites you visit\" unless it\u2019s clearly justified (e.g., a password manager). If an update suddenly adds new permission requests, dig into why. It might mean the extension has been sold or hacked.",
      "5. Update your passwords: Change passwords for any accounts that may have been affected by the incident, and use unique, strong passwords for each account. Consider using a password manager. This can help you generate and store strong, unique passwords for all your accounts. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "6. Remove your personal data from public databases: If your personal data was exposed in this security incident, it\u2019s crucial to act quickly to reduce your risk of identity theft and scams. While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "MASSIVE SECURITY FLAW PUTS MOST POPULAR BROWSERS AT RISK ON MAC",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Browser extensions can improve functionality but also pose significant security risks if not carefully managed. If you have any of the above extensions installed in Chrome, you should remove them immediately. Treat your browser as a key part of your digital security. Regularly check your extensions, remove unnecessary permissions and be cautious about automatic updates, even from trusted sources.",

      "Why should you store your driver's license in Apple Wallet?",
      "Storing your Apple ID in your Apple Wallet may be more secure than carrying a physical card that can be lost easily. Additionally, your digital ID doesn't contain as much visible personal information as a physical ID card. Digital IDs stored in your Apple Wallet do not display personal information other than your full name. To display things such as your address, date of birth and so on, you must sign in with Face ID or Touch ID.",
      "Information is only ever transferred from your Apple Wallet via NFC, which uses an encrypted Bluetooth data connection. This means nothing can be easily or quickly copied. Whenever you have to hand your phone over to a police officer or TSA agent, they won't see your personal information without authentication from you.",
      "Using your digital ID with Apple Wallet from your iPhone or Apple Watch works similarly to Apple Pay. You hold the device near the reader, and a screen will appear telling you exactly which information you will share. Next, you'll double-tap the side button to approve it, as if you were paying with Apple Pay.",

      "WHY YOU SHOULD NEVER CARRY THESE THINGS IN YOUR WALLET",
      "What information is stored in my digital ID?",
      "With digital IDs, only the information needed and nothing more can be transferred easily. For example, a security guard who needs to check your ID at a venue entrance would have a reader that shows your ID photo and confirms if you're over 21. They wouldn't see things like your ID number, address or actual date of birth, simplifying the process for you and the worker and preventing your personal info from being copied.",
      "At the time of publishing, police agencies do not accept digital IDs as driver's licenses, so you'll need to have your physical ID when driving. However, the TSA does accept digital IDs with digital ID readers at\u00a0several airports, and a few concert venues have begun accepting digital IDs. Additionally, apps that require an ID, such as car rental apps or alcohol delivery services, can use the info stored in your Apple Wallet to provide proof of age.",

      "If you are unable to add your driver's license to your Apple ID, it's most likely because your state doesn't yet support the feature. If your state is on the list above, but you can't add your license, it may be because of a temporary Apple server outage.\u00a0Apple recommends that you contact the local DMV or state office that issued your card in the event that the servers are not down.",

      "\"I also doubt that the West will offer de jure recognition to the areas Moscow controls,\" he added. \"So, Putin would have to swallow all of that in a peace deal.\"",
      "Each issue alone is a massive undertaking to negotiate, and\u00a0while Ukraine this week may be outlining concessions it could make to secure a deal coordinated by the U.S., Putin is unlikely to do the same, according to Koffler, who briefed NATO years ahead of the 2022 invasion on Putin\u2019s plans.",
      "RUBIO SAYS MINERAL DEAL \u2018NOT MAIN TOPIC ON AGENDA\u2019 IN UKRAINE MEETING",
      "\"Putin is unlikely to make any concessions as he believes he is in a strong position,\" Koffler told Fox News Digital. \"The disparity in combat potential dramatically favors Russia over Ukraine, which is out-manned and outgunned because Putin transitioned the Russian military and economy on a wartime footing seven years prior to the invasion of Ukraine.\"",

      "\"Putin is highly unlikely to agree to a ceasefire because he doesn\u2019t want to give a strategic pause to Ukraine, the U.S., and NATO to re-arm,\" Koffler said. \"He doesn\u2019t trust Washington. He doesn\u2019t trust President Trump any more than we trust Putin.",
      "\"He trusts Trump even less than Biden because he could read Biden and predict his behavior. He cannot read Trump because Trump is unpredictable.\"",

      "Their nightmare was supposed to be over.",
      "UN WARNS OF 'FRIGHTENING AND DISTURBING' ACTIVITY BY MILITARY, REBELS IN WESTERN BURMA",
      "Last month, a dramatic and highly publicized operation by Thai, Chinese and Myanmar authorities led to the release of more than 7,000 people from locked compounds in Myanmar where they were forced to trick Americans and others out of their life savings. But survivors have found themselves trapped once again, this time in overcrowded facilities with no medical care, limited food and no idea when they\u2019ll be sent home.",
      "One young man from India said about 800 people were being held in the same facility as him, sharing 10 dirty toilets. He said many of the people there were feverish and coughing. Like all former enslaved scammers who talked to The Associated Press, he spoke on condition of anonymity out of concern for his safety.",
      "\"If we die here with health issues, who is responsible for that?\" he asked.",
      "The armed groups who are holding the survivors, as well as Thai officials across the border, say they are awaiting action from the detainees\u2019 home governments.",
      "It\u2019s one of the largest potential rescues of forced laborers in modern history, but advocates say the first major effort to crack down on the cyber scam industry has turned into a growing humanitarian crisis.",
      "The people released are just a small fraction of what could be 300,000 people working in similar scam operations across the region, according to an estimate from the United States Institute of Peace. Human rights groups and analysts add that the networks that run these illegal scams will continue to operate unless much broader action is taken against them.",
      "A high-profile crackdown",
      "The trapped people, some of whom are highly educated and fluent in English, were initially lured to Thailand with promises of lucrative office jobs, only to find themselves locked in buildings where they describe being forced to sit at computers up to 16 hours a day running scams. Refusing to work could bring beatings, starvation and electric shocks.",
      "People from China, Vietnam and Ethiopia, believed to have been trafficked and forced to work in scam centers, sit with their faces masked while in detention after being released from the centers in Myawaddy district in eastern Myanmar, Wednesday, Feb. 26, 2025.\u00a0 (AP Photo/Thanaphon Wuttison)",
      "\"Your passport is confiscated, you cannot go outside and everything is like hell, a living hell,\" a trapped Pakistani man told The Associated Press.",
      "Cyber scams run from compounds have flourished during the pandemic, targeting people around the world. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crimes estimates that between $18 billion and $37 billion was lost in Asia alone in 2023, with minimal government action against the criminal industry\u2019s spread.",
      "Beijing began pushing the region's governments to crack down this year after a young Chinese actor was trafficked to Myanmar by people who promised him an acting job in Thailand. His girlfriend spearheaded a viral social media campaign that led to his release.",
      "Following that rescue, a senior Chinese government official visited Thailand and Myanmar demanding an end to the scams. In response, Thailand cut electricity, internet and gas supplies to five border towns in Myanmar.",
      "Shortly after, the ethnic militia groups that rule this part of Myanmar \u2014 the Kayin Border Guard Force and the Democratic Kayin Buddhist Army \u2014 asked some of the trapped scammers if they wanted to leave, and then escorted them out of their compounds.",
      "From forced labor to detention",
      "As the number of people released grew into the thousands, formerly enslaved scammers found themselves caught in indefinite detention just across a narrow, slow-moving river\u2019s width from freedom.",
      "Most are being held either in army camps controlled by the Kayin Border Guard Force, or repurposed scam compounds, where many have been since early February.",
      "For weeks, men and women have shared unsanitary conditions, sleeping on the floor and eating what their captors provide. At one point, the Border Guard Force said that over 7,000 people were crammed into these facilities, as China began busing citizens across the border for flights.",
      "Exclusive photos obtained by AP underscore the detainees' desperation: Surgical masks, often two per face, cover their eyes, noses and mouths as they huddle under the watchful eyes of armed guards.",
      "\"It felt like a blessing that we came out of that trap, but the actual thing is that every person just wants to go back home,\" said another Indian man, 24, speaking softly on a contraband phone from inside a makeshift detention center. He asked to not publish his name out of concern for his safety and because the militias guarding them had confiscated their phones.",
      "Last week, fights broke out between Chinese citizens waiting to go home and the security forces guarding them, two detainees told the AP.",
      "An unconfirmed list provided by authorities in Myanmar says they\u2019re holding citizens from 29 countries including Philippines, Kenya and the Czech Republic.",
      "Waiting for a $600 plane ticket",
      "Authorities in Thailand say they cannot allow foreigners to cross the border from Myanmar unless they can be sent home immediately, leaving many to wait for help from embassies that has been long in coming.",
      "China sent a chartered flight Thursday to the tiny Mae Sot airport to pick up a group of its citizens, but few other governments have matched that. There are roughly 130 Ethiopians waiting in a Thai military base, stuck for want of a $600 plane ticket. Dozens of Indonesians were bused out one morning last week, pushing suitcases and carrying plastic bags with their meager possessions as they headed to Bangkok for a flight home.",
      "Thai officials held a meeting this week with representatives from foreign embassies, promising to move \"as quickly as possible\" to allow them to rescue their trapped citizens. But they warned that Thailand can only manage to receive 300 people per day, down from 500 previously, Monday through Fridays. It also announced it would let embassy staff cross over into Myanmar.",
      "\"The ministry attaches very high importance to this and is aware that there are sick people, and that they need to be repatriated,\" Nikorndej Balankura, spokesman for Thailand\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Thursday.",
      "The Indian Embassy in Bangkok did not respond to requests for comment. The Czech Foreign Ministry says it cannot confirm a Czech citizen is among those repatriated. It says it is in touch with the embassies in Bangkok and Yangon over the issue and that the embassies have not been asked for assistance.",
      "Amy Miller, the Southeast Asia director of Acts of Mercy International who is based at the Thai-Myanmar border, says it\u2019s hard for the world to understand why all of the released workers aren\u2019t free.",
      "\"You can literally, with your naked eye, stand at the border and see people inside, on their balconies, in these compounds, and yet we cannot reach them,\" she said. Pausing a moment, she gestured out a nearby window toward the Friendship Bridge to Myanmar just blocks away. \"I think what people don\u2019t understand is that to enter into another country is an act of war. You cannot just go in and receive these people out.\"",
      "Assistance is scarce",
      "Aiding the work on the front lines, especially for those countries with fewer resources, are a handful of small nonprofit groups with very limited funds.",
      "In a nondescript Mae Sot home, Miller\u2019s organization receives escapees and a trickle of survivors who have made it across the river with comfortable couches, clean water, food and working phones to reach their families. She said today\u2019s unprecedented numbers are overwhelming the aid available across the river.",
      "\"When we\u2019re looking at numbers in the thousands, the ability to get them over to Thailand and process them and house them and feed them would be impossible for most governments,\" said Miller. \"It really does require a kind of a global response.\"",
      "The recent abrupt halt to U.S. foreign aid funding has made it even harder to get help to released scam center workers.",
      "The United Nations\u2019 International Organization for Migration, for example, previously funded care for victims of trafficking in scam compounds in one shelter in Cambodia, but was forced to halt that work by the Trump Administration\u2019s funding freeze announced in January, according to a source with direct knowledge of the situation. The halt to funding has also impacted a network of civil society groups that worked to stop human trafficking and rescue survivors in Thailand.",
      "\"It\u2019s really heartbreaking to see that there\u2019s such an immense amount of people that are in need of assistance,\" said Saskia Kok, Head of Protection Unit in Thailand for the IOM.",
      "In a statement, U.S. officials acknowledged the high pressure impasse.",
      "\"The United States remains deeply concerned about online scam operations throughout Southeast Asia, which affect thousands of Americans and individuals from many other countries,\" said a State Department spokesperson in a statement sent to the AP.",
      "A bigger problem",
      "While advocates estimate some 50 million people are living in modern slavery, mass rescues of enslaved workers are rare. In 2015, more than 2,000 fishermen were rescued from brutal conditions at sea, liberated after an Associated Press investigation exposed their plight. That same year hundreds of Indians were rescued from brick factories in India. And last year Brazilian prosecutors rescued 163 Chinese nationals working in \"slavery-like\" conditions at an electric vehicle factory construction site in northeastern Brazil.",
      "\"What we are seeing at the Thai-Myanmar border now is the result of years of inaction on a trafficking crisis that has had a devastating impact on thousands of people, many of whom were simply seeking better economic prospect, but were lured to these compounds on false pretenses,\" said Amnesty International Myanmar researcher Joe Freeman.",
      "Being forced to commit a crime under threat of violence should not be criminalized, said Freeman. \"However, in general we are aware of countries in the region repatriating their nationals from scam compounds only to then charge them with crimes.\"",
      "Business as usual",
      "It\u2019s not clear how much of an effect these releases will have on the criminal groups that run the scam centers.",
      "February marked the third time the Thais have cut internet or electricity to towns across the river. Each time, the compounds have managed to work around the cuts. Large compounds have access to diesel-powered generators, as well as access to internet provider Starlink, experts working with law enforcement say.",
      "\"The resources is the one thing that they are not lacking and they\u2019ve been able to bring them to bear in the past,\" said Benedikt Hoffman, acting representative for the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime in the region.",
      "The armed groups that staged the crackdown have also been accused of helping to run scam compounds in Myawaddy. The head of the Kayin Border Guard Force, General Saw Chit Thu, has been sanctioned by the European Union and the United Kingdom for profiting from scam compounds and human trafficking, respectively. Compounds in the DKBA\u2019s control are less well-documented in the public record, but activists say they also control a fair number.",
      "\"There is clearly a lot of pressure on the Border Guard Force to take action and helping people to leave is one of the most visible ways to do so,\" Hoffman said. \"That said, it likely also reflects an adjustment to the business model, reducing the number of people involved \u2014 and with less attention, continuing lower key operations.\"",
      "It will take simultaneous pressure exerted in multiple areas to truly shut down the compounds, said Hoffman.",
      "In this crackdown, there have been no major prosecutions or compounds shut down.",

The bosses, he said, are \"rich as hell\" and can buy anything they need to keep the lucrative operations going. Meanwhile, he said, conditions are worsening.",
      "\"My friends are in really bad condition, we can\u2019t survive here,\" he said, requesting anonymity out of fear for retribution from his guards. He asks a question that's been haunting him day in and day out for weeks: \"Is anyone coming for us?\""

    "story": [
      "A federal judge in California on Thursday ordered that the departments of Veterans Affairs, Defense, Energy, Interior, Agriculture and Treasury\u00a0reinstate thousands of probationary employees who were fired last month.",
      "The departments must \u201coffer reinstatement to any and all probationary employees terminated on or about February 13,\u201d U.S. District Judge William Alsup wrote, referring to the date when the Office of Personnel Management held a call with department and agency heads and directed them to fire probationary employees.",
      "Alsup said the office's directive to fire all probationary employees, in a\u00a0written memo and the February phone call, was not legal.",
      "Follow live politics coverage here",
      "The office had provided departments and agencies with a template to use for firing the employees that said, \"The Agency finds, based on your performance, that you have not demonstrated that your further employment at the Agency would be in the public interest.\"",
      "\u201cIt is sad, a sad day when our government would fire some good employee, and say it was based on performance, when they know good and well, that\u2019s a lie,\u201d Alsup said.",
      "The judge added that there is nothing wrong with reductions in force \u201cif it\u2019s done correctly under the law.\"",
      "The Justice Department did not immediately respond to NBC News' request for comment.",
      "In a statement, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told NBC News: \"A single judge is attempting to unconstitutionally seize the power of hiring and firing from the Executive Branch. The President has the authority to exercise the power of the entire executive branch \u2014 singular district court judges cannot abuse the power of the entire judiciary to thwart the President\u2019s agenda.\"",
      "\"If a federal district court judge would like executive powers, they can try and run for President themselves. The Trump Administration will immediately fight back against this absurd and unconstitutional order,\" she added.",
      "Plaintiffs' attorney Danielle Leonard argued the government knew what it was doing in going after probationary employees for removal, saying: \u201cThis has been the plan since the very beginning. Fire them all because they can\u2019t appeal.\u201d",
      "Alsup expressed outrage at the beginning of the hearing, which had been scheduled to go over evidence, when the administration said the Office of Personnel Management's acting director, Charles Ezell, would not testify as the judge had ordered.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re not helping me get at the truth,\u201d Alsup said, calling the information that the government did provide \u201cpress releases\u201d and a \u201csham.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt upsets me, I want you to know that,\u201d he said.",
      "The judge also ordered that any further terminations of probationary employees must be made by the departments or agencies themselves, within the regulations outlined in the Civil Service Reform Act and the Reduction in Force Act.",
      "Alsup further asked for a list of all fired probationary employees and an explanation of what the departments and agencies were doing to comply with the order.",
      "Everett Kelley, president of the American Federation of Government Employees, one of the plaintiffs in the case, praised the ruling, saying it will \"immediately reinstate tens of thousands of probationary federal employees who were illegally fired from their jobs by an administration hellbent on crippling federal agencies and their work on behalf of the American public.\u201d",
      "Alsup had previously found that he OPM directive was \"illegal\" and should be rescinded \u2014 which it later was \u2014 but had not previously directed the agencies to reinstate the workers.",
      "\u201cThe Office of Personnel Management does not have any authority whatsoever under any statute in the history of the universe, to hire and fire employees within another agency,\u201d he said last month.",
      "An attorney for the Justice Department suggested then that fired employees should have their cases heard by the U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board instead of a federal judge.",
      "Last week, that federal civil service board found that the firing of over 5,000 probationary employees from the Department of Agriculture\u00a0may have been unlawful\u00a0and directed that the employees be restored to their jobs for at least 45 days.",
      "In court Thursday, a lawyer for the plaintiffs told the judge that while those employees had been restored to the agency's payroll, they had not actually been put back to work.",
      "At a hearing in a separate case involving probationary workers in Maryland, a federal judge indicated he might sign an order that would put all of the fired probationary workers back to work.",
      "U.S. District Judge James Bredar made the comments after a hearing at which a coalition of states argued that the mass firings, allegedly for cause, were actually a \"reduction in force\" \u2014 a mass firing that requires the government to follow certain procedures.",
      "The judge seemed sympathetic to that argument, saying: \u201cThis case isn\u2019t about whether or not the government can terminate people. It\u2019s about if they decide to terminate people, how they must do it.\u201d",
      "He said he would issue a written ruling on the case \"promptly.\""

      "Acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris said in three concurrently filed emergency applications in different cases that it was a \u201cmodest\u201d request.",
      "Notably, she is not asking the court to issue a decision on the merits of the plan that would apply nationwide. Instead, the government wants to the court to limit lower court injunctions to individuals or groups that sued over President Donald Trump\u2019s order, and potentially to people who live in the Democratic-led states that challenged it.",
      "She also asked that the court allow agencies to be able to work on how the executive order issued by Trump on his first day in office could be implemented, if it ever does go into effect.",
      "If the request is granted, the administration could move forward with developing its policy and try to implement it in some form.",
      "Most legal experts say the proposal is doomed and unlikely to ever be put into practice because the Constitution\u2019s 14th Amendment is clear that anyone born in the United States is a U.S. citizen.",
      "At least five votes on the nine-justice Supreme Court are needed for an emergency request to be granted.",
      "Follow live politics coverage here",
      "Trump\u2019s lawyers argue that birthright citizenship should be limited to those who have at least one parent who is a U.S. citizen or permanent resident.",
      "The Trump administration filings arise from three cases around the country challenging the proposal. Federal judges in Maryland, Massachusetts and Washington state all ruled that the policy is likely unconstitutional and blocked it. Appeals courts upheld those preliminary findings and refused to put the rulings on hold.",
      "The lower court rulings apply to the entire country, but Harris said in her filings that judges did not have the authority to order such broad relief.",
      "Such broad injunctions \u201ccompromise the executive branch\u2019s ability to carry out its functions,\u201d Harris wrote.",
      "\u201cThis court should declare that enough is enough before district courts\u2019 burgeoning reliance on universal injunctions becomes further entrenched,\u201d she added.",
      "Harris also argued that the states do not have legal standing to sue, saying they cannot assert 14th Amendment claims on behalf of their residents.",
      "The states \"simply cannot assert citizenship rights on behalf of individuals, so the district courts should not have granted any relief to them,\" she wrote.",
      "Presidents of both parties have complained about judges issuing nationwide injunctions in recent years. So have some Supreme Court justices. But the court has yet to meaningfully rein them in."

      "Anne Marie Hochhalter, 43, died of sepsis on Feb. 16 and the two gunshot wounds that left her paralyzed were a \"significant contributing factor\" in her death, Dr. Dawn B. Holmes, a forensic pathologist, wrote in a 13-page report released March 1.",
      "\u201cThe manner of death is best classified as homicide,\u201d Holmes wrote.",
      "With Hochhalter's passing, the death toll now stands at 14. That total does not include the shooters, Dylan Klebold, 17, and Eric Harris, 18, who killed themselves before police could arrest them.",
      "Hochhalter, then a 17-year-old junior, was eating lunch with friends when she was shot in the chest and back, suffering wounds that left her paralyzed from the waist down and in chronic pain for the rest of her life.",

She\u2019d get knocked down \u2014 she struggled a lot with health issues that stemmed from the shooting \u2014 but I\u2019d watch her pull herself back up. She was her best advocate and an advocate for others who weren\u2019t as strong in the disability community.\u201d",
      "In 2016, Hochhalter found it in her heart to reach out with forgiveness to Klebold's mother, Sue Klebold, after she published a memoir about raising a mass killer called \"A Mother's Reckoning.\"",
      "\u201cJust as I wouldn\u2019t want to be judged by the sins of my family members, I hold you in that same regard,\u201d Hochhalter wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s been a rough road for me, with many medical issues because of my spinal cord injury and intense nerve pain, but I choose not to be bitter towards you.\"",
      "The mass killing at Columbine put a previously obscure Denver suburb called Littleton on the nation's radar, and images of heavily armed SWAT teams descending on the school and the sight of students filing out with their hands up were burned into the national consciousness.",
      "\u201cColumbine played out on TV,\u201d Bruce Beck, who was Lauren Townsend's stepfather, told NBC News in 2019 on the 20th anniversary of the massacre. \u201cNo previous school shooting had done that. There was the unknown of where the shooters were during the entire time that it was being filmed, so I think people connected with Columbine more.\u201d",
      "The others killed at Columbine that day were teacher William \"Dave\" Sanders, 47, and students Cassie Bernall, 17, Steve Curnow, 14, Corey DePooter, 17, Kelly Fleming, 16, Matt Kechter, 16, Daniel Mauser, 15, Daniel Rohrbough, 15, Rachel Scott, 17, Isaiah Shoels, 18,  John Tomlin, 16, and Kyle Velasquez, 16.",
      "Sadly, the Columbine massacre also set a tragic template for the school shootings that followed.",
      "The Washington Post, using law enforcement reports, news articles and various databases, has calculated that as of Thursday, more than 394,000 students \u201chave experienced gun violence at school\u201d since Columbine."

      "Notably, she is not asking the court to issue a decision on the merits of the plan that would apply nationwide.

      "Enacted via the\u00a0Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or TCJA, of 2017, there\u2019s currently a\u00a0$10,000 limit\u00a0on the federal deduction on state and local taxes, known as SALT. Residents who itemize tax breaks cannot deduct more than $10,000 in levies paid to state and local governments, including income and property taxes.",
      "That could change amid tax negotiations with lawmakers from high-tax states like California, New Jersey and New York.",
      "Since 2018, the SALT cap has been a\u00a0hot-button issue\u00a0among certain lawmakers from those high-tax states. Before TCJA, the SALT deduction was unlimited, but the so-called\u00a0alternative minimum tax\u00a0reduced the benefit for some higher earners.",
      "The TCJA SALT provision will expire after 2025 without action from Congress.",
      "Although Trump enacted the $10,000 SALT cap in 2017, he\u00a0reversed his position\u00a0last year on the campaign trail, vowing to \u201cget SALT back\u201d if re-elected. He has renewed calls for reform since being sworn into office.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d love to see something happen on SALT,\u201d Trump said in a\u00a0Fox News interview\u00a0on Sunday.",
      "However, it\u2019s unclear how the provision will ultimately change amid competing tax priorities and a\u00a0limited budget.",
      "\u201cThe SALT cap is a major revenue raiser,\u201d said Garrett Watson, director of policy analysis at the Tax Foundation. \u201cThat\u2019s the balancing act.\u201d",
      "Trillions of dollars in tax breaks\u00a0enacted via TCJA are scheduled to expire after 2025, including\u00a0lower tax brackets, a bigger\u00a0child tax credit\u00a0and a\u00a020% deduction\u00a0for pass-through businesses, among others.",
      "Extending individual and estate tax provisions would reduce revenue by $3.9 trillion over the next decade, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.",
      "One SALT reform proposal, which aims to\u00a0raise the SALT cap to $20,000\u00a0for married couples filing jointly, would\u00a0further decrease revenue\u00a0by $170 billion, the organization estimates.",
      "Other plans have called for a higher SALT deduction limit or raising the cap for taxpayers under a certain income threshold.",
      "The budget is 'too small' for tax agenda",
      "With control of both chambers of Congress, Republicans plan to use a process known as \u201creconciliation\u201d to enact Trump\u2019s tax agenda. Currently, the House Republicans\u2019\u00a0budget blueprint\u00a0authorizes $4.5 trillion in tax cuts through 2034, though it could change in Senate negotiations.",
      "That\u2019s an \u201calmost unfathomably large number and somehow too small for the current agenda,\u201d unless lawmakers include offsets to pay for the proposed tax cuts, said Andrew Lautz, associate director for the Bipartisan Policy Center\u2019s economic policy program.",

      "Icon started the project at Wolf Ranch in 2022, using two 40-foot robotic printers. By the second year, the company was using 11 machines, cutting print time in half and squeezing out two homes per week. Each printer does the job of more than a dozen construction workers. The systems operated 24 hours a day.",

      "According to the memo, which outlined a review of Oz\u2019s tax returns from 2021, 2022 and 2023, Oz paid no Medicare or Social Security taxes in 2023 and \u201cnegligible\u201d amounts in 2022. The review from Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee, which is overseeing Oz\u2019s nomination, alleges that Oz underpaid his \u201cSECA\u201d taxes, a tax on net earnings from self-employment, from income through his media entity Oz Property Holdings LLC.",
      "Overall, Democratic committee staff said that Oz underpaid Social Security and Medicare taxes by roughly $440,000.",
      "During a meeting with Oz and his accountant, Democratic committee staff said they asked Oz to amend his tax returns to include income from Oz Property Holdings LLC in his SECA tax calculation, according to the memo. Oz argued that he was not liable for the tax because he was a \u201climited partner\u201d in Oz Property Holdings LLC.",
      "Democratic committee staff asserted that he was \u201cactively involved\u201d in the company, and should pay more in self-employment taxes.",
      "\u201cDr. Oz\u2019s position is counter to the position of the Department of Treasury and results in him not paying into Social Security and Medicare, the very healthcare program he hopes to manage,\u201d Democratic staff wrote in their five-page memo.",
      "Christopher Krepioch, a spokesperson for Oz, told NBC News in a statement in response to the memo: \u201cThe Office of Government Ethics has conducted an extensive review of Dr. Oz\u2019s finances as part of the regular vetting process. OGE has transmitted to the Senate a letter indicating that any potential conflicts have been resolved and he is in compliance with the law.\u201d",
      "NBC News has not independently verified the findings of the memo.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Oz, the television personality and surgeon, is set to appear before the Senate Finance Committee for a confirmation hearing on his nomination on Friday.",
      "The panel\u2019s chairman, Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, said Oz \"followed the law\" in a statement.",
      "\u201cDr. Oz followed the law and provided significant amounts of documentation to substantiate his tax return positions as part of the committee\u2019s rigorous vetting process,\" Crapo said. \"I look forward to holding his hearing tomorrow.\u201d",
      "As CMS administrator, Oz would oversee a sprawling agency responsible for administering Medicare and Medicaid, as well as the Affordable Care Act\u2019s insurance exchanges. CMS provides health care to more than 160 million people.",
      "Senate Democrats had previously raised concerns about Oz\u2019s ability to lead the agency, mainly surrounding his advocacy to put all Americans into Medicare Advantage, which would effectively replace the traditional Medicare program in which the government directly insures Americans 65 and older in tandem with private insurance plans.",
      "\u201cNot only does Dr. Oz want to gut Medicare, but he evidently cheated on his Medicare taxes,\u201d Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., said in a statement. \u201cDr. Oz is once again demonstrating that he cannot be trusted to protect Medicare and Medicaid for millions of people \u2014 and Senate Republicans will be held accountable if they support this health care-cutting, tax-dodging nominee.\u201d",
      "Oz ran an unsuccessful Republican Senate campaign in Pennsylvania in 2022, and does not have any experience at a federal agency."

    "story": [
      "Dollar General\u00a0CEO Todd Vasos said on Thursday that inflation continues to hurt the discounter\u2019s customers and that the macroeconomic environment won\u2019t improve this year.",
      "On the company\u2019s fourth-quarter\u00a0earnings\u00a0call, Vasos said customers are expecting value and convenience \u201cmore than ever\u201d from the dollar-store chain.",
      "\u201cOur customers continue to report that their financial situation has worsened over the last year, as they have been negatively impacted by ongoing inflation. Many of our customers report they only have enough money for basic essentials, with some noting that they have had to sacrifice even on the necessities,\u201d Vasos said. \u201cAs we enter 2025, we are not anticipating improvement in the macro environment, particularly for our core customer.\u201d",
      "Dollar General\u2019s core consumer is \u201calways strained\u201d due to their economic status, but also resourceful, Vasos said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve started to see where [our customer is] getting her sea legs, if you will, on the additional inflation that\u2019s been very sticky out there, and she\u2019s starting to understand her budgets even more,\u201d Vasos said.",
      "Part of the uncertainty, Vasos said, stems from the potential impact of President Donald Trump\u2019s\u00a0tariffs\u00a0on the consumer.",
      "When Trump imposed tariffs during his first term in office in 2018 and 2019, Dollar General had to raise some prices in line with others in the industry, Vasos said. But the general store was able to mitigate the impact back then and is \u201cwell positioned\u201d to do so again this year, he said.",
      "\u201cGiven the already stressed financial condition of our core customer, we are closely monitoring these and any other potential economic headwinds, including any changes to government entitlement programs,\u201d Vasos said.",
      "CFO Kelly Dilts said the company\u2019s 2025 guidance factors in continued economic pressure on the consumer, but does not account for further changes to tariff policy or government initiatives like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which subsidizes food for low-income Americans.",
      "For the fourth-quarter, Dollar General said same-store sales growth of 1.2% was driven entirely by 2.3% growth in average transaction. Customer traffic fell 1.1% during the period, \u201cimpacted by ongoing financial pressures of our core consumer,\u201d\u00a0Vasos said.",
      "Alongside its fourth-quarter earnings, Dollar General said Thursday it would close 96\u00a0Dollar General\u00a0stores and 45 Popshelf stores and will convert six other Popshelf stores into flagship banner locations this year. Popshelf primarily serves\u00a0higher-income shoppers\u00a0with lower-priced products.",

      "Duke Blue Devils forward Cooper Flagg, the presumptive No. 1 overall pick in the upcoming NBA Draft, injured his left ankle during the Blue Devils\u2019 ACC Tournament game on Thursday.",
      "According to the ESPN broadcast, Flagg was ruled out for the remainder of Thursday\u2019s game against the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets. Duke initially listed him as doubtful to return.",
      "Flagg suffered the injury after going up for a rebound with under three minutes to go in the first half. As he came back down, Flagg\u2019s left foot landed on an opposing player. Flagg immediately went down to the ground holding his left ankle.",
      "He was then helped off the court and taken to the locker room for further evaluation. Once off the court, Flagg was transported by wheelchair to have his ankle examined.",

      "\u201cBut I would have to be really convinced that we should even consider seeing if he can go (Friday). He may not be able to go anyway. He probably won\u2019t be able to go anyway. But I think it\u2019s a real longshot, a real longshot.\u201d",
      "Expected by many to be the first overall pick in this summer\u2019s NBA draft if he declares his intent to go professional, Flagg is one of the most highly touted prospects in men\u2019s college basketball. In his freshman season at Duke, Flagg averaged 19.4 points, 7.6 rebounds and 4.2 assists per game before the conference tournament.",
      "After growing up in Maine, Flagg finished his high school basketball career at Montverde Academy in Florida. He was the 2024 Gatorade National Player of the Year and the No. 1 rated recruit in the class of 2024.",
      "Flagg committed to Duke in October of 2023 after also considering the Connecticut Huskies."

    "summary": "Spirit Airlines is out of bankruptcy, hitting its target to emerge in the first quarter, after a crippling few years.",
    "story": [
      "Spirit Airlines is\u00a0out\u00a0of bankruptcy, hitting its target to emerge in the first quarter, after a crippling few years. CEO Ted Christie says the carrier is leaner and ready to take on competitors, including rival\u00a0Southwest Airlines.",
      "Earlier this week, Southwest shocked customers by announcing it will\u00a0start charging for checked bags\u00a0for the first time in its half-century of flying, a huge strategy move for the largest domestic U.S. carrier. (There are some\u00a0exceptions\u00a0to Southwest new bag rules, which take effect in late May.)",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s going to be painful for a little bit as they find their footing, and we\u2019re going to take advantage of that,\u201d Spirit\u2019s Christie said in an interview Thursday.",
      "Southwest had been a standout in the U.S. by offering all customers two free checked bags, a perk that has endured recessions, spikes in fuel prices and other crises while most rivals introduced bag fees and\u00a0raised\u00a0them every few years.",
      "Spirit Airlines, on the other hand, made a la carte pricing common in the U.S., with fees for seat assignments, checked bags and other add-ons. It\u2019s a strategy most large airlines, except for Southwest, have copied in one form or another.",
      "As Southwest starts charging for bags and introduces its first basic economy class, which doesn\u2019t include a seat assignment or allow free changes, Spirit could possibly win over customers, Christie said.",
      "Southwest said it would get rid of its single-class open seating model last year.",
      "\u201cThere at least was an audience of people who were intentionally selecting and flying Southwest because they felt that it was easy. They knew they were going to get two bags,\u201d Christie said. \u201cNow that that\u2019s no longer the case, it\u2019s easy to say that they\u2019re going to widen their aperture and they\u2019re now going to look around.\u201d",
      "Spirit is far smaller than Southwest and even smaller than it was last year, but it competes with the airline in cities like Kansas City, Missouri; Nashville, Columbus, Ohio; and Milwaukee. If customers look on travel sites like\u00a0Expedia, where Southwest is a new entrant, Spirit\u2019s tickets could be cheaper and appear higher in results, Christie said.",
      "Other airline executives have also said they expect to win over some Southwest customers.",
      "Delta Air Lines\u00a0President Glen Hauenstein said at a JPMorgan industry conference Tuesday that there are consumers who choose Southwest based on its free-bag perk \u201cand now those customers are up for grabs.\u201d",
      "Spirit, for its part, has recently been offering more ticket bundles that include things like seat assignments and luggage.",
      "The carrier is now focused on returning to profitability. It posted a net loss of more than $1.2 billion last year, more than double its loss in 2023 as it grappled with grounded jets because of a Pratt & Whitney engine recall, higher costs, more domestic competition and a failed acquisition by\u00a0JetBlue Airways.",
      "Spirit has\u00a0rejected\u00a0multiple recent merger attempts by fellow budget carrier\u00a0Frontier Airlines. Christie said Thursday that nothing is \u201coff the table\u201d and that a fifth-largest airline as a low cost carrier in the U.S. makes sense, but that the airline is focused on stabilizing itself after bankruptcy.",
      "Through its restructuring process, which started in November, Spirit said it reduced its debt by about $795 million. The transaction converted debt into equity for major creditors. The carrier also received a $350 million equity infusion.",
      "Spirit plans to relist its shares on a stock exchange but hasn\u2019t set a date yet.",

    "summary": "Countries that received more deportation flights don't see major changes and predict that the year will end with fewer deportees than previous years.",
    "story": [
      "Four days after President Donald Trump returned to office, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt made an announcement: \u201cDeportation flights have begun. President Trump is sending a strong and clear message to the entire world: If you illegally enter the United States of America, you will face severe consequences.\"",
      "Trump began using U.S. military planes to reinforce his deportation operation, although Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has been deporting immigrants on private airlines since 2010.",
      "But a month and a half after the White House announcement, the pace of deportation flights is a bit slower than those of his predecessor, former President Joe Biden. Also, the number of immigrants expelled through flights has decreased and the government has stopped using military aircraft, which according to immigration experts was more expensive and inefficient.",
      "The findings are based on a Noticias Telemundo analysis of data on deportation flights and interviews with Central American government officials and experts who have analyzed these immigration operations in recent years.Para leer en espa\u00f1ol haga click aqu\u00ed",
      "In Latin American countries such as Guatemala, Honduras and Ecuador \u2014\u00a0which receive the most deportation flights \u2014\u00a0authorities say they have not seen major changes in operations compared to previous U.S. administrations. They even predict that, if the current trend of the Trump administration continues, 2025 would end with fewer flights and fewer deportees.",
      "The decline in flights and deportees is partly due to a drop in border crossings since Trump took office, which has left immigration authorities with fewer people eligible for \u201cexpedited removal,\u201d which is used to expel those caught at the border or in an area within 100 miles of the border, and within 14 days of arrival to the country.For the analysis, Noticias Telemundo developed a database of Trump administration deportation flights based on news reports, official government information, websites that record aeronautical information and data collected by Thomas Cartwright of the group Witness at the Border, which has tracked U.S. deportation flights since 2020.",
      "Data shows that in February, 128 flights with deportees took off, including 19 military flights. That figure is lower than Immigration and Customs Enforcement's 137 deportation flights in February 2024.",
      "The main destinations of February's deportation flights were Honduras and Guatemala, countries that for years have received weekly flights with deportees.",
      "Consulted by Noticias Telemundo, the directors of both nations' migration institutes said that so far the only difference in the operation compared to previous administrations was the use of military aircraft. Otherwise, the pace of deportation flights remains about the same, they said.",
      "\u201cThere is no radical change other than the issue of deportations made by military flights,\u201d said Wilson Paz, director of Honduras\u2019 National Institute of Migration. He agreed with Honduran Foreign Minister Enrique Reyna, who in mid-February told local media they weren't seeing mass deportations from the U.S. Guatemala had a similar assessment. \u201cCompared to the previous year, it's a lower number of returnees (...) on the issue of deportation we cannot talk about radical changes,\u201d Danilo Rivera, director general of the Guatemalan Institute of Migration, said.",
      "On average, Guatemala received 5,140 monthly deportees by air during 2024. In February of last year, the United States expelled 6,972 Guatemalans on 58 flights. This year, during the same month, the Trump administration deported a little over 2,000 Guatemalans on 24 flights, according to Guatemalan government data.",
      "Ecuador received 13 deportation flights from Jan. 20 to Feb. 28. Government officials estimate that, at that rate, they could end the year with fewer than 100 flights, a notable difference compared to the 150 flights the South American country received last year, Ecuadorian Deputy Foreign Minister Alejandro Davalos said in a public discussion on social network X on Feb. 25.",
      "Davalos said about 30,000 undocumented Ecuadorians in the U.S. have deportation orders, but he was skeptical that the Trump administration could expel them soon. \u201cThose deportation orders have not been executed and will not be executed in the immediate future, they were not in the past and they will certainly not be in the coming months. We are not going to have a massive flow of deported Ecuadorians,\u201d the deputy foreign minister said.",
      "On March 9, Ecuadorian President Daniel Noboa said that the country won't receive immigrants deported from the U.S. who are not Ecuadorian, as Panama and Costa Rica have done in recent weeks.",
      "Authorities in Honduras and Guatemala say that the vast majority of the people they're receiving don't have serious criminal records in the U.S. beyond having entered the country without permission or committing traffic violations.",
      "NBC News reported this week that of the people deported by the Trump administration in February, about half had no criminal convictions or pending criminal charges.",
      "\u201cWe cannot continue to criminalize or treat them as criminals when we are observing that almost all of them are working people, they are people who have dignity,\u201d Rivera said.",
      "\u201cMaybe less than 1% have any criminal history,\u201d Wilson Paz said. Despite that, all deported Honduran adults fly handcuffed on planes hired by ICE, the official explained.",
      "The Honduran government has asked the U.S. to release the restrained deportees once the planes enter Honduran airspace, Paz said. \u201c(We request) in a non-negotiable way, respect for human rights, the dignity of Honduran migrants to return to their territory without handcuffs, without shackles, because here they are free,\u201d he said.",
      "The U.S. Department of Homeland Security did not respond to questions about the decrease in deportation flights from February 2024 to February 2025 and whether it plans to increase the number of flights.",
      "The decrease in deportation flights took place as Trump pressured countries such as Panama, Honduras and Costa Rica to accept planes with deportees of other nationalities and the administration used military aircraft to carry out the deportations.",
      "In early March, the Defense Department suspended the use of C-17 jets to transport undocumented people to the U.S. base at Guantanamo Bay and other countries.",
      "In total, the Trump administration conducted 29 military flights to seven countries, mostly Guatemala. But those flights ended up being more expensive and less efficient than the commercial flights usually contracted by ICE to expel migrants.",
      "An hourlong flight of a Boeing C-17 jet, designed to carry cargo and soldiers, costs about $28,500, according to the military's Air Mobility Command. By contrast, the average one-hour flight cost of a regular charter plane hired by ICE is $8,577 and the cost of \u201cspecial high-risk\u201d charter flights is $6,929 to $26,795 per hour, according to ICE.",
      "Military flights to Latin America have also been more expensive because aircraft have taken longer routes, avoiding Mexico\u2019s airspace, which has not allowed military planes carrying deportees to land. Mexico continues to receive ICE charter flights; between January and Feb. 11, they transported almost 2,000 Mexicans from Texas and Arizona, according to data provided by the Mexican government.",
      "The military flights carried out by the Trump administration since Jan. 24 carried an average of 68 passengers per trip, while regular ICE flights on private airline planes carried an average of 105 passengers, according to data analyzed by Noticias Telemundo.",
      "On Jan. 31, the military flight that transported 17 migrants to Honduras and 34 to Peru lasted about 19 hours round trip, according to FlightRadar data. Deporting those 51 people likely cost U.S. taxpayers more than half a million dollars, about $10,000 for each deportee.",
      "The decrease in deportation flights took place despite the fact that Colombia has been sending planes from its Air Force to pick up deported Colombians following a diplomatic crisis between Trump and Colombian President Gustavo Petro, who refused to allow military flights to land in the country. Petro decided to use the Colombian planes after Trump threatened to impose tariffs on all Colombian products imported into the U.S. as well as implement a travel ban and immediately revoke the visas of Colombian government officials.",
      "In total, the Colombian Air Force conducted 10 repatriation flights from late January to February. In addition, Venezuela sent two flights to Texas to repatriate nearly 200 Venezuelans on Feb. 10. despite the fact that President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro had refused to receive flights with deportees from the U.S. the year before.",
      "Venezuela also sent another Conviasa Airline plane to Honduras to pick up 177 Venezuelans expelled from the naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, on Feb. 20.",
      "The Trump administration has released images of immigrants boarding military planes in chains and the administration's border czar, Tom Homan, said in January that Army aircraft with deportees would take off every day.",
      "Experts said they thought the use of military aircraft was publicity strategy to increase the visibility of Trump\u2019s crackdown on illegal immigration and persuade immigrants to desist from crossing into the U.S. illegally.",
      "\u201cIt is neither efficient nor productive (...) but I\u2019m not surprised by the use of military aircraft,\u201d Ariel Ruiz Soto, a senior analyst at the Washington-based Migration Policy Institute, told Noticias Telemundo.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a tactic by President Trump to reduce the incentives to arrive at the border irregularly and also increase a certain sense of fear in the undocumented immigrant community that they could be subject to deportation, even though most of them would not,\u201d Ruiz explained.",
      "Fewer deportations \u2014\u00a0and fewer crossings",
      "The data seems to indicate that the focus on the military flights, along with the deployment of troops to the southern border and the increase in arrests of undocumented immigrants and images of immigrants in chains are working in stopping the flow of people trying to cross into the U.S. without permission. According to the Department of Homeland Security, the government recorded 8,347 arrests of immigrants crossing illegally from Mexico in February, the lowest number in 15 years.",
      "That abrupt drop is reflected in the decrease in deportation flights. Now, with fewer crossings, there are also fewer people to deport immediately, Ruiz said.",
      "\u201cDuring the Biden administration, especially in early 2024, most of the people they deported were those who had just crossed the border with Mexico and the United States,\u201d he explained.",
      "\u201cTo maintain those kinds of high deportations, President Trump has to rely on arrests in the interior of the country,\u201d Ruiz said. But detaining and expelling undocumented immigrants who have been living in the U.S. for years and who are entitled to a process in overcrowded immigration courts, can take years.",
      "In Central America, the kinds of deportees returning via flights points to a decrease in migration to the U.S. Last year, 8 out of 10 deportees Guatemala received were detained at the U.S. border. Currently, a third of Guatemalans coming back had been living in the U.S. for years, Danilo Rivera said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re starting to get a little bit more people who had the experience of living, working and going on with their lives in the United States,\u201d he said.",
      "In 2023, an average of 1,500 migrants a day moved through Honduras on their way to the U.S. \u201cToday, we are not even reaching 100 or 150 people who transit through our country,\u201d said Wilson Paz, the country\u2019s director of migration.",
      "\u201cRather, the migratory dynamic has taken a turn, no longer from south to north, but from north to south, because many of these people are returning to their countries and transiting through Honduras, but in reverse,\u201d the official explained."

She pivoted to traditional publishing by getting an agent and book deal with Gallery Books.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really important to understand what your goals are. In my case, my goal was just to write, and if other people read it, that would have been nicer,\u201d the Italian author tells TODAY.com.",

That is, until she meets Ian at a wedding (not her own) and he makes her question everything about her meticulously planned life. Could Ian be the person that changes everything for Amelie?",
      "\u201cI really wanted to write a story of a character who is stuck in a relationship that she doesn\u2019t like, a job that she\u2019s not passionate about, family dynamics that she\u2019s not happy with, and not knowing how to get out of this rut,\u201d Lorini says.",
      "Enter: Ian. \u201cI figured she needed someone who, instead, was completely unapologetic about all of his many opinions and would always value hers,\" she says.",

She's lost her job, has fallen out of love with Frank and finds herself struggling to maintain the one meaningful friendship she has remaining. At a cooking expo in Ian's hometown, Amelie starts to picture a new life for herself \u2014 but of course, the best laid plans. She learns that Ian comes from a rival family who may threaten to ruin her culinary career. It's a will-they-won't-they romance that will make food lovers swoon.",

And it was like 2014 when my talents was going this way a little bit, and I felt that. I felt the words to that song. And obviously, he's an amazing artist. The melody is beautiful, and so I just connected with it and I listened to it over and over and over again.\"",

      "Right before they moved on to the next topic, Jenna played Wade a short video message that Sheeran had made for him. In the clip, Sheeran told Wade that it was \"lovely\" meeting him at the Met Gala and he invited \"The Cube\" host to one of his shows in the U.S.",

      "But starting with the third book, which was published 14 months after the second, Yarros said they decided together to \"draw it back.\"",
      "\u201cI miss my kids, and I miss my family, and I feel like I wasn\u2019t able to be present because I was just driven by these deadlines,\u201d Yarros said. \u201cAnd so now being able to take a step back and say, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m still going to work and do this, but I need healthy hours. I need to work eight hours a day and not 12 to 15.\u2019\"",

      "\"I think you have to have a sustainable pace,\" Yarros said. \"So, in order to keep putting these books out, I had to slow it down so it's sustainable. Otherwise, it's burnout, and then no one gets books.\"",

      "\"There will always be a time I'm in a real life situation and I look at two people and I think, 'How can I make you miserable and then make you fall in love?'\" she said. \"You know, it's just the way my brain's gonna work. I will probably write until I die.\"",

      "Liz Moore's third novel, \"Long Bright River,\" came out in 2020 and quickly became a phenomenon. Now, the thriller is being adapted for an eight-part Peacock series, with all episodes dropping on March 13.",
      "In the show, Amanda Seyfried plays Mickey, a Philly cop and a single mom struggling to make ends meet on one income. When multiple women die of overdoses in close succession, Mickey realizes that it might not be a coincidence. She's further motivated to find an answer because her sister, Kacey (Ashleigh Cummings), struggles with addiction and has been missing.",
      "Moore's most recent book, \"The God of the Woods,\" came out last summer. Both made it into Barack Obama's annual round-ups of recommended reading. She also co-wrote the adaptation of \"Long Bright River\" along with showrunner Nikki Toscano.",
      "Moore spoke to TODAY.com ahead of the show's release about what fans of the book can expect.",
      "Peacock is owned by NBCUniversal, TODAY's parent company.",
      "There's an element of bringing awareness to what it is to be somebody in active addiction, to be somebody in recovery or to be the family member of somebody who struggles with substance use disorder. What this does is bring a light specifically \u2014 it's a love story between sisters.",
      "I'm very happy it's set in Philadelphia, where I've lived for 16 years, and we were able to do local casting to bring actors from Philly, and non-actors from Philly, on set to play large and small roles.",
      "I think they're fundamentally different shows. I think we offer a look at actual Philadelphia. It's a very urban show. It also examines a pretty marginalized and underserved community. I hope it offers a pretty nuanced vision of the city of Philadelphia and runs counter to the negative media that the city and neighborhood have received in the past.",
      "I've corresponded with a lot of readers since the book was published in 2020, and they\u2019ve shared really, really moving things with me. I\u2019ve heard from people in recovery from addiction. I\u2019ve heard from family members who have lost loved ones to addiction. I\u2019ve heard from family members who have are happily sharing a story of a loved one who who\u2019s in recovery as well. And I think that was really important to us in \"Long Bright River,\" to portray \"Long Bright River\" as something from which it is possible to recover \u2014 and telling a good, propulsive mystery at the same time.",
      "I think it was important to all of us who wrote on the series to tell a really good story and to prioritize good storytelling, rather than writing like to a particular set of themes. Because I think when you're writing to a theme or two themes, sometimes your characters can end up feeling kind of like weighed down by that.",
      "Character first, place first, story first \u2014 everything else is a byproduct of that.",
      "For viewers who have read the book, I think the heart of the book is very much still in the series \u2014 but I think they may possibly also be surprised by certain departures, hopefully in a good way.",
      "We changed one major character (Ed. note: G, Mickey's grandfather in the show) from a woman in the book to a man in the show, partly because we thought it would be fun to incorporate Mummer culture. It\u2019s a very big part of Philly culture. The mummers are groups of musicians and performers and who dress up and form parade units on New Year\u2019s Day.",
      "As far as I know this, it hasn\u2019t really been portrayed much in pop culture.",
      "No, I never do. I never outline. I know a very limited amount of information when I begin a novel, and it's where the novel is set, who the main character characters are and what the initial problem is that they have to solve \u2014 but I don't know the answer to the problem.",
      "So in the case of \"Long Bright River,\" I did not know who was responsible for the deaths of the the victims, I did not know where Mickey's sister had gone and I did not know whether there would be a connection between those two things."

      "President Donald Trump threatened Thursday to impose 200% tariffs on alcohol from the European Union in response to the region's retaliatory 50% tariff on U.S. whiskey, further escalating tensions between two longtime trading partners.",
      "Trump also sharpened his rhetoric toward the E.U., which has for decades been one of the closest U.S. allies.",
      "\"The European Union, one of the most hostile and abusive taxing and tariffing authorities in the World, which was formed for the sole purpose of taking advantage of the United States, has just put a nasty 50% Tariff on Whisky,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"If this Tariff is not removed immediately, the U.S. will shortly place a 200% Tariff on all WINES, CHAMPAGNES, & ALCOHOLIC PRODUCTS COMING OUT OF FRANCE AND OTHER E.U. REPRESENTED COUNTRIES. This will be great for the Wine and Champagne businesses in the U.S.\"",
      "A spokesperson for the European Commission said the region's trade minister has already contacted his American counterparts  and that \u201ccalls are being prepared.\u201d",
      "Later Thursday morning, Trump posted: \"The U.S. doesn\u2019t have Free Trade. We have 'Stupid Trade.' The Entire World is RIPPING US OFF!!!\"",
      "After some early gyrations Thursday morning, the major U.S. stock indexes settled firmly in the red, with the S&P 500 approaching correction territory, almost 10% down from its all-time high in February. The tech-focused Nasdaq index was down 1.4%, now down more than 14% from is February high.",
      "The U.S. remains the world's largest importer of both wine and champagne, with the former comprising $4.9 billion in annual sales and the latter more than $1.7 billion. Meanwhile, U.S. exports of wine rank fifth among all nations at about $1 billion, while its exports of champagne and sparkling wine total just $67 million, 12th in the world.",
      "The impact of the tit-for-tat tariffs could weigh heavily on U.S. consumers, who depend on import of the goods, than manufacturers of them.",
      "In a statement, the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, which represents alcohol makers here, called on the president to come to an agreement with the EU over the impasse, noting that neither region's liquors have been subjected to tariffs for multiple decades.",
      "\"We urge President Trump to secure a spirits agreement with the EU to get us back to zero-for-zero tariffs, which will create U.S. jobs and increase manufacturing and exports for the American hospitality sector.\u00a0We want toasts not tariffs,\u201d said Chris Swonger, Distilled Spirits Council President and CEO.",
      "Trump has made wielding tariff threats against stalwart U.S. partners a core practice of his early second administration. The latest volley shows he has no plans to halt doing so despite protests from economists and businesses groups alike about the repercussions of such policy. On Wednesday, Trump\u2019s largest tariffs regime \u2014 targeting all steel and aluminum imports into the U.S. \u2014 came into effect. In response, the E.U. and Canada announced they would impose retaliatory duties on U.S.-made products.",
      "The president has repeatedly suggested the U.S.'s large trade deficit with the rest of the world is a sign of weakness. Trump has acknowledged that his tariffs strategy may lead to a period of \"transition\" for the U.S. economy, which has shown signs of wobbling in recent weeks, but that it will ultimately emerge stronger.",
      "Thursday morning, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick added additional context to Trump's latest barb and the EU specifically targeting products from states with strong Trump support.",
      "\"The President was totally annoyed that the Europeans did this, and so you\u2019re going to hear back from someone who emotionally cares about America,\" he said on Bloomberg Television.\u00a0\"He cares about America, and he wants to take care of Americans. And why are Europeans picking on Kentucky bourbon secretary, Harley Davidson motorcycle? It\u2019s disrespectful.\"",
      "Lutnick added Trump was looking to \"balance\" trade relations with the E.U.",
      "\"We are your largest, most important trading partner. Treat us with respect, and let\u2019s get a little balance,\" he said.",
      "Ernst B\u00fcscher, spokesperson for the German Wine Institute, said in an interview that a 200% would be a \"catastrophe,\" noting that the United States is the most important export market for German winemakers, accounting for about one sixth of exports.",
      "He added that when a tariff of 25 percent was placed on German wines during the first Trump administration, importers and winemakers shared that cost to shield U.S/ consumers from the price increase \u2014 but that would likely not be possible with a 200-percent tariff.",
      "French Trade Minister Laurent Saint-Martin said in a statement Thursday that Trump was \"escalating the trade war he chose to launch.\"",
      "\"France remains determined to fight back with the European Commission and our partners,\" he said. \"We will not give in to threats and will always protect our industries.\u201d",
      "So far, market reaction to Trump's approach has been broadly negative. Major stock indexes have now erased their post-electoral gains, as investors rebel against the prospect of higher costs. On Thursday, stock futures immediately fell in response to Trump's latest announcement, though pared losses somewhat after a favorable inflation report.",
      "Most academics say that the ability of U.S. consumers and businesses alike to import goods cheaply mostly leads to higher living standards and more efficient output for companies.",

Informed by the attorney that Khalil was in the United States as a permanent resident with a green card, the agent said they were revoking that too, according to the lawyer.",
      "The arrest appears to be among the first known actions under President Donald Trump\u2019s pledge to deport international students who joined the protests against the war in Gaza that swept college campuses last spring. His administration has claimed participants forfeited their rights to remain in the country by supporting Hamas, a terror organization.",
      "When ICE agents arrived at the campus building Saturday, they also threatened to arrest Khalil\u2019s wife, an American citizen who is eight months pregnant, Greer said. The authorities declined to say why Khalil was being arrested, according to the attorney.",
      "They were initially told he was transferred to an immigration detention facility in Elizabeth, New Jersey. But when Khalil\u2019s wife tried to visit Sunday, she learned he was not there \u2014 and may have been transferred as far away as Louisiana, Greer said.",
      "\u201cWe have not been able to get any more details about why he is being detained,\u201d Greer told the AP. \u201cThis is a clear escalation. The administration is following through on its threats.\u201d",

      "DHS can initiate deportation proceedings against green card holders for a broad range alleged criminal activity, including supporting a terror group. It would ultimately be up to an immigration judge to revoke someone\u2019s permanent resident status, according to Camille Mackler, founder of Immigrant ARC, a coalition of legal service providers in New York.",
      "\u201cThis has the appearance of a retaliatory action against someone who expressed an opinion the Trump administration didn\u2019t like,\u201d Mackler said.",
      "Khalil served as a negotiator for students as they bargained with university officials over an end to the tent encampment erected on campus last spring, a role that made him one of the most visible activists in support of the movement.",

      "The university\u2019s allegations against Khalil focused on his involvement in the Columbia University Apartheid Divest group. He faced sanctions for potentially helping to organize an \u201cunauthorized marching event\u201d in which participants glorified Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023, attack and playing a \u201csubstantial role\u201d in the circulation of social media posts criticizing Zionism, among other acts of alleged discrimination.",

      "More than 1,300 people have been killed in 72 hours, according to the organization, including security force members and militants.",
      "It is unclear which groups are involved in the killing of civilians, with reports of different militias converging in the area, and much remains unknown about what is unfolding in Syria. Interim Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa called for peace Sunday, amid reports of executions, firing squads and bodies piled in the streets.",
      "Clashes between Syrian government forces and fighters loyal to the deposed dictator, Bashar al-Assad, have also led to hundreds more deaths on both sides.",
      "The violence has been concentrated in the coastal areas of Tartus and Latakia, the home of the Alawite community, a small Islamic sect to which the Assad family belongs. According to the SOHR, the vast majority of the civilian dead appear to be Alawites, which NBC News has not independently confirmed.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio blamed \u201cradical Islamic terrorists\u201d for the killings and urged Syria\u2019s leadership to hold them accountable.",

The statement also promised to \"identify those responsible.\"",
      "But as the nation grapples with this surge in violence, here\u2019s what we know about what\u2019s happening on the ground and what it could mean for Syria\u2019s future.",
      "What we know",
      "Syria\u2019s rugged Mediterranean shore was a stronghold of the Assad family\u2019s brutal regime, which lasted 53 years before a rebel alliance led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) ousted Assad three months ago in a lightning-fast offensive that swept across the nation and led HTS leader Sharaa to become the new government\u2019s interim president.",
      "However, Syria\u2019s northwest coast remains a fractured battleground, with armed Assad loyalists holding on to villages and remote pockets of territory.",
      "Sharaa\u2019s government has deployed armed forces to the region in a bid to assert control, but fierce clashes erupted last week that have left hundreds dead.",
      "Video posted on social media and verified by NBC News showed dozens of bodies piled on a blood-soaked street in Latakia. Women gathered around the bloodied corpses. One can be heard sobbing, \u201cMy dad, my brother, oh, God.\u201d",

      "The SOHR\u00a0is a prominent information office dedicated to documenting human rights abuses in Syria.",
      "The group said that the vast majority of people killed in the current clashes were from the Alawite sect and that women and children were executed by firing squad in the countryside near Tartus.",
      "NBC News has not independently verified the death toll or methods of execution.",
      "The Associated Press reported that Sunni gunmen, perhaps loyal to the government, initiated revenge killings Friday, with residents saying that Alawites were being killed in the streets or at the gates of their homes and that their houses were looted and set on fire.",
      "SOHR also reported that 125 government security forces and 148 militants from Assad-affiliated armed groups were among the dead.",
      "Federico Jachetti,\u00a0Syria country office director for the Norwegian Refugee Council, said in a statement Sunday that\u00a0the escalation is \u201ca grim reminder that the situation in the country remains fragile\u201d and cited reports of \u201csummary killings, widespread displacement and thousands more left trapped in their homes.\u201d",
      "\u201cSyrian families across the country are yearning for a respite after long years of uncertainty and fear,\u201d he said, calling on all parties to protect civilians.",
      "Who are the Alawites?",
      "The once-ruling minority is a tight-knit Islamic sect to which the Assad family belongs. Under Assad, Alawites were appointed to key positions in the military and security forces, positioning them as the elite within Syria\u2019s state bureaucracy and security apparatus.",
      "The rise of HTS, a former Al Qaeda affiliate with an extremist past, raised deep concerns among the Alawite community as it took power.",
      "Sunni dominance has inflicted deep scars on the region, and minorities like the Alawites, as well as Christians, Druze and Yazidis, all have reasons to fear the rise of extremist governance.",
      "Sharaa had tried to quell such fears, telling CNN in December, \u201cNo one has the right to erase another group.\u201d",
      "But the recent surge in violence suggests a different story, challenging Sharaa\u2019s claim that his interim government would protect all groups and foster stability.",
      "The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker T\u00fcrk, urged\u00a0Syria's leadership to take \u201cswift actions to protect\u00a0Syrians, including by taking all necessary measures to prevent\u00a0any violations and abuses.\u201d",
      "What does this mean for Syria?",
      "Unifying Syria\u2019s diverse ethnic and religious groups has been one of the major challenges of a post-Assad Syria. A significant escalation of violence could threaten the country\u2019s fragile stability and at worst threaten to tip the country back into civil war should the interim government lose control of some areas.",
      "Sharaa has actively sought to rebrand himself as a unifier willing to put down his previous extremist affiliations. For a time, this strategy appeared successful, generating a surge of goodwill and optimism.",
      "In February, a video surfaced showing Sharaa waving from the sunroof of a black vehicle, surrounded by a jubilant crowd during his first visit to Latakia, where he appeared receive a hero\u2019s welcome.",
      "Internationally, the explosion of violence may derail the progress Sharaa has made in reassuring Western leaders that he can ferry in a Syria free of threats."

      "Argentine retirees and fans of several soccer teams clashed with police Wednesday during a protest in front of Congress in the capital, Buenos Aires, against the economic policies implemented by the government of President Javier Milei.",
      "What started as a peaceful demonstration escalated into violent clashes as police deployed water cannons, tear gas, and pellets against stone-throwing protesters.",
      "For weeks, Buenos Aires retirees have held weekly protests demanding higher pensions, citing a precarious standard of living. While previous demonstrations involved minor incidents, including tear gas use against the elderly, Wednesday\u2019s protest was unprecedented in scale.",
      "The government of far-right President Javier Milei, who has championed a policy of public spending cuts since coming to power a year and a half ago, had warned of restrictions on entry to stadiums for those who cause disorder.Police deployed shotguns and water hoses before the scheduled 5:00 p.m. protest (4:00 p.m. EST).",
      "Clashes erupted when a large group of Boca Juniors soccer fans, waving flags and chanting in support of the retirees, arrived. Police formed a cordon to block their advance toward Congress.",
      "At the rear, a group of elderly protesters were pushed back by high-pressure water cannons fired by two tanks at the perimeter closest to the Legislative Assembly."

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Kuwait has released a group of American prisoners, including veterans and military contractors jailed for years on drug-related charges, in a move seen as a gesture of goodwill between two allies, a representative for the detainees told The Associated Press on Wednesday.",
      "The release follows a recent visit to the region by Adam Boehler, the Trump administration\u2019s top hostage envoy, and comes amid a continued U.S. government push to bring home American citizens jailed in foreign countries.",
      "Six of the newly freed prisoners were accompanied on a flight from Kuwait to New York by Jonathan Franks, a private consultant who works on cases involving American hostages and detainees and who had been in the country to help secure their release.",
      "\u201cMy clients and their families are grateful to the Kuwaiti government for this kind humanitarian gesture,\u201d Franks said in a statement.",
      "He said that his clients maintain their innocence and that additional Americans he represents also are expected to be released by Kuwait later.",
      "The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The names of the released prisoners were not immediately made public.",
      "Kuwait did not acknowledge the release on its state-run KUNA news agency and did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The holy Muslim fasting month of Ramadan and its upcoming Eid al-Fitr holiday typically see prisoner releases across Muslim-majority nations.",
      "Kuwait, a small, oil-rich nation that borders Iraq and Saudi Arabia and is near Iran, is considered a major non-NATO ally of the United States. Secretary of State Marco Rubio paid tribute to that relationship as recently as last month, when he said the U.S. \u201cremains steadfast in its support for Kuwait\u2019s sovereignty and the well-being of its people.\u201d",
      "The countries have had a close military partnership since America launched the 1991 Gulf War to expel Iraqi troops after Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein invaded the country, with some 13,500 American troops stationed in Kuwait at Camp Arifjan and Ali al-Salem Air Base.",
      "But Kuwait has also detained many American military contractors on drug charges, in some cases, for years. Their families have alleged that their loved ones faced abuse while imprisoned in a country that bans alcohol and has strict laws regarding drugs.",
      "Others have criticized Kuwaiti police for bringing trumped-up charges and manufacturing evidence used against them \u2014 allegations never acknowledged by the autocratic nation ruled by a hereditary emir.",
      "The State Department warns travelers that drug charges in Kuwait can carry long prison sentences and the death penalty. Defense cooperation agreements between the U.S. and Kuwait likely include provisions that ensure U.S. troops are subject only to American laws, though that likely doesn\u2019t include contractors.",
      "Since President Donald Trump returned to the White House, his Republican administration has secured the release of American schoolteacher Marc Fogel in a prisoner swap with Russia and has announced the release by Belarus of an imprisoned U.S. citizen.",
      "The Americans released Wednesday had not been designated by the U.S. government as wrongfully detained. The status is applied to a subsection of Americans jailed abroad and historically ensures the case is handled by the administration\u2019s special presidential envoy for hostage affairs \u2014 the office that handles negotiations for a release.",
      "But advocates of those held in foreign countries are hopeful the Trump administration takes a more flexible approach and secures the release of those not deemed wrongfully detained.",
      "\u201cThe sad reality is that these Americans were left in prison for years due to a misguided policy that had, before President Trump took office, effectively abandoned Americans abroad who hadn\u2019t been designated wrongfully detained,\u201d Franks said in a statement.",
      "\u201cThese releases,\u201d he added, \u201cdemonstrate what is achievable when the U.S. government prioritizes bringing Americans home.\u201d"

      "In addition to the slain hostages, four soldiers also died, Pakistan's military said in a statement, adding that security forces would assist victims' families and rescued hostages.",
      "The militants, members of the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), had earlier claimed to have killed more than 100 people and threatened to execute more.",
      "The Pakistani military said in the statement that \"after a prolonged, intense and daring operation, the\u00a0security forces successfully eliminated all 33 terrorists\u00a0including suicide bombers, while rescuing the hostages in a phased manner.\"",
      "The Pakistani army said it rescued 178 hostages Wednesday, in addition to the 168 it recovered Tuesday.",
      "More than 400 people, including 214 soldiers and other security personnel, were on the Jaffar Express on Tuesday as it traveled from Quetta, the capital of Pakistan's restive southwestern Balochistan province, to the northern city of Peshawar, officials said.",

      "Armed with rockets, grenades and guns, the assailants began taking passengers hostage, according to security officials, who added that the militants separated law enforcement personnel from the others before they took them into the mountains in small groups.",
      "The rescue operation was conducted extremely cautiously, the officials said, as the hostages were surrounded by militants wearing explosive-laden vests.",

      "The Baloch Liberation Army, an armed ethnic group that has waged a yearslong insurgency against the Pakistani government, claimed responsibility for the attack. The group said it was seeking the release of Baloch political prisoners, activists and others within 48 hours, threatening to execute hostages if the government did not comply.",
      "The BLA had earlier said that none of its fighters had been killed and claimed the hostages had not been freed but that it had \u201creleased all the women, children, sick and Baloch civilians.\u201d",
      "The 11 people killed in the initial attack included the train driver and eight paramilitary troopers, security officials said. Thirty-seven others were injured, including two Pakistan army officers who were airlifted to a military hospital, they said.",
      "Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned what he called the \u201ccowardly attack.\u201d",
      "\u201cTargeting innocent passengers during the peaceful and blessed month of Ramadan clearly reflects that these terrorists have no connection with Islam, Pakistan or Balochistan,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fight against terrorism will continue until this menace is completely eradicated from the country.\u201d",
      "The nine-coach train remained stuck in the tunnel, with the area cordoned off by security forces.",
      "\u201cWe have beefed up security in Bolan in view of the situation,\u201d said Rana Muhammad Dilawar, head of the District Police Office.",
      "Security officials said 80 hostages who were released Tuesday night \u2014 43 men, 26 women and 11 children \u2014 had reached safety at a railway station in the Mach district of Balochistan, Pakistan\u2019s largest, least populated and least developed province.",
      "They said the hostages had to walk for several hours during the night before they boarded a cargo train because militants had damaged the railway track.",
      "The BLA seeks independence for Balochistan, a resource-rich province that borders Afghanistan and Iran, and its ethnic Baloch minority.",
      "\u201cThe main reasons why the conflict continues after decades is because the establishment is antidemocratic, U.S.-supported activities in neighboring Afghanistan have fueled instability, and terrorism in Pakistan is rampant,\u201d said Rizwan Ullah Kobab, chair of the history department at Government College University in Faisalabad, Pakistan.",
      "Militant violence has surged in Balochistan since U.S.-led forces withdrew from Afghanistan in 2021, allowing the Taliban to return to power. Pakistan and Afghanistan have accused each other of supporting antigovernment insurgencies in each other\u2019s countries.",
      "Pakistan's military said intelligence reports \"unequivocally\" confirmed the attack \"was orchestrated and directed by terrorist ring leaders operating from Afghanistan, who were in direct communication with the terrorists throughout the incident.\"",

      "BUDAPEST \u2014 Hungary\u2019s governing party has proposed constitutional changes that could mean a ban on an annual march celebrating the LGBTQ community and the expulsion of citizens with dual citizenship if they are deemed to pose a threat to the country\u2019s sovereignty.",
      "Nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban has repeatedly criticized LGBTQ people and pledged to crack down on foreign funding of independent media and nongovernmental organizations in Hungary in recent weeks, after his ally, U.S. President Donald Trump, paused funding from the U.S. Agency for International Development.",
      "Trump\u2019s steps prompted speculation that Orban would be emboldened and clamp down on media deemed to be unfriendly.",
      "\u201cThe corruption network that rules the entire Western world of politics and media must be eliminated,\u201d Orban told parliament on Feb. 24, adding that his government would \u201cgo to the wall\u201d with the new laws.",

    "summary": "Researchers in Spain have discovered pieces of a fossilized face belonging to an ancient human ancestor. The fragments cannot be conclusively identified as any particular species.",
    "story": [
      "In a cave in northern Spain, researchers have discovered pieces of a fossilized face belonging to an ancient human ancestor \u2014\u00a0the oldest human fossil ever found in Western Europe.",
      "The remains, which the team nicknamed \u201cPink,\u201d are between 1.1 million and 1.4 million years old. But they\u2019re mysterious: The facial fragments do not seem to come from any species found in the same area in the past, nor can they be conclusively identified as any particular species.",
      "\u201cWe are documenting a previously unknown human population in Europe,\u201d said Mar\u00eda Martin\u00f3n-Torres, a co-author of the study and a paleoanthropologist at the Spanish National Research Center for Human Evolution, said in a call with reporters. \u201cThis fossil represents the earliest human fossil found so far in Western Europe.\u201d",
      "The fragment, discovered in 2022, was first reported in the journal Nature on Wednesday with new details.",
      "The researchers tentatively suggested that Pink is likely related to the human ancestor Homo erectus. (The fossil was named, in part, for the band Pink Floyd, and also after Rosa Huguet, the study\u2019s primary author and the coordinator of the archaeological site where it was found.)",
      "The finding is significant because it gives researchers a better timeline of when Western Europe was first settled by human ancestors. It could also help bridge a gap in evolutionary space between the oldest known human ancestor fossils found in Europe \u2014 which are roughly 1.8 million years old and were discovered at a site in the Republic of Georgia called Dmanisi \u2014 and a species called Homo antecessor, which dates back roughly 900,000 years.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not like the Dmanisi fossils, which are older, and it\u2019s not like the younger Homo sapien-like anatomy of Homo antecessor. It\u2019s something in between,\u201d said Rodrigo Lacruz, a professor of molecular pathobiology at New York University, who was not involved in the new discovery but has studied the evolution of the human face.",
      "The discovery may therefore help researchers better understand the story of early human evolution and migration in Europe.",
      "\u201cWe can start piecing together what that population could have looked like, and that\u2019s a great value, because you start seeing how anatomy changes over time,\u201d Lacruz said.",
      "The team that discovered Pink said the fossil is from an adult, but they are not sure whether male or female. Pink was found about 60 feet below the top layer of sedimentary rock, at a cave within the Sierra de Atapuerca archaeological site, which is known for the rich historical record in its rock layers.",
      "Within the same sedimentary level as Pink, researchers found stone tools and animal bones with marks made by cutting, which suggests that these early ancestors butchered animals for meat.",
      "Evidence suggests that human ancestors settled Europe in multiple waves, but that most of those populations subsequently contracted and died out. The fossil record is discontinuous at the Atapuerca site and in Western Europe as a whole, indicating that there were likely long periods without human presence.",
      "The study posits that the species Pink belonged to could have overlapped briefly with Homo antecessor. It\u2019s also possible the species was wiped out during a climactic shift that started about 1.1 million years ago and has only recently been identified by researchers.",
      "Chris Stringer, a professor and research leader on human evolution at the Natural History Museum in London, who was not involved in the discovery of Pink, said the climate event \u201cmay have caused a major and perhaps complete human depopulation of western Europe.\u201d",
      "The cave where Pink was discovered, called Sima del Elefante, or elephant chasm, has produced compelling fossils before. In 2007, researchers found a small piece of jawbone that is believed to be about 1.2 million years old, which appears to be closely related to Pink. Pink was found about 6 feet deeper than that fossil, though, which makes scientists believe it\u2019s older.",
      "Martin\u00f3n-Torres said the researchers were shocked to find a new, important fossil even deeper. Her first reaction to the discovery, she said, was: \u201cAm I really dreaming?\u201d",
      "The region\u2019s impressive collection of fossils likely has to do with its geography.",
      "\u201cAtapuerca was a natural corridor between different mountain systems,\u201d Martin\u00f3n-Torres said, adding that there was ample water. \u201cIt was probably a place that was ideal for hominins to settle. They have the resources; they have the animals passing by.\u201d",
      "Scientists are still digging at the archaeological site.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to keep excavating,\u201d Martin\u00f3n-Torres said. \u201cWe may have more surprises.\u201d"
