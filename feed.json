      "Harper, an imprint of HarperCollins Publishers, announced Tuesday that \u201cWhere We Keep the Light: From a Life of Service,\u201d will be released Jan. 27. Shapiro, 52, has become a prominent national Democrat since he was elected governor in 2022. He was on Kamala Harris' shortlist as a running mate in last year's presidential election and he has often been cited as a potential candidate for 2028.",

      "Universal Pictures says Sunday that \u201cBlack Phone 2\u201d has topped the North American box office with an estimated $26.5 million in ticket sales",
      "The horror sequel \u201cBlack Phone 2\u201d topped the North American box office charts this weekend with $26.5 million in ticket sales, according to studio estimates Sunday. Not only did it surpass the original's $23.6 million debut, it's a much-needed win for Blumhouse after a string of disappointments this year like \u201cM3GAN 2.0.\u201d",
      "Though \u201cBlack Phone 2\u201d opened in line with expectations, moviegoing in October continues to be slow \u2014 down about 11% from last year, according to Comscore. The overall box office is still up about 4% compared with last year, but a big blockbuster hit that could spark more momentum might not arrive until late November or December.",
      "Universal Pictures released \u201cBlack Phone 2\u201d in 3,411 theaters in North America on a wave of good reviews. Coming four years after the original, the sequel sees the return of filmmaker Scott Derrickson, as well as stars Ethan Hawke and Mason Thames. Opening weekend audiences were 63% between the ages of 18 and 34, according to exit polls, and the biggest demographic was Hispanics, making up 39% of ticket buyers while Caucasians accounted for 35%.",
      "With an additional $15.5 million from 71 international territories, \u201cBlack Phone 2\u201d had a $42 million worldwide launch against a reported $30 million production budget.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a fantastic opening,\u201d said Jim Orr, who heads Universal\u2019s domestic distribution. \u201cOur great partners in Scott Derrickson and Blumhouse once again took this property and crafted an unbelievably haunting, chilling story that audiences just simply couldn\u2019t get enough of.\u201d",
      "The first \u201cBlack Phone\u201d was a bit of a sleeper hit for Universal and Blumhouse in 2021 as cinemas were beginning to come back to life after COVID shutdowns. By the end of its run, it had earned more than $161 million worldwide against an $18 million budget.",
      "Blumhouse has had a rocky 2025, with a handful of duds including \u201cWolf Man\u201d and \u201cThe Woman in the Yard.\u201d But the once impenetrable horror hitmaker could be on the upswing again with a \u201cFive Nights at Freddy\u2019s\u201d sequel coming in December. The first movie earned nearly $300 million worldwide.",
      "The horror genre in general has soared to record-breaking heights this year, with hits like \u201cWeapons\u201d and the multi-genre \u201cSinners,\" generating over $1.2 billion for the industry, noted Paul Dergarabedian, Comscore\u2019s head of marketplace trends.",
      "\u201cBlack Phone 2\u201d was also the only film to really break through this weekend, despite a slew of options playing in wide release including the R-rated Seth Rogen, Aziz Ansari and Keanu Reeves comedy \u201cGood Fortune,\u201d which opened in 2,990 locations to $6.2 million, and the expansion of the Julia Roberts and Andrew Garfield drama \u201cAfter the Hunt,\u201d which made $1.6 million from 1,238 theaters. Also new in theaters is Guillermo del Toro\u2019s \u201cFrankenstein,\u201d although Netflix does not report box office grosses.",
      "\u201cTron: Ares\u201d fell about 67% to $11.1 million in its second weekend in theaters, which was enough to snag second place on the charts. Globally it has now earned $103 million.",
      "\u201cGood Fortune,\u201d which opened in third place, had mostly positive reviews on its side, but Ansari's comedy with a side of social commentary did not drum up a lot of enthusiasm in its first weekend. With a B+ CinemaScore, though, it likely has a better chance in the coming weeks than the campus drama \u201cAfter the Hunt,\u201d which got a very poor C- score.",
      "\u201cThis is a quintessential October for movies, meaning this is not a hotbed of box office blockbusters,\u201d said Dergarabedian. \u201cBut the marketplace is flush with titles. This is awards season; this is where you have a lot of auteur driven films, edgier films. Collectively these don\u2019t generate a ton of box office, but there\u2019s the currency of goodwill created with movie fans.\u201d",
      "Next weekend audiences will get another batch of awards-hopefuls, including Yorgos Lanthimos\u2019s latest Emma Stone collaboration \u201cBugonia\u201d and the Bruce Springsteen biopic \u201cSpringsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere,\u201d starring \u201cThe Bear\u2019s\u201d Jeremy Allen White.",

      "The inventive R&B artist Ty Dolla $ign released his fifth studio album on Friday",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 \u201cIt's \u2018Tycoon\u2019 season,'\u201d a beaming Ty Dolla $ign, declares.",
      "It is indeed. The inventive R&B singer has just released his fifth studio album, his first full-length solo release in five years. He chose \u201cTycoon\u201d for its title because the word encompasses his current state of mind. \u201cIt\u2019s like (being at) the top of your game,\" he says. \u201cIt\u2019s like, not only have I done all the stuff you could do in artistry, (but) there\u2019s still more to do.\u201d",
      "Call it confidence or swagger or showboating: The Grammy-nominated artist has a trove of multiplatinum records to his name from 2018 to the present, and recently, his controversial project with Kanye West, $, released two albums, \u201cVultures 1\u201d and \u201cVultures 2\u201d in 2024. They debuted at No. 1 and 2 on the Billboard 200, respectively.",
      "\u201cTycoon\u201d is classic Ty Dolla $ign. The album is what he's made a name for himself doing: a collection of ceaselessly catchy, NSFW R&B anthems about lust and love (both mostly lechery), stacked with A-list collaborations: Quavo,Juicy J, 2 Chainz, Tyga, Travis Scott, Chlo\u00eb \u2014 the list goes on.",
      "Also among them: Rappers Kodak Black and Ty Dolla $ign's longtime kindred spirit YG. (Ty Dolla $ign and YG have worked together for a number of years, certainly going back to 2010's \u201cToot It & Boot It.\") For his latest album, the trio teamed up for \u201cSMILE BODY PRETTY FACE.\u201d It was one of the last songs to make \u201cTycoon,\u201d says Ty Dolla $ign, \u201cBut when we started messing with the beat. I was like, \u2018This has got to be YG.\u2019\u201d",
      "There's a romantic element to the song \u2014 with some of his explicitly sexual posturing. The same can be said about the lead single to \u201cTycoon,\u201d \u201cAll In,\u201d where Ty Dolla $ign's rich baritone considers devotion to a partner. \u201cThey say love don\u2019t cost a thing,\u201d he swoons on the chorus. \u201cAnd if it did, I\u2019d go all in.\u201d",
      "\u201cI'm always loving something,\u201d he says. \u201cIt hasn't all the way worked out for me yet.\u201d Love, then, is still a constant source of inspiration \u2014 enriched by the song's sample of Wayne Wonders\u2019 2002 reggae fusion track \u201cNo Letting Go.\u201d",
      "For Ty Dolla $ign, this new era means being a business \u201cTycoon\u201d as well. He's taken on his fair share of industry endeavors \u2014 like launching a label, EZMNY, with Motown Records executive Shawn Barron \u2014 and experiencing immediate success with its first signing, the R&B upstart Leon Thomas. His single, \u201cMutt,\u201d hit No. 11 on the all-genre Billboard Hot 100 and No. 1 on its Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.",
      "Thomas told AP earlier this year about working with Ty Dolla $ign: \u201cI was around some epic legends in the field, and I feel like the best teacher is experience.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy goal there, with EZMNY, is to give the real artists a chance. Myself, I didn\u2019t make it until I was 27 and I was always good. I was always making music,\u201d Ty Dolla $ign says. \u201cAnd I just wanted to reach back to people that are actually great.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s definitely going to be a comeback in R&B very soon,\u201d he adds. \u201cWe're talking Leon specifically.\u201d",

      "Can one documentary encapsulate the life of Martin Scorsese",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The first time the filmmaker Rebecca Miller met Martin Scorsese was on the set of 2002's \u201cGangs of New York.\u201d Miller\u2019s husband, Daniel Day-Lewis, was starring in it. There, Miller found an anxious Scorsese on the precipice of the film\u2019s enormous fight scene, shot on a sprawling set.",
      "\u201cHe seemed like a young man, hoping that he had chosen the right way to shoot a massive scene,\u201d Miller recalls. \u201cI was stunned by how youthful and alive he was.\u201d",
      "That remains much the same throughout Miller\u2019s expansive and stirring documentary portrait of the endlessly energetic and singularly essential filmmaker. In \u201cMr. Scorsese,\u201d which premieres Friday on Apple TV, Miller captures the life and career of Scorsese, whose films have made one of the greatest sustained arguments for the power of cinema.",
      "\u201cWe talk about 32 films, which is a lot of films. But there are yet more films,\u201d Miller says, referencing Scorsese\u2019s projects to come. \u201cIt\u2019s a life that overspills its own bounds. You think you\u2019ve got it, and then it\u2019s more and more and more.\u201d",
      "Scorsese\u2019s life has long had a mythic arc: The asthmatic kid from Little Italy who grew up watching old movies on television and went on to make some of the defining New York films. That\u2019s a part of \u201cMr. Scorsese,\u201d too, but Miller\u2019s film, culled from 20 hours of interviews with Scorsese over five years, is a more intimate, reflective and often funny conversation about the compulsions that drove him and the abiding questions \u2014 of morality, faith and filmmaking \u2014 that have guided him.",
      "\u201cWho are we? What are we, I should say?\u201d Scorsese says in the opening moments of the series. \u201cAre we intrinsically good or evil?\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is the struggle,\u201d he adds. \u201cI struggle with it all the time.\u201d",
      "Miller began interviewing Scorsese during the pandemic. He was then beginning to make \u201cKillers of the Flower Moon.\u201d Their first meetings were outside. Miller first pitched the idea to Scorsese as a multifaceted portrait. Then, she imagined a two-hour documentary. Later, by necessity, it turned into a five-hour series. It still feels too short.",
      "\u201cI explained I wanted to take a cubist approach, with different shafts of light on him from all different perspectives \u2014 collaborators, family,\u201d Miller says. \u201cWithin a very short amount of time, he sort of began talking as if we were doing it. I was a bit confused, thinking, \u2018Is this a job interview or a planning situation?\u2019\u201d",
      "Scorsese\u2019s own documentaries have often been some of the most insightful windows into him. In one of his earliest films, \u201cItalianamerican\u201d (1974), he interviewed his parents. His surveys of cinema, including 1995\u2019s \u201cA Personal Journey With Martin Scorsese Through American Movies\u201d and 1999\u2019s \u201cMy Voyage to Italy,\u201d have been especially revealing of the inspirations that formed him. Scorsese has never penned a memoir, but these movies come close.",
      "While the bulk of \u201cMr. Scorsese\u201d are the director\u2019s own film-to-film recollections, a wealth of other personalities color in the portrait. That includes collaborators like editor Thelma Schoonmaker, Paul Schrader, Robert De Niro, Leonardo DiCaprio and Day-Lewis. It also includes Scorsese\u2019s children, his ex-wives and his old Little Italy pals. One, Salvatore \u201cSally Gaga\u201d Uricola for the first time is revealed as the model for De Niro\u2019s troublemaking, mailbox-blowing-up Johnny Boy in \u201cMean Streets.\u201d",

      "\u201cCinema consumed him at such an early age and it never left him,\u201d DiCaprio says in the film. \u201cThere will never be anyone like him again,\u201d says Steven Spielberg.",
      "It can be easy to think of Scorsese, perhaps the most revered living filmmaker, as an inevitability, that of course he gets to make the films he wants. But \u201cMr. Scorsese\u201d is a reminder how often that wasn\u2019t the case and how frequently Scorsese found himself on the outside of Hollywood, whether due to box-office disappointment, a clash of style or the perceived danger in controversial subjects (\u201cTaxi Driver,\u201d \u201cThe Last Temptation of Christ\u201d) he was drawn to.",
      "\u201cHe was fighting for every single film,\u201d Miller says. \u201cCutting this whole thing was like riding a bucking bronco. You\u2019re up and you\u2019re down, you\u2019re dead, then alive.\u201d",
      "Film executives today, an especially risk-averse lot, could learn some lessons from \u201cMr. Scorsese\u201d in what a difference they can make for a personal filmmaker. As discussed in the film, in the late \u201970s, producer Irwin Winkler refused to do \u201cRocky II\u201d with United Artists unless they also made \u201cRaging Bull.\u201d",
      "For Miller, whose films include \u201cThe Ballad of Jack and Rose\u201d and \u201cMaggie\u2019s Plan,\u201d being around Scorsese was an education. She found his films began to infect \u201cMr. Scorsese.\u201d The cutting of the documentary took on the style of his film\u2019s editing. \u201cIn proximity to these film,\u201d she says, \u201cyou start to breathe the air.\u201d",
      "Nearness to Scorsese also inevitably means movie recommendations. Lots of them. One that stood out for Miller was \u201cThe Insect Woman,\u201d Japanese filmmaker Sh\u014dhei Imamura\u2019s 1963 drama about three generations of women.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s still doing it,\u201d Miller says. \u201cHe\u2019s still sending me movies.\u201d",
      "\u201cMr. Scorsese\u201d recently debuted at the New York Film Festival, where Miller's son, Ronan Day-Lewis made his directorial debut with \u201cAnemone,\u201d a film that marked her husband's return from retirement. At the \u201cMr. Scorsese\u201d premiere, a packed audience at Lincoln Center's Alice Tully Hall came to enthusiastically revel in, and pay tribute to its subject.",
      "\u201cYou hear all those people laughing with him or suddenly bursting into applause when they see Thelma Schoonmaker or at the end of the \u2018Last Waltz\u2019 sequence,\u201d Miller says. \u201cThere was a sense of such palpable enthusiasm and love. My husband said something I thought was very beautiful: It reminded everyone of how much they love him.\u201d",

      "Richard Linklater and Ethan Hawke have collaborated for over 30 years, but their latest film, \"Blue Moon,\" pushed their partnership to new limits",
      "Richard Linklater likes to joke that if he and Ethan Hawke didn\u2019t know each other so well, Hawke probably would have punched him during the making of \u201cBlue Moon.\u201d",
      "The two Texans have been friends and collaborators for over 30 years. They had made eight films together when they started \u201cBlue Moon,\u201d about the lyricist Lorenz Hart set over one night at Sardi\u2019s restaurant. It\u2019s a project they\u2019d been talking about for over a decade.",
      "One might assume that it would be all old hat between them. And yet this was a film, in select theaters Friday, that would require a vastly different dynamic.",
      "\u201cI was nagging. I was riding his (expletive). It\u2019s not the way I work usually,\u201d Linklater said in a recent interview with The Associated Press. \u201cThe film\u2019s small in scale. It seems minimalistic. But what was incumbent on Ethan was pretty massive.\u201d",
      "That punching thing, Hawke said in a separate interview, was completely true. He came to realize that Linklater was channeling his inner Sidney Lumet \u2014 a great actors\u2019 director, but a tough one.",
      "\u201cIt was shocking to me. He didn\u2019t want us to take the work for granted, or that we were friends,\u201d Hawke said. \u201cHe\u2019s been listening to me talk about acting for 30 years and he wanted to give me a chance to really do it. To stop talking about it and do it.\u201d",
      "Hawke has never shied away from a challenge. When they were making \u201cBefore Sunrise\u201d in Vienna in 1994, Linklater remembered Hawke looking at the script and saying \u201cthis probably won\u2019t work\u201d but diving into it anyway. That\u2019s when he was sure he had found a kindred spirit, someone who ran towards the impossible.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be in that territory if you want to do anything that\u2019s different, something someone hasn\u2019t seen before,\u201d Linklater said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to feel like you\u2019re out on some limb going, \u2018We\u2019re risking a huge whopping failure.\u2019\u201d",
      "But Lorenz Hart was not Jesse the writer in the \u201cBefore\u201d movies. Here was a man who was both small in stature (the most generous reports say he was 5-foot-2-inches), balding, extremely self-conscious about his appearance and the biggest personality and wit in the room. He was a genius and an alcoholic who had made himself unemployable. And amid all of this, the times were changing, and he was being left behind.",
      "Every couple of years over the last decade, they would get together and do a reading of the script. Hawke loved the character and felt deeply that he was the right person to do it, but when it came time to take it out of the theoretical, he said, \u201cit got very scary.\u201d During the first couple of days of rehearsal, Hawke got terribly sick.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like my body knew this was about to be something really stressful,\u201d he said. \u201cThe event of the movie is Lorenz Hart and everybody\u2019s actually supporting this portrait.\u201d",
      "That included himself and his ego. \u201cBlue Moon\u201d would require a deconstruction, and disappearance of the movie star that is Ethan Hawke.",
      "The script from author Robert Kaplow takes audiences inside the famed Broadway theater district restaurant Sardi\u2019s on the opening night of \u201cOklahoma!\u201d in 1943. Hart is holding court with a bartender (Bobby Cannavale) waiting for his old collaborator Richard Rodgers (Andrew Scott) to come to the party.",
      "For over 20 years Rodgers and Hart were a prolific and successful songwriting team, behind musical hits and hundreds of classic songs, including \u201cMy Funny Valentine,\u201d \u201cIsn\u2019t It Romantic?\u201d \u201cThe Lady is a Tramp\u201d and \u201cBlue Moon.\u201d It\u2019s one of the great artistic partnerships of all time. This film is about that breakup.",

Hart, meanwhile, would die eight months after the \u201cOklahoma!\u201d opening, at age 48.",
      "\u201cThe country is changing, and the jazz era is ending and a new era is beginning and one of these people is going to continue on to lead and the other is going to be completely left behind,\u201d Hawke said. \u201cAnd the fact that he\u2019s so funny in the face of tragedy? That\u2019s where the screenplay really shines: The duality of this man. He\u2019s both absurdly jealous and simultaneously very supportive and loving. He\u2019s wickedly funny and suicidal. He\u2019s a homosexual in love with a woman. The correlation of opposites, that is Larry Hart.\u201d",
      "The production used old school Hollywood tricks to make the 5-foot-10-inch Hawke look tiny on a micro budget. He shaved his head to get that balding look. And they built a Sardi\u2019s set in Ireland.",
      "\u201cI always describe it as this little howl into the night of an artist being left behind. It\u2019s to live through your own extinction,\u201d Linklater said. \u201cI hope people respond to it the way you would a beautiful Rodgers and Hart song. It\u2019s lyrical, it\u2019s beautiful in a way, but it leaves you kind of devastated.\u201d",
      "Making a life in the arts requires immense sacrifice no matter how you look at it. And there\u2019s always the possibility that the culture will pass you by. Hawke, for one, said he\u2019s had three distinct moments in his career where he was pretty sure he was washed up.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no way you could do this for over 30 years and not feel it,\u201d Hawke said. \u201cThey come on like waves and you have to try to survive.\u201d",
      "The experience made him think of a lot of the people he came up with, who mentored him when he was starting out in the theater in the 1980s. Many of them, like Hart, were closeted, and they viewed their vocation not as a job but as a kind of spiritual calling. One stage actor he was thinking a lot about was the late Richard Easton, who he did a few plays with before he passed.",
      "\u201cWhen I was young, he said to me, \u2018One lifetime is not enough. It\u2019s not enough time to learn what you need to learn to be the kind of actor that you dream of being,\u2019\u201d Hawke said. \u201cIt\u2019s a great attitude. It creates a perpetual sense of learning and an ongoing process, and this part really did require everything that I\u2019d learned up until now.\u201d",
      "\u201cBlue Moon\u201d is actually one of two Linklater movies about artists that will be in theaters this month. \u201cNovelle Vague\u201d (out Oct. 31), about the making of Jean-Luc Godard\u2019s \u201cBreathless,\u201d is about the beginnings of a career. \u201cBlue Moon\u201d is about the end of one.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a poignancy to art careers,\u201d Linklater said. \u201cI think we all think we\u2019re just going to run the table and do this until the day we die. But things get in the way.\u201d",
      "One thing we don\u2019t have to worry about (yet) is a creative breakup between Linklater and Hawke. Linklater might have given his friend some tough love, but they never argued, and in the end it was worth it. Hawke lived up to the challenge and no one got punched.",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 As the government shutdown enters its fourth week, Senate Republicans are headed to the White House on Tuesday \u2014 not for urgent talks on how to end it, but for a display of unity with President Donald Trump as they refuse to negotiate on any Democratic demands.",
      "Senate Democrats, too, are confident in their strategy to keep voting against a House-passed bill that would reopen the government until Republicans, including Trump, engage them on extending health care subsidies that expire at the end of the year.",
      "With both sides showing no signs of movement, it\u2019s unclear how long the stalemate will last \u2014 even as hundreds of thousands of federal workers will miss another paycheck in the coming days and states are sounding warnings that key federal programs will soon lapse completely. And the meeting at the White House appears unlikely, for now, to lead to a bipartisan resolution as Senate Republicans are dug in and Trump has followed their lead.",
      "\u201cI think the president\u2019s ready to get involved on having the discussion\u201d about extending the subsidies, said Senate Republican leader John Thune, R-S.D., on Monday. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think they are prepared to do that until (Democrats) open up the government.\u201d",
      "While Capitol Hill remains at a standstill, the effects of the shutdown are worsening. Federal workers are set to miss additional paychecks amid total uncertainty about when they might eventually get paid. Government services like the  Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, known as WIC, and Head Start preschool programs that serve needy families are facing potential cutoffs in funding. On Monday, Energy Secretary Chris Wright said the National Nuclear Security Administration is furloughing 1,400 federal workers. The Federal Aviation Administration has reported air controller shortages and flight delays in cities across the United States.",
      "Still, there has been little urgency in Washington as each side believes the other will eventually cave.",
      "\u201cOur position remains the same, we want to end the shutdown as soon as we can and fix the ACA premium crisis that looms over 20 million hardworking Americans,\u201d said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., on Monday, referring to the expanded Affordable Care Act subsidies that expire in December.",
      "Schumer called the White House meeting a \u201cpep rally\u201d and said it was \u201cshameful\u201d that House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has kept the House out of town during the shutdown.",
      "Members of both parties acknowledge that as the shutdown drags on, it is becoming less likely every day that Congress will be able to either extend the subsidies or fund the government through the regular appropriations process. The House GOP bill that Senate Democrats have now rejected 11 times would only keep the government open through Nov. 21.",
      "Thune on Monday hinted that Republicans may propose a longer extension of current funding instead of passing individual spending bills if the shutdown doesn\u2019t end soon. Congress would need to pass an extension beyond Nov. 21, he said, \u201cif not something on a much longer-term basis.\u201d",
      "Democrats are focused on Nov. 1, when next year\u2019s enrollment period for the ACA coverage begins and millions of people will sign up for their coverage without the expanded subsidy help that began during the COVID-19 pandemic. Once those sign-ups begin, they say, it would be much harder to restore the subsidies even if they did have a bipartisan compromise.",

      "More women are defying traditional beauty standards and finding empowerment by going without hair on their heads",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 \u201cBeing bald is sexy. It\u2019s an attitude. It\u2019s a luxury. It\u2019s a lifestyle.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s how Brennan Nevada Johnson, who shaved her head voluntarily 14 years ago, opens the video podcast she launched last November to celebrate the advantages of choosing a bald look.",
      "Sensuous, self-assured and glamorous are not the adjectives typically assigned to women with shorn hair. For centuries, many cultures have viewed long hair as a symbol of femininity, health and fertility. But more women are defying that traditional beauty standard and finding empowerment by baring their heads.",
      "\u201cOnce you do it, it brings all this confidence into your life,\u201d Johnson, 34, said. \u201cWhenever you see someone who\u2019s bald and not wearing a wig, just know that they have fully embraced themselves, and I think that\u2019s something that\u2019s really challenging to do.\"",
      "Her initial decision to go baldheaded was practical. Johnson played competitive volleyball in college and found the sweating she did on the court affected the expensive hair relaxing treatments she often had done. Once she started shaving off her hair, though, she was hooked. She was relieved to save money on salon trips.",
      "Johnson now owns a New York public relations firm. \u201cBald and Buzzed with Brennan,\u201d the video podcast she posts on YouTube, was an attempt to fill a void in social media content that affirmed bald people, especially women. She says she always thought baldness was sexy.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s such a fashion statement, and it\u2019s a really powerful look,\u201d Johnson said.",
      "Other women without hair, whether voluntarily or due to medical conditions, also have sought ways to support each other, attending conferences, joining \u201cbaldie\u201d groups and swapping grooming and scalp care tips.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a whole community of us out there,\u201d said Dash Lopez, a content creator who posts a weekly video series of her shaving routine called \u201cFresh Cut Friday.\u201d \u201cWe need to talk about it because we do find comfort and empowerment and beauty in what some people think is weird.\u201d",
      "Lopez said members of her family praised the long curly hair she had growing up. Some of her friends played with different hair colors and styles, but Lopez said she didn't have the same freedom. And she didn't enjoy detangling her hair or spending long afternoons at the salon.",
      "As soon as she turned 18 and could get a haircut without permission, she chopped her locks into a pixie cut. Then she shaved it all off during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "\u201cIt makes me feel powerful in the sense that I\u2019m able to detach from the things that people place so much emphasis on,\u201d Lopez, 29, said. \u201cI\u2019m not sitting here planning, \u2018Oh my gosh, when am I going to get my next color appointment done? That\u2019s gonna cost me $300. Oh my gosh. I\u2019ve got to get my hair done before I go to this event.\u2019\u201d",
      "Lopez signed a contract with a modeling agency in 2020, a time when brands wanted to showcase diversity, she said. Back then, being bald worked for her professionally.",
      "\u201cThere was an appreciation for quirks and if you had a gap in your tooth, if you had a bald head, if you had a face full of freckles, that\u2019s what casting directors were looking for,\u201d Lopez said.",
      "She noticed the tide shifting last year, when her bookings for modeling jobs decreased. \u201cLet\u2019s be honest, the odds were stacked against me in the modeling world,\" Lopez said. \"I was 5\u2032 4\u2033, 5\u2032 5\u2033 on paper, no hair.\u201d",
      "A client suggested she wear wigs to land more work. Lopez did not want to do that or grow out her hair. Her modeling contract ended. Since then, she has shared glimpses of her life as a bald woman on Instagram and TikTok, where some of her videos have been watched millions of times.",

      "Many women are confronted with how they define beauty when they lose hair due to health conditions such as alopecia or during chemotherapy treatment for cancer.",
      "Felicia Flores, a flight attendant who lives in Atlanta, was diagnosed in 2001 with alopecia, an autoimmune disorder that causes hair to fall out. Six years later, all her hair was gone. Initially, she wore wigs.",
      "Then she came across a group called The Baldie Movement on Facebook. \u201cThe ladies just really inspired me,\u201d Flores, 47, said. \u201cThey really did help to encourage me and give me strength, ... and they were just so confident.\u201d",
      "She eventually decided to stop wearing wigs and embrace being bald in 2015, after a romantic breakup. \u201cI was tired of lying. I felt like I was hiding something. I felt like I wasn\u2019t myself,\u201d she said.",
      "To help uplift and inspire other women, Flores founded an annual conference called Baldie Con. The fourth one drew drew more than 200 attendees to Atlanta last month for a fashion show, guest speakers, a jazz brunch and a black tie gala, she said.",
      "Aicha Soumaoro, who works in Philadelphia as a nurse on weekdays and as a mechanic on weekends, said some of her patients call her \u201csir\u201d instead of \u201cma\u2019am,\u201d but she doesn\u2019t let it bother her. \u201cIt\u2019s new to them, girls that are bald.\u201d",
      "Soumaoro, 27, said that after she shaved her head, her mother told her that most men wouldn't want to marry a woman with no hair. She focuses instead on the compliments she's received while out in public, including \u201cYou wear it with confidence\u201d and \u201cYour face is gorgeous.\u201d",
      "\u201cBeing bald, it\u2019s like a boost of confidence out of nowhere,\u201d said Soumaoro, who cuts her hair every Sunday. \u201cIt\u2019s like a new skin, a new layer, a new personality. I just feel fresh. Like I was born again.\u201d",
      "She also hikes on Sundays, savoring the feeling of cold breezes on her scalp. \u201cHaving that connection with Earth, it feels amazing,\u201d Soumaoro said. \u201cI feel like I can hear everything more clearly. It\u2019s like I have a clear mindset when my head is bald.\u201d",
      "Tiffany Michael Thomas, an Atlanta-based performer who goes by the stage name Amor Lauren, shaved her head in a show of support when her mother was undergoing treatment for pancreatic cancer.",
      "After her mother died, Thomas continued receiving compliments from other women. She decided to keep the bald look.",
      "\u201cOnce I began to really embrace it, it just made me feel like I was unstoppable,\u201d Thomas, 37, said. \"There\u2019s nothing that I have to hide behind anymore. ... It forced me to deal with all of my insecurities.\u201d",
      "If you\u2019re thinking about shaving your head, don\u2019t hesitate, Thomas advises. Women tell her they\u2019re concerned that their head isn\u2019t the right shape, or they have a lump or a scar. \u201cDo it without thought,\u201d she said. \u201cDo it scared. Everything in life, just do it scared. The best way to get through that fear is to actually do it.\u201d",

      "In the wake of massive U.S. cuts to foreign aid, the tiny country of Lesotho in southern Africa faces deep uncertainty and worry over its HIV-positive residents",
      "HA LEJONE, Lesotho -- HA LEJONE, Lesotho (AP) \u2014 In the snow-topped mountains of Lesotho, mothers carrying babies on their backs walk for hours to the nearest health clinic, only to find HIV testing isn\u2019t available. Centers catering to the most vulnerable are shutting their doors. Health workers have been laid off in droves. Desperate patients ration or share pills.",
      "This Lesotho was unimaginable months ago, residents, health workers and experts say. The small landlocked nation in southern Africa long had the world\u2019s second-highest rate of HIV infections. But over years, with nearly $1 billion in aid from the United States, Lesotho patched together a health network efficient enough to slow the spread of the epidemic, one of the deadliest in modern history.",
      "Then, on Jan. 20, the first day of U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s second term, he signed an executive order freezing foreign aid. Within weeks, Trump had slashed overseas assistance and dismantled the U.S. Agency for International Development. Confusion followed in nearly all the 130 countries with USAID-supported programs. Nine months later in Lesotho, there\u2019s still little clarity.",
      "With the single stroke of a distant president\u2019s pen, much of a system credited with saving hundreds of thousands of lives was dismantled.",
      "Weeks ago, the U.S. announced it would reinstate some of its flagship initiatives to combat HIV worldwide. Officials here applauded the move. But the measures are temporary solutions that stress countries must move toward autonomy in public health.",
      "The State Department told The Associated Press in an email that its six-month bridge programs would ensure continuity of lifesaving programs \u2014 including testing and medication, and initiatives addressing mother-to-child transmission \u2014 while officials work with Lesotho on a multiyear agreement on funding.",
      "Those negotiations will likely take months, and while programs may have been reinstated on paper, restarting them on the ground takes considerable time, Lesotho health workers and experts told AP.",
      "HIV-positive residents, families and caregivers say the chaos that reigned most of this year has caused irreparable harm, and they\u2019re consumed with worry and uncertainty about the future. Most feel deep disappointment \u2014 even betrayal \u2014 over the loss of funds and support.",
      "\u201cEveryone who is HIV-positive in Lesotho is a dead man walking,\u201d said Hlaoli Monyamane, a 32-year-old miner who couldn\u2019t get a sufficient medication supply to support him while working in neighboring South Africa.",
      "HIV prevention programs \u2013 targeting mother-to-child transmission, encouraging male circumcision, and working with high-risk groups including sex workers and miners \u2014 were cut off. Unpaid nurses and other workers decided to use informal networks to reach isolated communities. Labs shuttered, and public clinics grew overwhelmed. Patients began abandoning treatment or rationing pills.",
      "Experts with UNAIDS \u2014 the U.N. agency tasked with fighting the virus globally \u2014 warned in July that up to 4 million people worldwide would die if funding weren\u2019t reinstated. And Lesotho health officials said the cuts would lead to increased HIV transmission, more deaths and higher health costs.",
      "Calculating how many lives are lost or affected is a massive task, and those responsible for tracking and adding data to a centralized system were largely let go.",
      "Lesotho Health Secretary Maneo Moliehi Ntene and HIV/AIDS program manager Dr. Tapiwa Tarumbiswa declined repeated requests to be interviewed or comment about the aid cuts. But Mokhothu Makhalanyane, chairperson of Lesotho\u2019s legislative health committee, said the impact is huge, estimating the country was set back at least 15 years in its HIV work.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to lose a lot of lives because of this,\u201d he said.",
      "Lesotho reached a milestone late last year \u2014 UNAIDS\u2019s 95-95-95 goal, with 95% of people living with HIV aware of their status, 95% of those in treatment, and 95% of those with a suppressed viral load. Still, the nation must care for the estimated 260,000 of its 2.3 million residents who are HIV-positive.",
      "Overall, Lesotho and even global HIV efforts accounted for small parts of the United States\u2019 massive international aid efforts. USAID spent tens of billions of dollars annually. Its dismantling has rocked the lives of millions of people in low- and middle-income nations around the world.",
      "For many in this mountainous country and elsewhere, a positive HIV test 20 years ago was akin to a death sentence. If untreated, most people with HIV develop AIDS, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. At the height of the epidemic in 2004, more than 2 million people died of AIDS-related illness worldwide \u2014 19,000 in Lesotho, UNAIDS estimated.",
      "In 2003, the U.S. launched the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. PEPFAR became the largest commitment by any nation to address a single disease, and its main implementing partner was USAID. PEPFAR became so important and well known in Lesotho and other countries that health professionals and residents use the term as shorthand to refer to any HIV aid.",
      "When foreign assistance was frozen, Lesotho lost at least 23% of PEPFAR money, putting it in the top 10 countries for share of such funding cut, according to the Foundation for AIDS Research.",
      "Mapapali Mosoeunyane is among Lesotho residents who credit PEPFAR with helping save them. After learning she had the virus in 2009, she was certain dying was just a matter of time. Neighbors gossiped, she was fired, and she considered giving up her two young sons for adoption.",
      "But around 2013, she got access to antiretroviral medication \u2014 which suppresses HIV levels in the blood, with the potential to bring it to undetectable levels. In 2016, Lesotho was the first African country to \u201ctest and treat all\u201d \u2014 everyone who tested positive was prescribed ARVs. That work, officials say, was possible because of PEPFAR.",

      "When Trump dissolved USAID, Lesotho leaders said they tried to talk to U.S. officials, even through their South African neighbors after failing to connect directly. But, they said, they got more information from news reports.",
      "For Lisebo Lechela, a 53-year-old sex worker turned HIV activist and health worker, the news was fast and blunt. Days after Trump\u2019s order, she was about to distribute medication, but a call from her boss interrupted her.",
      "\u201cStop work immediately,\u201d she was told.",
      "Lechela\u2019s organization, the USAID-funded Phelisanang Bophelong HIV/AIDS network, had drop-in centers at gas stations where sex workers could seek services.

      "Among them is a textile factory worker who turned to sex work at night to support her three children. She used to take PrEP and isn\u2019t sure how she\u2019ll protect herself. Most clients won\u2019t use condoms, she said, some turning violent if sex workers insist.",

She also applauded U.S. efforts to buy doses of a twice-a-year HIV prevention shot and prioritize them for pregnant and breastfeeding women in low- to middle-income countries, including Lesotho, via PEPFAR.",

The South Africa UNAIDS office will oversee Lesotho, she said, but she wasn\u2019t sure where she\u2019d be reassigned.",
      "In its email to AP, the State Department said Secretary Marco Rubio had approved lifesaving PEPFAR programs and urged implementers to resume their work. The email emphasized that officials will work with Lesotho to continue providing health foreign assistance, but didn't give specifics about the amount of funding.",

      "Health committee chair Makhalanyane said this month that it remains unclear how much U.S. aid is being reinstated, even if temporarily.

Like many miners, he chose his health over a job and steady paycheck. He fears diseases such as tuberculosis \u2014 a leading cause of death in Lesotho, attributed to weakened immune systems \u2014 may creep up on him if he interrupts treatment.",

      "The World Food Program, traditionally the U.N.'s most-funded agency, said in a new report that its funding this year \u201chas never been more challenged\u201d \u2014 largely due to slashed outlays from the U.S. under the Trump administration and other leading Western donors.",

      "Sanae Takaichi has become Japan's first female prime minister, a significant milestone in the country's male-dominated political landscape",
      "TOKYO -- TOKYO (AP) \u2014 Sanae Takaichi, a star of ultraconservative Japanese politics and a rare woman to rise in its male-dominated hierarchy, has been elected the country's first female prime minister.",
      "Takaichi, 64, is also the first woman to lead the Liberal Democratic Party that has dominated Japan\u2019s postwar politics almost without interruption.",
      "She admires former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and is a proponent of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's conservative vision for Japan. A China hawk, she is a regular at Yasukuni Shrine, seen by China, the two Koreas and other Asian victims of Japan's World War II aggression as a place that glorifies the country's wartime past.",
      "The leader of a country that ranks poorly internationally for gender equality, Takaichi had rarely mentioned the issue during the campaign. She did remark after winning the presidency of the ruling party: \u201dNow that the LDP has its first female president, its scenery will change a little.\"",
      "First elected to parliament from her hometown of Nara in 1993, she served in key party and government posts, including minister of economic security, internal affairs and gender equality, though her diplomatic experience is thin.",
      "She has called for a stronger military, more fiscal spending for growth, promotion of nuclear fusion, cybersecurity and tougher policies on immigration.",
      "As a student, Takaichi was a drummer in a heavy-metal band and rode a motorcycle.",
      "She says she's a workaholic who would rather work at home than go out and socialize. But after two unsuccessful bids to lead the LDP, she says she's made efforts to build more connections with colleagues.",
      "She asked all party lawmakers to \u201cwork like a horse.\u201d",
      "\u201cI will abandon the word \u2018work-life balance.\u2019 I will work, work, work and work\u201d \u2014 she said in comments that sparked strong, if mixed, online reactions.",
      "Female lawmakers in the LDP have often been passed over for ministerial posts, or been pushed aside if they spoke up about diversity and gender equality. Women hold only about 15% of the seats in Japan\u2019s lower house, the more powerful of the two parliamentary chambers. Only two of Japan\u2019s 47 prefectural governors are women.",

      "She had vowed to significantly increase the number of women in her government, but on Monday she appointed just two as ministers and a third as one of her three special aides. She supports the imperial family\u2019s male-only succession, and opposes both same-sex marriage and amending the 19th-century law that requires married couples to have the same surname.",
      "\u201cMs. Takaichi\u2019s policies are extremely hawkish, and I doubt she would consider policies to recognize diversity,\u201d said Chiyako Sato, a political commentator and senior writer for the Mainichi newspaper.",
      "Takaichi has backed financial support for women's health and fertility treatment as part of the LDP policy of having women serve in their traditional roles of being good mothers and wives. But she also acknowledged her struggles with menopause symptoms and stressed the need to educate men about female health to help women at school and work.",
      "Takaichi is expected to move the government to the right, especially after forming an alliance with the right-wing Japan Innovation Party, or Ishin no Kai. The previous partner, the Buddhist-backed moderate Komeito, left the coalition in protest of Takaichi's ultraconservative views.",
      "She has resisted acknowledging Japanese wartime aggression and atrocities and denied that coercion was used against Korean laborers and women held as sexual slaves for Japanese troops. She was part of a campaign to remove references to wartime sexual slavery from school textbooks.",
      "Her revisionist views may complicate ties with Beijing and Seoul, analysts say. Last week, apparently to avoid tensions, Takaichi sent a religious ornament to mark Yasukuni's autumn festival instead of visiting the shrine in person. She said she plans to maintain stable ties with China and further strengthen security partnership with South Korea.",

      "ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast -- ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) \u2014 Years after she was holed up in a bunker alongside her then-husband and president who had refused to step down following an election loss, Simone Ehivet Gbagbo is seeking to return to the presidential palace in Ivory Coast 's election this week in what analysts say is an unlikely comeback.",
      "Gbagbo, 76, is running for president in Saturday\u2019s election under the banner of the Movement of Skilled Generations party, competing against four other candidates including President Alassane Ouattara, who is seeking a fourth term.",
      "In a country where there has never been a female president, Gbagbo tells The Associated Press she could be a first.",
      "\u201cI think this idea (of a female president) is much less shocking than it was 20 years ago,\u201d she said after a presidential campaign outing in Guib\u00e9roua in southern Ivory Coast, adding that she believes the country is ready for its first female president. \u201cIt\u2019s good for a woman to run, and not just because it\u2019s me. But if it\u2019s me, then so much the better.\u201d",
      "As first lady, Gbagbo was both a powerful and controversial politician, and played an active role in her then-husband\u2019s rule. Nicknamed the \u201ciron lady\u201d due to her influence in power and often tough stance against the opposition and rebels, Gbagbo was Ivory Coast\u2019s first lady during years of conflict under her then-husband Laurent, whose rule witnessed both a civil war and an electoral crisis.",
      "After leading Ivory Coast from 2000 to 2010, including during a civil war between 2002 and 2007, the former president had refused to concede defeat to then-candidate Ouattara in the 2010 election, resulting in a fighting that brought the country to the brink of another civil war with at least 3,000 people dead.",
      "The Gbagbos were eventually arrested in 2011 after French troops and U.N. peacekeepers backed by pro-Ouattara forces stormed a bunker where they had been holed up at the presidential mansion in Abidjan.",
      "Laurent Gbagbo was charged by the International Criminal Court with involvement in the deadly violence of 2010-2011 but was eventually acquitted. The ICC issued an arrest warrant against Simone Gbagbo for \u201ccrimes against humanity\u201d but lifted it in 2021 following her husband\u2019s acquittal. In 2015, Ivorian authorities prosecuted and sentenced her to 20 years in prison on charges including \u201cundermining state security.\" In 2018, she received an amnesty from Ouattara and returned to the political scene shortly after.",
      "The Gbagbos divorced in 2023, ending decades of not just marriage but an unusual political alliance in which both started off as young activists and grew into a powerful pair.",

The electoral authorities earlier disqualified most of Ouattara\u2019s prominent rivals, including the former president and former Credit Suisse chief executive Tidjane Thiam.",
      "Simone Gbagbo is hoping to ride into power relying on her past, having played a key role in Ivorian political history for half a century. As a teacher and trade unionist, she led major revolts for multiparty politics from the 1970s. She was Laurent Gbagbo\u2019s comrade-in-arms before becoming his wife, and, like him, was imprisoned and tortured for her activism campaigns.",

She has been accused of being involved in the darker aspects of her husband\u2019s rule, particularly the extrajudicial abuses committed by \u201cdeath squads\u201d during the 2010-2011 political crisis, which she denies.",
      "Ivory Coast is one of the economic powerhouses of West Africa but suffers from high inequality, with 37.5% of the population living below the poverty line. Simone Gbagbo has promised social welfare programs and also reconciliation, with the wounds from the civil war still fresh.",

Even though her coalition was two seats short of a majority, Takaichi received enough votes to win in the first round. She likely received votes from lawmakers in fringe minority parties from whom she has sought cooperation.",

Toshimitsu Motegi, who previously served as both trade and foreign ministers, was named foreign minister. Former Agriculture Minister Shinjiro Koizumi was named defense minister.

      "The Millennium Seed Bank at the Royal Botanic Gardens Kew holds more than 2.5 billion wild plant seeds from around 40,000 species. The seeds are stored in sealed glass jars and foil packets, and are preserved in temperatures of minus 20 degrees Celsius ( minus 4 Fahrenheit) to guard against extinction.",

In the episode, they discuss the origins of the seed bank and its future potential to restore ecosystems across the world.",

      "\u201cDrying is the first step in increasing the longevity of those seeds,\u201d said Elinor Breman, senior research leader in seed conservation at Kew.",
      "In the drying room, air is kept at 15 degrees Celsius (59 Fahrenheit) and 15% humidity for about three months, allowing the seeds to lose moisture slowly and evenly. Removing water extends their lifespan by slowing the natural processes that cause decay.",
      "Once dried, the seeds move to the cleaning room. There, technicians use sieves, brushes and a device called an aspirator that separates seeds from dust and debris with air pressure. The work is mostly manual and time consuming, said David Hickmott, Seed Curator at Kew, who oversees the process.",
      "In the germination laboratory, petri dishes and incubators recreate the light and temperature of each seed\u2019s native environment. The tests confirm whether the seeds are still alive before storage.",
      "\u201cThe germination test is our last and most important process,\u201d said Rachael Davies, a germination specialist at Kew. \u201cIt gives us an indication that the seeds are alive.\u201d",

      "Dale Sanders, biologist and former director of the John Innes Centre in Norwich, said seed banks play a crucial role in protecting biodiversity. The need for genetic resources like those stored at Kew will grow as the world is expected to have 2 billion more people by 2050 and new agricultural land runs out.",
      "\u201cWithin species there is incredible genetic diversity, which protects against disease, climate change and other threats,\u201d he said. \u201cMaintaining that diversity is essential if we want to preserve the diversity of life itself.\u201d",

      "SHOSTKA, Ukraine -- SHOSTKA, Ukraine (AP) \u2014 As the lights went out in her hometown, 40-year-old Zinaida Kot could not help but think about her next dialysis treatment for kidney disease. Without electricity, the machine that keeps her alive stops working.",
      "Kot is among millions of Ukrainians who are bracing for another winter of power cuts and possibly blackouts as Russia renewed its campaign of attacks on the country\u2019s energy grid. Analysts and officials say that this year Moscow has shifted tactics, targeting specific regions and gas infrastructure.",
      "In some regions \u2014 mostly those closer to the front line in the east \u2014 the season of buzzing generators has started, as well as long hours of darkness with no power or water. People are once again pulling out small power stations, charging numerous power banks, and storing bottles of water in their bathrooms.",
      "The attacks have grown more effective as Russia launches hundreds of drones, some equipped with cameras that improve targeting, overwhelming air defenses \u2014 especially in regions where protection is weaker.",
      "The consequences are already reshaping daily life \u2014 especially for those whose survival depends on electricity. For Zinaida Kot, who has been on dialysis for seven years, this is far worse than mere discomfort.",
      "\u201cIt is bad. We really worry when there is no electricity,\u201d she said from her hospital bed, connected to a dialysis machine powered by a generator that staff call \u201cnot reliable enough.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf there\u2019s no treatment, I would die. I would not exist.\u201d",
      "In early October, a Russian strike left the small northern town of Shostka \u2014 with a prewar population of nearly 72,000 \u2014 without electricity, water, or gas. The town lies just 50 kilometers (31 miles) from the front line in northern Sumy region. Gas service was later restored, and electricity returned for only a few hours each day.",
      "\u201cThe situation is challenging,\u201d said Mykola Noha, the mayor of Shostka. Electricity and water are now supplied on a schedule, available for a few hours each day. \u201cAnd it really worries the residents as we can\u2019t predict power cuts. We fix something and it gets destroyed again. This is our situation.\u201d",
      "Shostka hums with the low growl of generators on rain-dark asphalt, blanketed in yellow leaves. They power cafes, shops, residential buildings, and hospitals. Across town, so-called \u201cinvincibility points\u201d offer residents a place to charge devices, warm up, and even rest on cots provided.",
      "The hardest days, locals say, were when there was no gas \u2014 no heat or way to cook \u2014 and people made meals over open fires in the streets.",
      "At the local hospital, where all stoves are electric, staff built a simple wood-burning oven during the early days of Russia\u2019s invasion, in 2022, when the town came close to occupation. And now it helps to feed at least 180 patients, said Svitlana Zakotei, 57, a nurse who oversees the patients\u2019 meals.",
      "The hospital has spent three weeks running on generators \u2014 a costly lifeline that burns half a ton of fuel a day, about 250,000 hryvnias ($5,973) a week, said the hospital's chief, Oleh Shtohryn. That\u2019s nearly as much as its usual monthly electricity bill.",
      "Power is rationed. In the dialysis ward, lights stay dim so electricity can feed the machines that keep patients alive. One of the eight units burned out because of the blackout \u2014 a costly loss the hospital could not afford to replace soon. Still, 23 patients come daily for hourslong treatment.",
      "The crisis in Shostka reflects Russia\u2019s shifting strategy. In 2022\u20132023, Moscow launched waves of missiles and drones across the country to destabilize Ukraine\u2019s national grid. This year, it is striking region by region.",
      "The recent pattern shows heavier attacks on the Chernihiv, Sumy, and Poltava regions, while Kharkiv, Odesa, Mykolaiv, and Dnipro face less frequent but still regular strikes.",
      "On Tuesday, Chernihiv and part of the region were left without electricity after Russia attacked the local energy grid the night before, local officials said.",

      "Share prices have soared in Japan recently on hopes that conservative lawmaker Sanae Takaichi, who was chosen Tuesday to be Japan\u2019s first female prime minister, will double down on market friendly policies",
      "TOKYO -- TOKYO (AP) \u2014 Share prices have soared recently in Tokyo on hopes that conservative Japanese lawmaker Sanae Takaichi, who was chosen Tuesday to be Japan\u2019s first female prime minister, will double down on market friendly policies, including hefty spending on defense and cheap credit.",
      "The benchmark Nikkei 225 share index climbed close to the symbolically important 50,000 level, gaining 0.7% to 49,517.57. Takaichi, a motorbike and heavy metal enthusiast, prevailed in a lower house parliamentary ballot that gave her 237 votes, above the 233 votes required to win.",
      "Here\u2019s what might be expected from what has been dubbed \u201cSanaenomics:\u201d",
      "Increases in consumer prices have surpassed the Bank of Japan\u2019s 2% target range at 2.5% to 3%. So the central bank is gradually raising rates from their longstanding level near or below zero. Wages remain near the level they were at 30 years ago, only topping the 1997 average level in 2024 for the first time. Meanwhile, low rates have helped to keep the Japanese yen weak against the dollar, amplifying inflation since much of what Japan consumes is imported.",
      "\u201cI want to focus first on dealing with rising consumer prices,\u201d Takaichi told reporters after she was elected head of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party earlier this month, putting her in line to replace departing Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba.",
      "Takaichi has indicated she opposes raising interest rates. The promise of continued cheap credit is one reason share prices have shot higher. But keeping rates low will hinder efforts to curb inflation and to strengthen the Japanese yen.",
      "Echoing many of her predecessors\u2019 promises, Takaichi also has vowed to deliver wage increases, without saying how she intends to do that.",
      "Japan\u2019s population has been shrinking and rapidly aging for years, leading to labor shortages and undermining the country\u2019s potential economic growth.",
      "Although she is an unabashed conservative on most social issues, Takaichi has said she favors giving tax incentives to companies that provide child care facilities to their employees and possible tax breaks for family spending on child care.",
      "It\u2019s unclear what more the government might do under any leader to counter the low birth rate, which partly reflects the financial difficulties of raising and educating children when wages fail to keep up with inflation. It also reflects a corporate culture that is not conducive to a family-friendly work-life balance.",
      "Takaichi is expected to emulate the policies of her late mentor, former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. He stepped down in 2020 and was assassinated in 2022. His \u201cAbenomics\u201d approach included promises of cash handouts and boosting government spending, despite a national debt that is nearly triple the size of the economy.",

      "Takaichi is bound to seek cordial relations with U.S. President Donald Trump, just as Abe did, and to strengthen Japan\u2019s security alliance with Washington. They are expected to meet later this month.",
      "Initially Takaichi said Japan might want to rethink its pledge of $550 billion to the Trump administration, part of a deal that helped lower U.S. tariffs on imports from Japan. She later said she would honor the agreement, despite public disapproval over handing over Japanese taxpayers\u2019 money to Washington.",
      "Takaichi will be confronting problems that have confounded Japan\u2019s leadership for decades. Any major reforms would face resistance from entrenched vested interests. The tenures of Japanese prime ministers tend to be short and vulnerable to feuding between party factions and the hereditary political fiefdoms that control most seats in parliament.",
      "To win Tuesday\u2019s parliamentary vote, the Liberal Democrats forged an alliance with the Japan Innovation Party, a libertarian opposition group based in Osaka.",
      "But Takaichi likely will need support from lawmakers belonging to other parties in the fractious and splintered opposition to pass legislation. They span the spectrum from the Japan Communist Party on the far left to the Sanseito and others on the extreme right.",

      "Hong Kong authorities were in contact with barge companies for the cleanup but they could not begin removal work while Tropical Storm Fengshen was still affecting the city, he said. Depending on weather, wreckage removal and other work could be completed within a week, Yiu said.",

      "President Donald Trump is preparing for a significant trip to Asia, aiming to address international trade tensions",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump is expected to leave for Asia at the end of the week, betting that an around-the-world journey will help him untangle big issues that he can\u2019t afford to get wrong.",
      "At stake is nothing less than the future of the global economy, which could hinge on whether he\u2019s able to calm trade tensions during an expected meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. A misstep could send shock waves through American industries that have already been rattled by Trump\u2019s aggressive tariffs, government layoffs and political brinkmanship.",
      "Trump\u2019s strategy of improvisation has had both hits and misses since he returned to office in January. Hamas returned hostages to Israel but the ceasefire in the Middle East remains fragile; a trade war with China has ebbed and flowed this year; and Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine hasn\u2019t slowed down despite Trump\u2019s efforts to resolve the conflict.",
      "There's been some mystery around Trump's trip, with no official announcements from the White House about much of his itinerary. The president said Monday that he plans to go to Malaysia, which is hosting a regional summit, then Japan, where he's trying to nail down foreign investment.",
      "He'll also visit South Korea, where he's working on more trade issues and expects to sit down with Xi. Beijing has yet to confirm that they\u2019ll meet, and the two leaders have recently exchanged threats of tariffs and export restrictions.",
      "\"I have a very good relationship with President Xi of China,\u201d Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday. He offered to lower tariffs but \u201cthey have to give us some things too,\u201d including buying U.S. soybeans, reducing the flow of fentanyl ingredients and ending limits on rare earth minerals that are critical for high-tech manufacturing.",
      "Trump expressed even more confidence on Monday, saying, \u201cI think we\u2019re going to end up having a fantastic deal with China\" and \"it\u2019s going to be fantastic for the entire world.\u201d",
      "With just days to go before Trump leaves, there\u2019s an unusual level of ambiguity even for a president who loves to keep people guessing about his next move.",
      "\u201cThe whole trip has seemed so uncertain from the beginning,\u201d said Bonnie Glaser, a managing director at the German Marshall Fund, a Washington-based think tank.",
      "It's Trump's first trip to Asia since returning to office. Although he\u2019s hosted leaders from the region at the White House, he hasn\u2019t forged the kind of foundational relationships that he has on other continents.",
      "Anna Kelly, a spokesperson for the president, responded to a list of questions about Trump\u2019s plans by saying he \u201cwill participate in meetings and events in Asia that will result in many great deals for our country.\u201d She added, \u201cStay tuned!\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s approach to Asia has focused on using tariffs to realign what he describes as unfair trade practices, unnerving countries that depend on the United States as the world\u2019s largest market for exports. There\u2019s also anxiety about Trump\u2019s meeting with Xi, and the potential that a feud between the two leaders could send the international economy into a tailspin.",
      "\u201cThere will be some appreciation for the fact that he\u2019s there, but I don\u2019t think it will go far enough to quell the doubts that are pervasive in the region,\u201d Glaser predicted.",
      "The Republican president has downsized his foreign policy team since his first term, eschewing the typical array of advisers at the National Security Council in favor of a core group of loyalists.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s not very many White House staff to do this kind of work,\u201d said Rush Doshi, who worked on China policy under President Joe Biden. \u201cAll of this puts us in uncharted waters.\u201d",
      "Michael Green, who worked on President George W. Bush's National Security Council and now leads the United States Studies Centre in Sydney, Australia, said there's been no clear Asia strategy from Trump.",
      "\u201cEveryone is waiting to see where he\u2019s going to come down on all of this,\" he said.",
      "Others say Trump's approach is paying off. Anthony Kim, a research fellow in international economic affairs at the Heritage Foundation, said Japan and South Korea are eager to work with the administration to solidify partnerships.",
      "The message from them has been \u201clet\u2019s sit down, talk about relevant details to make a deal,\u201d Kim said.",

      "Doshi, the former Biden adviser, said there are three potential outcomes from Trump's meeting with Xi \u2014 \u201cdeal, no deal or disaster.\u201d He said China is emboldened after Trump backed down on an earlier tariff announcement when Beijing restricted the export of rare earth magnets.",

      "Trump said Monday that China has \u201ctreated us with great respect\u201d since he's been in office. He said \u201cI could threaten them with many other things,\u201d but \u201cI want to be good to China.\u201d",
      "Another open question will be Trump's trade negotiations with South Korea, which is facing U.S. tariffs that could undermine its auto industry. However, Seoul has balked at Trump's demand for a $350 billion investment fund similar to the one in Japan.",

      "President Donald Trump and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese have signed a critical-minerals deal at the White House",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese signed a critical-minerals deal at the White House on Monday as the U.S. eyes the continent\u2019s rich rare-earth resources at a time when China is imposing tougher rules on exporting its own critical minerals abroad.",
      "The two leaders described the agreement as an $8.5 billion deal between the allies. Trump said it had been negotiated over several months.",
      "\u201cIn about a year from now we\u2019ll have so much critical mineral and rare earth that you won\u2019t know what to do with them,\" said Trump, a Republican, boasting about the deal. \"They\u2019ll be worth $2.\u201d",
      "Albanese added that the agreement takes the U.S.-Australia relationship \u201cto the next level.\u201d",
      "Earlier this month, Beijing announced that it will require foreign companies to get approval from the Chinese government to export magnets containing even trace amounts of rare-earth materials that originated from China or were produced with Chinese technology. The Trump administration says this gives China broad power over the global economy by controlling the tech supply chain.",
      "\u201cAustralia is really, really going to be helpful in the effort to take the global economy and make it less risky, less exposed to the kind of rare earth extortion that we\u2019re seeing from the Chinese,\u201d Kevin Hassett, the director of the White House\u2019s National Economic Council, told reporters Monday morning ahead of Trump\u2019s meeting with Albanese.",
      "Hassett noted that Australia has one of the best mining economies in the world, while praising its refiners and its abundance of rare earth resources. Among the Australian officials accompanying Albanese are ministers overseeing resources and industry and science, and Australia has dozens of critical minerals sought by the U.S. because they are needed in everything from fighter jets and electric vehicles to laptops and phones.",
      "The agreement could have an immediate impact on rare earth supplies in the United States if American companies can secure some of what Australian mines are already producing, although it will take years \u2014 if not decades \u2014 to develop enough of a supply of rare earths outside of China to reduce its dominance.",
      "Pini Althaus, who founded USA Rare Earth back in 2019 and is now working to develop new mines in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan as CEO of Cove Capital, said it will be crucial that the contracts to buy materials from Australian mines include price floors, similar to what the U.S. government promised MP Materials this summer, to protect against China manipulating prices.",
      "For decades, China has used the tactic of dumping excess critical minerals onto the market to drive prices down to force mining companies in the rest of the world out of business to eliminate any competition.",
      "\"I think taking away that arrow in the quiver of China to manipulate pricing is an absolute crucial first step in Australia and the West being able to develop critical minerals projects to meet our supply chain demands,\u201d said Althaus, who has spent nearly a quarter-century in the mining business.",
      "The agreement underscores how the U.S. is using its global allies to counter China, especially as it weaponizes its traditional dominance in rare earth materials. Top Trump officials have used the tactics from Beijing as a rallying cry for the U.S. and its allies to work together to try to minimize China's influence.",
      "\u201cChina is a command-and-control economy, and we and our allies will neither be commanded nor controlled,\u201d Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week. \u201cThey are a state economy and we are not going to let a group of bureaucrats in Beijing try to manage the global supply chains.\u201d",
      "The level of investment outlined in the agreement shows how serious the two nations are about addressing the problem.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. and Australia will invest over $3 billion in joint critical minerals projects within six months. That\u2019s a somewhat unprecedented speed of capital injection,\u201d said Gracelin Baskaran, director of the Critical Minerals Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.",
      "But Althaus cautioned that Australia can\u2019t supply everything the United States needs, so it is crucial that American continues to invest in the long-term effort to develop other mining and processing projects both at home and in friendly nations. He said central Asia might be one of the most promising places to invest because the region has significant rare earth reserves, and the Soviet Union already did some of the initial development work when it controlled that territory. That could cut years off the time it will take to build a new mine there.",

      "TOKYO -- TOKYO (AP) \u2014 Sanae Takaichi is on track to become Japan's first female prime minister, after her governing party secured a crucial coalition partner.",
      "Takaichi, 64, is set to replace Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba in Tuesday\u2019s parliamentary vote. If she's successful, it would end Japan's three-month political vacuum and wrangling since the coalition's loss in the July parliamentary election.",
      "The moderate centrist Komeito party had split from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party after a 26-year-long coalition. It came just days after Takaichi\u2019s election as LDP leader, and forced her into a desperate search for a new coalition partner to secure votes so that she can become prime minister.",
      "The Buddhist-backed Komeito left after raising concerns about Takaichi's ultraconservative politics and the LDP\u2019s lax response to corruption scandals that led to the party's consecutive election defeats and loss of majority in both houses.",
      "While the leaders of the country's top three opposition parties failed to unite to seek a change of government, Takaichi went for a quick fix by teaming up with the most conservative of them: the Osaka-based Ishin no Kai, or Japan Innovation Party. The two parties on Monday signed a coalition agreement that includes joint policy goals on diplomacy, security and energy.",
      "The fragile new coalition, still a minority in the legislature, would need cooperation from other opposition groups to pass any legislation.",
      "Big diplomatic tests await the government within days \u2014 talks with U.S. President Donald Trump and regional summits. At home, Takaichi needs to quickly tackle rising prices and come up with economic stimulus measures to appease the frustrated public.",
      "An admirer of former U.K. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, Takaichi's breaking of the glass ceiling makes history in a country whose gender equality ranks poorly internationally.",
      "But many women aren't celebrating, and some see her impending premiership as a setback.",
      "\u201cThe prospect of a first female prime minister doesn\u2019t make me happy,\u201d sociologist Chizuko Ueno posted on X. Ueno said that Takaichi\u2019s leadership would elevate Japan\u2019s gender equality ranking, but \u201cthat doesn\u2019t mean Japanese politics becomes kinder to women.\u201d",
      "Takaichi, an ultraconservative star of her male-dominated party, is among those who have stonewalled measures for women\u2019s advancement. Takaichi supports the imperial family\u2019s male-only succession, opposes same-sex marriage and a revision to the civil law allowing separate last names for married couples, so women don\u2019t get pressured into abandoning theirs.",
      "\u201cMs. Takaichi\u2019s policies are extremely hawkish and I doubt she would consider policies to recognize diversity,\u201d said Chiyako Sato, a political commentator and senior writer for the Mainichi newspaper.",
      "If she's successful in the parliamentary vote, Takaichi would immediately launch her Cabinet on Tuesday and make a policy speech later in the week.",

      "The shrine honors Japan\u2019s 2.5 million war dead, including convicted war criminals. Victims of Japanese aggression, especially China and the Koreas, see visits to the shrine as a lack of remorse about Japan\u2019s wartime past.",
      "Takaichi supports a stronger military, currently undergoing a five-year buildup with the annual defense budget doubled to 2% of gross domestic product by 2027. Trump is expected to demand that Japan increase its military spending to NATO targets of 5% of GDP, and purchase more U.S. weapons.",
      "Takaichi also needs to follow up on Japan\u2019s pledge of investing $550 billion in the U.S. as part of a U.S. tariff deal.",
      "Her policy plans have focused on short-term measures such as battling rising prices and improving salaries and subsidies, as well as restrictions against a growing foreign population as Japan faces a rise in xenophobia. Takaichi hasn't addressed bigger issues like demographic challenges.",
      "Takaichi's mission is to regain conservative votes by pushing the party further to the right. The LDP\u2019s coalition with the right-wing JIP may fit Takaichi's view.",
      "On Friday, Takaichi sent a religious ornament instead of going to the Yasukuni Shrine, apparently to avoid a diplomatic dispute with Beijing and Seoul. She also reached out to smaller opposition groups, including the far-right Sanseito, apparently in a bid to bring her coalition closer to securing a majority in parliament.",
      "\u201cThere is no room for Takaichi to show her true colors. All she can do is cooperate per policy,\u201d said Masato Kamikubo, a Ritsumeikan University political science professor. \u201cIt\u2019s a pathetic situation.\u201d",

      "Vietnam is racing to electrify its motorbike market, one of the largest in Southeast Asia with 77 million bikes on the road",
      "HANOI, Vietnam -- HANOI, Vietnam (AP) \u2014 Vietnam is split between two visions: the rumbling, reliable gas-powered motorbikes that now rule the roads, and sleek, silent electric bikes the government says are its future.",
      "Hanoi plans to ban fossil-fuel motorcycles from its city center in July 2026, part of a national drive to cut emissions and air pollution. Its commercial capital, Ho Chi Minh City, is weighing a similar step. By 2030, Vietnam aims for a third of cars and more than a fifth of motorbikes to run on electricity.",
      "Some see this as an opportunity to swap out smoke-belching engines for cleaner, quieter rides, But others remain wary. Gas-powered bikes are still cheaper, sturdier, and easier to repair. Many owners worry that electric models could fall short on range, affordability, and charging convenience.",
      "At the heart of the debate is the motorbike\u2019s central place in Vietnamese life. The country\u2019s 77 million two-wheelers \u2014 including 7 million in Hanoi and 8.5 million in Ho Chi Minh City \u2014 power small businesses, shape daily commerce, and set the rhythm of cities. Shopkeepers pile goods onto scooters to push through traffic, while families squeeze three generations onto a single bike for the school run.",
      "While delivery drivers and mechanics are scrambling, electric bike start ups are opening new retail stores and e-bike sales are climbing.",
      "Vietnam\u2019s biggest motorbike makers, Honda and Yamaha, say the 2026 timeline is too ambitious. Vietnamese electric vehicle companies \u2014 start ups like Dat Bike or the larger VinFast, backed by Vietnam\u2019s largest conglomerate VinGroup \u2014 and the Chinese electric bikemaker Yadea are betting on an electric future.",
      "Ta Manh Cuong, 45, a ride-hailing driver who earns about $20 on good days, calls his battered but reliable motorbike his \u201ciron horse,\u201d a slang riders use for their faithful companion through the city\u2019s daily chaos. He'd be willing to shift to an electric bike, would even welcome it if it cost less.",
      "\u201cBut right now I can\u2019t afford to buy an electric bike,\u201d he said.",
      "Vietnam\u2019s motorbike market, at about 3.5 million units a year, is the second-largest in Southeast Asia. It's also among the most electrified markets for two-wheelers, ranking third only to China and India, though electric motorbikes make up about 12% of total sales.",
      "Electrifying remaining two-wheelers is key for cutting tailpipe emissions and clearing smog from the streets. EVs are more energy efficient than gas engines, said Zifei Yang of the International Council on Clean Transportation. About 70,000 deaths in Vietnam each year are linked to polluted air, according to the Boston-based nonprofit Health Effects Institute.",
      "Unlike the car market, Yang added, motorbikes sold in Vietnam are made there. That means a shift to electric bikes could boost local producers, foster startups, and attract new investment. Vietnam\u2019s transition could also shape other developing markets.",
      "\u201cThese countries look at each other. Look at the experience,\u201d she said.",
      "Electric motorbike sales have surged since the ban was announced, with purchases of smaller bikes up 89% and full-sized bikes 197% in the first eight months of 2025. VinFast led as its sales more than quadrupled, outpacing Yadea and other local rivals, according to industry tracker MotorcyclesData.",
      "Yang said government subsidies to scrap old motorbikes could help riders like Cuong. While better public transport in crowded city centers would also encourage the shift to electric vehicles. She added that ride-hailing fleets stand to gain too since they travel longer distances and electric bikes could help them save on fuel. Stations where riders can replace depleted batteries with a fully charged one instead of waiting for it to recharge would also help.",

      "Yang said smaller batteries make home charging easier, battery costs are falling globally, and EVs are no more fire-prone than older vehicles, though such fires need special training and strict safety standards.",
      "Ho Chi Minh City plans to replace 400,000 gasoline motorbikes with electric ones by 2028, starting with a 2026 ban on using gas bikes for ride-hailing and delivery. The city will offer low-interest loans, tax breaks and set up low-emission zones to curb pollution. In Hanoi, people affected by the ban can get $120\u2013$200 in subsidies to buy electric bikes worth at least $590, depending on income, and won\u2019t have to pay new registration or license plate fees until 2030.",
      "VinFast looks set to profit from the transition. Its ride-hailing company, Green SM, surpassed Singapore-based regional ride-hailing firm Grab in February to become the market leader in Vietnam. It soon will launch its first battery\u2011swapping electric motorbike, selling for about $760. It plans, also, to build 150,000 battery-swapping stations nationwide within three years.",
      "VinFast is partnering with Vietnamese banks to offer low\u2011interest loans and subsidies to boost electric vehicle adoption, including covering up to 90% of costs and waiving registration fees.",
      "These policies and incentives can encourage more purchases of electric motorbikes, said Dat Bike CEO and founder Son Nguyen, but long-term success hinges on making electric bikes that deliver high performance, long ranges and fast charging at prices equal to or better than gas-guzzling motorbikes. \u201cIncentives can help add momentum, but long-term success depends on building products that win on their own merits,\u201d he said.",
      "Dat Bike raised $22 million in September from private investors, nearly doubling its capital to $47 million. The company said it will use the funding to boost production, research and expand its sales.",
      "Honda dominates Vietnam\u2019s motorcycle market with a more than 80% market share. It sold about 2.3 million bikes in Vietnam from April 2024 to March 2025 and exported 300,000 more, cementing the country as both a top market and a key production hub.",
      "Yamaha trails with about a 17% share. Through Vietnam\u2019s manufacturers\u2019 association, the two companies said the 2026 ban is too rushed. Honda only began selling e-bikes this year and warned that replacing millions of bikes quickly would strain consumers.",
      "Honda and the Vietnam's motorcycle manufacturers' association didn't respond to requests for comment. Yamaha told The Associated Press that it was reviewing the plan and couldn't respond yet.",
      "For now, many businesses are hedging their bets. Bao Ngoc Cao, who rents motorbikes to expats and tourists, said she was \u201cterrified\u201d when she first heard about the ban. Her business runs on the principle that bikes are cheap \u2014 costing about $80 monthly. Losing access to Hanoi\u2019s most touristy streets would cut her off from her core customers, and while interest in EVs is growing, current subsidies aren\u2019t nearly enough for her to replace her fleet. Still, she says she supports the ban in principle, welcoming the promise of cleaner air and healthier streets.",
      "\u201cWe are just waiting to get more clarity and see what happens,\u201d she said.",

    "story": [
      "China has expanded its export rules on rare earths, requiring foreign firms to get approval for exporting products containing even small amounts of China-originated materials",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 China likes to condemn the United States for extending its arm too far outside of its borders to make demands on non-American companies. But when it sought to hit back at the U.S. interests this month, Beijing did exactly the same.",
      "In expanding export rules on rare earths, Beijing for the first time announced it will require foreign firms to obtain approval from the Chinese government to export magnets containing even tiny amounts of China-originated rare earth materials or produced with Chinese technology.",
      "That means a South Korean smartphone maker must ask for Beijing's permission to sell the devices to Australia if the phones contain China-originated rare earth materials, said Jamieson Greer, the U.S. trade representative. \u201cThis rule gives China control over basically the entire global economy in the technology supply chain,\u201d he said.",
      "For anyone familiar with U.S. trade practice, China is simply borrowing a decades-long U.S. policy: the foreign direct product rule. It extends the reach of U.S. law to foreign-made products, and it has been used regularly to restrict China's access to certain U.S. technologies made outside of the United States, even when they are in the hands of foreign companies.",
      "It is the latest example of Beijing turning to U.S. precedents for tools it needs to stare down Washington in what appears to be an extended trade war between the world's two largest economies.",
      "\u201cChina is learning from the best,\u201d said Neil Thomas, a fellow on Chinese politics at Asia Society Policy Institute's Center for China Analysis. \u201cBeijing is copying Washington\u2019s playbook because it saw firsthand how effectively U.S. export controls could constrain its own economic development and political choices.\"",
      "He added: \u201cGame recognizes game.\"",
      "It was in 2018, when President Donald Trump launched a trade war with China, that Beijing felt the urgency to adopt a set of laws and policies that it could readily deploy when new trade conflicts arise. And it looked to Washington for ideas.",
      "Its Unreliable Entity List, established in 2020 by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce, resembles the U.S. Commerce Department's \u201centity list\u201d that restricts certain foreign companies from doing businesses with the U.S.",
      "In 2021, Beijing adopted the anti-foreign sanction law, allowing agencies such as the Chinese Foreign Ministry to deny visas and freeze the assets of unwelcome individuals and businesses \u2014 similar to what the U.S. State Department and the U.S. Department of Treasury can do.",
      "Calling it a toolkit against foreign sanctions, intervention and long-arm jurisdiction, the state-run news agency China News in a 2021 news report cited an ancient Chinese teaching, saying Beijing would be \u201chitting back with the enemy's methods.\u201d",
      "The law \u201chas combed through relevant foreign legislation and taken into consideration the international law and the basic principles of international relations,\u201d said the Chinese scholar Li Qingming as quoted in the news report. He also said it could deter the other side from escalating.",

      "Other formal measures Beijing has adopted in the past several years include expanded export controls and foreign investment review tools.",
      "Jeremy Daum, a senior research scholar in law and senior fellow at Yale Law School\u2019s Paul Tsai China Center, said Beijing often draws from foreign models in developing its laws in non-trade, non foreign-related areas. As China seeks capabilities to retaliate in kind in trade and sanctions, the tools are often \u201cvery parallel\u201d to those of the U.S., he said.",
      "Both governments also have adopted a \u201cholistic view of national security,\u201d which expands the concept to justify restrictions on each other, Daum said.",
      "When Trump launched his trade war with China shortly after he returned to the White House earlier this year, Beijing readily deployed its new tools in addition to raising tariffs to match those imposed by the U.S. president.",
      "In February, in response to Trump's first 10% tariff on China over allegations that Beijing failed to curb the flow of chemicals used to make fentanyl, the Chinese Commerce Ministry put PVH Group, which owns Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger and the biotechnology company Illumina, on the unreliable entity list.",
      "That barred them from engaging in China-related import or export activities and from making new investments in the country. Beijing also announced export controls on tungsten, tellurium, bismuth, molybdenum and indium, which are elements critical to the production of modern high-tech products.",
      "In March, when Trump imposed the second 10%, fentanyl-related tariff, Beijing placed 10 more U.S. firms on its unreliable entity list and added 15 U.S. companies to its export control list, including aerospace and defense companies like General Dynamics Land Systems and General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, among others, asserting that they \u201cendanger China\u2019s national security and interests.\u201d",
      "Then came the so-called \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs in April, when Beijing not only matched Trump's sky-high tariff of 125% but also blacklisted more U.S. companies and announced export controls on more rare earth minerals. That led to a pause in the shipment of magnets needed in manufacturing a wide range of products such as smartphones, electric vehicles, jet planes and missiles.",
      "While the new tools have allowed China to stare down the United States, Daum said they are not without risks.",
      "\u201cThe dangers in such a facially balanced and fair approach are, one, what one side sees as reciprocity the other might interpret as escalation,\u201d he said. And second, \"in a race to the bottom, nobody wins.\u201d",

      "Springer's drive to left field Monday night didn't have quite the same impact as Joe Carter's homer that gave Toronto the World Series in 1993, or even Dave Winfield's extra-inning double that helped the Blue Jays edge Atlanta for the 1992 title. But for a hit that occurred outside the World Series, Springer's was awfully impactful.",

      "Springer's homer increased Toronto's chance of winning the World Series by 19.73%. It ranks as one of the 10 biggest non-World Series plays since 1903. Here's the full list:",

      "The LCS was best-of-five before 1985, so this homer by Chambliss was a walk-off in a winner-take-all game. It also touched off a complete mob scene as fans invaded the field at Yankee Stadium. Baseball Reference's cWPA data has Chambliss' drive just ahead of a similar homer by Aaron Boone of the Yankees in Game 7 of the ALCS 27 years later.",

      "Arriving for the NFL's annual fall owners meeting, Johnson defended Glenn, praised the first-year coach's handling of the defense and deferred to the staff on who should start at football's most important position moving forward. Justin Fields started six games, missing one with injury, and was benched in favor of backup Tyrod Taylor in the second half Sunday against Carolina.",
      "\u201cThe defense is pretty good. If we can just complete a pass, it would look good,\u201d Johnson said. \"We\u2019ve got to complete some passes. You\u2019ve got to convince them that you can do something. Otherwise it\u2019s hard to have a game that you can win.\u201d",

      "Johnson said he believes in the decisions to hire Darren Mougey as GM and Glenn as coach.",

      "The organization moved on from Aaron Rodgers after going 5-12 in 2024. Rodgers has thrown for 14 touchdowns and five interceptions to help Pittsburgh open 4-2 and sit atop the AFC Central.",

      "Behind the scenes, the British government has been seeking to resolve the row, which comes at a time of heightened worries about antisemitism in Britain following a deadly attack on a Manchester synagogue earlier this month and calls from Palestinians and their supporters for a sports boycott of Israel over its conduct of the war against Hamas in Gaza.",
      "Maccabi\u2019s decision came despite the British government pledging to give police extra resources so that the game could be played safely with both teams\u2019 fans present.",

      "\u201cIt is completely unacceptable that this game has been weaponized to stoke violence and fear by those who seek to divide us,\u201d it said. \u201cWe will never tolerate antisemitism or extremism on our streets.\u201d",
      "Bans for traveling fans are not unheard of in European soccer, but are typically based on a history of violence between fans of rival clubs. There is no history of violence between Aston Villa and Maccabi fans.",
      "However, Maccabi fans have been increasingly in the spotlight over the past year or so, partly linked to the war in Gaza. Most notably, Maccabi fans clashed violently with city residents in Amsterdam last season when the team visited for a Europa League game against Ajax.",

      "Jaxon Smith-Njigba had his NFL-leading fifth 100-yard receiving game of the season as the Seattle Seahawks beat the Houston Texans 27-19",
      "SEATTLE -- SEATTLE (AP) \u2014 Jaxon Smith-Njigba called it spontaneous. Sam Darnold was simply surprised.",
      "The reserved Smith-Njigba, who has let his play speak for itself while leading the NFL in yards receiving this season, decided to celebrate his fourth touchdown catch of the season in style.",
      "After corralling an 11-yard pass from Darnold in the end zone to give the Seattle Seahawks a 14-0 lead on the Houston Texans late in the first quarter , Smith-Njigba effortlessly and gracefully slam-dunked the football on the crossbar of the goalposts. He drew an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty in the process, but helped guide the Seahawks to a 27-19 win on Monday night.",
      "\u201cThat was very spontaneous,\u201d Smith-Njigba said. \u201cDefinitely saw a lot of my favorites do it (growing up), but that was really on the spot right there.\u201d",
      "Smith-Njigba caught eight passes for 123 yards receiving, good for his NFL-leading fifth 100-yard receiving game of the season. He became the second player in franchise history to record three straight 100-yard games, and his five 100-yard games this season are tied for the second-most in a year by any Seahawks player.",
      "As stellar as Smith-Njigba has been in his third NFL season, what he\u2019s put forth on the regular has become somewhat expected. From teammate and 2021 AP NFL Offensive Player of the year Cooper Kupp\u2019s perspective, though, Smith-Njigba\u2019s excellence should be appreciated.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s nothing routine about what he\u2019s been able to do productivity-wise,\u201d Kupp said. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult. That\u2019s difficult. Takes a lot of work to be able to do that. I think that\u2019s the standard.\u201d",
      "Outside of Smith-Njigba\u2019s success, the Seahawks didn\u2019t get a whole lot going offensively against the No. 1 rated scoring defense in the NFL. Seattle did strike first, though, when running back Zach Charbonnet plunged in from one yard out on the Seahawks\u2019 second drive of the game to give them a 7-0 lead.",
      "They had excellent field position thanks to linebacker Uchenna Nwosu sacking C.J. Stroud for an 18-yard loss, which pinned the Texans at their own one-yard line. It was the third-longest sack in Seahawks franchise history by Nwosu, who missed Seattle\u2019s first game of the season and was limited due to injuries in 2023 and 2024.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s amazing to see him play like this right now,\u201d defensive end Leonard Williams III said of Nwosu.",
      "Charbonnet punched in his second touchdown of the game, a two-yard rush, late in the third quarter to give the Seahawks a 27-12 advantage.",
      "Houston, meanwhile, scored its first touchdown of the game when Darnold was strip-sacked in his own end zone midway through the third quarter. Texans edge rusher Will Anderson Jr. recovered the fumble in the Seahawks\u2019 end zone, but Houston failed to convert its two-point conversion attempt.",
      "\u201cAt the end of the day,\u201d Darnold said, \u201cI got to get the ball out of my hands.\u201d",
      "The Texans\u2019 only offensive touchdown came courtesy of a four-yard TD pass from Stroud to running back Woody Marks with only 2:04 remaining in regulation.",
      "\u201cOur defense kept us in the whole game,\u201d Stroud said. \u201cGot to help those guys out and score some points somehow, some way.\u201d",
      "Ka\u2019imi Fairbairn added two field goals for the Texans, whose two-game win streak was snapped and dropped to 2-4 on the year. Jason Myers, meanwhile, converted two of three attempts for the Seahawks, who advanced to 5-2 on the season and moved into a tie atop the NFC West with the San Francisco 49ers and Los Angeles Rams heading into their bye week",
      "\u201cI think we got our bye at the perfect time,\u201d Williams said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost midseason right now. I think we\u2019re going into it feeling good about what we\u2019ve accomplished so far.\u201d",
      "Linebacker Ernest Jones IV set a career-high with his third interception of the season, picking off Stroud on the Texans\u2019 first drive of the third quarter.

      "\u201cWhat we want to do is make sure young people are as prepared as possible to find employment in a world that\u2019s moving really quickly,\u201d said Ed Skyler, Citi Head of Enterprise Services and Public Affairs.",
      "Employer feedback suggested to Citi that early career applicants lacked the technical skills necessary for roles many had long prepared to fill, highlighting the need for continued vocational training and the importance of soft skills.",
      "Skyler pointed to the World Economic Forum\u2019s recent survey of more than 1,000 companies that together employ millions of people. Skills gaps were considered the biggest barrier to business transformation over the next five years. Two-thirds of respondents reported planning to hire people with specific AI skills and 40% of them anticipated eliminating jobs AI could complete.",
      "Some of Citi's grantees are responding by teaching people how to prompt AI chatbots to do work that can be automated. But Skyler emphasized it was equally important that Citi fund efforts to impart qualities AI lacks such as teamwork, empathy, judgment and communication.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not a one-size-fits-all effort where we think every young person needs to be able to code or interface with AI,\" Skyler said. \u201cWhat is consistent throughout the programs is we want to develop the soft skills.\u201d",
      "Among the recipients is NPower, a national nonprofit that seeks to improve economic opportunity in underinvested communities by making digital careers more accessible. Most of their students are young adults between the ages of 18 and 26.",
      "NPower Chief Innovation Officer Robert Vaughn said Citi's grant will at least double the spaces available in a program for \u201cgreen students\u201d with no tech background and oftentimes no college degree.",
      "Considering the tech industry's ever-changing requirements for skills and certifications, he said, applicants need to demonstrate wide-ranging capabilities both in cloud computing and artificial intelligence as well as project management and emotional intelligence.",
      "As some entry-level roles get automated and outsourced, Vaughn said companies aren\u2019t necessarily looking for college degrees and specialized skillsets, but AI comfortability and general competency.",

      "In the recovery unit of UC San Diego Health, Salaysay helps patients manage pain after surgery. Along with medications, he offers tunes on request and sometimes sings. His repertoire ranges from folk songs in English and Spanish to Minuet in G Major and movie favorites like \u201cSomewhere Over the Rainbow.\u201d",

      "No one suggests that a catchy song can fully eliminate serious pain. But several recent studies, including in the journals Pain and Scientific Reports, have suggested that listening to music can either reduce the perception of pain or enhance a person\u2019s ability to tolerate it.",

      "Two people with the same condition or injury may feel vastly different levels of acute or chronic pain. Or the same person might experience pain differently from one day to the next.",
      "Acute pain is felt when pain receptors in a specific part of the body \u2014 like a hand touching a hot stove \u2014 send signals to the brain, which processes the short-term pain. Chronic pain usually involves long-term structural or other changes to the brain, which heighten overall sensitivity to pain signals. Researchers are still investigating how this occurs.",

      "Scientists are still tracing the various neural pathways at work, said Palmer.",
      "\u201cWe know that almost all of the brain becomes active when we engage in music,\u201d said Kate Richards Geller, a registered music therapist in Los Angeles. \u201cThat changes the perception and experience of pain \u2014 and the isolation and anxiety of pain.\u201d",

AI can translate poorly worded phishing emails into fluent English, for example, as well as generate digital clones of senior government officials.",
      "Government cyber operations often aim to obtain classified information, undermine supply chains, disrupt critical public services or spread disinformation. Cyber criminals on the other hand work for profit by stealing corporate secrets or using ransomware to extort payments from their victims. These gangs are responsible for the wide majority of cyberattacks in the world and in some cases have built partnerships with countries like Russia.",

      "A new analysis released Thursday by the Strada Education Foundation finds 70% of recent public university graduates can expect a positive return within 10 years \u2014 meaning their earnings over a decade will exceed that of a typical high school graduate by an amount greater than the cost of their degree. Yet it varies by state, from 53% in North Dakota to 82% in Washington, D.C. States where college is more affordable have fared better, the report says.",
      "It's a critical issue for families who wonder how college tuition prices could ever pay off, said Emilia Mattucci, a high school counselor at East Allegheny schools, near Pittsburgh. More than two-thirds of her school\u2019s students come from low-income families, and many aren't willing to take on the level of debt that past generations accepted.",
      "Instead, more are heading to technical schools or the trades and passing on four-year universities, she said.",
      "\u201cA lot of families are just saying they can\u2019t afford it, or they don\u2019t want to go into debt for years and years and years,\u201d she said.",
      "Education Secretary Linda McMahon has been among those questioning the need for a four-year degree. Speaking at the Reagan Institute think tank in September, McMahon praised programs that prepare students for careers right out of high school.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not saying kids shouldn\u2019t go to college,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m just saying all kids don\u2019t have to go in order to be successful.\u201d",
      "American higher education has been grappling with both sides of the ROI equation \u2014 tuition costs and graduate earnings. It\u2019s becoming even more important as colleges compete for decreasing numbers of college-age students as a result of falling birth rates.",
      "Tuition rates have stayed flat on many campuses in recent years to address affordability concerns, and many private colleges have lowered their sticker prices in an effort to better reflect the cost most students actually pay after factoring in financial aid.",
      "The other part of the equation \u2014 making sure graduates land good jobs \u2014 is more complicated.",
      "A group of college presidents recently met at Gallup\u2019s Washington headquarters to study public polling on higher education. One of the chief reasons for flagging confidence is a perception that colleges aren\u2019t giving graduates the skills employers need, said Kevin Guskiewicz, president of Michigan State University, one of the leaders at the meeting.",

The goal is to mold degree programs to the job market's needs and to get students internships and work experience that can lead to a job.",
      "Bridging the gap to the job market has been a persistent struggle for U.S. colleges, said Matt Sigelman, president of the Burning Glass Institute, a think tank that studies the workforce. Last year the institute, partnering with Strada researchers, found 52% of recent college graduates were in jobs that didn\u2019t require a degree. Even higher-demand fields, such as education and nursing, had large numbers of graduates in that situation.",
      "\u201cNo programs are immune, and no schools are immune,\u201d Sigelman said.",
      "The federal government has been trying to fix the problem for decades, going back to President Barack Obama's administration. A federal rule first established in 2011 aimed to cut federal money to college programs that leave graduates with low earnings, though it primarily targeted for-profit colleges.",
      "A Republican reconciliation bill passed this year takes a wider view, requiring most colleges to hit earnings standards to be eligible for federal funding. The goal is to make sure college graduates end up earning more than those without a degree.",
      "Others see transparency as a key solution.",
      "For decades, students had little way to know whether graduates of specific degree programs were landing good jobs after college. That started to change with the College Scorecard in 2015, a federal website that shares broad earnings outcomes for college programs. More recently, bipartisan legislation in Congress has sought to give the public even more detailed data.",
      "Lawmakers in North Carolina ordered a 2023 study on the financial return for degrees across the state\u2019s public universities. It found that 93% produced a positive return, meaning graduates were expected to earn more over their lives than someone without a similar degree.",
      "The data is available to the public, showing, for example, that undergraduate degrees in applied math and business tend to have high returns at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, while graduate degrees in psychology and foreign languages often don't.",

      "A new wave of protests is unfolding worldwide, driven by young people expressing discontent with their governments",
      "NEW DELHI -- NEW DELHI (AP) \u2014 From the Andes to the Himalayas, a new wave of protests is unfolding across the world, driven by generational discontent against governments and anger among young people.",
      "This week, Madagascar's President Andry Rajoelina was forced out of power and out of the country after a military mutiny, the culmination of weeks of demonstrations led by young protesters referring to themselves as \u201cGen Z Madagascar.\u201d",
      "The rage against the political establishment in the Indian Ocean island country mirrors other recent protests across the world, in countries like Nepal, the Philippines, Indonesia, Kenya, Peru and Morocco. These protests have been sparked by specific grievances but are driven by long-simmering issues like widening inequality, economic uncertainty, corruption, and nepotism of leaders.",
      "But they have one thing in common: Mostly leaderless, they are made up primarily of young people who brand themselves as \u201cGen Z,\u201d defined as those born roughly between 1996 and 2010 \u2014 the first generation to grow up entirely in the internet age.",
      "\u201cWhat connects these youth-led protests is a shared sense that traditional political systems aren\u2019t responsive to their generation\u2019s concerns, whether that\u2019s corruption, climate change, or economic inequality. Protest then becomes the logical outlet when institutional channels feel blocked,\u201d said Sam Nadel, director of Social Change Lab, a U.K.-based nonprofit that researches protests and social movements.",
      "Though their specific demands differ, most of these protests have been sparked by government overreach or neglect. Some have also confronted harsh treatment by security forces and brutal repression.",
      "In Morocco, a leaderless collective called Gen Z 212 \u2014 named after Morocco\u2019s dialing code \u2014 has taken to the streets to demand better public services and increased spending on health and education. In Peru, protests over a pension law exploded into broader demands, including action to tackle rising insecurity and widespread corruption in the government. In Indonesia, deadly protests have erupted over lawmakers\u2019 perks and the cost of living, forcing the president to replace key economic and security ministers.",
      "The most widely recognized movement to be dubbed as a \u201cGen Z\u201d protest was a deadly uprising in Nepal that culminated with the resignation of the prime minister in September. Protesters drew inspiration from successful anti-government movements elsewhere in South Asia \u2014 Sri Lanka in 2022 and Bangladesh in 2024 \u2014 which led to the ouster of incumbent regimes.",
      "In Madagascar in turn, protesters say they were particularly inspired by the movements in Nepal and Sri Lanka.",
      "The protests began against regular water and electricity cuts but quickly morphed into wider discontent, as demonstrators called for the president and other ministers to step down. On Wednesday, Madagascar\u2019s military coup leader said he is \u201ctaking the position of president.\u201d",
      "Across multiple countries, a singular pop culture symbol has emerged: a black flag showing a grinning skull and crossbones wearing a straw hat. The flag comes from a cult Japanese manga and anime series called \u201cOne Piece,\u201d which follows a crew of pirates as they take on corrupt governments.",
      "In Nepal, protesters hung the same flag on the gates of the Singha Durbar, the seat of the Nepalese government, and on ministries, many of which were torched in protests. It was also hoisted by crowds in Indonesia, the Philippines, Morocco and Madagascar.",
      "Last week in the Peruvian capital, Lima, 27-year-old electrician David Tafur stood with the same flag in San Mart\u00edn Square, now the stage for weekly protests.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re fighting the same battle \u2014 against corrupt officials who, in our case, are also killers,\u201d he said, recalling that President Dina Boluarte\u2019s government held on to power since December 2022 despite more than 500 protests and the deaths of 50 civilians.",

      "\u201cDigital platforms are powerful tools for information sharing and building connections, but the most effective movements often combine digital mobilization with traditional in-person organizing, as we\u2019ve seen in these recent protests,\u201d said Nadel from Social Change Lab.",

      "Hold on. The rat hole wasn't what you think. It wasn't some back alley bar that served as a speakeasy for the city's notorious gangster clientele or a tenement stuffed to the brim with junk. It was actually a full-body impression of an unlucky critter that got trapped in wet sidewalk cement in the city's Roscoe Village neighborhood about 20 or 30 years ago. The imprint closely resembles that of a spread-eagled rat, complete with outlines of what appear to be tiny claws, arms and legs and even a tail.",
      "The rat hole went viral early last year after comedian Winslow Dumaine posted a photo of it on X. The post drew curious tourists to the site at all hours, with some leaving coins and other odd objects around the impression as a tribute.",
      "The constant traffic drew complaints from neighbors, though, and in April 2024 someone filled the impression with a substance resembling plaster. City workers eventually removed that slab of sidewalk and took it to the City Hall-County Building. A plaque honoring the rat hole remains at the actual site.",
      "Researchers hailing from the University of Tennessee, New York Institute of Technology College of Osteopathic Medicine and the University of Calgary published a paper Wednesday in the journal Biology Letters that concludes the rat hole was most likely created not by the titular rodent but a squirrel or a muskrat.",

      "The researchers studied online photos of the rat hole and compared measurements of the imprint to museum specimens of animals commonly found in the Chicago area. The presence of arms, legs and a tail excluded birds, snakes, frogs and turtles, shrinking the possibilities to a mammal. The claw outlines further reduced the field to rats, mice, squirrels, chipmunks and muskrats, the study said.",
      "The creature's long forelimbs, third digits and hind paws were too large for a rat but fell into the measurement ranges for Eastern gray squirrels, fox squirrels and muskrats. The most probable suspect is the Eastern gray squirrel given how abundant that creature is in the Chicago area, the study concluded.",
      "Other researchers have theorized that a squirrel created the imprint, the study acknowledged. Cement is typically wet during the day, and rats are nocturnal and the creature didn't leave any tracks, suggesting a squirrel misjudged a leap or slipped from a branch and landed in the wet cement, the study noted.",
      "The imprint didn't show any sign of a bushy tail, but hair often lacks the rigidity to create deep, well-defined impressions, and it would have been surprising to find such an imprint, the study said.",
      "\u201cWe therefore propose that the specimen be rechristened the 'Windy City Sidewalk Squirrel' \u2014 a name more fitting of its likely origins and more aligned with the evidence at hand,\" they wrote.",

      "The first licensed platforms are expected to start operating in late 2026 at the earliest, officials said.",
      "In granting a license, Hong Kong's transport commissioner can consider the firm\u2019s experience, financial capacity and intended investments in the region. Licensed companies will need to maintain \u201cproper and efficient\u201d services and ensure all vehicles and drivers on their platforms hold valid permits, according to the new rules.",

      "Immergut issued a second TRO following the Trump administration's attempt to deploy members of the California National Guard to Portland.",
      "The government is seeking to dissolve that TRO or \"at a minimum\" to stay, or suspend, the order until it expires on Nov. 2, according to the motion filed Monday.",
      "The city of Portland and state of Oregon have not yet filed a response to the government's motion, according to the online docket.",

      "\"Defendants did not publish the Article on the front page of The Wall Street Journal based on a mere harmless joke between friends,\" Monday's filing said. \"Indeed, such an assertion strains credulity beyond repair.

      "The lawsuit filed by the former Colorado driver demands that the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission resume investigating her claims that Amazon discriminates against female drivers by failing to provide adequate bathroom breaks.",
      "The lawsuit is the latest example of workers and others scrambling to find recourse as federal agencies abandon their cases in response to Trump\u2019s shake-up of the country\u2019s civil rights enforcement infrastructure.",
      "The EEOC, which enforces civil rights laws in the workplace, decided last month to discharge any complaints based on \u201cdisparate impact liability,\u201d which holds that policies that are neutral on their face can be discriminatory if they impose unnecessary barriers that disadvantage different demographic groups.",
      "The EEOC's decision came in response to an executive order in April directing federal agencies to deprioritize the use of disparate impact liability. The Trump administration argues that disparate impact assumes any racial or gender imbalance in workplaces is the result of discrimination and leads to practices that undermine meritocracy.",

Companies are reluctant to add staff amid so much economic uncertainty.

      "It's a welcome development in the wake of a troubling decline in the previous decade. The population of the whales, which are vulnerable to collisions with ships and entanglement in fishing gear, fell about 25% from 2010 to 2020.",
      "The whale's trend toward recovery is a testament to the importance of conservation measures, said Philip Hamilton, a senior scientist with the New England Aquarium's Anderson Cabot Center for Ocean Life. The center and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration collaborate to calculate the population estimate.",

      "Scientists have cautioned in recent years that the whale's slow recovery is happening at a time when the giant animals still face threats from accidental deaths, and that stronger conservation measures are needed. But there are also reasons to believe the whales are turning a corner in terms of low reproduction numbers, Hamilton said.",

      "The whales were hunted to the brink of extinction during the era of commercial whaling. They have been federally protected for decades.",
      "The whales migrate every year from calving grounds off Florida and Georgia to feeding grounds off New England and Canada. Some scientists have said the warming of the ocean has made that journey more dangerous because the whales have had to stray from established protected areas in search of food.",

      "Prosecutors are backing off a bit after getting a misdemeanor conviction against a record-setting mountain runner in a national park",
      "Michelino Sunseri climbed past boulders on his way to a record-breaking feat: The extreme runner reached the summit of Grand Teton, one of the highest mountains in the American West, and then rushed back down, all in less than three hours.",
      "The National Park Service, however, didn\u2019t celebrate. Instead, it charged him with a crime.",
      "In September, Sunseri, 33, was found guilty of a misdemeanor for spending just two minutes during the run on a prohibited trail in Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming.",
      "The remarkable solo triumph in 2024 has been overshadowed by his legal saga. \u201cFree Michelino\u201d stickers are on posts and benches in Jackson, Wyoming. Sunseri\u2019s supporters, including members of Congress, are appalled by what they consider to be a glaring example of excessive enforcement by the government.",
      "Sunseri hasn't been sentenced yet, and now he could be getting a break. Federal prosecutors last week said the charge could be dismissed if he meets certain conditions over 12 months and the judge agrees. A hearing is set for Tuesday.",
      "Prosecutors have repeatedly said the ban on shortcutting designated trails is on the park\u2019s website, the park map, in the park newspaper and also posted at trailheads. They pressed ahead with a two-day trial last May, despite a lack of support from officials in the new Trump administration.",
      "Joey Wilson of Salt Lake City, an ultramarathoner who designs training programs for athletes, said the significance of Sunseri\u2019s achievement sometimes gets lost.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an unbelievable thing that he accomplished \u2014 world class,\u201d Wilson said.",
      "Sunseri defends himself by saying he took the same route as many previous record holders on Grand Teton, including Kilian Jornet, one of the world's greatest mountain athletes, in 2012, without any blowback from the Park Service.",
      "He set out on Sept. 2, 2024, sharing the mountain with Labor Day holiday hikers. The path starts flat and wide before becoming extremely rocky on the way up.",
      "\u201cThere are boulders the size of small houses,\u201d said Wilson, whose father was a park ranger. \u201cYou've got to use your hands. If your hands were to pop off in a couple of places, you're going to fall a long way down.\u201d",
      "Sunseri also had to confront a series of switchbacks as the Garnet Canyon Trail zigged and zagged like a maze. On his way down, shirtless and wearing a hat backwards, he made a split-second decision that would later land him in court: He left a switchback to avoid casual hikers and possible injury, taking a path known as the Old Climber's Trail for two minutes.",
      "\u201cI was ahead of pace,\u201d said Sunseri, who had trained by running the mountain more than 40 times. \u201cI knew I was going to get the record regardless of which trail I took. I didn't want to be yelling at people to get out of my way.\u201d",
      "A small sign where he entered the trail says, \u201cShort Cutting Causes Erosion,\u201d while another at the other end says, \u201cClosed For Regrowth.\u201d Sunseri said there was no vegetation to destroy on the steep, narrow, hard-packed ground.",

      "Sunseri had run a total of 13.3 miles (21.4 kilometers) while gaining an elevation of 7,000 feet (2,133 meters) on his way up the mountain. The summit rests at 13,775 feet (4,198 meters).",
      "\u201cI was stoked,\" he recalled. \u201cIt's one of those things where every single thing has to go right \u2014 and everything did go right.\u201d",
      "Andy Anderson didn\u2019t bypass switchbacks during his record run in 2012, but Sunseri said he still had his blessing. They had dinner in Truckee, California, and Anderson handed over the prize: a handmade box bearing a commemorative belt buckle and listing the names of past Grand Teton record holders.",
      "Sunseri wrote about his epic run on social media. Those words doomed him. Federal investigators used search warrants to get access to the posts, which led to a misdemeanor charge of shortcutting a designated trail in the national park.",
      "U.S. Magistrate Judge Stephanie Hambrick found him guilty in a 51-page opinion released in September. She noted the testimony of Park Service Ranger Michelle Altizer, who said Sunseri's \u201cactions were high profile\u201d and that the potential to deter others was \u201cvery high and an important consideration\u201d in citing him.",
      "Sunseri's lawyers argued that the signs on Old Climber's Trail did not explicitly prohibit entry.",
      "\u201cThe trail has been sitting in its current state for decades,\u201d Wilson told The Associated Press. \u201cIf they really wanted to close that trail they could plant seeds over it and put a log down. Trail closed. Do not cross.\u201d",
      "After the spring trial, emails obtained by the defense team revealed that Park Service officials in Washington had told prosecutors on the eve of trial that they were withdrawing their support. A U.S. Interior Department lawyer referred to President Donald Trump's order \u201cfighting overcriminalization\u201d in federal regulations.",
      "\u201cWe're continuing with the prosecution,\u201d Assistant U.S. Attorney Nicole Romine in Wyoming wrote back.",
      "Because of the court case, Sunseri's performance on Grand Teton is not being recognized by fastestknowntime.com, a website for the best times on routes considered to have remarkable scenery or historical and cultural value around the world.",
      "In Congress, U.S. Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., is sponsoring a bill that would make willful intent a requirement for prosecuting certain crimes like Sunseri's trail-cutting misdemeanor. He called the case a \u201cprime example of the problem of overcriminalization.\u201d",

      "A leading opponent of affirmation action launched a campaign last month to test the policy's legality and stop Kamehameha Schools from favoring Hawaiians. It's part of a movement to expand the legal definition of racial discrimination in education, which comes on the heels of a Supreme Court ruling against affirmative action in college admissions and is bolstered by the Trump administration\u2019s war against diversity, equity and inclusion.",
      "Now, they\u2019re targeting scholarships, academic programs and admissions policies tied directly or indirectly to race.",
      "The lawsuit was expected after Students for Fair Admissions \u2014 led by Edward Blum, a leading opponent of affirmative action \u2014 set up a website posing the question, \u201cIs your child barred from Kamehameha Schools based on ancestry?\u201d",
      "The lawsuit doesn't include any named or anonymous plaintiffs other than Students for Fair Admissions. The complaint says the group has members who are \u201cinjured by Kamehameha's discrimination,\" and members who are \u201cready and able\u201d to apply to the Hawaii private school system, which has an endowment valued at more than $15 billion.",
      "\"We are ready for this challenge,\" trustees said in a statement. \u201cThe facts and the law are on our side, and we are confident that we will prevail.\u201d",
      "Kamehameha Schools was founded by the will of Bernice Pauahi Bishop, the great-granddaughter of King Kamehameha I. When she died in 1884, her will directed the establishment of schools that give preference to Native Hawaiians.",
      "Each year, the number of applications exceeds the number of spaces by as much as 17 to 1, depending on the campus and grade, according to the Kamehameha website. Alumni and parents of current students say a Kamehameha education is highly desirable because it's affordable, offers stellar academics and is grounded in the culture of Hawaii's Indigenous people.",

      "There\u2019s an understanding among Hawaii residents that only students with Hawaiian blood will be admitted. Many see the policy as a way to remedy disparities stemming from U.S. colonization and the 1893 overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom by a group of American business owners.",
      "The lawsuit says that if not for the admissions policy, there are non-Hawaiian families who would apply for reasons including: \u201cbad experiences with local public schools,\u201d Kamehameha's \u201chigh-quality programs\u201d and for its networking and career opportunities.",

      "The mass evacuation by military aircraft of hundreds of residents from Alaska villages ravaged by the remnants of Typhoon Halong is complete",
      "JUNEAU, Alaska -- JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) \u2014 The mass evacuation by military aircraft of hundreds of residents from Alaska villages ravaged by the remnants of Typhoon Halong is complete, and officials and local leaders are turning attention to trying to stabilize damaged infrastructure and housing where they can before the winter freeze sets in.",
      "The focus of major response efforts following back-to-back storms that battered western Alaska has been the Yup\u2019ik communities of Kipnuk and Kwigillingok, which are near the Bering Sea and have histories of flooding. While more than a dozen communities reported damage from the remnants of Halong earlier this month, Kipnuk and Kwigillingok were devastated by storm surge and water levels that reached record highs.",
      "Homes were swept away, some with people inside. Winds in the region shook and tossed buildings like toys. First responders recounted rescuing people from rooftops. One person died, and two remain missing.",
      "Initial estimates suggest 90% of buildings were destroyed in Kipnuk, with the fresh water supply seemingly contaminated by fuel and sewage, according to a report released Monday by Alaska\u2019s emergency management division. About 35% of buildings in Kwigillingok were destroyed, the report states.",
      "The Alaska Federation of Natives passed a resolution during its annual convention that ended Saturday in support of expansive, urgent and ongoing help for the region.",
      "The group is the largest statewide Native organization in Alaska, and its meeting in Anchorage coincided with the temporary relocation last week of hundreds of people to shelters in the city, which is Alaska's largest and about 500 miles (804.7 kilometers) from some of the tiny villages where residents rely heavily on hunting and fishing as part of their culture.",
      "The resolution, among other things, urges the state and federal governments \u201cto make sustained investments in permanent Alaska Arctic infrastructure and protective measures\u201d and to strengthen ties with tribes \u201cto ensure a consistent federal presence and equitable access to resources for remote communities across the Bering Sea and Arctic regions.\u201d",
      "Funds for community resilience or aimed at mitigating disaster risks have been called into question by President Donald Trump's administration, with efforts to cancel them being challenged in court. Alaska's U.S. senators, Republicans Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan, have said they would make the case for the importance of such funds in Alaska, where numerous rural communities face threats from coastal erosion and thawing permafrost that require significant infrastructure updates \u2014 and in some cases, relocation.",
      "The Alaska Federation of Natives' resolution also urged the federal government to establish a regional response hub in the southwest Alaska community of Bethel and to provide funds for village public safety officers to aid in response efforts. And it asks governments at all levels to discourage \u201cany barriers that would inhibit hunting and fishing practices\u201d to replenish fish, moose meat and other subsistence and traditional foods that Native people lost in the storm.",
      "The remoteness of the region requires goods to be shipped in by barge or brought in by air. Hunting and fishing helps supplement food available at local groceries that can be limited and often expensive.",
      "On Monday, 65 displaced students began classes in Anchorage schools. Anchorage School District staff over the weekend met with families in the shelters set up in the city and helped register children for school, the district said in a statement.",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump said Monday that the U.S. commands \u201cgreat respect\u201d from Beijing and that he will reach a \u201cfantastic deal\u201d with Chinese President Xi Jinping when the two leaders meet soon.",
      "Trump's remarks come after Beijing infuriated him by expanding export controls on rare earth products that are used in smartphones, fighter jets, electric vehicles and more. Trump spoke as he hosted Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese at the White House, celebrating an agreement with the U.S. ally as a potential counterpoint to China's near-monopoly in processing those critical minerals.",
      "\u201cI think we\u2019re going to end up having a fantastic deal with China,\" Trump said. \"It\u2019s going to be a great trade deal. It\u2019s going to be fantastic for both countries, and it\u2019s going to be fantastic for the entire world.\u201d",
      "When asked about China's leverage, Trump said Beijing \u201cthreatened us with rare earths, and I threatened them with tariffs.\" But he insisted his good relationship with Xi means they would work out \u201da very fair deal.\"",
      "All eyes are on a potential meeting between Trump and Xi because any failure to reach some agreement raises the risk of destabilizing not only relations between the two superpowers but also the global economy.",
      "Trump affirmed that he would meet with Xi this month on the sidelines of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, a grouping of 21 economies. Beijing has not announced plans for Xi to make the trip to South Korea, but it's not unusual for such details to emerge closer to the travel date.",
      "The president has threatened to impose a new 100% tariff on China in response to Beijing\u2019s expanded rules on rare earth products. And he said Monday that it has already had results.",
      "\u201cNow, they\u2019re treating us with great respect,\u201d Trump said. \u201cNow, we\u2019ll see what happens. I said, if we don\u2019t make a deal, I\u2019m putting on an additional 100% on November 1. I think we\u2019ll make a deal.\u201d",
      "Since returning to the White House, Trump has levied additional 30% across-the-board tariffs on China. Trump said the total rate on Chinese goods is about 55% to 57% and the country has paid the U.S. \u201chundreds of billions of dollars worth of money for tariffs.\u201d",
      "Beijing, however, has indicated it would play hardball.",
      "\u201cThreatening high tariffs is not the right way to deal with China,\u201d Lin Jian, a spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry, said last week in response to Trump's new tariffs threat.",
      "When asked if the 100% tariff could stand and how it could affect the economy, Trump told Fox Business\u2019 Maria Bartiromo last week that \u201cit\u2019s not sustainable.\u201d",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s not even close,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe have the best equipment. We have the best of everything, and nobody\u2019s going to mess with that.\u201d",
      "The United States is obligated by its own laws to give military support to Taiwan, which split from China in 1949 during a civil war. Beijing claims sovereignty over the island and vows to seize it by force if necessary to achieve what it says to be \u201cthe unification of the motherland.\u201d",

      "Meanwhile, Li Chenggang has been ousted as China's top trade negotiator after co-leading the last four rounds of talks with the U.S. In a routine, bullet-style announcement of removals and appointments, Beijing said Monday that Li was removed from his post as China\u2019s permanent representative to the World Trade Organization. No reason was given.",
      "He was replaced by Li Yongjie, deputy international trade representative, who recently held trade talks with Ecuador.",
      "The announcement coincided with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's recent criticisms of Li Chenggang. At a press conference last week, Bessent made a rare public airing of displeasure, saying Li \u201cshowed up here with very incendiary language on August 28,\" has \u201cgone rogue\u201d and was \u201cvery disrespectful.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe showed up uninvited in Washington and said, quote, China will cause global chaos if the port shipping fees go through,\u201d Bessent said, referring to the U.S. plan to charge port fees on China-linked vessels.",
      "Late last week, Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng had a video call with Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer. The sides held a \u201ccandid, in-depth and constructive exchange\u201d and agreed to hold a new round of trade talks as soon as possible, according to China\u2019s official Xinhua news agency.",
      "Bessent said last week that he and his Chinese counterpart would likely meet in Malaysia soon to prepare for a leaders summit.",

      "The sentence came more than a year after Ian Cleary was extradited back to Pennsylvania from France over the assault at Gettysburg College and nearly 12 years after the victim first went to police.",
      "The judge took into account Cleary\u2019s guilty plea, his remorse and his long history of mental illness in giving a sentence below state guidelines. Cleary, 32, said he sent the messages as part of a 12-step program, in hopes of seeking atonement.",
      "Victim Shannon Keeler told the court on Monday that the messages only reopened wounds she had long carried over the assault, which went years without being prosecuted.",
      "\u201cThe system meant to protect me protected you instead,\u201d said Keeler, detailing in a powerful 10-minute impact statement the years she spent pursuing charges, which prosecutors are often reluctant to file in campus sexual assault cases.",

      "Cleary faced a maximum of 10 years in prison for the attack, and the two sides had initially proposed a four- to eight-year sentence.",
      "Andrea Levy, Keeler\u2019s lawyer, said the sentence was \u201cless than what we expected and certainly less than he deserves,\" but she said there was relief that the case was over.",
      "Keeler told police that Cleary sneaked into her dorm on the eve of winter break, when few people were left on campus, then pushed his way into her room and assaulted her. She was an 18-year-old in her first semester on campus at the time.",
      "Senior Judge Kevin Hess said that anyone with daughters or, like him, granddaughters in college would find the crime \u201chorrifying.\u201d",
      "Nevertheless, he said, \u201cthe defendant has admitted his guilt, he\u2019s come forward and even though 10 to 11 alarming years have passed in the meantime, we wouldn\u2019t be here today but for his hope for some kind of forgiveness and contrition.\u201d",
      "Cleary left Gettysburg after the attack and ultimately finished college in Silicon Valley, California, where he\u2019d grown up. He then got a master\u2019s degree and worked for Tesla before moving overseas.",
      "In 2019, he sent the Facebook message to Keeler, and she renewed her efforts with police and prosecutors after noticing them a few months later. In 2021, she shared her experience in an Associated Press story on the reluctance of prosecutors to pursue campus sex crimes.",

      "U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis last week ordered uniformed agents to wear cameras, if available, and turn them on when engaged in arrests, frisks and building searches or when being deployed to protests. She held a hearing Monday at which she questioned a U.S. Customs and Border Protection official and a U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement official about the operation and complaints that agents are increasingly using combative tactics.",
      "Kyle Harvick, deputy incident commander with CBP, said Border Patrol agents who are part of Operation Midway Blitz have cameras. He said 201 are in the Chicago area.",
      "But Shawn Byers, deputy field office director for ICE, said more money from Congress would be needed to expand camera use beyond two of that agency's field offices. He said no cameras have been worn by ICE agents working at a building in Broadview, outside Chicago, where immigrants pass through before being detained elsewhere. It's been the site of protests that at times have been tumultuous.",

      "President Donald Trump and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese have signed a critical-minerals deal at the White House",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese signed a critical-minerals deal at the White House on Monday as the U.S. eyes the continent\u2019s rich rare-earth resources at a time when China is imposing tougher rules on exporting its own critical minerals abroad.",
      "The two leaders described the agreement as an $8.5 billion deal between the allies. Trump said it had been negotiated over several months.",
      "\u201cIn about a year from now we\u2019ll have so much critical mineral and rare earth that you won\u2019t know what to do with them,\" said Trump, a Republican, boasting about the deal. \"They\u2019ll be worth $2.\u201d",
      "Albanese added that the agreement takes the U.S.-Australia relationship \u201cto the next level.\u201d",
      "Earlier this month, Beijing announced that it will require foreign companies to get approval from the Chinese government to export magnets containing even trace amounts of rare-earth materials that originated from China or were produced with Chinese technology. The Trump administration says this gives China broad power over the global economy by controlling the tech supply chain.",
      "\u201cAustralia is really, really going to be helpful in the effort to take the global economy and make it less risky, less exposed to the kind of rare earth extortion that we\u2019re seeing from the Chinese,\u201d Kevin Hassett, the director of the White House\u2019s National Economic Council, told reporters Monday morning ahead of Trump\u2019s meeting with Albanese.",
      "Hassett noted that Australia has one of the best mining economies in the world, while praising its refiners and its abundance of rare earth resources. Among the Australian officials accompanying Albanese are ministers overseeing resources and industry and science, and Australia has dozens of critical minerals sought by the U.S. because they are needed in everything from fighter jets and electric vehicles to laptops and phones.",
      "The agreement could have an immediate impact on rare earth supplies in the United States if American companies can secure some of what Australian mines are already producing, although it will take years \u2014 if not decades \u2014 to develop enough of a supply of rare earths outside of China to reduce its dominance.",
      "Pini Althaus, who founded USA Rare Earth back in 2019 and is now working to develop new mines in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan as CEO of Cove Capital, said it will be crucial that the contracts to buy materials from Australian mines include price floors, similar to what the U.S. government promised MP Materials this summer, to protect against China manipulating prices.",
      "For decades, China has used the tactic of dumping excess critical minerals onto the market to drive prices down to force mining companies in the rest of the world out of business to eliminate any competition.",
      "\"I think taking away that arrow in the quiver of China to manipulate pricing is an absolute crucial first step in Australia and the West being able to develop critical minerals projects to meet our supply chain demands,\u201d said Althaus, who has spent nearly a quarter-century in the mining business.",
      "The agreement underscores how the U.S. is using its global allies to counter China, especially as it weaponizes its traditional dominance in rare earth materials. Top Trump officials have used the tactics from Beijing as a rallying cry for the U.S. and its allies to work together to try to minimize China's influence.",
      "\u201cChina is a command-and-control economy, and we and our allies will neither be commanded nor controlled,\u201d Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week. \u201cThey are a state economy and we are not going to let a group of bureaucrats in Beijing try to manage the global supply chains.\u201d",
      "The level of investment outlined in the agreement shows how serious the two nations are about addressing the problem.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. and Australia will invest over $3 billion in joint critical minerals projects within six months. That\u2019s a somewhat unprecedented speed of capital injection,\u201d said Gracelin Baskaran, director of the Critical Minerals Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.",
      "But Althaus cautioned that Australia can\u2019t supply everything the United States needs, so it is crucial that American continues to invest in the long-term effort to develop other mining and processing projects both at home and in friendly nations. He said central Asia might be one of the most promising places to invest because the region has significant rare earth reserves, and the Soviet Union already did some of the initial development work when it controlled that territory. That could cut years off the time it will take to build a new mine there.",

The conservative majority found in 2022 that the Second Amendment generally gives people the right to carry guns in public for self-defense and any firearm restrictions must have a strong grounding in the nation\u2019s history.",
      "The landmark 2022 ruling led to a cascade of challenges to firearm laws around the country, though the justices have since upheld a different federal law intended to protect victims of domestic violence by barring guns from people under restraining orders.",

      "A U.S. man authorities say faked his death and fled to the United Kingdom to avoid rape charges has been sentenced to at least five years in prison",
      "SALT LAKE CITY -- SALT LAKE CITY (AP) \u2014 A Utah judge on Monday sentenced a man who appeared to fake his death and flee the United States to avoid arrest on rape charges to anywhere from five years to life in prison.",
      "Nicholas Rossi, 38, is \u201ca serial abuser of women\u201d and \u201cthe very definition of a flight risk,\u201d District Judge Barry Lawrence said before handing down the sentence.",
      "It was Rossi's first of two sentencings after separate convictions in August and September of raping two women in northern Utah in 2008. He is scheduled to be sentenced in November in the second case.",
      "Utah allows prison sentences to be given as a range rather than a set period of time. A parole board will determine if and when Rossi is released. Five years to life is the entire range of possible prison time under Utah law for rape, a first-degree felony.",
      "Jurors found Rossi guilty of rape in August after a three-day trial in which his accuser and her parents each took the stand.",
      "Rossi left a \u201ctrail of fear, pain and destruction\u201d behind him, the victim in the case told the court shortly before Rossi was sentenced. The Associated Press does not typically identify rape victims.",
      "\u201cThis is not a plea for vengeance,\" she said. \u201cThis is a plea for safety and accountability, for recognition of the damage that will never fully heal.\u201d",
      "Rossi posed a risk to community safety and should be in prison, argued Deputy Salt Lake County District Attorney Brandon Simmons, a prosecutor in the case, before the sentencing. Rossi's lawyers, meanwhile, urged the judge to give him parole.",
      "Rossi did not testify on his own behalf during the trial. Given a chance to speak before being sentenced Monday, he maintained his innocence.",
      "\u201cI am not guilty of this. These women are lying,\u201d Rossi said in a soft, raspy voice. He appeared in court in a wheelchair and used an oxygen tank.",
      "Utah authorities began searching for Rossi, whose legal name is Nicholas Alahverdian, when he was identified in 2018 through a decade-old DNA rape kit. He was among thousands of rape suspects identified and later charged when Utah made a push to clear its rape kit backlog.",
      "Months after he was charged in that case, an online obituary claimed Rossi died on Feb. 29, 2020, of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. But police in his home state of Rhode Island, along with his former lawyer and a former foster family, cast doubt on whether he was dead.",

      "He was extradited to Utah in January 2024 after a protracted court battle. At the time, Rossi insisted he was an Irish orphan named Arthur Knight who was being framed. Investigators say they identified at least a dozen aliases Rossi used over the years to evade capture.",
      "In his first trial, Rossi\u2019s public defender denied the rape claim and urged jurors not to read too much into his move overseas. Even so, the jury convicted Rossi of the rape charge for which he was sentenced Monday.",
      "The victim in the case had been living with her parents and recovering from a traumatic brain injury in 2008 when she responded to a personal ad Rossi posted on Craigslist. They began dating and were engaged within a couple weeks.",
      "She testified that Rossi asked her to pay for dates and car repairs, lend him $1,000 so he wouldn\u2019t be evicted, and take on debt to buy their engagement rings. He grew hostile soon after their engagement and raped her in his bedroom one night after she drove him home, she said.",
      "She went to police years later, after hearing that Rossi was accused of raping another woman in Utah around the same time.",
      "The victim in that case went to police soon after Rossi attacked her at his apartment in Orem. The woman had gone there to collect money she said he stole from her to buy a computer.",
      "Rossi was convicted in that case in September and sentencing is set for Nov. 4.",
      "Rossi grew up in foster homes in Rhode Island and returned there before he appeared to fake his death and flee the country.

      "The 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals has scheduled a hearing in Philadelphia over Habba's appointment, which a lower court judge said in August was done with a \u201cnovel series of legal and personnel moves\u201d and that she was not lawfully serving as U.S attorney for New Jersey.",
      "The judge's order said that her actions since July could be declared void but put his order on hold so the U.S. Justice Department could appeal.",
      "Habba is validly serving in the role under a federal statute that permits the first assistant attorney, a post she was appointed to by the Trump administration, the government said in court briefs ahead of Monday's hearing.",
      "A similar dynamic is playing out in Nevada, where a federal judge disqualified the administration's pick to be U.S. attorney there.",
      "In the Habba case, U.S. District Judge Matthew Brann's decision came after several people charged with federal crimes in New Jersey challenged the legality of Habba\u2019s tenure. They sought to block the charges, arguing she didn\u2019t have the authority to prosecute their cases after her 120-day term as interim U.S. attorney expired.",
      "Habba was Trump's attorney in criminal and civil proceedings before he was elected to a second term. She served as a White House adviser briefly before Trump named her as a federal prosecutor in March.",
      "Shortly after her appointment, she said in an interview she hoped to help \u201cturn New Jersey red,\u201d a rare overt political expression from a prosecutor, and said she planned to investigate the state\u2019s Democratic governor and attorney general.",

      "PEORIA, Ill. -- PEORIA, Ill. (AP) \u2014 A jury was seated Monday in the murder trial of an Illinois sheriff\u2019s deputy charged with killing Sonya Massey, a Black woman shot in her home last year after calling police for help.",
      "Opening statements are scheduled for Wednesday in the case against Sean Grayson after a jury of 10 women and five men, including three alternates, was chosen.",
      "Grayson 31, an ex-Sangamon County Sheriff\u2019s deputy, responding to a call about a suspected prowler, fired on the 36-year-old Massey in her Springfield home early on July 6, 2024, after confronting her about how she was handling a pan of hot water Grayson had ordered removed from her stove.",
      "Massey\u2019s killing raised new questions about U.S. law enforcement shootings of Black people in their homes and it prompted a change in Illinois law requiring fuller transparency on the background of candidates for law enforcement jobs.",
      "Security was tight at the courthouse, including snipers on rooftops around the perimeter. A protest attracted demonstrators holding signs, some of which read, \u201cThe People Demand: End Police Terror\u201d and \u201cUnited Now Against Racial Violence.\u201d",
      "The jury chosen from four dozen prospects who were asked about their attitudes toward law enforcement. Sangamon County State's Attorney John Milhiser probed potential jurors about whether Grayson's status as a police officer would affect their ability to deliver a guilty verdict; a handful said it would.",
      "No one raised a hand when Milhiser asked if police officers should be free to use unchecked levels of force. The defense likely will argue that Grayson was justified in his use of force because of the pan of hot water Massey held.",
      "Defense attorney Dan Fultz gauged panel members' comfort level in acquitting the officer and questioned their willingness to serve, their outside obligations and how those distractions would affect their focus.",
      "Here's what to know about the case.",
      "In addition to first-degree murder, Grayson is charged with aggravated battery with a firearm and official misconduct. He has pleaded not guilty.",
      "Widespread attention on Grayson's shooting of Massey prompted Sangamon County Circuit Judge Ryan Cadagin to move the trial from Springfield, 200 miles (322 kilometers) southwest of Chicago. Jurors will instead come from Peoria and surrounding areas, an hour's drive north, and will hear the case in their local courthouse.",
      "Grayson, who is white, faces a sentence of 45 years to life in prison if convicted of first-degree murder.",
      "After Grayson and another deputy checked the area around Massey\u2019s house, body camera video shows Grayson knocked on her door to report they had found nothing suspicious. He entered the house to obtain details for a report, noticed a pan on the stove and ordered its removal. Massey picked it up.",
      "She laughingly asked Grayson why he was backing away. He said he was trying to avoid the \u201chot, steaming water.\u201d Massey responded, \u201cI rebuke you in the name of Jesus.\u201d Grayson wrote in an incident report, \u201cI interpreted this to mean she was going to kill me.\u201d",

She apologized then put the pan down and ducked behind a counter, but in the confusion, as Grayson yelled, it appears she picked it up again. Grayson fired three times, hitting Massey once just below the left eye.",
      "Massey, a single mother of two teenagers, was beset by mental health problems. When she answered Grayson's knock minutes before the shooting, she said, \u201cDon't hurt me,\u201d and then, as she was questioned and Grayson asked her if she was all right, she repeatedly said, \u201cPlease God.\u201d",
      "Earlier that same week, Sonya Massey had admitted herself to a 30-day inpatient mental health program in St. Louis but returned two days later without explanation.",
      "County records indicate that in the days leading up to the shooting, three 911 calls were made by Massey or on her behalf. In one, her mother, Donna Massey, told authorities her daughter was suffering a \u201cmental breakdown.\" Donna Massey also told the dispatcher, \u201cI don\u2019t want you guys to hurt her.\"",

      "There was no indication Grayson had been fired from any job, but evaluations from past employers documented concerns about him. One department reported that while Grayson worked hard and had a good attitude, he struggled with report writing, was \u201cnot great with evidence \u2014 left items laying around office\u201d and was \u201ca bragger.\u201d",
      "Jack Campbell, the Sangamon County sheriff, was forced to retire six weeks after the shooting. He insisted though that none of Grayson's issues disqualified him from working as a deputy.",

      "Introduction",
      "\"Honey, you're the third Tim Curry to call today,\" she said, and hung up the phone.",
      "It was the spring of 1976. By an extraordinary coincidence, I had recently moved into a great apartment right behind the Waverly cinema, in New York's Greenwich Village. The Waverly was the flagship of several key venues that were experiencing success with a little film called The Rocky Horror Picture Show, whose new life had only just taken off.",
      "I'd been in the stage adaptation, and we'd had an extraordinary run in London and Los Angeles. But when the film was released in 1975, it had bombed rather spectacularly. Less than a year later, it was going through a sort of renaissance, due to some genius marketing and raucous audience participation.",
      "Naturally, I was curious, however hesitant, about this new incarnation. I'd called a day ahead of time, to let them know that I was a member of the cast and to ask if they would be so kind as to reserve a few tickets for my friends and me.",
      "\"And who are you?\" the woman asked. Her accent was rather aggressive and I caught the distinct whiff of exaggerated boredom in her tone.",
      "\"This is Tim Curry.\"",
      "That was when I was informed of the previous two Tims. The receiver dinged, and the line went dead.",
      "I stared at the phone, both bemused and irate by her response. Ultimately, my friends and I showed up anyway (with identification). We didn't wear special costumes or anything like that \u2014 I'm not inclined to do so unless it's required or earned. Luckily, as much renewed success as the show was now having, it wasn't terribly difficult to get tickets. We went in and sat toward the back of the theater. I was far more interested in viewing the spectacle than in participating, and the crowd's engagement was a true delight to behold.",
      "Before long, people started noticing me. A group of girls came up to my seat, giggling, touched my arm or leg, then tittered as they dispersed. It was all rather surreal, especially with the film, the fevered audience participation, and the all-too- familiar music carrying on in the background.",
      "Unintentionally, I'd created a stir among the already animated audience. About a half hour into the film, the woman from the ticket booth of the Waverly \u2014 a slightly bedraggled, very unlikely blonde \u2014 hustled down the aisle and pulled me out of my seat.",
      "\"You are an imposter,\" she hissed. \"You must leave. You're a nightmare! And you are not Tim Curry at all \u2014 you don't even look like him!\" She pointed at the screen, her long red fingernail trembling with emphasis.",
      "I stood up slowly and, with a mixture of embarrassment and triumph (neither of which were particularly founded), I handed her my passport.",
      "She snatched it, squinted at the photo, looked back at my face, then back at the passport. In the flickering light, I watched her haughty expression collapse. Speechless, she seemed to sort of melt in front of me, evoking a wicked witch who had been assaulted by a bucket of water.",
      "Aware I was now on a stage of sorts, I steadied myself and waited for her response.",
      "\"Ohhh my God. Oh, Mr. Curry. I didn't ... Please just ... please sit down.\"",
      "I took my passport back and gestured to my friends.",
      "\"I wouldn't dream of it!\" I said, and promptly strode out of the cinema.",
      "By definition \u2014 as one who has professionally pretended or masqueraded onstage, onscreen, and into a microphone \u2014 there is an argument to be made that I have been a career imposter for most of my life.",
      "But if you ask me, there's a much better word for my vocation and identity, a word that carries me back to my earliest days.",
      "Vagabond.",
      "Vagabonds rove. We travel about and pick up work wherever we go. We wander, drift, stagger, wink. Reluctant to be pinned down, we're enticed by risk, restless if we linger, fueled by curiosity and a sense of wonder.",
      "Vagabonds learn, often from a young age, that indeed time is fleeting. As is fame \u2014 a fairly worthless pursuit, really. We are less startled by life's unpredictable shifts than those who choose to remain safe and settled. We often practice our trade in varied locations.",
      "Those of us with itinerant upbringings or similar proclivities often have no choice but to adapt and reinvent ourselves. Over and over and over again. We rely on charming exteriors and don't mind saying so, leading us to project an inflated sense of self-confidence. We feel deeply but are perhaps less inclined to express our true selves to others \u2014 because our relationships so often prove to be ephemeral.",
      "Of course, these qualities don't apply to all vagabonds. I'm not sure they'll apply to me tomorrow. But it feels about right today.",
      "In Shakespearean times, people of the stage were considered rogues and vagabonds. I always rather liked that. I presume that such labels came about because of actors assuming manifold identities, traveling from one town to the next in pursuit of new audiences and a bit of coin here and there. How can you trust somebody, or truly know somebody, who appears as a king one day and a jester the next? What does it mean when neither role is the true identity of the person, and when that very person might be gone the next day? These entertainers with ever-changing faces and varied costumes were presumed to be scoundrels, not regarded as honorable or honest members of society.",
      "That part doesn't define me, of course.",
      "I'm very trustworthy.",
      "You believe me, don't you?",
      "Over the course of my life, my vagabond blues, hopes, and highs have found their way into varied channels of expression, different creative boxes from which flashes of my real self could emerge. Through my songs. Delivered upon the stage. Exhibited on screens. Cultivated in my homes and gardens. Re-envisioned, attached to, and filtered through more voices and personas than I can recall.",
      "Much of this book has involved returning to those characters, the ones who defined my professional life. As there is a piece of me who either exists in or understands each of the roles we'll be revisiting, surveying them together will hopefully yield a colorful, curious mosaic of who I am, beneath the cosmetics and costumes.",
      "Looking in the rearview mirror is neither my instinct nor my preferred way of being. I'd rather get on with it and keep moving forward. I have never been one to dwell on past performances any more than is required. I do not snatch memorabilia from my films to keep it displayed around my house like glistening ashes. I find little reward lingering in nostalgia. Living gig to gig for the better (and worse) part of half a century, I have grown accustomed to appreciating and accepting lessons offered, then looking forward to the next challenge.",
      "That's the vagabond's way.",
      "And yet, it hasn't escaped my notice that others have jumped at the opportunity to make their own assumptions. I have been described as everything from a confounding sex symbol, to a home designer, to a rock 'n' roll singer, to an imposter, to the prince of Halloween, to a paralyzed tragic case, to a dead legend.",
      "Contrary to village gossip, I am still very much alive.",
      "So, while that remains the case, I believe it's my turn \u2014 and my privilege \u2014 to malign my own reputation.",
      "Why expose myself now? After all, I'm quite comfortable in the shade, and it would be easy enough to remain there. But with time, the thought of sharing my story stayed on my mind and felt just risky enough to intrigue me as a creative pursuit. I've also developed increasing respect for the characters I've played over the course of my life, characters about whom I've spent no small amount of time answering (and avoiding) questions.",
      "More than anything, the challenges presented to me by being alive, by the pandemic, and by sundry health issues have offered an appalling amount of time to reflect. Strewn amid those reflections has been a recurring fantastical notion: Maybe it's time to write my story. Before I could even finish musing about what that might mean, self-doubt had persistently reared up, chuckling malevolently: You've got a nerve.",
      "I'm prone to heed that voice, which has so often intervened, posing the deceptively simple question: Who do you think you are?",
      "However, as loud and obstructive as that voice has been throughout my life, generations of you (yes, you) have continued to flatter me with curiosity and kind attention. In doing so, you have given me permission to mute my self-deprecating instincts \u2014 or at least to hold them at bay.",
      "Today, I am physically unable to take you on a vigorous vagabond's adventure, due to a stroke I endured in 2012 that has limited my capacity as an active tour guide. But my mind and most of my memories have remained intact, and within them exist a multitude of journeys perhaps worth sharing. Before I can no longer be bothered to recount them, I humbly invite you into my stories of living across various environments: seaside living, country living, city living; on the road, on the stage, crossing borders and blurring them, ever in a vagabond state. I've loved inhabiting most of those settings, and \u2014 with some notable exceptions \u2014 enjoy remembering the times I've had.",
      "You should know what you're in for, however.",
      "I'd hate to leave you dissatisfied.",
      "Before we raise the curtains, before the elevator descends, know this:",
      "This will not be a master class. I have stories to impart, not explicit lessons to teach. You may glean profound takeaways from where I've been, how I got there, whom I've met, what I've done, or how I finagled my way into repeatedly being cast as an irresistible villain. Even so, my words are not meant to serve as instructions on how to act, sing, become a voiceover artist, or remain resilient in the face of unforeseen physical hardship. In part, because I do not believe that I have mastered any of those things. Furthermore, since I was a young boy, I've been dubious of anyone who claims to be an authority. Far be it for me to adopt an expert's stance now.",
      "I must also warn (or assure) you that while there are scraps of my nature in all of my characters, I am none of them. That sentence feels too ludicrously obvious to put in writing, but the distinctions between who I really am and who I've pretended to be as an actor have proven to be a source of great disappointment to some audiences. It has not caused me much personal distress, beyond the periodic necessity to deter stalkers.",
      "Nor will this be a juicy Hollywood tell-all. Not because my moral compass won't allow it, or because I haven't had ample run-ins with juicy celebrities \u2014 but simply because I find such books immensely dull and highly susceptible to gathering dust.",
      "I also won't be dishing out lurid details of my love affairs. I guarantee you, if it matters, that I have experienced true love, true heartbreak, and everything in between, including no small amount of wreckage. Which, naturally, helps inform who I am. I have loved and been loved and I hope you have, too. But I'm not interested in your romances. And specifics about my affairs of the heart or the bedroom are \u2014 respectfully \u2014 none of your f***ing business.",
      "With those caveats taken care of, I sincerely hope you enjoy the escapades, illusions, and contradictions I've collected recklessly over the course of my vagabond days.",
      "I trust you're now shivering with antici - I'll play along; I'll SAY IT - pation ...",
      "Let's get on with it.",

    "published": "Sun, 19 Oct 2025 10:10:12 -0400",
    "summary": "After the deaths of his mother and father, actor-director Ben Stiller sought to pay tribute as few sons could: a documentary about their lives on-stage and off. But even he didn't anticipate to what depths his film, \"Stiller & Meara: Nothing Is Lost,\" would go.",
    "story": [
      "A-List actor and director Ben Stiller knows a good story when he sees one, so he knew profiling his late parents, Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara, would be compelling. But even he had no idea how deep it would take him. \"No, I didn't!\" he laughed. \"I mean, I didn't know where it was gonna go.\"",
      "Stiller & Meara had been the husband-and-wife comedy team of the 1960s and '70s, appearing on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" 36 times. But for Ben and sister Amy, Stiller & Meara were also Mom & Dad \u2013 and that could get confusing.",
      "Stiller's new Apple TV documentary, \"Stiller & Meara\" Nothing Is Lost,\" examines how his parents navigated both roles.",
      "Married 62 years, their family life was shaped by Jerry's relentless ambition, and Anne's resentment doing comedy when her dream was to be a serious actress \u2013 and the drinking that followed. As Ben noted in his film, \"She had to go up there and do that act, because she was so good at it. But it wasn't really her true thing, you know? It wasn't her true happiness.\"",
      "The film is an adult's attempt to answer the complicated question that shaped his childhood: Where did the act end, and the marriage begin?",
      "In one archival interview, Jerry Stiller calls his wife \"the funniest woman in the world off stage and on stage. Now the thing is, when she does these funny things, I am an exploiter and opportunist, and I'll take a pencil and I'll start to write it down.\"",
      "Anne Meara picks up: \"He says we can use that on a show, and I'm ready to kill him! Again, where does the act end and the marriage begin?\"",
      "Ben Stiller said, \"There's so much footage and material and things to show of the good and the bad and the tension and the happy times. I felt it was really important to try to have a balance in the film that would relay to the audience what the reality was of their relationship, which was, I think, grounded in love.\"",
      "From 2010: Stiller & Meara on love and marriage (\"Sunday Morning\")",
      "It wasn't just old clips from long-ago shows that Stiller had access to. He stumbled into some unexpected help while cleaning out the family apartment to sell: Jerry Stiller had secretly taped everything, producing boxes and boxes of recordings. \"I had no idea that there were these sort of arguments and discussions that he had recorded,\" said Ben. \"All of it, I'd never heard before. It brought me back to being a kid in the house when they were working together.\"",
      "For a filmmaker trying to figure it all out, Ben Stiller had struck gold.",
      "Among the recordings was a conversation in which his father talks to his mother about her drinking, and confronts her about it.",
      "I asked, \"Was it important to you in terms of understanding your dad, that you could hear him do that?\"",
      "\"Yeah,\" said Ben. \"I was like, 'Oh, okay. He really did speak to her about it.' Because as kids that was never anything we talked about.\"",
      "\"You may be carrying around this sense of, why didn't dad ever confront mom? Guess what \u2013 he did.\"",
      "\"Right! He did,\" said Ben. \"And it changed.\"",
      "This deconstruction of his parents' marriage came while Stiller was wrestling with his own mid-life issues. Separated at the time from his wife, actress Christine Taylor (with whom he later reconciled), Stiller describes himself as having felt out of balance and unhappy, disconnected from his family, and a little bit lost.",
      "He talked about the irony of thinking he was doing so much better than his parents: \"When you're younger, you think, Okay, I'm gonna do everything better. I'm not gonna make THAT mistake. I found myself at a place in my life where things weren't really in sync.\"",
      "Stiller & Meara now had some company under the magnifying glass: their son. \"I didn't want to pretend to be some sort of objective judge of their relationship when I had so many issues in my own relationships and my stuff,\" he said,",
      "Was that a challenging journey to make himself? \"Yeah,\" he said. \"Then it changed everything because it was like, oh, okay. I'm gonna have to, you know, talk about my own feelings! It's stuff that I don't really ever, you know, talk about.\"",
      "Not exactly where he expected to end up, when he started the project. In honest, raw, and revealing conversations with his daughter Ella and son Quin, Ben talked in the film about his own issues being the child of someone famous: \"I remember there was this one time I literally was on the street talking to him about the fact that I felt like he didn't pay enough attention to us, and while we were talking someone on the street came over and said, 'Jerry, I love you work' and he started talking [to them]!\"",
      "Stiller exposes the excruciating challenge of breaking patterns, when his son adds: \"That's hilarious, because just a few weeks ago we were all out at a restaurant and I'd been stressed about college stuff. And then the people there wanted to get a picture of you, and I remember I was so frustrated, like, the world just has to stop to get this picture.\"",
      "Stiller said, \"I was genuinely surprised when he told me that. As a filmmaker I thought, This is an interesting moment in the movie.\"",
      "\"As a father?\" I asked.",
      "\"As a father I was like, Oh, s***,\" he laughed.",
      "Ben Stiller has done something requiring more courage than simply making an honest movie about loved ones; he's made an honest movie about himself.",
      "I said, \"One of the most uncomfortable places you can ever be is the mirror, right? Sometimes your kids are holding up the mirror.\"",
      "\"Yeah, you know, it's kind of like \u2026 it is a bummer, 'cause I'm never gonna get to go back, you know?\" Stiller said.",
      "And that's helped him round the edges from his own childhood \u2013 finding the grace to give his parents by understanding he might need to seek some of his own.",
      "Asked where he stands in his relationship to his parents, Stiller replied, \"I don't know!\"",
      "\"All this work, and you don't know?\"",
      "\"Well, I mean, they're still not here. That was the sad thing for me about finishing the movie. It was like, Oh, now I don't have an excuse to kind of just be connecting with them here.\"",
      "I asked, \"This was an intense reconnection when it sounds like you needed it the most?\"",
      "\"Yeah,\" said Stiller. \"Like my mom probably would have said, like, 'Yeah, go make a movie about it if you wanna figure out how to process your feelings!'\"",

    "summary": "The star of \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show,\" \"Clue\" and \"It\" has played roles campy, comical, and menacingly sinister, yet his most inscrutable role is still Tim Curry. He talks about his memoir \"Vagabond,\" the stroke he suffered in 2012, and learning how to speak again.",
    "story": [
      "A stroke 13 years ago left Tim Curry partially paralyzed, but it hasn't diminished his memorable laugh, or the mystique about him. In 50 years on the screen, he's played so many types \u2013 campy, comical, menacingly sinister \u2013 yet his most inscrutable role is still Tim Curry.",
      "And being an enigma is exactly how he wants it. \"I think it's important,\" he said. \"I encourage it.\"",
      "Though Curry is out with a new memoir, \"Vagabond\" (to be published Tuesday by Grand Central), he's keeping some secrets to himself. \"One of the keys is to not encourage an identity, I think, and I've tried to nurse that,\" he said. \"I have protected that, and continue to.\"",
      "Born a military brat in Hong Kong, Curry grew up moving from place to place. As a boy, he worshipped his dad, a chaplain in the British Royal Navy. The last time he saw his father, when he was 10, was when his dad had a stroke: \"And as they were about to take him into the ambulance, he said, 'Look after your mother.'\"",
      "After his father's death, there was no one to buffer the impact of his mother, who would be kind one minute, then cruel the next. \"I actually think now that she was probably bipolar, because she could turn on a dime,\" Curry said.",
      "Acting offered him an escape from his mother's moods \u2013 and access to so different many different lives. He said what excited him about acting was \"the freedom of being somebody else, and I think that I was (like everybody else) drawn to the idea of fame probably, although I came to kind of rather despise it.\"",
      "His first nibble of notoriety came from his first paid gig, in the 1969 London production of \"Hair.\" It was a big deal, but nothing in comparison to what came next: \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show,\" first on stage, then the movie. He joked that he got the part of Dr. Frank-N-Furter because of his legs. It was a transformative performance, for Curry, and the audience.",
      "Curry says what made the role unique was his power: \"He gave a lot of teenagers permission to be different, and I'm very happy that he did have that power.\"",
      "\"Rocky Horror\" earned Curry stardom. It did not earn praise, or even respect, from his mother. She lived well into her son's success, but \"she didn't make much of it,\" Curry said. \"She was scared of it.\"",
      "Why? \"Well, she said to me later that, 'I thought your head was gonna grow too big.' She would have preferred me to operate under the radar!\"",
      "He laughed: \"I never did. I didn't give a s*** about the radar!\"",
      "I asked, \"When Frank is committing his particularly most heinous act in 'The Rocky Horror Picture Show' [killing Eddie with an axe], was some of that directed at your mom maybe?\"",
      "\"It's not directed at her, it's just channeling,\" Curry replied.",
      "\"Rocky Horror\" set up Curry to play some memorable screen villains \u2013 under a mountain of prosthetics in \"Legend,\" opposite Tom Cruise; as Pennywise in the Stephen King thriller \"It\"; and as Carol Burnett's scheming and duplicitous brother in \"Annie.\" \"I loved her to bits,\" Curry said of Burnett.",
      "And don't forget the hotel concierge in \"Home Alone 2,\" and the manipulative butler in \"Clue.\"",
      "But then came 2012, and the moment that changed Tim Curry's life. \"It was so strange,\" he said. \"I was actually having a massage, and the guy who was giving me a massage said, 'I'm worried about you. I think we should call a doctor.' I felt fine. I had no symptoms that I was aware of. I wasn't in pain.\"",
      "But he was taken to the hospital, where he learned he'd had a stroke. \"I though immediately of my dad. So, I was scared,\" he said.",
      "He then underwent invasive brain surgery, and had rehabilitation to learn how to speak again. \"That was very weird,\" he said. \"I hated not being able to speak.\"",
      "He also has paralysis on his left side. \"My face kind of went sideways,\" he said.",
      "I asked, \"From reading the book, and from talking to the people here who care about you, there hasn't been a lot \u2013 I'm sure there was some self-pity, but it doesn't sound like there was a lot?\"",
      "\"I don't think so,\" Curry said. \"I hope not, because I don't admire self-pity much. Another legacy from my mother, I guess. It's one that I'm thankful for: Why are you so important that we have to pity you?\"",
      "Now 79, he's reached an age he didn't think he'd see back in 2012. Today, he's not remotely afraid of dying \u2013 though exactly what he means remains, fittingly, a mystery.",
      "\"I don't fear death,\" he said. \"I try to avoid it, as I think we all do! But I suspect that in the end, I will welcome it.\"",
      "And what does that mean? \"Well, I think it may be very comforting to go bye-bye \u2013 and I want to earn it!\" he laughed.",

      "Britain's Prince Andrew will not use his royal titles, including the Duke of York, any longer, he said in a statement released by Buckingham Palace on Friday. The announcement comes after the release of excerpts from a posthumous memoir by Jeffrey Epstein accuser Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who had repeatedly claimed to have been sexually trafficked by the late financier to Andrew.",
      "\"In discussion with The King, and my immediate and wider family, we have concluded the continued accusations about me distract from the work of His Majesty and the Royal Family,\" Andrew, the younger brother of King Charles III, said in the statement. \"I have decided, as I always have, to put my duty to my family and country first. I stand by my decision five years ago to stand back from public life.\"",
      "He continued: \"With His Majesty's agreement, we feel I must now go a step further. I will therefore no longer use my title or the honours which have been conferred upon me. As I have said previously, I vigorously deny the accusations against me.\"",
      "Giuffre, who died by suicide in April, sued Andrew in 2021, alleging that he forced her to engage in sexual acts against her will when she was 17 years old. The two reached an out-of-court settlement in 2022. Andrew has denied the allegations.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Guiffre's family said they believe Prince Andrew's decision to give up his royal titles is \"vindication for our sister and survivors everywhere.\" They called on Charles to strip him of the title of prince.",
      "\"This moment serves as victory for Virginia, who consistently maintained, 'He knows what happened, I know what happened, and there's only one of us telling the truth, and I know that's me,'\" the statement said. \"This is not just a victory for her, but for every single survivor of the horrific crimes perpetrated by Epstein and his co-conspirators.\"",
      "Giuffre was one of the most vocal accusers of Epstein, a convicted sex offender, and Ghislaine Maxwell, who was found guilty of helping Epstein groom, recruit and sexually abuse underage girls. Giuffre alleged Maxwell connected her with Epstein, which Maxwell denies.",
      "In an excerpt of her memoir published by The Guardian, Giuffre describes her alleged encounters with Andrew in detail.",
      "\"He was friendly enough, but still entitled \u2014 as if he believed having sex with me was his birthright,\" she wrote. \"The next morning, Maxwell told me: 'You did well. The prince had fun.' Epstein would give me $15,000 for servicing the man the tabloids called 'Randy Andy.'\"",
      "Andrew, once second in line to the British throne, has long been a source of tabloid fodder because of his links to Epstein, other questionable characters and money woes.",
      "His attempt to refute Giuffre's allegations backfired during a November 2019 BBC interview. Viewers saw a prince who proffered curious rebuttals \u2014 such as disputing Giuffre's recollection of sweaty dancing by saying he was medically incapable of perspiring \u2014 and showed no empathy for the women who said Epstein abused them.",
      "Within days of the interview, Andrew stepped down from his royal duties.",
      "As well as no longer being known as the Duke of York, Andrew will also give up other titles: Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order and Royal Knight Companion of the Most Noble Order of the Garter.",
      "He will remain a prince, which he has been entitled to since birth."

      "He said attention to detail was \"really critical to the authentic presentation that we're able to make here.\"",
      "That meant shipping 11 tons of clay from Japan to construct the ring, or dohyo, in the center of the concert venue, where the wrestlers compete. Shipping containers were at sea for three months making the voyage. A big team of ring attendants (yobidashi), also had to make the trip from Japan\u00a0\u2014\u00a0alongside 11 interpreters to help them communicate with British workers.",
      "The roof for the dohyo, now suspended from the Albert Hall ceiling, was built in Britain, but its design is taken straight from traditional Japanese Shinto shrines, which, according to Todd, \"helps to show that this is a sacred area,\" in which routines and holy ceremonies are conducted as part of the tournament.",
      "It's a vital step, he said, to ensure the Shinto gods are paid their due respects before the fights.",
      "Female sumo wrestlers fight for visibility in Japan's male-dominated sport",
      "Female sumo wrestlers fight for visibility in Japan's male-dominated sport",
      "Sumo is deeply intertwined with Japanese culture and religion in ways that many Western sports fans may find difficult to comprehend. According to legend, it originated as a ritual to ask the gods for a bountiful harvest, but it transformed over almost 2,000 years into the sport it is today, drawing competitors still primarily from Japan, but also from around the world.",
      "Many of the most recent champions have been from Mongolia, and this year's tournament features two rikishi from Ukraine. While Americans have competed successfully in past tournaments, there are no U.S. rikishi competing in this year's event in London.",
      "The nuance of the wrestling competition itself can also be difficult to fully grasp, with 82 winning techniques called kimarite, numerous ranks and divisions and a host of other rules. So to help translate all this for a largely Western audience, in-ear English language commentary is provided at the Royal Albert Hall, alongside video replay screens to describe and explain the bouts, which can sometimes end in just seconds when a competitor is forced out of the ring.",
      "The wrestlers themselves live an incredibly regimented life. They are forbidden from driving cars and, somewhat counterintuitively, eating breakfast, and are normally required to take a long nap after their hefty lunch, to help them pack on the pounds.",
      "The average weight of a rikishi is about 330 pounds, but some tip the scales at 550.",
      "They have been given some leave during their visit to the British capital to enjoy themselves, however\u00a0\u2014\u00a0with organizers likely seeing the value in some degree of publicity.",
      "During the lead-up to the tournament, social media platforms were full of photos and videos of the traditionally kimono-clad wrestlers sightseeing around London.",
      "The Albert Hall will also be graced this week by the presence of two yokozuna, the highest ranking of all sumo wrestlers. The word yokozuna is generally translated as grand champion, but it translates literally to \"horizontal rope,\" in a reference to the special rope worn around their waists to display their rank.",
      "Once a rikishi is promoted to the rank of yokozuna, they keep it until retirement. In nearly 400 years of professional sumo, only 75 men have attained the vaunted grand champion status. The honor typically requires not only multiple consecutive championship wins, but approval by a dedicated council that judges rikishi on their wrestling skills, but also a range of other personal attributes.",
      "The tournament is due to end on Sunday, when the wrestler with the most victories in the ring will be crowned this year's champion.",
      "The field is considered wide open this year, but many, especially back at home in Japan, will be hoping for 25-year-old Yokozuna Onosato, the country's first grand champion in almost a decade, to emerge victorious."

      "Frehley died peacefully surrounded by family in Morristown, New Jersey, following a recent fall at his home, his agent said.",
      "Family members said in a statement\u00a0that they are \"completely devastated and heartbroken.\"",
      "\"In his last moments, we were fortunate enough to have been able to surround him with loving, caring, peaceful words, thoughts, prayers and intentions as he left this earth,\" Frehley's family said. \"We cherish all of his finest memories, his laughter, and celebrate his strengths and kindness that he bestowed upon others. The magnitude of his passing is of epic proportions, and beyond comprehension. Reflecting on all of his incredible life achievements, Ace's memory will continue to live on forever!\"",
      "Frehley's former Kiss bandmates, Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons, said in a statement they were \"devastated\" by Frehley's passing.",
      "\"He was an essential and irreplaceable rock soldier during some of the most formative foundational chapters of the band and its history,\" the two said. \"He is and will always be a part of KISS's legacy. Our thoughts are with Jeanette, Monique and all those who loved him, including our fans around the world.\"",
      "Frehley is the first death among the four founding members.",
      "Frehley was recovering from a \"minor fall\" that forced him to cancel a scheduled performance in late September, his tour manager, John Ostrosky, also known as John Ostronomy, said in a\u00a0Facebook post\u00a0last month addressed to fans. Doctors advised Frehley not to travel following his fall, Ostrosky said.",
      "Born in 1951 in the Bronx, Frehley grew up surrounded by music and received his first electric guitar as a Christmas present in 1964. Before joining Kiss, he played in local bands around New York City and was a roadie for Jimi Hendrix at age 18.",
      "Frehley co-founded Kiss in 1973 alongside Stanley, Simmons and Peter Criss. He played on many of Kiss' classic albums, including \"Destroyer,\" \"Rock and Roll Over\" and \"Love Gun.\" Today, Kiss has more gold albums than any other American band and has sold more than 100 million records worldwide.",
      "Kiss, whose hits include \"Rock and Roll All Nite\" and \"Detroit Rock City,\" was known for its intense stage shows, which included fireworks, smoke and eruptions of fake blood performed by band members in black-and-white painted faces, platform boots and black wigs.",
      "Band members took on the personas of comic book-style characters \u2014 Frehley was known as \"Space Ace\" and the \"Spaceman.\" The New York-born entertainer often experimented with pyrotechnics, making his guitars glow, emit smoke and shoot rockets from the headstock.",
      "The band was extremely popular, especially in the mid-1970s, selling tens of millions of albums and licensing its iconic look to sell numerous products. \"Beth\" was its biggest commercial hit in the U.S., peaking at No. 7 on the Billboard Top 100 in 1976.",
      "Frehley later released his first solo album, \"Ace Frehley,\" in 1978, and his song \"New York Groove\" quickly became a hit. Frehley frequently feuded with Stanley and Simmons through the years and left Kiss in 1982 to form the band Frehley's Comet and later continued recording under his own name.",
      "In 1996, Frehley rejoined Kiss for their 1996 reunion tour but left again in the early 2000s. The band continued with replacement members wearing the Frehley and Criss makeup and costumes. Kiss performed a\u00a0farewell tour in 2023.",
      "When the original four entered the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2014, a dispute scrapped plans for them to perform. Simmons and Stanley objected to Criss and Frehley being inducted instead of then-guitarist Tommy Thayer and then-drummer Eric Singer.",
      "Simmons told Rolling Stone magazine that year that Frehley and Criss \"no longer deserve to wear the paint.\" \"The makeup is earned,\" he added. \"Just being there at the beginning is not enough.\"",
      "Frehley and Kiss also had a huge influence on the glammy style of 1980s so-called hair metal bands, including M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce and Poison.",
      "\"Ace, my brother, I surely cannot thank you enough for the years of great music, the many festivals we've done together and your lead guitar on Nothing But A Good Time,\" Poison front man\u00a0Bret Michaels\u00a0wrote Thursday on Instagram.",
      "As the Kennedy Center's new chair, President Trump named Kiss as one of this year's honorees.",

    "story": [
      "Jeremy Allen White becomes \"The Boss\" in a new film, channeling Bruce Springsteen's raw vulnerability during one of the most introspective chapters of his life.",
      "The Emmy Award-winning star of \"The Bear\" plays the lead role in \"Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere,\" out Oct. 24. The biopic strips away the stadium rock legend to reveal a deeply human artist.",
      "\"I don't remember a time I didn't know the name Bruce Springsteen,\" White said.",
      "White had no experience singing or playing guitar before taking on the role, but that didn't stop director Scott Cooper \u2014 or Bruce Springsteen himself \u2014 from believing in him.",
      "After a call with Cooper, where White learned that Springsteen personally wanted him for the part, White said he felt an immediate sense of confidence. Knowing that Springsteen had seen his work and believed in his ability, he decided to take a leap of faith and fully commit to the transformation.",
      "Preparing for the role meant months of intense training, from vocal work to learning guitar. White said he found unexpected confidence through the music itself.",
      "\"I sang his songs over and over and over again,\" he said.",
      "Springsteen served as an important resource throughout the project. White said their conversations went beyond the film itself, touching on personal experiences and emotional challenges. During one discussion, Springsteen shared a story about a road trip and a moment at a county fair when he suffered a panic attack. He described feeling detached, as if he were merely observing his own life, a realization that deeply resonated with White, who had faced similar feelings himself.",
      "Through those exchanges, Springsteen encouraged White to bring his own emotions and perspective to the role, allowing him to fully inhabit the character with authenticity and vulnerability.",
      "One of the most meaningful exchanges came when Springsteen gave White something invaluable: freedom.",
      "\"One of the most beautiful things he did was really give me permission to bring myself to it,\" White said.",
      "Capturing the humanity behind \"The Boss\"",
      "Cooper shaped the story around the creation of Springsteen's \"Nebraska\" album, a period the musician described as one of the darkest in his life. The film explores his battles with depression and his complicated relationship with his father, who suffered from schizophrenia.",
      "Springsteen remained closely involved in the production, visiting the set several times but allowing the filmmakers full creative space. Cooper said his presence was supportive rather than intrusive and said that Springsteen made it clear he would step back if needed. White recalled being aware that Springsteen was on set but said it never broke his focus.",
      "Springsteen later praised White for his performance, calling it \"a deeply intuitive, psychological portrait\" of his younger self, a compliment that left the actor stunned.",
      "\"I still can't believe, you know, I don't know. I still can't believe we got started. I can't believe he gave our blessing in the first place,\" White said.",
      "Premiering at the Telluride Film Festival, the film earned praise from psychologists for its emotional depth and its potential to spark conversations about mental health, especially among men.",
      "Cooper described it as more than just a biopic, saying his hope is that audiences see it as a call for compassion and connection.",
      "\"I suppose if there's anything that I want this film for people to take away from the film, it's if you're struggling, if you're despairing and if you don't know how to get help, can't afford help, ask,\" Cooper said."

    "story": [
      "Open enrollment \u2014 the annual window when employees can adjust their benefits \u2014 may deliver sticker shock this year. Workers are likely to pay between 6% to 7% more for their 2026 employer-sponsored health insurance, more than double the current rate of inflation, according to a new\u00a0analysis\u00a0from consultant Mercer.",
      "That means employees could pay about $2,400 next year for single coverage in an employer-provided preferred provider organization, or PPO, the most common type of medical plan, Mercer said. Families would likely face paycheck deductions of $8,900 a year for their coverage, according to the group, whose projections are based on a survey of more than 1,700 employers.",
      "More working-age Americans receive health insurance through their employers than any other source, with about 60% \u2014 or 164.7 million people \u2014 covered by their workplaces, according to KFF.",
      "Companies, which typically pick up the bulk of their employees' health insurance costs, are likely to spend more than $18,000 on average to insure each worker in 2026, Mercer told CBS News. Workers typically shoulder between 16% to 25% of the total, depending on whether they are receiving single or family coverage, according to KFF's\u00a02024 employer health benefits survey.",
      "The findings come as American households continue to feel squeezed by rising prices, with inflation inching higher this year on everything from groceries to housing. The jump in health insurance costs are partly due to an aging workforce that's tapping more medical services, as well as increased demand for costly treatments such as the GLP-1 drugs used for weight loss, Mercer Chief Actuary Sunit Patel said.",
      "Employees \"might also see an increase in the cost-sharing provisions in the design as well \u2014 higher co-pays, higher deductibles \u2014 so it's getting hit on both ends,\" Beth Umland, director of research for health and benefits at Mercer, told CBS News.",
      "Employees who receive their health insurance through their employers will soon learn their new costs when open enrollment begins, which typically runs for several weeks in the fall but varies by company.",
      "Health care prices aren't likely to ease soon, Patel added, pointing to higher provider wages, inflation in medical goods, and an older workforce, as ongoing pressures. \"We think costs are pretty sticky right now,\" he said.",

      "Americans pay double what residents in other developed nations pay for health care, even though outcomes in the U.S. are worse than those in other countries, the Peter G. Peterson Foundation noted in an August\u00a0analysis.",
      "In addition to an aging workforce and inflation, the complexity of the U.S. health care system is also driving those costs higher, noted Peterson. On top of that, growing consolidation amongst health insurers has made the market less competitive, resulting in higher costs, the U.S. Government Accountability Office said in a\u00a0December report.",
      "Higher health care costs could add to the financial squeeze felt by many families, who are already coping with higher grocery, utility and housing prices, noted Lindsay Owens, executive director of the Groundwork Collaborative, a liberal-leaning economic think tank.",
      "A KFF poll in July found that 4 in 10 insured adults under 65 years old worry about affording their monthly health insurance.",
      "\"You can't really go without health care, so something else will have to give,\" Owens said. That could mean cutting \"a family vacation, a family trip to a soccer game, or putting groceries on the credit card so you can clear the health care premiums.\"",
      "The Consumer Price Index, a basket of goods and services typically purchased by Americans, likely rose 3.1% on an annual basis in September, an uptick from August's 2.9% annual rate, according to economists polled by FactSet. The September inflation data will be released on Oct. 24."

      "How much protein is really needed in a diet?",
      "For growing children and adolescents, protein provides the building blocks for muscle, bones, skin and hormones. Getting enough protein is also essential for older adults. It can help preserve strength, maintain bone density and reduce the risk of age-related injury.",
      "Government guidelines suggest most adults aim for about 0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight. For example, someone who weighs 150 lbs would need about 54 grams of protein \u2014 this is what's in about 6 ounces of cooked chicken breast, Byrne said.",
      "\"We want to look for high quality sources,\" Ansari said. \"So those are generally speaking animal protein. Now another way to do this is by combining beans and grains and making it a full meal.\"",
      "Byrne said you can calculate your estimated protein needs by consuming 0.36 grams of protein per pound of bodyweight.",
      "\"That calculation is an oversimplification, and many people need more protein than this. But the idea that you need to slam a protein shake before and after every workout just to meet your needs and reach your goals is totally wrong,\" she said.",

      "The scientist worked at the CDC for the past decade, studying chronic diseases like diabetes and heart disease.",
      "She spoke out the same day a federal judge in Northern California issued a verbal order temporarily halting all the government layoffs that were issued since the shutdown began. This was in response to a lawsuit brought by federal employees' unions.",
      "\"They went in and fired entire programs, even statutorily mandated by law programs, they cut entirely,\" she said. \"So there is no staff to do this work anymore.\"",
      "She said everything she was working on has come to a complete stop.",
      "\"It's truly like an episode of 'Squid Games,' because we don't know what's going to happen next,\" she said.",
      "The Trump administration has used the government shutdown, now in its third week, to lay off more than 4,000 federal workers, and plans to go further, according to Russell Vought, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget.",
      "\"I think we'll probably end up being north of 10,000,\" Vought said Wednesday during an appearance on \"The Charlie Kirk Show.\"",
      "Since last week, the Trump administration has informed approximately 600 CDC employees they have been laid off.",
      "On Tuesday, internal CDC officials not authorized to speak to the media told CBS News that on Oct. 10, about 1,000 CDC employees were initially given reduction-in-force notices, a government term for layoffs.",
      "However, within about 24 hours, hundreds of those notices were rescinded, reducing the total number of layoffs in the agency since Oct. 10 to about 600, the officials said.",
      "The judge's ruling Wednesday would put the layoffs of those 600 employees on hold, leaving them in limbo while the case plays out.",
      "According to numbers provided by a congressional source familiar with the cuts, the 600 CDC layoffs impacted all staff in the CDC's offices in Washington, D.C., all staff for the office of the director for the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, all staff for the National Center for State, Tribal, Local, and Territorial Public Health Infrastructure and Workforce, and all policy and communications staff for the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control.",
      "The CDC agencies that saw their layoffs rescinded, according to the source, were the Immunization and Respiratory Diseases Center, the Global Health Center, the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report team, the Epidemic Intelligence Service, and scientists working on responses to outbreaks of measles in the U.S. and Ebola in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.",
      "So far this year, the CDC has lost about 3,000 employees to resignations and layoffs, or just under a quarter of its staff, according to AFGE Local 2883, the union that represents CDC employees. That number was confirmed by the CDC officials who spoke to CBS News.",
      "The CDC has been beset by changes since Robert F. Kennedy Jr. took the reins of the Department of Health and Human Services earlier this year. A vaccine skeptic, Kennedy controversially replaced all 17 members of the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices, a panel that makes vaccine recommendations.",
      "And in August, less than a month after being confirmed by the Senate as CDC director, Susan Monarez was fired from her post over what she said was pressure from Kennedy to rubber-stamp his vaccine directives, later testifying before the Senate that Kennedy's demands were \"inconsistent with my oath of office and the ethics required of a public official.\" Her firing also prompted several top CDC officials to resign in protest.",
      "Kennedy, in his own Senate testimony last month, denied that he pressured Monarez to preapprove vaccination recommendations. He told senators that when he asked Monarez if she was \"a trustworthy person,\" she responded, \"no.\"",
      "The congressional source also confirmed that among the permanent layoffs in HHS last week were 41 people in the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response, an agency under the U.S. Public Health Service whose staff works in biodefense, as well as monitors data on natural disasters, infectious disease outbreaks and cyberattacks on hospitals.",
      "An HHS spokesperson told CBS News on Wednesday that the department's layoffs are part of an effort to cut a \"bloated bureaucracy,\" and that the positions were deemed \"non-essential by their respective divisions.\"",
      "\"HHS continues to close wasteful and duplicative entities, including those that are at odds with the Trump administration's Make America Healthy Again agenda,\" the spokesperson said in a statement.",
      "But the scientist who spoke to CBS News said the turmoil inside the CDC will impact responses to disease outbreaks, like the measles outbreak in South Carolina, where five new cases were reported Tuesday, bringing the total to 16 since July, and forcing 139 students into quarantine, according to health officials.",
      "\"The surge capacity of the CDC is going to be significantly hampered with these cuts,\" the scientist told CBS News. \"It's going to impede our ability to respond to public health outbreaks, just when all of these threats are on the rise.\""

    "published": "Tue, 21 Oct 2025 16:17:10 -0400",
    "summary": "Experts say the incident revealed what can happen when a such a broad spectrum of companies rely on singular cloud provider.",
    "story": [
      "The 15-hour\u00a0disruption to Amazon Web Services, a cloud-based computing service, on Monday shook internet users around the world, disrupting everything from travel to financial transactions \u2014 and underscoring the fragility of a system reliant on only a handful of tech giants.",
      "Monday's problems at Amazon Web Services, or AWS, spawned 11 million total outage reports, with 3 million reports stemming from U.S. users, Downdetector, a website that tracks online outages,\u00a0said\u00a0on Facebook.",
      "While other cloud providers support the world's businesses \u2014 including Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Microsoft Azure \u2014 AWS has the largest foothold in the market. Since it debuted in 2006, the company has grown to control 38% of the cloud computing infrastructure market,\u00a0according to research and advisory firm Gartner.",
      "Experts say Monday's outage reveals the vulnerabilities of a system where a small number of companies provide such a large chunk of the internet's backbone.",
      "\"[The] outage is a stark reminder of the massive 'concentration risk' the global economy has accepted by building on a handful of cloud providers,\" Dave McCarthy, who leads global research for cloud services at the International Data Corporation, told CBS News.",
      "AWS' rolodex of customers include government departments, universities and businesses, and platforms such as Venmo, Netflix and Snapchat.",
      "\"Frankly, many customers may have been unaware that a service they used relied upon AWS and are only learning that now, due to system failures,\" said Craig Shue, a professor and the head of the computer science department at Worcester Polytechnic Institute.",
      "As Shue explained, companies that are not technology-centric may seek out a cloud service like AWS to host their web servers and databases, allowing them to focus on their day-to-day operations. Amazon, meanwhile,\u00a0 handles the more technical aspects such as server maintenance and responses to fluctuations in customer demand, he added.",
      "Amazon declined to comment directly on the incident, instead sharing a statement from their\u00a0website\u00a0published on Oct. 20.",
      "How the AWS outage started",
      "The outage started Monday morning in Northern Virginia, home to AWS' oldest and biggest cloud computing hub in the U.S. AWS refers to the cluster of data centers in Virginia as US-EAST-1. The company also has cloud computing hubs in California, Ohio and Oregon.",
      "According to expert accounts and Amazon's own\u00a0explanation, the issue was partially tied to AWS' domain name system (DNS), which is called DynamoDB. As Shue explained, this is the part of the internet that takes domain names like Amazon.com and converts them to IP addresses, numerical labels that identify locations on the internet.",
      "The service can be used to distribute traffic to multiple servers to make things faster, Shue said.",
      "\"It is akin to waiting in a checkout line that then splits off to multiple cashier lanes,\" Shue explained. \"A staff member can direct the customer at the front of the line to the first available server that can handle the job.\"",
      "This function was disrupted on Monday, leading to a backlog of server requests without anything to route them. It's still unclear how the disruption began, experts said.",
      "For people on the ground, this meant they were unable to carry out simple web-based functions like checking their flight time on an airline app or sending a payment on Venmo.",
      "While the issue started in the eastern U.S. region, its effects were global. Experts say it's difficult to quantify the impact in dollar figures. McCarthy, however, noted that it appears to be one of the most significant outages in recent years.",
      "Amazon said that the issue was resolved around 6 p.m. EDT on Monday, or more than 15 hours after the company first reported a problem on the AWS Health Dashboard, where it tracks service disruptions.",
      "\"This wasn't a minor glitch; it was a cascading failure originating in US-EAST-1, the very nerve center of AWS, which took down everything from gaming and social media to critical financial and educational platforms,\" he said.",
      "Will the outage impact AWS?",
      "While the incident may have sparked a small reckoning with cloud services, it's not expected to shake up the landscape too much, experts told CBS News.",
      "McCarthy doesn't expect the outage to lead to a mass exodus of AWS customers, but he said it could compel companies to diversify their cloud services so they're not reliant on a single provider. That way if one goes down, the company can still keep some operations going."

    "published": "Tue, 21 Oct 2025 16:12:32 -0400",
    "summary": "Financial pros recommend waiting as long as possible to claim your Social Security benefits. Most Americans say they're ignoring that advice.",
    "story": [
      "Nine in 10 working Americans say they plan to ignore one of the most common pieces of financial advice about Social Security: waiting until age 70 to claim benefits, which ensures higher monthly payments, according to a new study from investment firm Schroders.",
      "Social Security allows employees to claim their benefits as soon as they turn 62, years before the so-called \"full retirement age,\" which now stands at 67. But claiming Social Security early has a tradeoff\u2014it lowers your monthly payment by about 30%, with those lower benefits locked in for the rest of your life.",
      "By contrast, delaying claiming Social Security until age 70 means you'll get a more than 30% boost in your monthly checks \u2014 also locked in as long you're collecting benefits. As a result, financial experts often recommend that seniors hold off as long as they can, with one study finding that filing early for benefits can cost $182,000 in foregone payments.",
      "The Schroders survey\u00a0suggests that many Americans who haven't yet retired aren't buying that advice. In the survey of 1,500 adults, most respondents said they understand the trade-offs of claiming early, but only 10% plan to wait until age 70, while 44% expect to file for benefits before they reach full retirement age.",
      "\"Not an oversight\"",
      "The disconnect illustrates the financial reality facing most workers, Deb Boyden, head of U.S. defined contribution at Schroders, told CBS News.",
      "\"The decision to sacrifice extra Social Security income is not an oversight for most Americans,\" she said. \"According to our research, 70% of Americans are aware that waiting longer to claim Social Security leads to higher payments, and yet so few are willing to hold off.\"",
      "Many retirees are facing a shortfall in their own retirement savings, a financial gap that's been well documented as a growing share of Americans live paycheck to paycheck. Many workers \"need the income generated by Social Security to meet their expenses immediately upon retiring,\" Boyden noted.",
      "Another new study, released Tuesday by the Allianz Center for the Future of Retirement, finds that a majority of Americans say they don't know much about Social Security or how it will fit into their retirement plan. And about 1 in 5 believe Social Security will provide all the retirement income they need, even though it generally replaces only 40% of a worker's wages when they retire, the study found.",
      "There's another reason why many Americans plan on claiming their Social Security benefits before reaching full retirement age, she added. That's due to concerns about the future of Social Security, which is fueling concerns that \"the money may not be there if they wait,\" Boyden said.",
      "Social Security is indeed facing a financial crunch, with an aging U.S. population resulting in its payments now outpacing contributions from workers. Without changes to the program, that will result in its trust funds becoming insolvent by 2034, according to the most recent calculation from the Social Security Board of Trustees.",
      "Yet many people wrongly believe that means Social Security will halt payments if the trust funds become insolvent. Payments would continue in such an event, but benefits would be reduced by about 20% \u2014 a potentially major financial hit to the program's more than 70 million beneficiaries.",
      "Still, there are ways lawmakers can shore up the program, such as by raising the income cap on Social Security taxes, which stands at $176,100, according to experts. Earnings over that amount are exempt from the payroll tax, which funds Social Security.",
      "In the meantime, non-retired Americans told Schroders they believe they need $5,032 in monthly income to retire comfortably. But today's retirees on average generate about $3,250 in monthly retirement income, Boyden said, adding that the gap signals the need to help workers plan better for retirement.",
      "A recent analysis from Goldman Sachs found three-quarters of younger working Americans say they're struggling to save for retirement because basic expenses such as housing are eating up a bigger share of their income compared with prior generations."

      "In the company's launch\u00a0video, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman described Atlas as an AI-powered web browser built around ChatGPT that will allow people to converse with web pages. In a video presentation, he also expressed confidence that a chatbot interface will eventually supplant a traditional browser's URL bar.",
      "\"Tabs were great, but we haven't seen a lot of browser innovation since then,\" he said.",
      "What the Atlas browser can do",

      "But a few features set the browser apart, according to OpenAI. One is a ChatGPT side bar, which users can activate by clicking an \"Ask ChatGPT\" button in the upper right-hand corner of the browser.",
      "\"It's basically you inviting ChatGPT into your corner of the internet,\" said Ryan O'Rouke, the lead designer for Atlas, in OpenAI's video unveiling the browser.",
      "The technology functions like ChatGPT but takes into account what web page people are on. In practice, that means users can ask questions about whatever content they are looking at. Users can also call on the ChatGPT function while drafting emails. In the demo, O'Rouke shows how he uses it to ask for edits on an email.",
      "\"It's using the internet for you,\" Altman said.",
      "Atlas also has an \"agent mode\" that can take action on a person's behalf, armed with what it has learned from users' browsing history and what they are searching for. The agent also can help people complete a range of tasks, such as booking a flight, editing a document or ordering groceries. For now, agent mode is only available for plus and pro users, according to Altman.",
      "OpenAI has said ChatGPT has more than 800 million users, although the San Francisco-based company has yet to turn a profit. Google's Chrome browser has roughly 3 billion worldwide users and has been adding some AI features drawing on the company's Gemini AI technology."

    "summary": "Economists say the Trump administration's sweeping tariffs on imports are boosting consumer prices in the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "Trump administration tariffs imposed this year on dozens of nations and a range of industries are fueling inflation, especially for goods that are widely imported into the U.S., a recent\u00a0analysis\u00a0shows.",
      "Product categories seeing some of the biggest price hikes due to tariffs include\u00a0furniture, car parts, electronics and musical instruments, according to economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The findings are based on research models estimating tariff-related price hikes and drawing on Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) data, a widely used gauge of inflation.",
      "Importers bear the cost of tariffs, typically passing at least some of the added expenses to consumers, economic research shows.",
      "The St. Louis Fed researchers found that companies passed 35% of tariff costs onto consumers from May through July. Other research from Goldman Sachs suggests that businesses could eventually pass on as much as 55% of added tariff costs to consumers. Companies would swallow 22% of the extra costs, while foreign exporters would absorb 18% of the expenses, economists with the investment bank found.",
      "How much could inflation rise?",
      "Businesses are expected to continue experimenting with pricing based on how tariffs affect their own costs, according to Max Dvorkin, an economist and one of the authors the St. Louis Fed study.",
      "\"Even if you don't change tariffs anymore, the dynamics of prices will continue to evolve and affect consumers over the next few months,\" he said.",
      "The regional Fed bank found that tariffs account for a sizable share of recent inflation. Between June through August, the tariffs imposed by President Trump added 0.5 percentage points to the headline PCE rate, which averaged 2.85% during that period, according to the findings. The levies added 0.4 percentage points to core PCE, which excludes volatile energy and food prices and which hovered around 2.9% during that three-month period, the study found.",
      "\"Tariff measures are already exerting measurable upward pressure on consumer prices,\" the economists conclude.",
      "As of August, the Consumer Price Index was up 2.9% from a year ago after, remaining above the Federal Reserve's 2% annual target. Inflation as measured by the index had fallen in April to a low of 2.3%, but has flared during the second half of the year. The Labor Department is expected to release CPI data for September, which has been delayed by the government shutdown, on Friday.",
      "The St. Louis Fed study notes that tariffs haven't driven up consumer prices as sharply as some experts had predicted. That's chiefly because many businesses are waiting to see where tariff rates settle before they adjust their prices, according to the research.",
      "\"We believe the passthrough of tariff increases by U.S. businesses to consumers remains in the early stages, delayed by stop-and-go announcements, pauses and drawn-out implementation,\" anaysts with the Wells Fargo Investment Institute said in a report on Tuesday.",
      "The White House did not respond to CBS News' request for comment. President Trump has defended his administration's trade policy, saying that it will benefit the country's manufacturing sector and boost job growth over the long-term.",
      "Mr. Trump's wide-ranging tariffs will cost businesses in the U.S. an additional $1.2 trillion this year, with consumers shouldering most of those costs, according to S&P Global\u00a0analysts\u00a0who reviewed data from 9,000 companies.",
      "Companies have passed on roughly two-thirds of those tariff costs \u2014 $592 billion \u2014 to consumers in the form of higher prices, S&P said. The levies have reduced corporate earnings by a total of $315 billion."

      "A quality job is defined by five indicators, the researchers said:",
      "Financial well-being, such as fair pay and stable employmentWorkplace culture and safety, meaning the worker is free from discrimination or harassmentGrowth and development opportunities, allowing a worker to build skills and advance their careerAgency and voice, or the ability to influence decisions that impact one's jobWork structure and agency, including a stable, predictable schedule and a manageable workload",

      "Agency and voice, or the ability to influence decisions that impact one's job",
      "Work structure and agency, including a stable, predictable schedule and a manageable workload",
      "By those measures, only 40% of the more than 18,000 workers surveyed by the group said they are employed in quality jobs, while the remaining 60% said their employment is falling short of those standards. For example, 62% of employees said they have unpredictable work schedules, while about one-third said they are struggling financially.",
      "\"We recognize that not only has the way we measure the economy not kept up with way work and the economy is changing, but it has never been sufficient in terms of letting us understand what's going on under hood of economy and across workforce, which is the engine of economic prosperity in the U.S.,\" said Molly Blankenship, director at Jobs for the Future.",
      "The group surveyed workers across industries and types of positions, in partnership with Gallup, the Families & Workers Fund, and the W.E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research.",
      "\"We suspected when we started this work that the majority of Americans were not in jobs that were helping them,\" Blankenship added. \"This date confirms what we suspected, which is that the majority of American workers are not in quality jobs.\"",
      "Dimensions of a quality job",
      "Pay is among a job's most important features because fair wages, stable employment and benefits can help an employee's sense of financial well-being, according to the study. But only 27% of those surveyed said they are financially comfortable, while nearly 3 in 10 described themselves as \"just getting by\" or \"finding it difficult to get by.\"",
      "But a job's pay alone doesn't indicate its overall quality. Workers also want to feel safe and respected in their jobs, the study noted.",
      "Providing a harassment-free workplace isn't just for workers' benefit: Research from consulting firm McKinsey & Co. shows that a firm's psychological safety and equitable treatment of workers can improve productivity and benefit business performance.",
      "Opportunities to grow and develop are another pillar of a quality job, yet one in four employees say they have no opportunities for promotion or advancement at work.",
      "Having agency and input into one's working conditions can help determine a worker's job satisfaction, according to the study's authors. But employees report gaps in their influence over key job attributes, with 70% of workers saying they should have more say over their compensation and benefits.",
      "Another 55% say their employers have too much say in how firms use new technology, like AI.",
      "\"There is tremendous concern over technology, how it's being adopted and how it will impact people's jobs in the future,\" Susan Houseman, a senior economist at the Upjohn Institute for Employment Research, who worked on the report, told CBS News. \"The research indicates that they lack input on these issues.\"",
      "The final determinant of job quality \u2014 the degree of autonomy a position offers workers \u2014 can shape an employee's daily routine and overall work-life balance. More than six in 10 employees said they lack control over their schedules, while more than half of workers said they often or sometimes work more than scheduled.",
      "Who works in quality jobs?",
      "Men are more likely than women to report holding high-quality jobs, the survey shows.",
      "The youngest employees, between the ages of 18 and 24, are the least likely to hold quality jobs. Race and ethnicity plays a part too, with Asian and White employees more likely than Black, multiracial, Hispanic or Middle Eastern/North African workers to hold high quality jobs, it found.",
      "Broken down by industry, more workers in professional services, financial activities and wholesale trade report holding high-quality jobs, while fewer workers in leisure and hospitality, retail, and warehousing say as much.",
      "Employees who have attained a bachelor's degree are also more likely to have quality jobs than those with less education, the report found."

      "\"The wrongdoers who took these gems won't earn 88 million euros if they had the very bad idea of disassembling these jewels,\" she said in an interview with broadcaster RTL. \"We can perhaps hope that they'll think about this and won't destroy these jewels without rhyme or reason.\"",
      "Questions have arisen about security at the Louvre, the world's most-visited museum, and whether security cameras might have failed as the thieves rode a basket lift up the Louvre's facade, cut their way through a window, smashed display cases and fled with priceless Napoleonic jewels on Sunday morning.",
      "But France's culture minister said Tuesday that the security apparatus installed at the Louvre worked properly during the theft.",
      "\"The Louvre museum's security apparatus did not fail, that is a fact,\" the minister, Rachida Dati, told lawmakers in the National Assembly. \"The Louvre museum's security apparatus worked.\"",
      "Dati said she launched an administrative inquiry that comes in addition to a police investigation to ensure full transparency into what happened. She did not offer any details about how the thieves managed to carry out their heist given that the cameras were working. But she described it as a painful blow for the nation.",
      "The robbery was \"a wound for all of us,\" she said. \"Why? Because the Louvre is far more than the world's largest museum. It's a showcase for our French culture and our shared patrimony.\"",
      "Interior Minister Laurent Nu\u00f1ez said Monday that the museum's alarm was triggered when the window of the Apollo Gallery was broken into.",
      "Police officers arrived on site two or three minutes after they were called by an individual that witnessed the scene, he said on LCI television. Officials said the heist lasted less than eight minutes in total, including less than four minutes inside the Louvre.",

      "\"We will catch them,\" he said of the thieves. But he added: \"I don't think we will capture the jewels.\"",

      "The jewels were not privately insured, the French Ministry of Culture said in a statement to the daily newspaper Le Parisien. French law prohibits entities like the Louvre from insuring its property, except when part of a collection is moved or loaned to another institution, Romain D\u00e9chelette, president of France-based Serex Assurances, a fine art insurer, told CBS News."

    "story": [
      "Although a short U.S. government shutdown would be unlikely to have much impact on air travel, a prolonged impasse could lead to disruptions for passengers and financial losses for businesses, according to travel experts and industry groups.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration and Transportation Security Administration define most of their employees as essential, requiring them to work even if the government closes and workers at other federal agencies are furloughed. That means airport screeners, air traffic controllers, federal air marshals, safety inspectors and other workers with the two agencies are expected to continue showing up on the job \u2014 without pay \u2014 even as lawmakers failed this week to strike a deal on federal funding.",
      "But things could get messy if a shutdown dragged on and government employees suddenly deprived of a paycheck come under financial pressure, Caleb Harmon-Marshall, a former TSA officer, told CBS News.",
      "\"TSA officers are expected to continue to report to work. But in the past, if a shutdown exceeds two weeks, officers start to get frantic, and they stop going to work,\" he said, adding that agency personnel may call in sick and even seek other job opportunities if a shutdown persists.",
      "Any ensuing labor shortages can lead to snarled lines at airport security. For example, roughly 10% of TSA workers called in sick during the 34-day government shutdown that started in December 2018 and extended into 2019, driving up screening times at major airports across the country.",
      "\"So if officers decide not to come to work, there is less personnel manning checkpoints, and wait times can potentially get longer,\" Harmon-Marshall said.",
      "A shutdown began at 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday, Oct. 1, after the Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded. If lawmakers passed a spending bill, TSA and FAA workers would be entitled to back pay for any time worked during a shutdown.",
      "$1 billion hit",
      "The U.S. Travel Association, a trade group, warned that a government shutdown could cost the economy $1 billion a week, while also inconveniencing passengers and hurting travel industry businesses.",
      "\"A shutdown exacerbates staffing shortages among Transportation Security Administration officers and air traffic controllers, threatening longer airport security lines, flight delays and cancellations,\" the group said in a Sept. 25 letter. \"It halts hiring and training of new air traffic controllers when we are already short more than 2,800 controllers nationwide, and restarting the process adds further delays even after funding is restored.\"",
      "The U.S. is already experiencing a shortage of air traffic controllers, and has launched an effort to hire more than 2,000 additional controllers by the end of the fiscal year.",
      "Neither the White House nor the Transportation Department responded to requests for comment about the impact of a potential government shutdown on travel in the U.S.",
      "By contrast, train travel is unlikely to be disrupted if the government closes this week, according to the Rail Passengers Association, which represents the nation's rail travelers. Although Amtrak receives some federal funding and could eventually be impacted if a shutdown dragged on, the rail service is financially healthy enough to pay workers in the near term and keep trains in operation, the group\u00a0said in a statement last week.",

    "story": [
      "Even with a U.S. government shutdown beginning on Wednesday, Oct. 1, the 74 million Americans who collect Social Security will continue receiving their monthly checks, although some services could be disrupted due to a potential halt in federal activities, according to experts.",
      "Social Security benefits are covered by mandatory spending, which means that the funding for the program has already been approved by Congress without an expiration date. As a result, Social Security recipients, including retirees, disabled Americans and the dependents of deceased workers, wouldn't see an interruption in their monthly payments if the government shuts down.",
      "However, other Social Security services could be impacted by a shutdown, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare. The Social Security Administration's working budget requires approval from Congress. The Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded past Sept. 30.",
      "With no agreement having been reached, some Social Security services could be temporarily halted until the issue is resolved, according to both the Social Security Administration and experts on the retirement program.",
      "\"The system hasn't missed a payment in its entire 90-year history and won't start now,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare, said in an email. \"But customer service at the Social Security Administration (SSA) may be disrupted, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing, and replacing Medicare cards.\"",
      "In preparation for past shutdowns, each federal agency has created a contingency plan for its operations, with some employees expected to work without pay because they're considered to be providing essential services. In an email to CBS News, the SSA said beneficiaries would continue to receive payments even if the government closes.",
      "\"In the event of a lapse in appropriation, SSA will follow the contingency plan for continued activities, and Social Security beneficiaries would continue receiving their Social Security, Social Security Disability Insurance, and SSI payments,\" an agency spokesperson said.",
      "Which Social Security services could be impacted?",
      "That would depend on how many SSA employees are deemed to be essential, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare.",
      "In a Sept. 24 contingency plan\u00a0published\u00a0by the SSA, the agency said about 45,000 employees \u2014 almost 90% of its workforce \u2014 would stay on the job in case of a shutdown. Another roughly 6,200 workers would be furloughed, according to the planning document.",
      "\"We will continue activities critical to our direct-service operations and those needed to ensure accurate and timely payment of benefits,\" the plan states. \"We will cease activities not directly related to the accurate and timely payment of benefits or not critical to our direct-service operations.\"",
      "According to the new plan, the following are services that would be halted during a shutdown:",

      "Replacement Medicare cards",
      "Overpayments processing",
      "Another aspect of Social Security could be delayed due to a shutdown: the Social Security Administration's annual announcement of the cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, to beneficiaries' monthly payments. The COLA is intended to ensure that people's benefits keep up with inflation and that the value of their Social Security income doesn't erode over time.",
      "The SSA announces the annual COLA each October when the Labor Department releases its Consumer Price Index data that month, which this year is scheduled for Oct. 15. But there could be a hitch this year if federal agencies shut down, according to the Labor Department.",
      "\"A delay of the CPI release during October of each year might have an impact on the Cost of Living Adjustment announcement by the Social Security Administration,\" the Labor Department said in issuing a\u00a0contingency plan that covers the impact of a possible shutdown on its operations.",
      "When is the next Social Security payment?",
      "Social Security payments would continue to go out as usual during a shutdown, with recipients of Supplemental Security Income \u2014 a program for low-income and disabled people \u2014 scheduled to receive their next checks on Oct. 1.",
      "Social Security recipients will receive their checks on their usual schedule, which is based on their birth date. Those born between the 1st to 10th of their birth month will receive payment on Oct. 8, while those born between the 11th to 20th days will receive their payment on Oct. 15.

    "story": [
      "States are warning struggling Americans who rely on food stamps to pay for groceries that they may miss out on benefits come November.",
      "\"Starting October 16, SNAP \u00a0[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program] benefits will not be paid until the federal government shutdown ends and funds are released to PA,\" reads a\u00a0notice from the Pennsylvania state website.",
      "New Jersey,\u00a0Maryland, New York and\u00a0Texas are among the other states that have issued similar notices.",
      "The wave of announcements come after the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees the federal food stamps program, issued a letter to state agencies on Oct. 10 saying that if the lapse in appropriations continues, there will be \"insufficient funds\" to pay full November SNAP benefits.",
      "Reached for comment, the White House referred CBS News to the USDA, which then shared the letter it sent to states. Both declined to comment on what a lapse in funding could mean for the millions of Americans who rely on the program. Advocates, meanwhile, have warned the effects could be devastating.",
      "\"These are, for the most part, working individuals who still are living paycheck to paycheck,\" said Gina Plata-Nino, interim director for SNAP at the Food Research & Action Center (FRAC), a nonprofit focused on ending hunger.",
      "How SNAP benefits are normally administered",
      "Over 40 million Americans are enrolled in SNAP. Recipients, on average, receive a payment of $187 (or roughly $6 per day) on prepaid cards that they can use\u00a0to buy produce, meat, dairy and other household food staples.",
      "While SNAP is a federally funded program run by the USDA, states are responsible for administering benefits and setting their own disbursement dates. As described by The Food Research and Action Center (FRAC) on its website, the program is a \"delicate partnership of public and private entities.\"",
      "To ensure benefits are available at the first of every month, states send electronic case files with information on SNAP recipients on a monthly basis to an electronic benefit transfer (EBT) vendor so they can process the data and load recipients' cards.",
      "\"EBT processors have to get all of this data in time,\" Plata-Nino explained. \"They need to be able to process the payment so when that person utilizes their card at that EBT retailer, the money will be there for the retailer to be able to swipe.\"",
      "The shutdown, however, has thrown a wrench in the process. In its letter to state agencies on Oct. 10, the USDA directed states to hold off on sending electronic files to EBT vendors \"until further notice.\" The pause opens the door to possible delays and disruptions in November benefits.",
      "\"Letting people go hungry is a choice, and it's not a good one,\" Deb Powers, a 66-year-old Massachusetts resident and SNAP recipient, told CBS News.",
      "Contingency funding",
      "One way for the USDA to cover SNAP costs, explained Plata-Nino, would be for the agency to tap into its contingency funds. According to FRAC, the reserve stood at $6 billion during the Biden administration.",
      "After Democrats and Republicans\u00a0failed to come to an agreement to extend government funding on Oct. 1, 2025, the USDA said in its Lapse of Funding\u00a0plan that the SNAP program has been provided for with multiyear contingency funds that could be used to cover state administrative expenses during a federal government shutdown.",
      "\"These multiyear contingency funds are also available to fund participant benefits in the event that a lapse occurs in the middle of the fiscal year,\" the plan states.",
      "However, it's unclear if the USDA plans to utilize those funds to ensure November SNAP benefits. The agency did not respond to CBS News' request for comment on whether that option is under consideration.",
      "During the government shutdowns in 2018 and 2019, the USDA disbursed SNAP funds early to prevent benefits from running out, Plata-Nino said.",
      "\"This administration didn't do any of that [this time], but they still have the contingency funding ...\" Plata-Nino said. \"They have the money, so it really is a policy choice.\"",
      "It's also possible states could attempt to free up money from their own budgets to bridge the gap, although approval would be an uphill battle given that it costs tens to hundreds of millions of dollars monthly to cover SNAP benefits. Whether states would get that money back is unclear.",
      "Peter Hadler, the deputy commissioner of Connecticut's Department of Social Services, told lawmakers in his state Thursday that he doesn't expect the federal government to ever reimburse states."

    "story": [
      "Americans worried that the U.S. government shutdown could derail their plans to take out a mortgage or refinance their home loan can breathe easy \u2014 mostly. Housing experts says lenders will continue processing mortgages as usual even if federal agencies close shop, while noting that a shutdown could lead to hitches for borrowers applying for government-backed loans.",
      "\"If you're expecting to close in a week or a month, there could be some slight delay,\" said Jeff Ostrowski, a housing analyst at Bankrate. \"But I think for most people, it's probably going to be a blip more than a real deal killer.\"",
      "The bulk of the mortgage market consists of loans originated by private lenders. But some government agencies have a hand in the process, such as the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) insuring private loans or Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) managing flood insurance policies.",
      "Impact on government-backed loans",
      "Borrowers applying for a conventional mortgage issued by a bank, credit union or other private lender are unlikely to encounter problems if the government closes shop. However, those applying for government-backed loans from agencies like the FHA, Department of Veteran Affairs an Department of Agriculture (USDA) could face minor delays lining up their mortgages, Holden Lewis, a senior writer at NerdWallet, told CBS MoneyWatch in an email.",
      "The National Association of Realtors (NAR) notes in an online\u00a0explainer\u00a0that the FHA will continue to approve most single-family mortgage loans in the event of a shutdown. The VA will also continue to guarantee home loans, but worker furloughs at the agency could lead to processing delays, the group said.",
      "\"It creates a little bit of extra stress and uncertainty, but I haven't seen a shutdown in either of those programs\" when politics led the government to shut it doors in the past, Ostrowski said.",
      "The VA and FHA account for up to a quarter of all mortgage applications, according to\u00a0Redfin. NAR\u00a0advises\u00a0U.S. veterans applying for or refinancing a government-backed loan to check with their lender on how long it will take to complete the process if the government shuts down.",
      "Another segment of the housing market that could feel the impact of the shutdown are people applying for mortgages through the USDA, which issues loans to buyers in eligible towns and rural areas. NAR\u00a0said the USDA will halt issuance of new direct and guaranteed home loans during a shutdown. Pre-scheduled direct\u2011loan closings will also be postponed.",
      "The USDA did not respond to a request for comment. The VA referred CBS News to its shutdown contingency plan, which says the agency will continue issuing \"housing benefits.\"",
      "Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored entities that support roughly 70% of the mortgage market, don't rely on federal funding and have continued to operate during past shutdowns. However, they could face bottlenecks if federal agencies close down this week, said Anthony Smith, an applied economist at Realtor.com.",
      "\"They rely on other federal processes like the IRS for tax transcript verifications,\" he said. \"So if the IRS shuts down or significantly cuts back on its transcript services, then Fannie and Freddie might be able to approve a loan, but they can't get the final verification piece.\"",
      "Possible flood insurance delays",
      "People purchasing a house in a flood zone could also face delays during a government shutdown, experts told CBS News. That's because homebuyers applying for a federally backed mortgage in high-risk flood areas are required to get flood insurance. A shutdown could hamper the FEMA-administered National Flood Insurance Program, which underwrites more than 4 million flood insurance policies in the U.S.",
      "\"The government shutdown could complicate your closing because it might be harder to just secure flood insurance,\" Ostrowski told CBS News.",
      "FEMA did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "According to the White House, the flood insurance program cannot sell new or renewal insurance policies during a government shutdown.\"A potential lapse of the NFIP authorization would negatively impact many thousands of Americans who would be left unable to renew/transfer their coverage or to buy the required coverage for their homes,\" a White House official said in an email."

      "\"The world now runs on the cloud\" and the internet is seen as a utility like water or electricity as we spend so much of our lives on our smartphones, Burgess said.",

    "story": [
      "Americans are still cracking open cold ones, but what's inside their cans is changing.",
      "More people are now reaching for cannabis beverages, nonalcoholic drinks infused with tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, the main ingredient in marijuana that makes you feel high. Some varieties also include cannabidiol, or CBD, a chemical compound found in marijuana or hemp that proponents say helps relieve pain, anxiety and other health symptoms. The drinks come in different forms including seltzers, juices, sodas and teas.",
      "Consumer demand for cannabis beverages is growing as Americans drink less booze. According to a July Gallup survey, the percentage of U.S. adults who say they consume alcohol fell to 54%, the lowest level since 1939, when the polling organization first started tracking people's drinking behavior. More Americans also believe even moderate alcohol consumption is unhealthy, the poll found.",
      "Hundreds of brands small and large now hawk cannabis beverages, many promising to help take the edge off in social settings.",
      "\"There's a replacement factor going on between THC beverages and wine and beer and distilled spirits,\" said Beau Whitney, chief economist at Whitney Economics, an Oregon-based consultancy focused on the cannabis and hemp industry.",
      "THC beverage sales in the U.S. are expected to grow from $1.1 billion last year to nearly $5.6 billion by 2035, according to Whitney Economics.",
      "\"The remarkable growth and innovation we're seeing in the hemp-derived beverage space is a clear sign of consumer enthusiasm and entrepreneurial success,\" Michelle Rutter Friberg, director of government relations at the National Cannabis Industry Association, told CBS News in an email.",
      "Potential health impacts, side effects",
      "Several THC beverage brands market themselves as nonalcoholic alternatives and say their drinks contain zero calories and zero sugar. Doctors, however, warn that cannabis beverages can come with side effects.",
      "Whether smoked or ingested as an edible or drink, cannabis can affect the brain, heart, lungs and mental health, CBS News medical contributor Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder said, adding that the drug can trigger anxiety, paranoia, elevated heart rate and, in rare cases, psychosis.",
      "Potential short-term effects of cannabis include issues with memory, focus and coordination, said Gounder.",
      "\"People may have trouble remembering new information, paying attention or moving smoothly,\" she said. \"This can slow reaction time, cause slurred speech, and raise the risk of car crashes by 30%-40%. The effects depend on how much cannabis is used, how it's taken and how used to it someone is.\"",
      "Heavy or long-term intake of the drug, especially in teens, can lead to lasting issues with memory, attention and decision-making, said Gounder. Long-term use, she added, can also lead to cannabis-use disorder, which is a clinical term for addiction,\u00a0defined\u00a0by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as when users are unable to stop using cannabis even though it's causing them health and social problems.",
      "Some heavy users may also develop severe nausea and vomiting, Gounder said. Those most at risk are pregnant individuals, teens, and people with mental or heart conditions, she added.",
      "The potential effects of a cannabis-infused drink can be felt in as little as 15 to 20 minutes, compared with 30 to 90 minutes for an edible, according to Dr. Staci Gruber, an associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, in a recent article on the school's website.",
      "\"If you are interested in trying it and it is legal for you to do so, be mindful about controlling the experience until you know how a particular product affects you,\" Gruber said.",
      "Target eyes THC segment",
      "The U.S. has a patchwork of regulations governing the sale of cannabis products, with states offering varying degrees of restrictions, including minimum-age requirements. THC beverages can be legally sold in 44 states in total, \u00a037 of which allow sales outside of the marijuana dispensary systems according to Whitney.",
      "In those areas, the beverages can commonly be found at restaurants, bars, grocery stores and liquor stores.",
      "In Atlanta, for example, Scofflaw Beverage Company \u2014 previously a brewery fighting for its financial life after the pandemic \u2014 revived its business by canning drinks without alcohol that contain 5 to 10 milligrams of hemp-derived THC, CBS News Atlanta reports. Cannabis products are legal in Georgia and can be shipped across the U.S.",
      "\"It's really been an almost seismic shift in customer preference,\" Scofflaw co-founder Matt Shirah told CBS News Atlanta. \"The THC infused business has the potential to be 10 to 20 times the size of beer business.\"",
      "Cannabis beverages have even caught the attention of major retailers like Target. The Minneapolis-based chain confirmed to CBS News that it is testing the sale of THC beverages at certain Target liquor stores in Minnesota. While other retailers, such as Total Wine & More, already sell cannabis beverages, Target is the first big-box player to explore the THC beverage market.",
      "\"At Target, we're always exploring new ways to meet our guests' evolving preferences and needs,\" a spokesperson said.",
      "Whitney Economics estimates there are 500 to 750 brands marketing cannabis drinks. Of those, roughly 30 are sizable labels with national distribution, while the rest are regional and local brands, according to Diana Eberlein, chair of the Coalition for Adult Beverage Alternatives Retailers, a group that represents stakeholders in the hemp and alcohol industries.",
      "Better-known names in the space include Cycling Frog, which makes THC seltzers and edibles; Cann, which markets itself as a \"social beverage\"; and Nowadays, which employs the motto \"the future of drinking is here.\"",
      "Mainstream alcohol brands are also testing the waters. Beer makers Lagunitas Brewing and Pabst have come up with their own THC-infused beverages.",
      "Whitney and Eberlein said the cannabis drink sector is growing most rapidly among women in their 30s and early 40s who are looking for more accessible, and less caloric, alternatives to alcoholic beverages.",
      "\"They still want to have a beverage, but they don't want the high amount of calories. They don't want the alcohol, they don't want the sugar, and they don't want to have a hangover the next morning,\" Whitney said. \"They're replacing their evening glass of wine with THC beverages.\""

Extreme weather in West Africa, which supplies 70% of the world's cocoa, has slashed yields, with heavy rains, crop disease and droughts causing the biggest supply deficit in more than 60 years.",

    "story": [
      "Americans continue to\u00a0fall behind\u00a0on auto loan payments in the face of record-high car prices and high interest rates.",
      "A recent\u00a0study by VantageScore found that auto loan delinquency rates have increased by more than 50% over the past 15 years. The upward trend continues even as delinquency rates in other loan categories \u2014 including credit card loans, personal loans and home equity loans \u2014 have declined, according to the report.",
      "\"Back in 2010, auto loans were the least risky of all products at that point in time,\" Rikard Bandebo, chief economist at VantageScore, said in a recent video. \"Now, as we look at 2025, it's actually \u2014 excluding student loans \u2014 the riskiest credit product.\"",
      "While a growing number of Americans have been\u00a0falling behind\u00a0on car payments for years, auto loan delinquency rates have picked up after a pandemic-induced dip.",
      "The most recent\u00a0data\u00a0from the Federal Reserve shows that auto loan delinquency rates \u2014 defined as the portion of loan balances that are at least 30 days past due \u2014 were at 3.8% in June 2024, the highest level since June 2010.",
      "The rise in delinquency rates includes all household income groups, VantageScore's data shows. What's more, delinquency rates among prime borrowers have climbed faster than subprime borrowers on an absolute basis.",
      "\"The broad-based decline in consumer credit quality indicates that economic pressures are no longer concentrated among some VantageScore credit tiers and income levels,\" Susan Fahy, executive vice president and chief digital officer at VantageScore, said in a statement.",
      "VantageScore also found that the average loan amount has increased 57% over the last 15 years \u2014 a bigger jump than any other loan category, including mortgages.",
      "Why people are falling behind on payments",
      "One of the main factors hurting car owners is rapidly increasing monthly payments.\u00a0Data from the Federal Reserve shows that average monthly payments increased roughly $130 from January 2020 to January 2023, to $600. By contrast, in the three-year-period from January 2017 to January 2020, average monthly car loan payments had increased approximately $40, from $430 to $470.",
      "Payments have continued to escalate: One in five new car loans have monthly payments that exceed $1,000, according to auto researcher\u00a0Edmunds.",
      "Behind the ballooning payments are rising car prices and interest rates. The average cost of a new vehicle is now more than $50,000, according to September data from Cox Automotive \u2014 the highest it's ever been.",
      "\"Prices for both new and used vehicles surged during and after the pandemic and they haven't come down,\" Stephen Kates, a financial analyst at Bankrate, told CBS News in an email.",
      "Those higher vehicle costs have encouraged more buyers to finance their purchases, often at increased interest rates, Kates added. The average auto loan rate in September was 7% for new cars and approximately 11% for used cars, September\u00a0data\u00a0from Edmunds shows.",
      "\"The combination of elevated prices and borrowing costs has led to longer loan terms, which increase the total interest paid and raise the risk of borrowers becoming underwater as their cars depreciate faster than they pay down the loan,\" Kates said.",
      "Broader economic conditions are also influencing delinquency rates, experts have noted. Fahy from VantageScore said that in addition to higher borrowing costs, the rise in auto loan delinquencies could also be attributed to inflation and an unsteady employment picture.",
      "While inflation has cooled since its 2022 peak, many Americans are still feeling stretched by sky-high prices. A Bankrate analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics data found that while the gap is narrowing, average wages are still trailing behind inflation and won't catch up until mid-2026."

      "They are due to be paid again Oct. 28, but they are at risk of missing that paycheck if the government shutdown persists, Duffy said. Because the Federal Aviation Administration defines air traffic controllers as\u00a0essential workers, they are required to stay on the job during government closures despite going unpaid, although they are guaranteed back pay once lawmakers restore government funding.",
      "\"They got a partial paycheck a week ago Tuesday. Their next paycheck comes a week from Tuesday. In that paycheck there will be no dollars. They don't get paid,\" Duffy said. \"[W]e have heard they are taking Uber jobs. They are doing DoorDash, they are [finding] ways to keep their families afloat.\"",
      "Since the government shutdown began on Oct. 1, some flights and airports have experienced delays due to shortages of air traffic controllers, including Burbank, California; Denver, Colorado; and Newark, New Jersey, federal flight data showed earlier this month.",

Families would likely face paycheck deductions of $8,900 a year for their coverage, according to the group, whose projections are based on a survey of more than 1,700 employers.",
      "More working-age Americans receive health insurance through their employers than any other source, with about 60% \u2014 or 164.7 million people \u2014 covered by their workplaces, according to KFF.",
      "Companies, which typically pick up the bulk of their employees' health insurance costs, are likely to spend more than $18,000 on average to insure each worker in 2026, Mercer told CBS News. Workers typically shoulder between 16% to 25% of the total, depending on whether they are receiving single or family coverage, according to KFF's\u00a02024 employer health benefits survey.",
      "The findings come as American households continue to feel squeezed by rising prices, with inflation inching higher this year on everything from groceries to housing. The jump in health insurance costs are partly due to an aging workforce that's tapping more medical services, as well as increased demand for costly treatments such as the GLP-1 drugs used for weight loss, Mercer Chief Actuary Sunit Patel said.",
      "Employees \"might also see an increase in the cost-sharing provisions in the design as well \u2014 higher co-pays, higher deductibles \u2014 so it's getting hit on both ends,\" Beth Umland, director of research for health and benefits at Mercer, told CBS News.",
      "Employees who receive their health insurance through their employers will soon learn their new costs when open enrollment begins, which typically runs for several weeks in the fall but varies by company.",

      "In addition to an aging workforce and inflation, the complexity of the U.S. health care system is also driving those costs higher, noted Peterson. On top of that, growing consolidation amongst health insurers has made the market less competitive, resulting in higher costs, the U.S. Government Accountability Office said in a\u00a0December report.",
      "Higher health care costs could add to the financial squeeze felt by many families, who are already coping with higher grocery, utility and housing prices, noted Lindsay Owens, executive director of the Groundwork Collaborative, a liberal-leaning economic think tank.",
      "A KFF poll in July found that 4 in 10 insured adults under 65 years old worry about affording their monthly health insurance.",
      "\"You can't really go without health care, so something else will have to give,\" Owens said. That could mean cutting \"a family vacation, a family trip to a soccer game, or putting groceries on the credit card so you can clear the health care premiums.\"",
      "The Consumer Price Index, a basket of goods and services typically purchased by Americans, likely rose 3.1% on an annual basis in September, an uptick from August's 2.9% annual rate, according to economists polled by FactSet. The September inflation data will be released on Oct. 24."

    "story": [
      "America's population of seniors is expected to surge by 40% over the next 25 years \u2014 a shift that could spark a crisis of aging, as most people remain unprepared for longer lives, according to new research from the MIT AgeLab and insurance company John Hancock.",
      "Americans are lagging in readiness to handle the demands of greater longevity, ranging from managing the cost of a longer retirement to maintaining their health in old age, according to the inaugural Longevity Preparedness Index, or LPI, from the MIT AgeLab, a research institute focusing on improving the quality of life for older people, and John Hancock.",
      "The problem goes well beyond saving for retirement \u2014 another area where Americans are known to fall short \u2014 and touches nearly every aspect of aging, from building community in later life to preparing for care when people can no longer look after themselves. Some people may fail to plan simply because they underestimate their own longevity, with\u00a0earlier research by Stanford University retirement expert Annamaria Lusardi finding that Americans generally believe they'll die younger than statistics predict.",
      "\"Believe it or not, longevity is quite new \u2014 we've always had older people, but never this many older people living this long,\" Joe Coughlin, founder and director of the MIT AgeLab, told CBS News. \"We can't look to our parents, saying 'This is how they did it.'\"",
      "Preparing for a long old age isn't all about money, although that remains an important part of retirement readiness, said Brooks Tingle, CEO of John Hancock, told CBS. While Americans are living longer, they're spending more years in poorer health, which raises additional issues around preparing for longer retirements than prior generations, he noted.",
      "A 65-year-old woman has a 40% chance of living to age 90, while men the same age have a 30% chance of reaching that age, according to Lusardi's research.",
      "The study analyzed eight aspects of longevity preparedness:",
      "Social connection: Relationships with family, friends and community.Finance: Having enough saved for retirement and old age.\u00a0Daily activities: Keeping busy with meaningful daily activities.\u00a0Care: Identifying who will care for you if you need assistance, understanding the costs of care and having advance directives in place.\u00a0Home: Modifying your home to prolong independence in old age.\u00a0Community: Access to health care, stores, recreation and transportation.\u00a0Health: Developing positive physical, mental, and cognitive behavioral habits to maintain health as you age.Life transitions: Preparing for major changes like retirement, the death of a loved one and more.",

      "Home: Modifying your home to prolong independence in old age.",
      "Community: Access to health care, stores, recreation and transportation.",
      "Health: Developing positive physical, mental, and cognitive behavioral habits to maintain health as you age.",
      "Life transitions: Preparing for major changes like retirement, the death of a loved one and more.",
      "U.S. adults scored an average of 60 out of 100 across the eight areas, which MIT and John Hancock said signifies that Americans' general longevity preparedness is low.",
      "\"Preparedness is, yes, about saving money, but really it's practically being aware of other things you'll have to do, like 'What should I do, who am I going to live with,'\" Coughlin said. \"Your Zip code is probably your bigger predictor of quality of life, not your 401(k).\"",
      "Care emerged as Americans' weakest area of preparedness, with an average score of 42 out of 100 on the LPI. The strongest domain was community, where people scored 70, suggesting greater readiness for maintaining access to stores, health care and recreation as they age.",
      "The price of long-term care, such as assisted living facilities, can easily cost $6,000 per month or more, placing it out of reach for many Americans. But smaller, less costly steps can also make a difference, such as identifying friends or family members who could step in to help if you ever need extra support, Tingle noted.",
      "\"It's not just, 'Will I need intensive care?' but 'Who is going to change the lightbulb for me when I'm 91?,'\" Tingle said. \"A big takeaway is just to start these conversations.\"",
      "He added, \"Most families don't ever talk about these things.\"",
      "To be sure, saving for retirement can ease many of these issues, ranging from having the resources to pay for long-term care to modifying your home with grab bars and other additions that can prolong independent living. On average, Americans scored a 64 for financial preparedness, but the study found a large gap between those with few assets and people with wealth.",
      "Those with less than $50,000 in investible assets had an overall longevity preparedness score of 56, while those with more than $3 million in assets scored 65, the survey found. People with financial advisers scored a 65, while those without ranked 7 points lower, it noted.",
      "\"Those who had financial advisers had better scores \u2014 of course they did better. The better financial advisers don't just advise you on your wealth, they help you anticipate what will come tomorrow,\" Coughlin noted. \"You have someone who is asking you to think about what those future plans are.\"",
      "He added, \"Most of us are hacking longevity, and we figure it out day after day.\" But he said he hopes the LPI will \"change the cultural narrative\" about aging by shifting the conversation beyond money to include how people can plan how to live and find purpose in their later years."

      "To dodge law enforcement, Chen and Prince Group's top executives allegedly paid bribes to public officials and used their political influence, the department said.",
      "Mark Taylor, who formerly worked on human trafficking issues in Cambodia for the nonprofit Winrock International, said that Chen was embedded in the Cambodian elite and \"well protected\" by the government, showing \"the larger role that Cambodia has played as a safe center for this online scamming to prosper.\" Chen was formerly a personal adviser to Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet.",
      "\"Cambodia is the physical location where a lot of it operates, but it's also the money laundering center for the entire region,\" Taylor said",
      "Independent research group Cyber Scam Monitor has documented more than 200 online scamming centers and casinos in Cambodia alone, based on first-hand accounts from former scam workers, field surveys and media reports."

      "\"You know we're building \u2014 right behind us \u2014 we're building a ballroom,\" Mr. Trump said during the celebration of the 2025 NCAA champions in the White House East Room. He pointed out, \"Right on the other side, you have a lot of construction going on, which you might hear periodically.\"",

      "Court documents obtained by CBS News said Christopher Moynihan was arrested Sunday after saying in text messages that he planned to \"eliminate\" Jeffries when the top House Democrat spoke at an event in New York City on Monday.",
      "Jeffries spoke at the Economic Club of New York on Monday.",
      "Moynihan was arraigned Tuesday and entered a plea of not guilty.",
      "According to a court filing by prosecutors in the New York state criminal case, Moynihan wrote, \"Hakeem Jeffries makes a speech in a few days in NYC I cannot allow this terrorist to live.\"",
      "Moynihan also allegedly stated: \"Even if I am hated, he must be eliminated, I will kill him for the future,\" the filing said.",
      "Moynihan faces a felony charge of making a terroristic threat, according to court filings shared by prosecutors.",
      "In a statement on Tuesday, Jeffries noted that Moynihan had been pardoned by Mr. Trump on his first day in office and that \"many of the criminals released have committed additional crimes throughout the country.\" But Jeffries added that \"threats of violence will not stop us from showing up, standing up and speaking up for the American people.\"",
      "Moynihan's father declined to comment on the case when reached by phone by CBS News on Monday. He said Moynihan has not yet been appointed a defense attorney.",
      "Dutchess County, New York district attorney Anthony Parisi said in a statement to CBS News that \"although my office was not contacted during the investigative stage of this matter, we are now reviewing the case for legal and factual sufficiency.\"",
      "Moynihan was pardoned by President Trump nine months ago, along with more than 1,500 other Capitol riot defendants who were granted clemency hours after Mr. Trump returned to the White House.",
      "Moynihan was found guilty in August 2022 of obstructing an official proceeding, and pleaded guilty to five misdemeanor charges. He was sentenced in February 2023 to 21 months in prison.",
      "Prosecutors described Moynihan as being among the first rioters to breach police barricades and enter the Capitol grounds on Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "Moynihan was also among a smaller group of riot defendants who were on the Senate floor during the siege. Prosecutors argued in Moynihan's sentencing memorandum: \"While inside, Moynihan rifled through a notebook on top of a Senator's desk, saying 'There's gotta be something in here we can f*cking use against these scumbags.'\"",
      "Prosecutors said Moynihan \"occupied the dais of the Senate, joining other rioters in shouts and chanting,\" and didn't leave the chamber until police made him leave.",
      "Moynihan's arrest for allegedly threatening Jeffries was made by New York State Police, according to a statement by the agency that was confirmed by a state official. The investigation was initiated by the FBI, according to state police.",
      "A state police statement said Moynihan was arraigned in local court in Clinton, a town in New York's Hudson Valley region. He was remanded to the Dutchess County Justice and Transition Center \"in lieu of $10,000 cash bail, a $30,000 bond, or an $80,000 partially secured bond.\"",
      "State police declined a request to immediately release a copy of the agency's incident report or a booking photo.",
      "Moynihan is not the first pardoned Capitol rioter to be arrested on new, separate charges. But he is the first to be charged with making a violent threat against a member of Congress.",
      "Critics of the president's blanket pardons of Jan. 6 defendants have warned about the risk of recidivism by rioters, many of whom remained defiant and unapologetic about their roles in the attack. The rioters have been defended and lionized publicly as \"hostages\" by Mr. Trump.",
      "In a March 2025 floor speech, Sen. Dick Durbin, a member of Senate Democratic leadership from Illinois, listed the names of accused rioters who had been arrested again. Durbin cited the case of Matthew Huttle, who was accused of \"raising a firearm at police\" in early 2025 and \"acknowledged he was a January 6th defendant who stormed the Capitol,\" according to Durbin. Huttle was fatally shot by police during the traffic stop.",
      "Zachary Alam, who was convicted of eight felonies for his role in the Capitol riot, was arrested weeks after his 2025 presidential pardon for allegedly breaking and entering a home near Richmond, Virginia.",
      "Other Jan. 6 defendants have since been arrested for other alleged criminal infractions that occurred before the siege or in the years between 2021 and the pardon.",
      "The alleged threat against Jeffries is also part of a fast-growing wave of threats against legislators. In a statement last month, Capitol Police said the number of threat investigations in 2025 had already eclipsed 14,000, more than the number of cases in all of 2024.",
      "The Capitol riot injured more than 140 police officers and caused millions of dollars of damage to the Capitol complex. It interrupted the certification of the electoral vote from the 2020 election and triggered the evacuation of Congress, with leadership sent to a secure, secret location.",
      "Some rioters chanted to hang then-Vice President Mike Pence, threatened to kill then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and beat police officers with dozens of makeshift weapons, including bats, sticks, poles, bear spray and beams. Some were accused of carrying guns, knives and handmade weapons."

      "A government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to approve funding for federal agencies. Before 1980, agencies largely continued operating during a lapse in funding with the assumption that Congress would act quickly. But in 1980 and 1981, then-Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti authored a series of legal opinions that found government agencies didn't have the authority to continue running during a gap in funding.",

The most recent lapse in government funding, in late 2018, caused $3 billion in permanent losses, according to the Congressional Budget Office.

The bill differed from a version passed in the House and funding technically lapsed at midnight, but since Nov. 21 fell on a Saturday, the effects weren't felt immediately. House and Senate negotiators worked over the weekend to reconcile their differences and passed identical bills on Sunday.",

      "Although a short U.S. government shutdown would be unlikely to have much impact on air travel, a prolonged impasse could lead to disruptions for passengers and financial losses for businesses, according to travel experts and industry groups.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration and Transportation Security Administration define most of their employees as essential, requiring them to work even if the government closes and workers at other federal agencies are furloughed. That means airport screeners, air traffic controllers, federal air marshals, safety inspectors and other workers with the two agencies are expected to continue showing up on the job \u2014 without pay \u2014 even as lawmakers failed this week to strike a deal on federal funding.",
      "But things could get messy if a shutdown dragged on and government employees suddenly deprived of a paycheck come under financial pressure, Caleb Harmon-Marshall, a former TSA officer, told CBS News.",
      "\"TSA officers are expected to continue to report to work. But in the past, if a shutdown exceeds two weeks, officers start to get frantic, and they stop going to work,\" he said, adding that agency personnel may call in sick and even seek other job opportunities if a shutdown persists.",
      "Any ensuing labor shortages can lead to snarled lines at airport security. For example, roughly 10% of TSA workers called in sick during the 34-day government shutdown that started in December 2018 and extended into 2019, driving up screening times at major airports across the country.",
      "\"So if officers decide not to come to work, there is less personnel manning checkpoints, and wait times can potentially get longer,\" Harmon-Marshall said.",
      "A shutdown began at 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday, Oct. 1, after the Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded. If lawmakers passed a spending bill, TSA and FAA workers would be entitled to back pay for any time worked during a shutdown.",
      "$1 billion hit",
      "The U.S. Travel Association, a trade group, warned that a government shutdown could cost the economy $1 billion a week, while also inconveniencing passengers and hurting travel industry businesses.",
      "\"A shutdown exacerbates staffing shortages among Transportation Security Administration officers and air traffic controllers, threatening longer airport security lines, flight delays and cancellations,\" the group said in a Sept. 25 letter. \"It halts hiring and training of new air traffic controllers when we are already short more than 2,800 controllers nationwide, and restarting the process adds further delays even after funding is restored.\"",

    "story": [
      "Even with a U.S. government shutdown beginning on Wednesday, Oct. 1, the 74 million Americans who collect Social Security will continue receiving their monthly checks, although some services could be disrupted due to a potential halt in federal activities, according to experts.",
      "Social Security benefits are covered by mandatory spending, which means that the funding for the program has already been approved by Congress without an expiration date. As a result, Social Security recipients, including retirees, disabled Americans and the dependents of deceased workers, wouldn't see an interruption in their monthly payments if the government shuts down.",
      "However, other Social Security services could be impacted by a shutdown, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare. The Social Security Administration's working budget requires approval from Congress. The Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded past Sept. 30.",
      "With no agreement having been reached, some Social Security services could be temporarily halted until the issue is resolved, according to both the Social Security Administration and experts on the retirement program.",
      "\"The system hasn't missed a payment in its entire 90-year history and won't start now,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare, said in an email. \"But customer service at the Social Security Administration (SSA) may be disrupted, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing, and replacing Medicare cards.\"",
      "In preparation for past shutdowns, each federal agency has created a contingency plan for its operations, with some employees expected to work without pay because they're considered to be providing essential services. In an email to CBS News, the SSA said beneficiaries would continue to receive payments even if the government closes.",
      "\"In the event of a lapse in appropriation, SSA will follow the contingency plan for continued activities, and Social Security beneficiaries would continue receiving their Social Security, Social Security Disability Insurance, and SSI payments,\" an agency spokesperson said.",
      "Which Social Security services could be impacted?",
      "That would depend on how many SSA employees are deemed to be essential, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare.",
      "In a Sept. 24 contingency plan\u00a0published\u00a0by the SSA, the agency said about 45,000 employees \u2014 almost 90% of its workforce \u2014 would stay on the job in case of a shutdown. Another roughly 6,200 workers would be furloughed, according to the planning document.",
      "\"We will continue activities critical to our direct-service operations and those needed to ensure accurate and timely payment of benefits,\" the plan states. \"We will cease activities not directly related to the accurate and timely payment of benefits or not critical to our direct-service operations.\"",
      "According to the new plan, the following are services that would be halted during a shutdown:",

      "Replacement Medicare cards",
      "Overpayments processing",
      "Another aspect of Social Security could be delayed due to a shutdown: the Social Security Administration's annual announcement of the cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, to beneficiaries' monthly payments. The COLA is intended to ensure that people's benefits keep up with inflation and that the value of their Social Security income doesn't erode over time.",
      "The SSA announces the annual COLA each October when the Labor Department releases its Consumer Price Index data that month, which this year is scheduled for Oct. 15. But there could be a hitch this year if federal agencies shut down, according to the Labor Department.",
      "\"A delay of the CPI release during October of each year might have an impact on the Cost of Living Adjustment announcement by the Social Security Administration,\" the Labor Department said in issuing a\u00a0contingency plan that covers the impact of a possible shutdown on its operations.",
      "When is the next Social Security payment?",
      "Social Security payments would continue to go out as usual during a shutdown, with recipients of Supplemental Security Income \u2014 a program for low-income and disabled people \u2014 scheduled to receive their next checks on Oct. 1.",
      "Social Security recipients will receive their checks on their usual schedule, which is based on their birth date. Those born between the 1st to 10th of their birth month will receive payment on Oct. 8, while those born between the 11th to 20th days will receive their payment on Oct. 15. People born between the 21st and the last day of their birth month will get their check on Oct. 22.",
      "\"If you're a Social Security recipient, you're going to get your check, and that's obviously a good thing,\" Wayne Winegarden, a senior fellow in business and economics at the Pacific Research Institute, a think tank focused on free trade, told CBS News."

      "During a government shutdown, all active-duty personnel, as well as National Guard who are currently deployed, must carry out their assigned duties with their pay delayed until the shutdown is over. Civilian personnel whose work the Defense Department considers essential, or \"excepted,\" will also continue to work, while other civilians are furloughed for the duration of the shutdown.",
      "\"After the government shutdown, all government employees will automatically receive back pay, based on the terms of the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019,\" said Seamus Daniels, a fellow for Defense Budget Analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.",
      "Active-duty service members won't get paid on time unless Congress passes a separate piece of legislation, as it did in 2013 with the \"Pay Our Military Act,\" which ensured military pay and allowances continued during a government shutdown.",
      "Republican Rep. Jen Kiggans of Virginia introduced a bill earlier this month with bipartisan support, the \"Pay Our Troops Act of 2026,\" which would keep members of the military and Coast Guard paid during a shutdown, but it did not pass in time because the House is out of session until Oct 7.",
      "During the last shutdown in 2019, the Navy Federal Credit Union and USAA offered special loans to members of the military, and they plan to do so again if there's a shutdown in October. The Navy Federal Credit Union said in a\u00a0press release\u00a0it would \"offer 0% APR loans to eligible members whose pay may be affected, continuing a tradition of assistance seen during previous shutdowns in 2011, 2013 and 2018-2019, when nearly 20,000 members received support.\" USAA plans to offer eligible members who have accounts with the bank a \"no-interest loan equal to the amount of one net paycheck.\"",
      "The Defense Department published contingency guidance on Friday, outlining its priority missions and stating that unused funds passed in the reconciliation bill over the summer could be considered to support them. The list includes, in order: operations to secure the U.S. Southern Border, Middle East operations, the U.S. missile defense project Golden Dome for America, depot maintenance, shipbuilding and critical munitions.",
      "The guidance estimates about 406,000 of the department's 741,000 civilian employees will be required to work in the event of a shutdown because their mission is critical and not easily carried out by any U.S. service member.",
      "While a memo from the White House Office of Management and Budget said some civilians could be laid off during the shutdown, the guidance released by the Defense Department outlines furloughs but no cuts to the civilian workforce.",
      "During the shutdown, medical care and dental care will be excepted, according to the contingency guidance, but elective surgeries and other elective procedures would be delayed unless they're necessary for military readiness. Private health care using the Defense Department's TRICARE medical insurance would continue uninterrupted."

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Hundreds of thousands of federal employees could soon go without pay or face potential layoffs, since a government shutdown went into effect on Wednesday, Oct. 1.",
      "The GOP-controlled House passed a bill earlier this month to extend government funding until Nov. 21, but the bill stalled in the Senate, where Democratic votes were needed to advance it. Democrats wanted an extension of health care subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, which Republicans opposed. With hours left before the midnight deadline Wednesday, the Senate voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded.",
      "Under the shutdown, federal employees in critical positions are required to stay on the job. Many others will be forced to stay home. Both groups will have their paychecks delayed until Congress approves more spending. Most federal contractors might not get paid at all.",
      "Here's what the shutdown means for lawmakers themselves \u2014 and their paychecks.",
      "Will members of Congress get paid during a government shutdown?",
      "The short answer is yes. Lawmakers will continue to draw a paycheck.",
      "The reason is because of how their pay is treated under the Constitution and federal law. Article I, Section 6 of the Constitution states: \"The Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States.\" Lawmakers' pay has been funded by a permanent appropriation since 1983, according to a recent Congressional Research Service\u00a0report, meaning funding for their pay doesn't need to be renewed annually.",
      "Members' pay rate is set by a process established by federal law, and the 27th Amendment says any law to change their pay can't take effect until after the next congressional election.",
      "Most members earn a salary of $174,000 per year, a rate that has not changed since 2009. The speaker of the House earns $223,500, while the president pro tempore of the Senate and the party leaders in both chambers make $193,400.",
      "When it comes to other federal entities, the law that governs how they must act during a lapse in funding is known as the Antideficiency Act. In short, it says that federal agencies generally can't spend more money than Congress has approved. This means many agencies must furlough employees \u2014 that is, tell them to stay home \u2014 if they haven't received funding.",
      "There are some exceptions. Some programs, like Social Security and Medicare, have permanent funding, and benefits continue to be paid out as normal. Employees whose jobs are necessary to protect life and property must also stay on the job. Those whose roles are authorized by other laws can keep working, as can officials with constitutional responsibilities.",
      "When it comes to congressional staffers, each office determines which employees are deemed essential and thus allowed to keep working during a shutdown. Most are expected to keep all or nearly all of their employees on board, though the staffers won't be paid until more funding is approved.",
      "Does the president get paid during a shutdown?",
      "Yes. The Constitution prohibits reducing the president's salary while in office, \"thus effectively guaranteeing the president of compensation regardless of any shutdown action,\" according to a Congressional Research Service report from 2018.",
      "The president earns $400,000 annually, an amount set by Congress in 2001.",
      "His aides and staffers, however, are subject to the furlough requirements under the Antideficiency Act, meaning those in nonessential positions could be told to stay home until Congress authorizes more funding. In past shutdowns, presidents have furloughed many executive branch employees to increase pressure on Congress to take action.",
      "Do other federal employees get paid during a shutdown?",
      "Federal employees, whether they remain on the job or are furloughed, won't get paid while the government is shut down.",
      "They also face the risk of being permanently laid off if there's a shutdown, according to a memo from the Office of Budget and Management. The reduction-in-force notices would be in addition to any furlough notices, according to a memo sent to the agencies.",
      "\"Programs that did not benefit from an infusion of mandatory appropriations will bear the brunt of a shutdown, and we must continue our planning efforts in the event Democrats decide to shut down the government,\" the memo said.",
      "Those who still have jobs will receive back pay once funding is restored to their agency. In prior shutdowns, Congress had to approve back pay for employees, but a 2019 law made it mandatory. Contractors \u2014 who were responsible for carrying out about $755 billion worth of government work in the last fiscal year \u2014 are not guaranteed back pay.",
      "Each agency determines which positions are considered essential and which are not. The Office of Management and Budget has directed agencies to notify employees no later than two business days before a lapse in funding about their work and pay status.",
      "Some members of Congress have previously pointed out the apparent hypocrisy of lawmakers continuing to be paid while other federal employees miss out on their checks. In 2023, members of both parties offered different proposals that would prevent Congress from getting paid during shutdowns, but none attracted widespread support, and the 27th Amendment forbids any immediate change."

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Much of the federal government shut down Wednesday, October 1, after Congress failed to reach a deal to approve new funding.",
      "Republicans had proposed extending government funding at current levels until Nov. 21 to allow for members to continue working on full-year appropriations bills. Democrats made a counteroffer to keep the government open through October, but attached health care provisions and restrictions on President Trump's ability to withhold funding, both of which are nonstarters with most Republicans.",
      "The two sides were dug in on their positions, increasing the chances of a shutdown beginning Wednesday. Congressional leaders met with President Trump at the White House on Monday to search for a path forward, but walked away in the same position.",
      "A government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to pass funding for some or all agencies, which can't spend money that hasn't been approved by lawmakers. There have been 14 shutdowns since 1980, with the most recent coming in 2018. That shutdown lasted 34 days.",
      "Here's what to know about what happens during the government shutdown:",
      "What is a government shutdown?",
      "Most federal government agencies are funded annually by a dozen appropriations bills that need to be passed by Congress and signed by the president before the start of the new fiscal year on Oct. 1. These are often grouped together into one large piece of legislation known as an \"omnibus\" bill to speed up the process when Congress inevitably needs to pass a number of them at the last minute.",
      "If the funding deadline passes without Congress authorizing more spending, the government must fully or partially shut down, depending on which agencies are already funded. Ahead of this year's deadline, none of the 12 appropriations bills have been enacted. Some agencies got an infusion of money in the Republican-passed \"one big, beautiful bill\" earlier this year, meaning certain programs and functions in some departments will remain funded in the event of a shutdown, chiefly the Defense Department and Department of Homeland Security.",
      "Lawmakers regularly buy themselves more time to finish spending bills by passing what's known as a continuing resolution, which temporarily extends current funding levels to keep agencies functioning while they work to reach an agreement on new spending.",
      "The Constitution says the Treasury Department cannot spend money without a law authorizing it. Under a statute known as the Antideficiency Act, agencies are required to cease operations \u2014 with certain exceptions \u2014 in the absence of funding authorized by Congress. The act, a version of which first passed in 1870, with several significant updates since, also prohibits the government from entering into financial obligations without congressional sign-off.",
      "\"Treasury cannot pay out any money if there's not a law providing for who gets the money,\" said Matt Glassman, a senior fellow at the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown University. \"If those annual bills expire, then there is no law appropriating money for certain functions.\"",
      "What happens during a government shutdown, and who is affected?",
      "In a shutdown, the federal government must stop all non-essential functions until funding is approved by Congress and signed into law, except for programs that are funded by other means, like fees or other legislation. Each agency determines what work is essential and what is not. Members of Congress make that determination for their own staff, as well.",
      "\"No money can come out of Treasury whether you're essential or not essential. But who can keep working and incur obligations, even when there are no appropriations \u2014 there are three exceptions,\" Glassman said.",
      "Those exceptions are defined by the Antideficiency Act. They allow the government to fund operations to protect life and property, and keep officials involved in the constitutional process on the job, like the president, his staff and members of Congress.",
      "All active-duty military members, many federal law enforcement officers and employees at federally funded hospitals are considered essential, along with air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration officers. Each agency determines which of its employees can stay on the job.",
      "In a step that differs from previous shutdowns, the Office of Budget and Management last week told federal agencies to consider permanent mass layoffs for programs or projects that have discretionary funding that runs out on Oct. 1 or that don't have any alternative sources of funding. The reduction-in-force notices would be in addition to any furlough notices issued during a shutdown, according to a memo sent to the agencies.",
      "\"Programs that did not benefit from an infusion of mandatory appropriations will bear the brunt of a shutdown, and we must continue our planning efforts in the event Democrats decide to shut down the government,\" the memo said.",
      "Whether employees are essential or not, if their pay is dependent on annual appropriations, they won't get paid during a shutdown.",
      "Essential employees continue to work during the shutdown, but don't get paid until funding is restored to their agency. Employees in nonessential positions are typically furloughed until the government is funded again, although that could look different this time if there are widespread layoffs. Under a 2019 law, furloughed employees are guaranteed to receive back pay once the shutdown is over.",
      "A Senate report published in 2019 found that government shutdowns in 2013, 2018 and 2019 cost taxpayers nearly $4 billion, including at least $3.7 billion in back pay to furloughed workers who were not permitted to work.",
      "What is open and closed during a shutdown?",
      "Entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid continue to function during a shutdown because benefit payments are funded through permanent appropriations that don't require renewal. Entitlement payments keep going out, but the working budgets of the agencies that oversee the programs require approval by Congress. That means staff could be furloughed, causing delays in enrolling new beneficiaries or other service interruptions.",
      "\"Any type of interaction you're having at a customer service level with the federal government could definitely be affected,\" Glassman said.",
      "For example, travel plans could be disrupted if air traffic control and airport security, who are essential workers, do not show up to work in protest for not being paid immediately. Many national parks stayed open during the last shutdown in 2018 and 2019, but understaffing led to vandalism and cuts in visitor services. The parks largely closed during the 2013 shutdown. The U.S. Postal Service continues to operate, since it is self-funded.",
      "Maya MacGuineas, the president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said the public may not notice the effects if the shutdown is short-lived.",
      "\"The truth is, most people won't really feel much of a difference,\" MacGuineas said. \"If you've got a vacation planned to a National Park, you're going to be [upset] and disappointed. But most people will go on with their everyday lives and interact with the government the same way they do and not feel a big difference. That could get worse, the longer it lasts.\"",
      "The Senate report found the 2018-2019 shutdown had widespread impacts across a variety of government functions that ceased or were curtailed during the lapse in funding. It noted that furloughs in many agencies like the SEC, Federal Trade Commission and Consumer Product Safety Commission hampered enforcement and investigations. The report said the Justice Department canceled 60,000 immigration hearings.",
      "The effects could be even more pronounced this time around, given the possibility that the administration could use the shutdown to implement mass layoffs, furthering the president's aim of permanently reducing the federal workforce.",
      "When was the last government shutdown?",
      "The last government shutdown stretched from December 2018 until January 2019, when congressional funding for nine executive branch departments with roughly 800,000 employees lapsed.",
      "The five-week partial shutdown cost the economy $11 billion, according to a Congressional Budget Office report. The CBO said most of that would be recovered once the shutdown ended, but estimated a permanent loss of about $3 billion.",
      "Businesses across the country that relied on government customers reported a slowdown in business and some said they had to lay off employees. Tens of thousands of immigration court hearings were canceled. Government contractors struggled to feed their families and pay their bills.",
      "The shutdown stemmed from a standoff over Mr. Trump's demand for $5.7 billion to fund a wall along the border with Mexico. Mr. Trump had vowed to close the government if the funding wasn't included in spending legislation, but Democrats refused to give in.",
      "Mr. Trump conceded after insisting for weeks that he would not reopen the government without money for the wall, signing a bill to reopen the government for three weeks while Congress negotiated a spending deal.",
      "Three weeks later, Mr. Trump signed a compromise spending bill to avert another government shutdown, ultimately accepting a bill that did not meet his $5.7 billion demand for his long-promised border wall.",
      "When was the longest government shutdown?",
      "Before the early 1980s, the government would typically continue operating as usual even when funding bills hadn't been passed, but that changed after the attorney general issued opinions stating that it was illegal for the government to spend money without congressional approval.",
      "Since 1980, there have been 14 shutdowns, most of which lasted just a few days.",
      "The longest shutdown in U.S. history was the 2018-2019 lapse, which lasted 34 full days. Before that, the record was 21 days in 1995 and 1996, when President Bill Clinton held out against steep spending and tax cuts favored by Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich."

      "As surging copper wire thefts are leaving many Los Angeles communities in the dark, a new statewide metal theft law set to kick in next year is aimed at recyclers who buy the stolen metal.",
      "Los Angeles city leaders, law enforcement and business leaders called on Gov. Gavin Newsom to\u00a0sign Assembly Bill 476\u00a0as copper wire theft has cost communities not only money, but safety.",
      "The Sixth Street Bridge in downtown Los Angeles, originally called the \"Ribbon of Light,\" is a glaring example, as it sits in darkness with seven miles of copper wire stolen and stripped from the 2023-built bridge.",
      "While the stolen copper is valued at $11,000, repairs to rewire it for lighting are estimated to cost over $2.5 million \u2013 and have yet to be completed.",
      "Similar wire theft crime scenes play out throughout the county, including around the Cahuenga Pass. Joy Taylor says her streetlights have been out for eight months, since February.",
      "\"I not only worry about cars not seeing us, but we have a lot of wildlife in this neighborhood, and there's coyotes that are coming through the area,\" Taylor said.",
      "In Encino, five streetlights are out of commission on a single block, leaving one couple to alter their evening walks with their aging father because of it.",
      "\"Unfortunately, because of the cracks in the sidewalk, my dad's 83 years old, he can't see, and you know, myself as well, I will trip on the cracks. You just can't walk at night, you can't when it's pitch black,\" Elayne said.",
      "CBS News California Investigates obtained and analyzed city data and found that there have been more than 37,000 streetlight repair requests made so far in 2025. As of September, more than half are still waiting for service.",
      "The Bureau of Street Lighting said through an email statement that 15% of the system is affected by outages.",
      "LA County District Attorney Nathan Hochman said that broken streetlights have life and death consequences. He noted the downtown Los Angeles shooting death of actor Johnny Wactor.",
      "\"He got killed because three individuals were trying to steal his catalytic converter. But why did they choose Johnny Wactor's car at 3 a.m. at that exact spot? \u00a0Because the streetlights were out\u00a0 \u2014 it was dark,\" Hochman said.",
      "The Bureau says nearly half of its service requests are due to wire theft, and the other half are routine maintenance. This leads to a nine to 12-month period before repairs can be made, as there are less than 200 field staff to cover the city's quarter of a million streetlights.",
      "Los Angeles Councilmember Nithya Raman represents the district that includes the Cahuenga Pass and she said she is constantly getting calls about broken streetlights. \"To me, it's unacceptable that it takes up to a year to fix a broken streetlight,\" Raman said.",
      "She's calling for an update to property assessment rates, to fund streetlight maintenance as the fees haven't been adjusted since the 90s.",
      "Neighbors in the Cahuenga Pass have taken matters into their own hands by pooling money to install their own streetlights. Residents Martha Carr and Joy Taylor said they aren't waiting for the city to come to the rescue, and instead are subsidizing a city service with two motion-activated lights.",
      "\"Well, in a strange way, I felt empowered that I was able to do something myself, but I shouldn't have to,\" Carr said.",
      "Mayor Karen Bass' Office responded by email, saying the city is \"embracing new and innovative technologies like solar lighting,\" moving away from copper wire. \"Mayor Bass has begun that work as hundreds of solar streetlights have been installed,\" the Mayor's Office wrote.",
      "Assembly member Mark Gonz\u00e1lez authored AB 476, stating that \"Copper wire theft is not a victim-less crime.\"",
      "The bill puts more responsibility on junk dealers when purchasing scrap metal, leaving thieves with fewer options when selling. Buyers will be required to verify the seller's identity and lawful ownership. \u00a0Certain scrap metal from streetlights and traffic signals will be illegal to possess, and the bill also increases penalties for recyclers who purchase materials that belong to public entities without ensuring the seller has proper authorization to do so.",
      "\"Every stolen wire is more than metal ripped from the ground; it's light ripped from our communities,\" Gonz\u00e1lez said.",
      "The city is also working on a Metal and Wire Theft Reward Program, where rewards of $5,000 would be offered for information leading to felony grand theft charges and $1,000 for misdemeanor charges involving city-owned metal thefts, including copper wiring, plaques, streetlight parts and more."

    "summary": "A new court filing by James Comey's attorneys definitively answers a lingering question about the criminal charges against the former FBI director: who is \"Person 3\"?",
    "story": [
      "A new court filing by James Comey's attorneys definitively answers a lingering question about the criminal charges against the former FBI director: Who is \"Person 3\"?",
      "The Department of Justice last month charged Comey with lying during a 2020 Senate hearing. The two-page indictment accuses the former FBI director of falsely telling lawmakers that he never gave anybody at the FBI permission to serve as an anonymous source in news reports about the bureau's investigation into Hillary Clinton. But it doesn't name the FBI staffer whom Comey allegedly authorized to leak, referring to them only as \"Person 3.\"",
      "In a motion filed Monday to dismiss the charges, Comey's lawyers wrote that last week, the government \"confirmed to the defense that \u2026 Person 3 refers to Daniel Richman.\"",
      "Richman, a longtime friend of Comey, is a Columbia University law professor and former federal prosecutor in New York. He served at one point as a \"special government employee\" at the FBI when Comey led the bureau.",
      "It's still unclear what information Richman is accused of leaking. The Justice Department has not charged Richman with a crime or accused him of any wrongdoing.",
      "Monday's filing \u2014 which argues Comey is the victim of a vindictive prosecution driven by President Trump's \"personal animus\" toward him \u2014 marks the first time that court papers have named the person the Justice Department believes Comey authorized to leak. Several media outlets had previously reported that Richman was \"Person 3.\"",
      "Richman's name did not come up in the Senate testimony that led to Comey's charges.",
      "Instead, the indictment focuses on a testy back-and-forth in 2020, when Republican Sen. Ted Cruz grilled Comey about whether he let a different person \u2014 former Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe \u2014 leak information about the Clinton probe to the Wall Street Journal. McCabe says he told Comey after the article came out that he authorized the leak, and Comey approved of it, but Comey has long insisted that no such conversation took place.",
      "Comey had previously told Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley at a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing in 2017 that he never authorized anyone to serve as an anonymous source in media coverage on the FBI's investigations into Clinton or Mr. Trump. Three years later, Cruz argued McCabe's statements about the Wall Street Journal leak contradicted that.",
      "\"Now, what Mr. McCabe is saying and what you testified to this committee cannot both be true. One or the other is false,\" Cruz said to Comey in 2020. \"Who's telling the truth?\"",
      "\"I can only speak to my testimony. I stand by the testimony,\" replied Comey.",
      "In Monday's filing, Comey's attorneys cast the fact that Cruz didn't ask about Richman as a fatal flaw in the government's case against the ex-FBI chief, who was charged with one count of making false statements to Congress and one count of obstructing a congressional investigation.",
      "The lawyers wrote: \"the indictment omits Senator Cruz's words that explicitly narrow the focus of his questions to Mr. McCabe and misleadingly implies that the questioning related to Mr. Richman.\"",
      "\"In other words, the indictment presents an inaccurate description of the testimony at the heart of this case,\" the court filing continued.",
      "His attorneys also argue the Justice Department's charges misquote Comey. The indictment says Comey falsely stated to the Senate that he hadn't \"authorized someone else at the FBI to be an anonymous source in news reports\" \u2014 but that exact phrase was actually used by Cruz and Grassley, not Comey. And the filing notes that Cruz used the phrase \"Clinton administration,\" not \"Clinton investigation.\"",
      "The filing says Comey is planning on asking for his false statement count to be dismissed \"based on a defense of literal truth.\" It referenced the Supreme Court case Bronston v. United States, which said people who make literally true statements under oath aren't guilty of perjury.",
      "CBS News has reached out to the Justice Department, Comey's attorneys and Richman for comment.",
      "What is Daniel Richman accused of doing?",
      "The indictment doesn't say what information the Justice Department believes Richman leaked to the media. It states only that Comey \"authorized PERSON 3 to serve as an anonymous source in news reports regarding an FBI investigation concerning PERSON 1.\"",
      "Comey's lawyers confirmed in Monday's filing that \"Person 1\" referred to Clinton.",
      "The filing points to one FBI leak investigation involving Comey and Richman called \"Arctic Haze,\" which was detailed in a memo declassified by the bureau earlier this year. Arctic Haze sought to figure out how classified details on the FBI's investigation into Clinton's use of a private email server made their way into a 2017 New York Times article, which looked at Comey's decision-making while leading the politically fraught probe.",
      "Richman was interviewed as part of Arctic Haze, according to the heavily redacted memo, which was published by the conservative-leaning site Just The News. The memo says Richman told FBI agents he had spoken with one of the authors of the Times article, but he didn't know how the reporter got a hold of the classified information, and Richman said he was \"sure 'with a discount'\" that he didn't tell the reporter himself.",
      "The memo describes Richman as Comey's \"liaison to the media,\" but also notes at one point: \"Richman later told the interviewing agents Comey never asked him to talk to the media.\"",
      "The Arctic Haze investigation closed without any charges. The memo said the probe \"has not yielded sufficient evidence to criminally charge any person, including Comey or Richman, with making false statements or with the substantive offenses under investigation.\"",
      "Separately, during the first Trump term, Comey was investigated by the Justice Department's inspector general for giving memos about his conversations with Mr. Trump to Richman, who then provided their contents to a Times reporter. The internal watchdog found that Comey \"violated applicable policies\" but did not release any classified information.",
      "Mr. Trump has accused Comey of leaks and other nefarious conduct for almost a decade, stretching back to when he fired Comey as FBI director in 2017. The president has long criticized how Comey handled the FBI's probes into Clinton and the Trump campaign. Comey, for his part, has called Mr. Trump \"morally unfit to be president.\"",
      "In Monday's court papers, Comey's lawyers asserted that Mr. Trump's longstanding \"personal spite\" led to the charges against him, which were filed shortly before the statute of limitations expired.",
      "\"No reasonable prosecutor would have brought such a deficient case; the only explanation is that the President's handpicked interim U.S. Attorney did so to carry out the President's wishes,\" they wrote in a 51-page filing, which also included a 60-page attachment listing all of the verbal barbs flung between Comey and Mr. Trump over the years."

      "The agents forced their way into the home without showing a warrant, Maga\u00f1a told CBS News.",
      "The raid occurred on Oct. 15. Maga\u00f1a, a native of Mexico, said she got a call from her children, who told her the agents were shouting for someone named Israel, but nobody in their home goes by that name. She said she told her children to lock themselves inside a room.",
      "With guns drawn, agents broke open the room's door. Maga\u00f1a's daughter took a video of the heavily-armed agents telling them to put their hands up as her daughter, a three-month-old baby, cried. One of the agents asked if any of the men inside the room were named Israel.",
      "Outside of the home, witnesses asked the federal officers for information.",
      "\"Stop watching TikTok. We don't have to identify ourselves to you,\" one agent was heard saying on video recorded by a witness.",
      "While federal officials have since admitted they were looking for someone else, agents still detained Maga\u00f1a's 20-year-old son and her partner, saying they were in the U.S. illegally. Maga\u00f1a said neither has a criminal record. Federal records reviewed by CBS News also indicate the men do not have any criminal charges or convictions.",
      "ICE's online detainee system indicated on Monday that Maga\u00f1a's son, Napoleon Maga\u00f1a, was being held at the agency's detention facility in Tacoma, Washington. Her partner, Arturo Garcia Cabrera, was transferred to the Adams County Correctional Center in Mississippi, the system showed.",
      "A senior Homeland Security official told CBS News the federal agents who entered Maga\u00f1a's home on Oct. 15 were looking for an individual with a criminal history who they say had evaded arrest and fled into the apartment complex. The target of the operation remains at large, the official said.",
      "\"Two other aliens from Mexico were found inside the apartment and taken into ICE custody at the scene,\" the official said, adding that no federal agents were hurt during the incident.",
      "As millions took to the streets over the weekend for \"No Kings\" protests, federal agents in Portland deployed tear gas to disperse a crowd that had gathered outside and ICE facility, where for months there have been demonstrations denouncing the agency's tactics as heavy-handed and indiscriminate.",
      "In an interview with CBS News in Portland, Marcos Charles, the head of ICE's deportation branch, Enforcement and Removal Operations, denied those charges.",
      "\"They're not indiscriminate,\" he told CBS News. \"We do our surveillance. If you're in the country illegally, we're gonna arrest you.\"",
      "Charles also downplayed concerns that ICE's tactics have become too aggressive.",
      "\"We use the force necessary to affect an arrest,\" he said. \"If people interpret that as being aggressive, so be it.\"",
      "Since President Trump took office again and launched a sweeping crackdown on illegal immigration, ICE agents have been given a broad mandate to detain and deport those in the U.S. illegally, with Biden-era limits on arrests of non-criminals reversed.",
      "Charles said ICE is still primarily targeting immigrants in the U.S. illegally who also have committed crimes. But he said anyone in the U.S. illegally who is found by his agents will be arrested, even if they lack a criminal record and have been in the country for 40 years.",
      "On Monday, an appeals court said the Trump administration could deploy National Guard troops to Portland to protect the ICE facility there while the legal battle over their deployment plays out.",
      "Some in the local community are seeking to help those who could be targeted by immigration agents, including Pastor Mark Knutson, who has put up signs saying ICE agents need permission to enter his church.",
      "\"We're not gonna hide people. What we're gonna create is a space to be safe,\" explained Knutson, who is a reverend doctor at the Augustana Lutheran Church. \"And then we work the systems to help them get their amnesty or get the documents.\"",

    "story": [
      "Attorneys for former FBI Director James Comey filed a slate of motions Monday seeking to have the two-count federal indictment against him dismissed before a potential trial date early next year, arguing he was charged because of \"President Trump's personal animus.\"",
      "Comey's attorney, Patrick Fitzgerald, moved to dismiss the case on the grounds that it is based on a vindictive and unlawful prosecution. He is also challenging the appointment of interim U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan to that role.",
      "Comey's attorneys wrote that the charges arose due to an \"egregious abuse of power,\" and there are \"multiple glaring constitutional violations\" in the indictment. They argued that Mr. Trump ordered prosecutors to charge Comey due to \"personal spite\" and because Comey had \"frequently criticized the President,\" who fired Comey from his role leading the FBI in 2017 and has sparred with Comey for years.",
      "The requests were expected, as Fitzgerald previewed them when he appeared alongside Comey during his arraignment earlier this month. He is expected to file a second tranche of filings to toss out the charges in the coming weeks.",
      "U.S. District Judge Michael Nachmanoff has set a hearing on the first set of motions for Nov. 19 in Alexandria, Virginia.",
      "Comey's attorneys said that even if the case is not dismissed for vindictive prosecution, \"concrete and objective facts justify thorough discovery into the suspect prosecutorial decision-making process that led to this flawed indictment and a hearing at which the government must justify its decision to bring these unfounded and retaliatory charges.\"",
      "His legal team says that \"absent a dismissal with prejudice, Mr. Comey would face a potential perpetual state of being vindictively prosecuted.\"",
      "In a separate motion, attorneys for Comey also argued that Halligan, the only attorney in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia to sign his indictment, \"was defectively appointed to her office as an interim U.S. Attorney.\"",
      "Arguing that \"no properly appointed\" official from the executive branch had obtained the indictment against Comey, his lawyers said \"the indictment is equally a nullity\" and should be dismissed.",
      "\"The President and Attorney General appointed the President's personal lawyer as interim U.S. Attorney in violation of a clear statutory command so that the interim U.S. Attorney could indict an outspoken critic of the President just days before the relevant statute of limitations was set to expire,\" Comey's lawyers wrote.",
      "A Justice Department spokesperson had no comment on the pair of motions.",
      "Prosecutors raise doubts about Comey's attorney",
      "Federal prosecutors also indicated Sunday that they may seek to have Fitzgerald disqualified because of his alleged involvement in a so-called plan by Comey to leak the contents of a memo to the media shortly after Mr. Trump fired him as FBI director in 2017, during the president's first term.",
      "\"[B]ased on publicly disclosed information, the defendant used current lead defense counsel to improperly disclose classified information,\" prosecutors Tyler Lemons and Gabriel Diaz, wrote in a filing. \"This fact raises a question of conflict and disqualification for current lead defense counsel.\"",
      "A Department of Justice Inspector General report found that Comey shared four memos with Fitzgerald in May 2017, who then forwarded them to two other lawyers working for Comey. Prosecutors are asking Nachmanoff to put in place a \"filter team\" to sift through evidence that may contain information shielded by attorney-client privilege and therefore cannot be disclosed.",
      "Prosecutors' use of material protected by privilege can raise obstacles in the case, ranging from disqualification of that material to mistrial or dismissal of charges. Filter teams are typically groups of government attorneys who review documents and separate privileged information from non-privileged information before the material gets to prosecutors on a given case.",
      "Prosecutors said the evidence at issue in Comey's case includes communications between him and several lawyers, one of whom appears to be Fitzgerald. They wrote in their latest filing that the material subject to review by the filter team \"could also inform a potential conflict and disqualification issue for\" Fitzgerald.",
      "But Comey's lawyers accused prosecutors of attempting to \"defame\" Fitzgerald and noted that the Justice Department's internal watchdog \"found no evidence that Comey or his attorneys released any of the classified information contained in any of the Memos to members of the media.\" The Justice Department in 2019 declined to prosecute Comey for his handling of the memos.",
      "Halligan is the latest DOJ prosecutor to face court challenges",
      "Comey was charged in September with one count of making false statements to Congress and one count of obstruction of justice, related to Senate testimony he gave five years ago. Comey pleaded not guilty to both counts at his arraignment.",
      "Because Comey is challenging Halligan's appointment to temporarily lead the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia, Nachsmanoff, who sits on the bench in the district, will have to recuse himself, and a judge from outside of the district will hear arguments on that motion.",
      "The challenge to Halligan's appointment comes after defendants in New Jersey and Nevada successfully challenged similar U.S. attorney appointments President Trump made in those two states in recent weeks, as the administration has attempted to bypass the Senate confirmation process for these positions around the country.",
      "A federal judge in August found that Mr. Trump's former personal lawyer, Alina Habba, is serving \"without lawful authority\" as the U.S. attorney in New Jersey. Weeks later, a federal judge ruled that Sigal Chattah, the top federal prosecutor in Nevada, was also serving illegally in her role.",
      "Halligan, one of Mr. Trump's former defense lawyers who later joined him in his second administration, was tapped as interim U.S. attorney in September after serving as a senior aide to Mr. Trump in the White House. Her appointment came days after Erik Siebert, who had been the top federal prosecutor in Eastern Virginia, resigned amid concerns he would be forced out for not prosecuting another of Mr. Trump's foe, New York Attorney General Letitia James, for alleged mortgage fraud.",
      "James was indicted in the Eastern District of Virginia earlier this month on one count of bank fraud and one count of making false statements to a financial institution. She has called the charges \"baseless.\"",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi has invoked a provision of federal law that addresses U.S. attorney vacancies to install people in these posts temporarily. The law allows an appointee to serve 120 days as interim U.S. attorney and gives district court judges in the area the authority to keep them in the role or tap a new U.S. attorney to serve until the vacancy is filled.",
      "In the case of the Eastern District of Virginia, Siebert was installed as the interim U.S. attorney in January, and the judges there had extended his appointment as U.S. attorney for the region in May.",
      "But in the challenge to Habba's appointment to lead the New Jersey U.S. Attorney's Office earlier this year, U.S. District Judge Matthew Brann found that the attorney general is given 120 total days to appoint an interim U.S. attorney. The judge agreed that the law allows different individuals to be appointed interim U.S. attorney, \"but for an aggregate term of 120 days.\"",
      "Allowing the 120-day clock to reset with the selection of each new temporary U.S. attorney would allow the president \"to staff the United States Attorney's office with individuals of his personal choice for an entire term without seeking the Senate's advice and consent,\" Brann wrote.",
      "While that conclusion does not bind the judge who will consider the validity of Halligan's appointment in Virginia, Fitzpatrick's motion points to Habba's case as part of the government's attempt to \"end run\" Congress' authority on judicial nominations and appointments, adding: \"This Court should reject the government's machinations here.\"",
      "Comey charged after sparring with Trump for years",
      "Comey has long been a political opponent of Mr. Trump's, and the president has for years taken to social media to attack the former FBI director. Mr. Trump has lambasted Comey for his handling of the FBI's investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election and alleged ties between Russia and Mr. Trump's associates. Mr. Trump fired Comey in May 2017, and Robert Mueller, who was named special counsel just over a week after Comey's ouster, then took over the probe.",
      "The indictment of the former FBI chief came days after Mr. Trump took to social media to voice frustration with Bondi for not bringing criminal charges against Comey and two other political opponents: James and California Sen. Adam Schiff, both Democrats.",
      "In his message to Bondi, Mr. Trump called the trio \"guilty as hell\" and wrote, \"We can't delay any longer, it's killing our reputation and credibility. They impeached me twice, and indicted me (5 times!), OVER NOTHING. JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!\"",
      "While claims of selective or vindictive prosecution are difficult to prevail on, former prosecutors have said the circumstances surrounding Comey's indictment could be a boon to his lawyers in having the charges tossed out.",
      "Selective prosecution is when the prosecutor appears motivated by discriminatory intent, and vindictive prosecution is when the government acts out of \"genuine\" animus or seeks to punish a defendant for exercising a legal right.",
      "Fitzgerald said at Comey's arraignment that there will be another slate of motions filed by Nov. 20 also challenging the case against him, including claims of grand jury abuse and \"outrageous conduct\" by the Justice Department.",
      "Grounds for a motion alleging abuse of the grand jury process can include possible improper legal instructions given by the prosecutor to the grand jury, an intentional withholding of information that would exonerate the defendant or indictments obtained as a means of retaliation."

    "story": [
      "The fragile peace deal President Trump spearheaded between Israel and Hamas in Gaza appeared on Monday to have survived serious threats over the weekend. The top U.S. officials who helped negotiate the ceasefire and hostage release agreement \u2014   senior envoy Steve Witkoff and Mr. Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner \u2014 were back in Israel on Monday to help ensure it does not unravel.",
      "Israel struck multiple targets inside Gaza after a deadly attack on Israeli soldiers. Hamas has rejected Israel's claim that it was involved in that attack.",
      "On Monday, the skies over Gaza were quiet again in the wake of the gravest threat since the ceasefire there came into effect on Oct. 10. Hamas and Israel accused each other of violating the terms of Mr. Trump's peace plan over the weekend, but both sides recommitted to the process on Monday.",
      "For a couple tense days, however, war was back in Gaza. Local health officials in the Hamas-ruled Palestinian territory said 45 people were killed in Israeli strikes.",
      "Speaking Monday in Israel's parliament, the Knesset, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the military had dropped almost 169 tons of bombs in Gaza over the weekend.",
      "\"One of our hands holds a weapon, the other hand is stretched out for peace,\" he told lawmakers. \"You make peace with the strong, not the weak. Today Israel is stronger than ever before.\"",
      "The Israel Defense Forces said it launched the attack after two soldiers were killed when Hamas operatives opened fire with an RPG.",
      "As mediators raced to get the peace process back on track, President Trump said the situation would be \"handled toughly, but properly,\" and added that in his view, the ceasefire remained in effect.",
      "Over the weekend, Palestinian families had come out to enjoy a quiet moment at a seaside caf\u00e9 in Gaza, when cameras captured the moment that an Israeli strike shattered the peace.",
      "Many feared the blood-soaked scenes left in the wake of the explosions were a sign that two years of relentless violence had resumed after just a week.",
      "\"We were drinking tea,\" said Salih Salman, \"when suddenly people were bombed.\"",
      "Once again Gaza's crippled hospitals filled up with dozens of injured in the wake of multiple Israeli strikes.",
      "The IDF said it was targeting Hamas forces responsible for ceasefire violations, and it provided video purportedly showing armed Hamas fighters moving toward Israeli troops.",
      "A media center in central Gaza was among the locations bombed, with the strike killing a cameraman and an engineer, and wounding three other people.",
      "\"We are all journalists here,\" protested Ajeb Mohamed at the scene. \"No-one else can even enter here.\"",
      "More than 220 journalists and media workers have been killed in Gaza since the war started, according to the international advocacy group Reporters Without Borders.",
      "Amid the renewed fighting and accusations over the weekend, an Israeli official said all humanitarian aid deliveries into Gaza would be suspended. On Monday, however, COGAT, the Israeli government agency that handles affairs in the Palestinian territories, told CBS News that the Kerem Shalom border crossing was open for aid to transit.",
      "The United Nations and a number of humanitarian aid agencies have called repeatedly since the ceasefire came into effect for Israel to open all of the border crossings into Gaza to allow far more food, water, medicine, building materials and other essential items in.",
      "The ingress of aid \u2014 which under the U.S. peace plan should be maximized under the ceasefire \u2014   is likely to be among the key issues as Witkoff and Kushner meet with Israeli officials this week to ensure the process stays on track. Vice President JD Vance is also due in Israel this week, and set to meet with Netanyahu.",
      "Netanyahu met Monday with Witkoff and Kushner to discuss \"developments and updates in the region,\" Shosh Bedrosian, a spokeswoman for Netanyahu's office said Monday.",
      "She added that Vance and his wife were also expected in the country \"for a few days and will be meeting with the prime minister,\" but neither she nor the White House have confirmed the Vances' arrival date.",
      "Witkoff and Kushner were entrusted by Mr. Trump to broker the peace deal, and in an exclusive interview with 60 Minutes that aired on Sunday, they said an apology phone call from Netanyahu to Qatar's leader, about unprecedented airstrikes on the U.S. ally's capital, Doha, and a moment of personal connection between Witkoff and Hamas' top negotiator marked two key turning points that led to the ceasefire."

      "Former President Joe Biden has completed a round of radiation therapy to treat an aggressive form of prostate cancer \u2014 an encouraging sign of progress \u2014 but one that does not signal the end of his treatment.",
      "A Biden spokeswoman confirmed to CBS News Monday that the former president, who turns 83 next month, finished several weeks of radiation therapy treatment Monday at Penn Medicine Radiation Oncology in Philadelphia. His office first announced Oct. 11 that the former president had been undergoing radiation treatment for prostate cancer for several weeks.",
      "\"He rang the bell today,\" Biden spokeswoman Kelly Scully said.",
      "Ashley Biden, the daughter of the former president,\u00a0posted on Instagram\u00a0a quick video clip of her father ringing the bell, with the caption, \"Rung the bell! Thank you to the incredible doctors, nurses, and staff at Penn Medicine. We are so grateful!\"",
      "Subsequent photos posted by the one-time first daughter show the former president posing with a medical professional, and another with former first lady Jill Biden and two of their grandchildren with the caption, \"Dad has been so damn brave throughout his treatment. Grateful.\"",
      "Most cancer treatment centers encourage patients to ring a wall-mounted bell when they complete cancer treatment to signal their progress and encouragement to other patients. But it is unclear at this time whether Biden will need to undergo any other treatment, since doctors always need to assess a patient's progress in the weeks after they complete cancer treatment.",

      "Gleason scores are a grading system, and the lower the grade, the more cancer cells look like normal cells. A score of 9 is the second-highest,\u00a0CBS News previously reported, and places Biden in the most aggressive risk category.",
      "Prostate cancer is the second-most common cancer that affects men, according to the\u00a0Cleveland Clinic. Age is the most common risk factor. The condition has many forms of treatment, including radiation, chemotherapy, surgery and hormone treatment.",
      "Biden also\u00a0underwent a skin cancer surgery\u00a0in September 2025. That procedure was a Mohs surgery, which involves cutting away thin layers of skin until only cancer-free tissue remains in the affected area.",
      "The former president is occasionally spotted in Washington, where he still keeps an office, and aboard Amtrak trains to and from his home in Delaware. He has begun fundraising and planning for an eventual library and museum documenting his time in the White House."

    "summary": "A divided panel of judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit ruled in favor of the Trump administration.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal appeals court on Monday cleared the way for the Trump administration to mobilize and deploy members of the Oregon National Guard to Portland while a legal challenge moves forward.",
      "A divided panel of three judges on U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit agreed to freeze a lower court order that had blocked the Trump administration from sending Oregon National Guard troops to Portland to protect federal immigration personnel and property.",
      "In its 2-1 ruling, the majority found the Trump administration is likely to prevail on the merits of its appeal by establishing that President Trump lawfully invoked a law known as Title 10 to bring Oregon's National Guard into federal service and send them to Portland.",
      "\"The statute delegates the authority to make that determination to the President and does not limit the facts and circumstances that the President may consider in doing so,\" Judges Ryan Nelson and Bridget Bade, both appointed to the 9th Circuit by Mr. Trump, said in the opinion for the court.",
      "The judges found that the \"rather than reviewing the president's determination with great deference,\" the district court \"substituted\" its own findings related to the circumstances in Portland.",
      "\"Considering the totality of the circumstances, there is a colorable basis for the President's determination that he is unable with regular forces to execute the laws of the United States,\" the majority found.",
      "Judge Susan Graber dissented and urged the full 9th Circuit to reconsider the case \"before the illegal deployment of troops under false pretenses can occur.\"",
      "Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield echoed Graber's call and encouraged the Portland community to ensure the city remains \"peaceful and safe\" while the legal proceedings continue.",
      "\"Today's ruling, if allowed to stand, would give the president unilateral power to put Oregon soldiers on our streets with almost no justification,\" he said in a statement. \"We are on a dangerous path in America.\"",
      "U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut, appointed by Mr. Trump, had issued two temporary orders earlier this month regarding the president's federalization and deployment of National Guard members. The first forbade the administration from mobilizing Oregon National Guard troops and sending them to Portland, a decision that was appealed to the 9th Circuit. But the second prevented the administration from deploying any federalized National Guard members in Oregon.",
      "The Justice Department did not appeal that second decision, arguing instead that because it relies on the same legal reasoning as the first order regarding the Oregon National Guard, the district court would be required to dissolve it if the Trump administration succeeded in their bid for emergency relief. The 9th Circuit said in its decision that it agrees with the Trump administration that \"the first TRO and the second TRO rise or fall together on the merits of the issues raised in this motion for a stay pending appeal.\"",
      "The dispute involving Portland began in late September, when the president directed the Defense Department to coordinate the deployment of National Guard troops to Oregon. Mr. Trump's move came in response to protests outside of an immigration facility in Portland, some of which have turned violent. The president said on social media that he was sending in troops to protect the \"war ravaged\" city and immigration facilities from \"Antifa and other domestic terrorists,\" and was authorizing \"full force, if necessary.\"",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth then issued a directive placing 200 members of the Oregon National Guard under federal control to protect immigration personnel and property at the immigration facility in Portland.",
      "Oregon officials, however, objected to the deployment, and they filed a lawsuit arguing that Mr. Trump lacked the authority to federalize the Oregon National Guard. Immergut, the district judge presiding over the case, swiftly issued a temporary order blocking the Trump administration from implementing the September directive that ordered the federalization and deployment of the Oregon National Guard.",
      "The judge found that Mr. Trump's determination that the National Guard had to be federalized because of the situation on the ground in Portland was \"untethered to the facts,\" and said that while the president is entitled to significant deference, that is \"not equivalent to ignoring the facts on the ground.\"",
      "But following that order, the Trump administration said it would be sending 300 members of California's National Guard to Portland. Mr. Trump had deployed members of the state's National Guard in Los Angeles in response to protests over immigration enforcement actions, and the 9th Circuit allowed their continued deployment in June.",
      "Immergut issued her second decision blocking the Trump administration from deploying any federalized National Guard members, which the Justice Department did not appeal.",
      "Mr. Trump has relied on as law known as Title 10 to bring members of state-run National Guards under federal control and has sought to deploy troops to Los Angeles, Memphis, Portland and Chicago. The law allows the president to federalize members of any state's Guard when he cannot execute U.S. laws with the regular forces or when there is a \"rebellion or danger of a rebellion\" against the government.",
      "In its decision, the 9th Circuit ruled that \"there is a colorable basis for the President's determination that he is unable with regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.\"",
      "The judges found that the district court discounted \"violent and disruptive events\" that occurred between June and August, some of which forced the closure of the ICE facility for several weeks. The president, they said, is \"entitled, and indeed, duty-bound, to evaluate the entire context of events leading up a decision to invoke\" Title 10.",
      "Mr. Trump's efforts to send National Guard troops to major U.S. cities has divided federal appeals courts. While the 9th Circuit has sided with the president in the early stages of cases challenging the president's deployment of troops from the Oregon and California National Guards, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit has prevented the administration from sending Illinois National Guard troops into Chicago.",
      "The Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to intervene, setting up an early test of the president's authority to mobilize and deploy National Guard troops over the objections of local leaders."

    "summary": "The Australian prime minister said the critical minerals deal takes the U.S.-Australia relationship \"to the next level.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese signed a critical minerals deal at the White House on Monday, as the U.S. eyes the country's rich rare earth resources while China is imposing tougher rules on exporting its own minerals abroad.",
      "Mr. Trump said the deal, which will entail up to $8.5 billion in projects, had been negotiated over several months. Albanese said the deal would take the U.S.-Australia relationship \"to the next level.\"",
      "\"In about a year from now we'll have so much critical mineral and rare earth that you won't know what to do with them,\" Mr. Trump said, seated alongside Albanese. \"They'll be worth $2.\"",
      "Critical minerals include some of the elements necessary for modern technology, including lithium and silicon. They also include rare earth elements, which are used to make magnets that are used in defense and aerospace technology.",
      "The White House says the U.S. and Australian governments intend to invest more than $3 billion in critical minerals projects in the next six months. But the framework released by the Australians says the two countries will invest $1 billion in the next six months. The framework the Australians released says the two countries will work together to accelerate the secure supply of critical minerals for defense manufacturing, streamline or deregulate the permitting process for critical minerals and rare earths, protect domestic critical minerals and rare earth markets from unfair trade and address gaps in key supply chains, among other things.",
      "The U.S.-Australia deal comes after Beijing announced it will require foreign companies to get approval from the Chinese government to export magnets containing even trace amounts of rare earth materials that originated from China or were produced with Chinese technology. The Trump administration says this gives China broad power over the global economy by controlling the tech supply chain. The move led Mr. Trump to threaten an additional 100% tariff on Chinese goods.",
      "The Trump administration and the president himself have been focused on securing rare earths deals, in part to find alternatives to China. Earlier this year, Mr. Trump struck a deal with Ukraine to\u00a0give the U.S. access to that country's minerals.",
      "Albanese said the critical minerals deal also signals the strong partnership between the U.S. and Australia.",
      "\"We are great friends and we're great allies,\" Albanese said Monday. \"And this is a relationship that's been forged in the battlefields of the world. We have stood side by side for freedom and democracy.\"",
      "The White House said Australia is also making new defense investments, including the purchase of $1.2 billion in unmanned underwater vehicles. Since February, the White House said Australia has contributed $1 billion to modernize the U.S. submarine industrial base. A trilateral security partnership called AUKUS involving the U.S., Australia and the United Kingdom \u2014 which was first struck during the Biden administration \u2014 aims to counter China in the Indo-Pacific, and producing submarines for that region is a key part of that security alliance.",
      "\"We have the best submarines in the world, anywhere in the world,\" Mr. Trump said Monday."

You leave it the way it is right now,\" Mr. Trump told reporters Sunday on Air Force One, apparently referring specifically to the Donbas region. \"They can negotiate something later on down the line. But I said cut and stop at the battle line. Go home. Stop fighting, stop killing people.\"",
      "The Donbas is a culturally and economically significant region, where many people speak Russian and have sympathies with Moscow. It is home to much of Ukraine's heavy industry and mining, accounting for about 16% of the country's GDP before the war started, according to The Associated Press.",
      "His remarks came two days after Mr. Trump met in person with Zelenskyy at the White House, which was a day after he spoke on the phone for two hours with Putin.",
      "Zelenskyy appeared to reiterate Kyiv's unwillingness to cede any territory for a ceasefire on Sunday, meanwhile, saying he had urged European leaders to apply \"the right kind of pressure\" on Russia.",
      "\"Almost every day now, we are communicating with leaders to ensure that we have a common position, all of us in Europe, on putting pressure on Russia \u2014 the right kind of pressure. We will grant the aggressor no gifts and forget nothing,\" Zelenskyy said in\u00a0a social media post.",

      "\"None of us should put pressure on Zelenskyy when it comes to territorial concessions,\" he said in a\u00a0social media post. \"We should all put pressure on Russia to stop its aggression. Appeasement never was a road to a just and lasting peace.\"",

      "In response to a request for comment on the report of a second heated exchange between the leaders, the White House referred CBS News on Monday to Mr. Trump's remarks to reporters on Air Force One, without providing any additional description of the meeting.

      "Mr. Trump said in a post on his own Truth Social media platform that his meeting with the Ukrainian leader was \"very interesting, and cordial.\"",

      "The president had spoken on Thursday with Putin by phone. Following that lengthy discussion, the White House said Mr. Trump would hold a second bilateral summit with Putin in Hungary's capital, Budapest, at a still-to-be-confirmed date to discuss a possible ceasefire deal. Mr. Trump said it would likely happen within a couple weeks.",
      "It will be their second bilateral meeting this year, following in-person talks in Alaska in August. That diplomatic effort by Mr. Trump yielded no tangible results, as Moscow has continued to press its military campaign, taking more territory on the ground and bombarding Ukrainian cities from the air. Putin has also so far declined Mr. Trump's urging to hold a three-way meeting with Zelenskyy.",
      "U.S. and Ukrainian officials told CBS News that\u00a0Zelenskyy had hoped Mr. Trump would agree to a deal at Friday's meeting to supply Tomahawk missiles, but that has not yet materialized. Kyiv sees the long-range, guided cruise missiles as vital to give Ukraine's armed forces the ability to hit critical military, logistical and energy targets deep inside Russia.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. military struck another alleged drug-carrying vessel on Friday, killing three people, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced on Sunday. It is the seventh known attack since last month.",
      "Hegseth said Friday's strike targeted a boat linked to Ej\u00e9rcito de Liberaci\u00f3n Nacional, a Colombian guerrilla group that the U.S. has considered a terrorist organization since the 1990s. He alleged in a post on X that the boat \"was traveling along a known narco-trafficking route, and was transporting substantial amounts of narcotics.\"",
      "The defense secretary said the strike took place in international waters and within the U.S. Southern Command's area of responsibility, which includes the Caribbean Sea.",
      "\"The United States military will treat these organizations like the terrorists they are\u2014they will be hunted, and killed, just like Al Qaeda,\" Hegseth wrote.",
      "At least 32 people have been killed in U.S. strikes on alleged drug boats. The Trump administration has said the U.S. is in a \"non-international armed conflict\" with drug cartels, arguing that the narcotics they smuggle kill tens of thousands of Americans every year, constituting an \"armed attack.\"",
      "\"When they're loaded up with drugs, they're fair game, and every one of those ships were,\" President Trump told reporters last week.",
      "The strikes have drawn some pushback from lawmakers who have pressed for more evidence that the boats were carrying drugs, and argue the administration hasn't made the case that the attacks are legally permitted.",
      "Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona told \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday that he believed the legal justification offered to members of Congress was \"very convoluted.\"",
      "\"They had a very hard time explaining to us ... the legal rationale for doing this and the constitutionality of doing it,\" Kelly said. \"The brief we got had a tremendous number of holes in it, and they had to go round and around to give us the legal rationale for doing this.\"",
      "The Venezuelan and Colombian governments have also criticized the strikes. This weekend, Colombian President Gustavo Petro accused the U.S. of hitting a fishing vessel in one of its strikes. Mr. Trump later called Petro an \"illegal drug leader\" and threatened to cut off U.S. aid to the South American country."

      "And this week on Face the Nation: Tensions build in the Caribbean. Plus, is there an end in sight to the government shutdown?",
      "As he pushes for peace in Ukraine and the Middle East, President Trump is leaning in the opposite direction on Venezuela, with U.S. forces killing 29 people accused of drug trafficking in six strikes on vessels since September, and the president offering a stark warning to Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "DONALD TRUMP (President of the United States): He's offered everything. You're right. You know why? Because he doesn't want to (EXPLETIVE DELETED) around with the United States.",

      "It's all just ahead on Face the Nation.",
      "Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation. We have a lot to get to today.",
      "And we begin with Arizona Democratic Senator Mark Kelly, who's here in studio with us.",
      "Good morning to you, Senator.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY (D-Arizona): Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: A lot to get to. I want to start on what you are seeing as a member of Senate Armed Services and the Intelligence Committee.",
      "There are about 10,000 U.S. forces now that are built up in the Caribbean area either on ships or in Puerto Rico. Three B-2 \u2013 B-52 bombers flew near Venezuela last week. There have now been six maritime strikes by U.S. Special Operations forces.",
      "What is this adding up to? Is the Trump administration planning regime change in Venezuela?",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: Well, I hope not. Regime change hasn't ever really worked out well for us as a nation where we have supported that, whether it was in Vietnam, Cuba, Iraq, Afghanistan. It doesn't go the way we think, and it puts a tremendous number of Americans in harm's way, the U.S. military, the guys flying those missions now in B-52s close to the coast.",
      "Those folks are at risk, members of the United States Navy now in this operation, which is clearly, traditionally a law enforcement operation, now escalating to something maybe, as the president talks about, regime change. I think this is the wrong move for this president. The Coast Guard has the resources to do this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: To interdict drug traffickers.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: To interdict drugs. That's the way this has traditionally been done, and I do worry about the legal authorities or lack thereof that the United States military has to conduct these kind of strikes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you have been briefed on what legal authorities are being invoked. Do you think they are insufficient at this point?",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: They \u2013 they had a very hard time explaining to us the rationale, the legal rationale, for doing this and the constitutionality of doing it, when you consider what \u2013 the law of warfare, especially at sea.",
      "It was a very convoluted argument. It also included, by the way, a secret list of over 20 narco organizations, drug trafficking cartels. But they wouldn't share with us the list. So the brief we got was \u2013 had a tremendous number of holes in it, and they had to go around and around to give us the legal rationale for doing this.",
      "And what I worry about, Margaret, are all these young military personnel that might find out months from now that what they did was illegal. And then you get to, what are we trying to accomplish here? We want to keep fentanyl out of the United States.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: And I don't know how widely known this is, but those routes through the Caribbean on boats are predominantly used to bring cocaine to Europe.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: To Europe, not to U.S. shores.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: Yes. That's right. Fentanyl tends to come from a different way. And we do want to keep fentanyl out of the United States.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But to this point you just said, the legality of what's being done, CBS reporting indicates that the commander who was running Southern Command, Admiral Alvin Holsey, was pressured to leave his command post early just a year into a four-year post and that there were tensions with Secretary Hegseth that were leading up to that departure, which Hegseth characterized as just a retirement.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You speak to the top officers. Can they, with confidence, refuse unlawful orders without fear of retribution or even losing their pensions?",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: Well, I don't know about losing their pension, but they should.",
      "This is more important than any single person. This is about our democracy at this point. And those admirals and generals, they need to speak truth to power. I have had conversations with the most senior members of our military about this specific thing. They cannot be breaking the law.",
      "Doesn't matter if the president or the secretary of defense tells them to do something. If it's against the law, they have to say no. They're not required to follow an unlawful order. So we expect that from them. I don't know the exact circumstances, why the admiral quit. He hasn't said publicly yet. I expect, in time, we're going to find out more.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you think he did quit? It wasn't just a retirement suddenly?",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: I don't know. He \u2013 they could have forced him out. He could have quit. He could have said, hey, you're not accepting my advice. You need somebody else in here.",
      "I don't know. I hate to speculate about it. He had a long service in the U.S. military\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Thirty-seven years.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: \u2026 highly decorated and a tremendous leader. I appreciate his service to this country.",
      "All of us\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: \u2026 all U.S. citizens would be better served if this administration listened to the advice of those military leaders, especially the secretary of defense, who thinks he is really good at this. He should have never had this job. He was unqualified for the job.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well\u2026",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: And, in my view, the president should have fired him multiple times.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: On Ukraine, you have been an outspoken supporter of it. Some of the pilots train in your state.",
      "After President Zelenskyy met with President Trump on Friday, he said they sort of agreed to disagree on whether to get these long-range missiles, these Tomahawks that would allow them to fire into Russia. Where does that stand? President Biden wouldn't do this either.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: Yes.",
      "So I spoke to Zelenskyy three weeks ago in New York right after his meeting with Donald Trump.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: And we talked about Tomahawks in that meeting, much longer range, over 1,000 miles, 700-kil \u2013 700-pound warhead. They're really good.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Game-changing?",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: Game-changing.",
      "The president said he would consider giving them these\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: This weapon system, and then he had a conversation with Vladimir Putin.",
      "And I think it's important for people to recognize Vladimir Putin is a former KGB officer. He is a master manipulator. The president has one view. Then he talks to Vladimir Putin, and he changes his story on this. Of course Putin does not want Ukraine to get\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: \u2026 a longer-range missile that could go after targets deep into Russia, beyond Moscow and St. Petersburg, by the way. It can range targets much further. It's very accurate. It's a very survivable weapon.",
      "And Putin has a conversation with him and those weapons are now off the table. Hey, I think Ukraine can handle \u2013 if we can give them enough rounds, if we have them in our inventory and enough launchers\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: Ground launchers are rather new to the system, something we got rid of for a long period of time.",
      "They have demonstrated their ability to operate a sophisticated weapon system like the F-16. They could handle this, and it would help.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Zelenskyy says they're going to continue to try to persuade President Trump.",
      "I have to ask you about the shutdown. The Republican leader, John Thune, has offered to sit down with Democrats to discuss Obamacare, but on the condition that Democrats end the shutdown. He posted this on social media.",
      "Can you bank this as a win and agree to start negotiations?",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: That's what we want. We want negotiations on how to fix\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is this enough?",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: \u2026 how to \u2013 I didn't look at his tweet, but what we need is to fix this skyrocketing premium.",
      "They're going to go up on November 1 for people. They can't afford it. People in my state\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Either way, they're going up .",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: I have talked to so many people.",
      "This woman Emily (sp?), whose husband's a pastor, who has three kids, says, without the Affordable Care Act, she cannot have insurance for her children. They don't get it through his work. So what we need to do is fix this health care premium issue and open the government.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But don't you need to do that before November 1, when premiums go up?",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you going to end the shutdown before November 1?",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: I would like to. I would like to \u2013 we should \u2013 we could \u2013 we should be able to wrap this up this week if they will sit down and have a negotiation with us.",
      "The president has spent one hour negotiating this issue with leadership in Congress.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: That's it, one hour. They need to get in the room and stay in the room until we can hash this out.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: The president has said he wants to fix this premium thing and he wants the government open. That's what we want.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we will see if there's progress this week. Senator, thank you for your time.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to Republican Senator Katie Britt, who joins us from Tuscaloosa, Alabama.",
      "Welcome to Face the Nation, Senator.",
      "SENATOR KATIE BRITT (R-Alabama): Thank you so much for having me, Margaret. I appreciate it. Look forward to being on here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to talk about a lot of things, but let me just pick up where Senator Kelly left off on the shutdown.",
      "He said, hey, you could all hash this out this week. Leader Thune made that offer. I know you have said you also are concerned insurance premiums are going to go up, whether Congress extends the tax credits related to Obamacare that Democrats are campaigning for or not here, basically.",
      "Do you want this extended?",
      "SENATOR KATIE BRITT: First off, Margaret, we need to reopen the government. Democrats need to come to the table and do the right thing.",
      "Just as I have been traveling the state this weekend, I have heard countless stories of people who are not getting a paycheck, whether it's our men and women in uniform or those who serve alongside them, or whether we're talking to veterans or we're talking to just a number of people, when we're looking what's happening with WIC.",
      "There are a lot of people that are being affected by the Democrats playing politics, and they need to actually do what's right, and that is work for the American people. And so getting the government open is number one. So we need to vote on this C.R. and open the government back up.",
      "We have also given alternatives like end government shutdown. And I think you will see this week, if the Democrats don't come to the table, saying, look, a Shutdown Fairness Act, making sure that the people who are working are actually getting paychecks, because, Margaret, these have real consequences for American people.",
      "And when we're talking about the ACA, look, Leader Thune said it best. We have always said we will have a conversation about this. We believe that you can walk and chew gum at the same time. Democrats, for some reason, don't think that that's possible.",
      "They need to come to the table, open the government back up, and then we're happy to have a conversation about the broken system that they created and help them get out of their own mess.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you do personally think the federal government should be offsetting some of these costs? Because we looked at the numbers, and I think it's like 130,000 Alabamans are at risk of losing insurance if the tax credit goes away.",
      "SENATOR KATIE BRITT: Margaret, let's be honest about this. Let's go back to Obamacare, 2010.",
      "This is the Affordable Air \u2013 Affordable Care Act that even \"The Washington Post\" has said was never really affordable.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR KATIE BRITT: You go to 2014, and what you see there though was increases made by the Democrats.",
      "And then these increases that we're talking about right now, insurance companies have said only account for about 4 percent of what they're talking about increasing in 2026. The underlying issue is the brokenness of Obamacare. That is the problem.",
      "And so, when you think about this, you have got the 2021 premiums that they have given to everyone. Do you understand Democrats are actually asking for us to continue premiums that are going to millionaires in some cases? We have got to be more \u2013 more responsible with taxpayer dollars.",
      "And if you want these health care systems to even be able to work, then we have to have a larger conversation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Sure.",
      "SENATOR KATIE BRITT: But this is absolutely, totally ridiculous to sit here and say we're afraid people cannot afford their health care, but at the same time we're going to deny them their paycheck.",
      "Those two things do not match up. And Democrats need to actually be honest about it and get the government back open. And we're happy to have conversations, as we have always said, just as Leader Thune reiterated this week.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You were in the Oval Office discussing another health care matter with President Trump this past week.",
      "He credited you with announcing \u2013 well, basically explaining to him that February 2024 decision by an Alabama court that ruled frozen embryos are children. He called it a bad decision, and we all probably remember what it did for those families trying to go through fertilization treatment at that time.",
      "With the changes that were announced, who's going to be able to afford this now?",
      "SENATOR KATIE BRITT: Look, millions more people are going to be able to afford this because of President Trump's leadership.",
      "From the very first time I talked to him about this, Margaret, he has been steadfast and unwavering, understanding that there are people from coast to coast that have been praying to be able to start their family or expand their family.",
      "And because of infertility, here in the United States, we have seen one in eight families that are actually struggling with infertility issues. We have got about 9 percent of men, 11 percent of women who are facing these challenges.",
      "President Trump believes in being obviously the president that is helping hardworking Americans, helping parents, helping families. He's turned the Republican Party into that, which is so exciting. And we want to make sure that they're going to be able to do that at a greater scale.",
      "And so that's exactly what this will do. Millions more will have access. And, additionally, we're going to drive the costs down.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR KATIE BRITT: And so I talked this weekend actually with a friend of mine who came up to me and said, \"I cannot tell you how much I appreciate this,\" because the affordability issue was the impediment.",
      "And she actually had to go off \u2013 off \u2013 off \u2013 over shores\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR KATIE BRITT: \u2026 overseas to try to be able to bring life into this world. So it's exciting for people like her.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR KATIE BRITT: And I have had grandparents and parents and moms and dads tell me what a game changer this is for them as they start and grow their family.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, one cycle of IVF can cost between $15,000 to $20,000, and lower-income women obviously have a challenge with that.",
      "But, during the campaign, President Trump said he was going to make the government pay for it or make insurance companies pay for it. So do you think that the Affordable Care Act, that Obamacare, for example, should cover it, or is it too controversial for conservatives, who have a moral issue with IVF?",
      "SENATOR KATIE BRITT: Well, Margaret, first, I mean, the Affordable Care Act is broken. And that is what we're seeing right now. I mean, you have seen the increases that people will see in 2026, 80 percent of those are just Obamacare, Affordable Care Act-related.",
      "And so we clearly see that the underlying structure of this program is not sustainable and is not working for the American people. No one is paying less now that Obamacare is in place.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR KATIE BRITT: And so we have got to be super honest about that.",
      "We also have to make sure that we're being responsible moving forward. What President Trump has done is made this accessible to millions more people. He's going to continue leading on this issue and so many others\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It's still not free. It's still not free, right?",
      "SENATOR KATIE BRITT: \u2026 and actually support hardworking families.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, do you want to legislate, though, to force it to be?",
      "SENATOR KATIE BRITT: Well, and what we're doing too \u2013 what I want to do is, I want as many people as possible to have opportunity to bring life into this world, and that's exactly what this is doing.",
      "We will continue to work on this issue. We also want to support families as they have children and are able to \u2013 in this environment right now, we hear from people all the time, whether it is bringing life into this world, whether it is the childcare cost, just the affordability aspect.",
      "And I am so proud to see President Trump lead on these. Actually, if you look at the Working Families Tax Cut, Margaret, this is the very first time we have actually increased the childcare tax credits\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR KATIE BRITT: \u2026 and also the DCAP tax credits in 20 years in some instances and 40 in others.",
      "So we're trying to make sure that people can not only bring life into this world, but that it's more affordable when they get here, because we want people to start and grow their families.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Really\u2026",
      "SENATOR KATIE BRITT: That's what this is doing. This is just the start, and look forward to continuing to work for the American people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Really quickly, you have been trying to label Russia a state sponsor of terrorism for stealing Ukrainian children.",
      "SENATOR KATIE BRITT: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Does the president's decision to meet with Vladimir Putin endanger your efforts to get this bill passed?",
      "SENATOR KATIE BRITT: Look, I am grateful for President Trump's efforts on this.",
      "If you look back, we are in this war because of President Biden. If President Biden had sent the weaponry needed to Ukraine on the front end, when we saw Russia building up, we wouldn't be in this war to start with. When you're looking at what President Trump has done, he has met with Zelenskyy more times in his nine months in office\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR KATIE BRITT: \u2026 than President Biden did his entire time.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But do you have support to bring it to the floor?",
      "SENATOR KATIE BRITT: So, these conversations help us to have resolution.",
      "The \u2013 the \u2013 well, the first lady obviously has been leading on this. We have built up support. We're having a hearing next week. I think you will see this come to the floor if there is not a resolution in the short order, because we believe in bringing these children home.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SENATOR KATIE BRITT: Margaret, it's about 20,000 children that have been stolen from their homes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR KATIE BRITT: This is something everyone should be able to get behind and Vladimir Putin should pay the price for.",

      "CHRISTINE LAGARDE: In transformation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Transformation.",
      "CHRISTINE LAGARDE: Transformation, I think caused by a couple of things. One is the tariffs, which have changed the map of trade around the world and reconstituted new alliances and reformed the way in which we trade with each other. I think the second major transformation is the impact of artificial intelligence on everything we do from data management to dating and everything in between.",

      "We return to our conversation with European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde.",
      "You said the economy is this transformation. S&P global forecasts, Trump's tariffs are going to cost global businesses upwards of $1.2 trillion this year with a lot of the costs passed along to consumers themselves.",
      "You've said that many economists overestimated the impact of Trump's tariffs. Does that mean you think we've moved past the point of risk, or are we yet to feel the pain?",
      "CHRISTINE LAGARDE (President, European Central Bank): I think we're yet to feel the pain. What we observe \u2013 I'll give you some numbers. From Europe to the United States, our goods to the U.S. consumers had a tariff of 1.5. With the tariff that was decided by the U.S. administration, it's gone up to 13 percent. So, the question is, where does this additional 11-ish percentage point go? At the moment, it's one-third on the exporter, so the European company, one-third of the U.S. importer, and one-third of the consumer.",
      "What will happen, though, is that these two-thirds born by two corporates essentially, the exporter and the importer, is based on the squeeze of the margins. How long are they going to put up with the squeeze of the margin? To be seen. And when they don't, because it's becoming too tight, then it will be on the consumer. So, it's a question of time.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How much they can stomach the hit to their own profits before passing it along?",
      "CHRISTINE LAGARDE: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, there are talks happening we understand between the world's two largest economies. The Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, said on social media he's going to meet with China's vice premiere in the coming days. This was after he called the negotiator unhinged recently, and President Trump said that starting November 1st there will be new tariffs as retaliation for Chinese restrictions on rare earth exports. These are the largest economies in the world. Where does this go? How damaging does this get?",
      "CHRISTINE LAGARDE: First of all, I would discount a little bit of the positioning at the moment because this is typical of negotiating tactics on both sides. Typical. You show your muscles and you say that you are ready to kill. I'm exaggerating, of course.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "CHRISTINE LAGARDE: But people will have to come to the table because it's the interest of both economies, despite the hostility that there is between the two.",
      "But China is using an advantage that it has built over the course of time by accumulating rare earth and the ways to refine rare earth and then to sell it to the rest of the world. They have very, very strong trading position on that front, and they're going to use it, which is why I think that on the other side, the consumers, that is the United States, Europe and a few other countries around the world, we should, you know, join forces and be a purchasing force on the other side of the table of a selling force.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, exactly to that point, there has been frustration on the American side of it that Europe hasn't been standing lockstep with the United States when it comes to China. That China has leverage over Europe here.",
      "CHRISTINE LAGARDE: Well, China currently has leverage against most countries that consume rare earth. And I think on the front of rare earth, the Europeans and the Americans are in the same boat, and they are rowing in the same direction.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But it's other items that you see space (ph) on?",
      "CHRISTINE LAGARDE: Well, I think, you know, it's not for me to say. I'm just a central banker. But the \u2013 the European authorities and the U.S. administration see it slightly differently. I think it's the \u2013 the U.S. would see a blanket force. I think the Europeans are more interested in targeting specific industries or specific sectors where they think that it will make a difference. So, it's a question of tactics that they will be discussing, I'm sure.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you have also said recently that you think investors have begun to question what the dollar would still warrant its status at the ultimate safe haven currency. I mean the American dollar is one of the strongest weapons, frankly, that \u2013 that the administration has to use.",
      "Do you think that it is the rise of cryptocurrency that is most threatening to that, or why are you worried?",
      "CHRISTINE LAGARDE: I see signs that the \u2013 the attraction of the dollar is slightly eroded. And future will tell whether there is more erosion of that. But when you look at the rise of crypto is number one. When you look at the price of gold. Gold is typically in any situation the ultimate destination for safe haven. Price of gold has increased by more than 50 percent since the beginning of the year.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, people are worried (ph) \u2013",
      "CHRISTINE LAGARDE: That's a clear sign that the trust in the reserve currency that the dollar has been is and will continue to be is eroding a bit.",
      "Now, in addition to that, we've seen capital flows outside of the U.S. towards other destinations, including Europe. So, you know, for a currency to be really trusted, you need a few things. You need geopolitical credibility. You need the rule of law and strong institutions. And you need, I would call it a military force that is strong enough. I think on at least one and possibly two accounts, the U.S. is still in a very dominant position. But it needs to be very careful because those positions erode over the course of time. We've seen it with the sterling pound, you know, way back after the \u2013 after the war. But it happens gently, gently, you don't notice it, and then it happens suddenly. And we are seeing intriguing signs of it, which is why I think that having a strong institution with the Fed, for instance, is important. Having a credible environment within which to trade is important. So, volatility, uncertainty to the extent it is fueled by the administration is not helpful to the dollar.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, quickly on Ukraine. President Zelenskyy said he spoke to you recently about using frozen Russian assets. What is fair use in your view?",
      "CHRISTINE LAGARDE: I think fair use would consist of an operational loan that would be using cash balances as collaterals. And I think that the strength of the system should be based on everyone holding Russian assets to do the same thing. So, if all those countries holding assets that have cash balances available as collaterals go in the same direction of lending the money to Ukraine, to be repaid by Russian financing of the reconstruction of Ukraine, because Russia is the aggressor, then I think that that would go a long way in convincing Russia that it has to come to the table to negotiate.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Christine Lagarde, always great to hear your insights.",
      "We'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to higher education. Universities are resisting the Trump administration's proposal to reward schools that commit to President Trump's priorities. The White House has requested that nine universities sign a nine-page compact or risk forgoing federal benefits. Tomorrow is the deadline for feedback. And so far, not one college has agreed to sign and at least six have rejected it.",
      "The compact, reviewed by CBS News, states that universities pledge not to use race or sex in admissions and hiring, freeze tuition for five years, cap international enrollment at 15 percent and require standardized testing.",
      "There's also a pledge for all employees to abstain from speech related to politics.",
      "On Thursday, we spoke with three professors who represent the views of their respective faculties. Jeri Seidman of the University of Virginia, Leila Hudson of the University of Arizona, the Miki Turner the University of Southern California. We began by asking about the administration's request for schools to create an environment that doesn't, quote, \"punish, belittle and even spark violence against conservative ideas.\"",
      "(BEGIN VT)",
      "JERI SEIDMAN (Professor, University of Virginia McIntire School of Commerce): So, belittling speech is obviously not something that any university would want. However, as a state university, we are required to abide by the Constitution. And so, while a private university could decide to limit the free speech of faculty, staff or students if that university decided to, as a state institution, nobody can require the University of Virginia to limit the free speech or any other constitutional right of faculty, staff or students.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, Professor Hudson and Professor Turner, how do you all think your university is going to interpret that kind of guidance? Do you think, first of all, that that is happening on your campuses? And then, how is that supposed to be regulated with this federal mandate?",
      "MIKI TURNER (Professor, USC Annenberg School for Communications and Journalism: I am on a task force, a provost (ph) task for academic freedom. Academic freedom and freedom of speech are two different things. But what we're working toward is to, you know, find that common ground between academic freedom, what professors and students can or cannot do in the classroom. And I don't think that this initiative will happen at USC. I can't \u2013 I can't see a situation where we would want to limit what we say, how we say it, and what we do as a university.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Professor Hudson, can you go back to this idea that is being introduced here, that in the view of the Trump administration, this is actually a problem that needs to be fixed, that there is belittling or violence against conservative ideas on university campuses.",
      "LEILA HUDSON (Professor, University of Arizona School of Middle Eastern and North Africa Studies): Well, I would push back against that. Again, as a public research university, we are an open marketplace, if you will, of ideas. So, you're going to hear all kinds of speech. We have institutional rules that prevent harassment and certainly violence.",
      "But in terms of trying to regulate the speech, that, indeed, will violate, not only the academic freedom that makes our universities great, but the constitutional rights of the university community.",
      "So, I think that, again, this will require a lot more discussion and, indeed, resistance. And I've been very heartened, both on our campus and across the country, to see people rising up against anything that would silence any voices.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But in terms of the specific accusation that there's a problem of, you know, belittling and sparking violence against conservative ideas, do any of you object to trying to counter that, or is it that none of you believe that that's actually even a real problem?",
      "JERI SEIDMAN: The University of Virginia has taken the ability of people to cordially or speak to each other with courtesy but differing opinions very seriously. And we have a number of initiatives on grounds to try to advance that. So, we definitely think it's something important and we want to make sure that those, you know, isn't happening on our campuses. I don't think it's happening to the extent that it gets reported.",
      "But the thing that's really important is that each university should determine how those are implemented on their universities, what their issues are and have the decentralized decision-making ability to decide whether their university has an issue and how to deal with that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Professor Hudson, you were talking about the open marketplace of ideas here. And that is referring to the language in the compact that talks about the need to foster \"a vibrant brant marketplace of ideas.\" But in these terms, it's suggesting that that doesn't exist. That the overwhelming, you know, persuasion of the professors on campus are liberal. That seems to be the accusation here. Do you deny that that is an issue?",
      "LEILA HUDSON: Well, I don't think it's an issue that the federal government needs to weigh in on or any other level of government. Indeed, we have traditions, we have understandings, we have an ironclad commitment to the principles of free speech that mean that any systematic or chronic silencing of any individual's voice or perspective would immediately be identified and rectified by more speech, not by government intervention. So, I'm very comfortable that we can continue to improve climate on campus. But the act of introducing government regulation into that absolutely undermines and sabotages that project.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Professor Seidman, in terms of where the Trump administration's compact came from, there were a lot of influences. But one of them, according to the man himself, is billionaire Mark Rowan, the CEO of Apollo Global Management. And he said he helped write the compact because \"without government involvement, reform at universities will be difficult,\" he argues. He says there have been \"government mandates\" on things like \"diversity, on discrimination and student discipline,\" so why view these at any different?",
      "Why is he wrong?",
      "JERI SEIDMAN: We were talking about academic freedom. And I think in our ability to search for the truth in research, we also have responsibilities in the classroom that are different than you would experience in a corporate setting. And so, I read the compact differently than he does. I think the thing that I struggle with the most about the compact is the idea that it rewards loyalty as opposed to focuses on advancement of the truth.",
      "As a cancer survivor, I want federal research funds to go to the universities and the professors who have the best ideas to cure cancer. That's the way to advance knowledge. And academics, that's really \u2013 we are truth seekers. The compact says, you know, truth seeking is a core foundation of institutions of higher education. And I completely agree with that portion of the compact, it's just the implementation of that truth seeking that I think we differ on.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, the \u2013 the compact says that if this proposal is not signed on to by the university, they may choose to \"forgo federal benefits.\" If you do sign on, there's a chance of increased funding and federal partnerships. So, it's not explicitly threatened, but it's strongly suggested that that would be the consequence. That's how \u2013 how your \u2013 how the university understands it?",
      "JERI SEIDMAN: That's how I believe most faculty understand it that I have heard from.",
      "Something interesting is that, even faculty who have grants have reached out to me and said, you know, we \u2013 we want the grants to go to the places that have the best ideas. We don't want to have special treatment. Faculty are truth seekers. And so, we don't \u2013 we don't want special benefits. Even if that means that our university is not favored because others do sign on, we all want the best ideas to be advanced.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: On the state government front, there's also pressure at - - in Virginia and in California. In Virginia, Democrats in the state Senate wrote, \"if UVA signs this thing, there will be significant consequences in future budget cycles. Out in California, Professor Turner, Governor Newsom vowed to cut off billions in state funding if anyone signs this thing. And the White House says that's like California\"endorsing discrimination, tuition hikes and confronting speech with violence.\" If you're between those two pressure points, what do you do?",
      "MIKI TURNER: That's \u2013 that's a great question because I really have complete empathy for our college presidents who have to deal with this situation right now because they are kind of stuck between a rock and a hard place because of all this political ping-pong.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Professor Seidman, on the pressure from the Democrats in the state of Virginia, is that helping or is that hurting?",
      "JERI SEIDMAN: Pressure from both sides definitely feel \u2013 definitely feels it.",
      "I think the difference between the pressure from the state level and the pressure from the federal level is the state funds that come from the university are the university's to determine how they use. The federal funds that we get are either for students for financial aid or are for specific grants. So, the threats to remove funding are a little bit different in that regard.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Professor Turner, one of the things that got a lot of attention from both parties during the campaign was also just the high cost of college and university tuition right now.",
      "MIKI TURNER: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: USC is the highest tuition of any private university in this country. We were looking at it before. And I was floored. It cost $75,000 a year in tuition. It gets close to $99,000 a year, inclusive of expenses. There are a lot of parents who would hear, oh, a five-year freeze in tuition and be glad that it went into effect.",
      "MIKI TURNER: Exactly. And that's one of the components I'm in agreement with, about the freeze on tuition.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But it also wants to cap the number of international students that you have, which would impact USC because you're above that 15 percent threshold.",
      "MIKI TURNER: Absolutely.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Does one premise fight the other? Can \u2013 can you bring the cost down if you cut out the university students who are paying full boat coming from overseas?",
      "MIKI TURNER: Not at all. Not at all. We would not be able to do that because, you know, they \u2013 they essentially come with cash in hand. And not only that, do they add to the financial pot, but they also add to the collective perspective. And so, we want those students there from every country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I also want to bring up one of the things that was raised here, and that is, we know the Supreme Court struck down race-based admissions. One of the first points in this compact addresses the issue of preferential treatment, as they refer to it, based on identity. They list, sex, nationality, gender, religion, race or political views.",
      "Professor Turner, you work on recruitment, I understand. How does this impact recruiting students?",
      "MIKI TURNER: Yes. If that goes into effect, that's going to affect the way I do things. But I don't think that it's going to have a huge impact on the way USC really does things. You know, we actively recruit, you know, students from all walks of life, of all races. And I don't think that, you know, we should stop that because, again, you know, we're thinking about these students. And we're thinking about their growth and how they are going to go out into the world and change this world for the better. And to \u2013 in order to do that, they need to engage with different types of people with different cultures. And so, hopefully, you know, this won't have that impact on our school because, you know, if we can't \u2013 we really can't afford to have that happen.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Professor Seidman, the University of Virginia's president was forced to resign because of a Department of Justice investigation related to DEI commitments. Do you get any indication that the federal pressure on UVA is going to go away?",
      "JERI SEIDMAN: Two of our open investigations with the Department of Justice that related to admissions around DEI have been closed. So, that is good news. And those were closed based on information we provided that apparently satisfied the concerns about race being used in admission.",
      "I think this particular item of the compact would impact UVA. UVA has always had a very holistic approach to admissions. We find talent to be much broader than just test scores and grades.",
      "(END VT)",

      "\"Tabs were great, but we haven't seen a lot of browser innovation since then,\" he said.",
      "What the Atlas browser can do",
      "Like other search engines, Atlas has a home page with a search bar where people can ask questions, similar to Google's landing page. Users can also toggle through different tabs across the top of the browser to find news stories, images and other content.",
      "But a few features set the browser apart, according to OpenAI. One is a ChatGPT side bar, which users can activate by clicking an \"Ask ChatGPT\" button in the upper right-hand corner of the browser.",
      "\"It's basically you inviting ChatGPT into your corner of the internet,\" said Ryan O'Rouke, the lead designer for Atlas, in OpenAI's video unveiling the browser.",
      "The technology functions like ChatGPT but takes into account what web page people are on. In practice, that means users can ask questions about whatever content they are looking at. Users can also call on the ChatGPT function while drafting emails. In the demo, O'Rouke shows how he uses it to ask for edits on an email.",
      "\"It's using the internet for you,\" Altman said.",
      "Atlas also has an \"agent mode\" that can take action on a person's behalf, armed with what it has learned from users' browsing history and what they are searching for. The agent also can help people complete a range of tasks, such as booking a flight, editing a document or ordering groceries. For now, agent mode is only available for plus and pro users, according to Altman.",
      "OpenAI has said ChatGPT has more than 800 million users, although the San Francisco-based company has yet to turn a profit. Google's Chrome browser has roughly 3 billion worldwide users and has been adding some AI features drawing on the company's Gemini AI technology."

      "Amazon says a massive outage of its cloud computing service has been resolved as of Monday evening, after a problem disrupted internet use around the world, taking down a broad range of online services, including social media, gaming, food delivery, streaming and financial platforms.",
      "The all-day disruption and the ensuing exasperation it caused served as the latest reminder that 21st century society is increasingly dependent on just a handful of companies for much of its internet technology, which seems to work reliably until it suddenly breaks down.",
      "About three hours after the outage began early Monday morning, Amazon Web Services said it was starting to recover, but it wasn't until 6 p.m. Eastern that \"services returned to normal operations,\" Amazon said on its AWS health website, where it tracks outages.",
      "Cybersecurity expert Mike Chapple said \"a slow and bumpy recovery process\" is \"entirely normal.\"",
      "Amazon pinned the outage on issues related to its domain name system that converts web addresses into IP addresses, which are numeric designations that identify locations on the internet. Those addresses allow websites and apps to load on internet-connected devices.",
      "Downdetector, a website that tracks online outages, said in a Facebook post that it received over 11 million user reports of problems at more than 2,500 companies.",
      "The Amazon division provides remote computing services to many apps, websites, governments, universities and companies. Early Monday, users reported issues with Snapchat, Roblox, Fortnite, online broker Robinhood, the McDonald's app and many others, according to Downdetector.",
      "Even Amazon's own services weren't immune. Users of the company's Ring doorbell cameras and Alexa-powered smart speakers posted on DownDetector that they weren't working, while others said they were unable to access the Amazon website or download books to their Kindle.",
      "By mid-morning, Amazon said it had started to recover, but around 1 p.m. ET, users were still reporting problems. Thousands of Venmo users reported difficulties at about 1:30 p.m. ET, while people also reported problems with AI chatbot Claude, the Wall Street Journal and Amazon services like Alexa around the same time, according to Downdetector.",

      "A Southwest spokesperson said the outage affected the airline's ability to efficiently dispatch some early morning flights, while United said it disrupted customers' access to the United app and website overnight. Delta said the issue caused a small numbers of minor delays Monday morning.",
      "The nation's railroad services were also affected. Amtrak reported at 1:30 p.m. EDT that it was experiencing \"intermittent technical difficulties\" which hobbled SMS, email and push notifications, and prevented customers from booking reservations through Amtrak.com or the mobile app.",
      "\"If you are traveling today, please arrive at your station at your regularly scheduled time typically 30 minutes prior to your train's departure,\" Amtrak said in a statement shared with CBS News.",
      "How did this start?",
      "Amazon first reported the outage issue at 3:11 a.m. ET. Shortly after, it said its services in its eastern U.S. region were disrupted and engineers were working to understand what was causing the problem. At 5:27 a.m. ET, AWS began reporting progress, saying, \"We are seeing significant signs of recovery.\"",
      "A little more than a half-hour later, it said, \"We continue to observe recovery across most\" of the affected services.",
      "AWS customers include some of the world's biggest businesses and organizations.",
      "\"So much of the world now relies on these three or four big (cloud) compute companies who provide the underlying infrastructure that when there's an issue like this, it can be really impactful across a broad range, a broad spectrum\" of online services, said Patrick Burgess, a cybersecurity expert at U.K.-based BCS, The Chartered Institute for IT.",
      "\"The world now runs on the cloud\" and the internet is seen as a utility like water or electricity as we spend so much of our lives on our smartphones, Burgess said.",
      "And because so much of the online world's plumbing is underpinned by a handful of companies, when something goes wrong \"it's very difficult for users to pinpoint what is happening because we don't see Amazon, we just see Snapchat or Roblox,\" Burgess said."

      "The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency on Wednesday issued a sweeping emergency order directing all federal agencies to immediately patch critical vulnerabilities in certain devices and software made by F5, a technology vendor, after confirming a nation-state cyber actor gained unauthorized access to F5's source code.",
      "CISA \u2014 a part of the Department of Homeland Security that manages risks to the U.S.'s cyber and physical infrastructure \u2014 issued\u00a0Emergency Directive 26-01\u00a0following the company's disclosure that a foreign threat actor had maintained long-term, persistent access to its internal development and engineering environments using source code.",
      "Officials warned that attackers could exploit the vulnerabilities to steal credentials, move laterally through networks, and potentially take full control of targeted systems. F5 said it first discovered the attack in August but did not disclose exactly when it began.",
      "\"This directive addresses an imminent risk,\" Nick Anderson, CISA's executive assistant director for cybersecurity, said during a news briefing Wednesday. \"A nation-state actor could exploit these flaws to gain unauthorized access to embedded credentials and API keys. That's an unacceptable risk to federal networks.\"",
      "F5 is a publicly traded American technology company headquartered in Seattle, Washington.",
      "Justice Department delayed breach announcement",
      "Earlier Wednesday, F5 disclosed the breach in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.",
      "In the SEC 8-K report, F5 said the Justice Department on Sept. 12 \"determined that a delay in public disclosure was warranted.\" It's one of the first times a company has publicly acknowledged DOJ intervention under the SEC's\u00a0cybersecurity disclosure rules.",
      "The rules were adopted in July 2023 and require companies to report cybersecurity incidents within four business days of determining that a material event has occurred.",

      "The federal agencies need to evaluate if their networks are accessible from the public internet, and apply newly released updates from F5 by Oct. 22, the emergency order stated. They must also complete scoping reports identifying affected devices by Oct. 29.",
      "There are currently thousands of F5 devices in use across federal networks, Anderson told CBS News. The cybersecurity agency said it expects to know more about the scope of exposure by the end of the month.",
      "CISA Acting Director Madhu Gottumukkala said in a statement that the agency remains \"steadfast\" in its mission to defend U.S. networks, even amid the ongoing government shutdown and the lapse of the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015.",
      "\"The alarming ease with which these vulnerabilities can be exploited demands immediate and decisive action,\" Gottumukkala said. \"These same risks extend beyond federal systems \u2014 to any organization using this technology.\"",
      "No confirmed compromises yet, but broader campaign underway",

      "\"The U.S. government is not making a public attribution at this time,\" said Marcy McCarthy, CISA's director of public affairs.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, the head of threat intelligence for Unit 42, a team of cybersecurity experts and researchers at Palo Alto Networks, said the theft of F5 BIG-IP source code is \"significant, as it potentially facilitates rapid exploitation of vulnerabilities.\"",
      "\"Generally, if an attacker steals source code, it takes time to find exploitable issues,\" Unit 42 Chief Technology Officer Michael Sikorski said. \"In this case, they also stole information on undisclosed vulnerabilities that F5 was actively working to patch. This provides the ability for threat actors to exploit vulnerabilities that have no public patch, potentially increasing speed to exploit creation.\"",

      "Anderson also said the lapse of the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015, a law that had governed federal-private sector cyber information sharing before sunsetting, did not delay coordination with F5 or impact the agency's response.",
      "While the directive applies only to federal agencies, CISA is strongly urging state, local and private sector organizations using F5 technologies to follow the same patching and mitigation steps. F5's products, including its BIG-IP line, are widely used in both government and commercial networks to manage internet traffic and security."

      "The 15-hour\u00a0disruption to Amazon Web Services, a cloud-based computing service, on Monday shook internet users around the world, disrupting everything from travel to financial transactions \u2014 and underscoring the fragility of a system reliant on only a handful of tech giants.",
      "Monday's problems at Amazon Web Services, or AWS, spawned 11 million total outage reports, with 3 million reports stemming from U.S. users, Downdetector, a website that tracks online outages,\u00a0said\u00a0on Facebook.",
      "While other cloud providers support the world's businesses \u2014 including Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Microsoft Azure \u2014 AWS has the largest foothold in the market. Since it debuted in 2006, the company has grown to control 38% of the cloud computing infrastructure market,\u00a0according to research and advisory firm Gartner.",
      "Experts say Monday's outage reveals the vulnerabilities of a system where a small number of companies provide such a large chunk of the internet's backbone.",
      "\"[The] outage is a stark reminder of the massive 'concentration risk' the global economy has accepted by building on a handful of cloud providers,\" Dave McCarthy, who leads global research for cloud services at the International Data Corporation, told CBS News.",
      "AWS' rolodex of customers include government departments, universities and businesses, and platforms such as Venmo, Netflix and Snapchat.",
      "\"Frankly, many customers may have been unaware that a service they used relied upon AWS and are only learning that now, due to system failures,\" said Craig Shue, a professor and the head of the computer science department at Worcester Polytechnic Institute.",
      "As Shue explained, companies that are not technology-centric may seek out a cloud service like AWS to host their web servers and databases, allowing them to focus on their day-to-day operations. Amazon, meanwhile,\u00a0 handles the more technical aspects such as server maintenance and responses to fluctuations in customer demand, he added.",
      "Amazon declined to comment directly on the incident, instead sharing a statement from their\u00a0website\u00a0published on Oct. 20.",
      "How the AWS outage started",
      "The outage started Monday morning in Northern Virginia, home to AWS' oldest and biggest cloud computing hub in the U.S. AWS refers to the cluster of data centers in Virginia as US-EAST-1. The company also has cloud computing hubs in California, Ohio and Oregon.",
      "According to expert accounts and Amazon's own\u00a0explanation, the issue was partially tied to AWS' domain name system (DNS), which is called DynamoDB. As Shue explained, this is the part of the internet that takes domain names like Amazon.com and converts them to IP addresses, numerical labels that identify locations on the internet.",
      "The service can be used to distribute traffic to multiple servers to make things faster, Shue said.",
      "\"It is akin to waiting in a checkout line that then splits off to multiple cashier lanes,\" Shue explained. \"A staff member can direct the customer at the front of the line to the first available server that can handle the job.\"",
      "This function was disrupted on Monday, leading to a backlog of server requests without anything to route them. It's still unclear how the disruption began, experts said.",
      "For people on the ground, this meant they were unable to carry out simple web-based functions like checking their flight time on an airline app or sending a payment on Venmo.",
      "While the issue started in the eastern U.S. region, its effects were global. Experts say it's difficult to quantify the impact in dollar figures. McCarthy, however, noted that it appears to be one of the most significant outages in recent years.",
      "Amazon said that the issue was resolved around 6 p.m. EDT on Monday, or more than 15 hours after the company first reported a problem on the AWS Health Dashboard, where it tracks service disruptions.",
      "\"This wasn't a minor glitch; it was a cascading failure originating in US-EAST-1, the very nerve center of AWS, which took down everything from gaming and social media to critical financial and educational platforms,\" he said.",
      "Will the outage impact AWS?",
      "While the incident may have sparked a small reckoning with cloud services, it's not expected to shake up the landscape too much, experts told CBS News.",
      "McCarthy doesn't expect the outage to lead to a mass exodus of AWS customers, but he said it could compel companies to diversify their cloud services so they're not reliant on a single provider. That way if one goes down, the company can still keep some operations going."

      "Nine in 10 working Americans say they plan to ignore one of the most common pieces of financial advice about Social Security: waiting until age 70 to claim benefits, which ensures higher monthly payments, according to a new study from investment firm Schroders.",
      "Social Security allows employees to claim their benefits as soon as they turn 62, years before the so-called \"full retirement age,\" which now stands at 67. But claiming Social Security early has a tradeoff\u2014it lowers your monthly payment by about 30%, with those lower benefits locked in for the rest of your life.",
      "By contrast, delaying claiming Social Security until age 70 means you'll get a more than 30% boost in your monthly checks \u2014 also locked in as long you're collecting benefits. As a result, financial experts often recommend that seniors hold off as long as they can, with one study finding that filing early for benefits can cost $182,000 in foregone payments.",
      "The Schroders survey\u00a0suggests that many Americans who haven't yet retired aren't buying that advice. In the survey of 1,500 adults, most respondents said they understand the trade-offs of claiming early, but only 10% plan to wait until age 70, while 44% expect to file for benefits before they reach full retirement age.",
      "\"Not an oversight\"",
      "The disconnect illustrates the financial reality facing most workers, Deb Boyden, head of U.S. defined contribution at Schroders, told CBS News.",
      "\"The decision to sacrifice extra Social Security income is not an oversight for most Americans,\" she said. \"According to our research, 70% of Americans are aware that waiting longer to claim Social Security leads to higher payments, and yet so few are willing to hold off.\"",
      "Many retirees are facing a shortfall in their own retirement savings, a financial gap that's been well documented as a growing share of Americans live paycheck to paycheck. Many workers \"need the income generated by Social Security to meet their expenses immediately upon retiring,\" Boyden noted.",
      "Another new study, released Tuesday by the Allianz Center for the Future of Retirement, finds that a majority of Americans say they don't know much about Social Security or how it will fit into their retirement plan. And about 1 in 5 believe Social Security will provide all the retirement income they need, even though it generally replaces only 40% of a worker's wages when they retire, the study found.",
      "There's another reason why many Americans plan on claiming their Social Security benefits before reaching full retirement age, she added. That's due to concerns about the future of Social Security, which is fueling concerns that \"the money may not be there if they wait,\" Boyden said.",
      "Social Security is indeed facing a financial crunch, with an aging U.S. population resulting in its payments now outpacing contributions from workers. Without changes to the program, that will result in its trust funds becoming insolvent by 2034, according to the most recent calculation from the Social Security Board of Trustees.",
      "Yet many people wrongly believe that means Social Security will halt payments if the trust funds become insolvent. Payments would continue in such an event, but benefits would be reduced by about 20% \u2014 a potentially major financial hit to the program's more than 70 million beneficiaries.",
      "Still, there are ways lawmakers can shore up the program, such as by raising the income cap on Social Security taxes, which stands at $176,100, according to experts. Earnings over that amount are exempt from the payroll tax, which funds Social Security.",
      "In the meantime, non-retired Americans told Schroders they believe they need $5,032 in monthly income to retire comfortably. But today's retirees on average generate about $3,250 in monthly retirement income, Boyden said, adding that the gap signals the need to help workers plan better for retirement.",
      "A recent analysis from Goldman Sachs found three-quarters of younger working Americans say they're struggling to save for retirement because basic expenses such as housing are eating up a bigger share of their income compared with prior generations."

      "OpenAI said Tuesday it is launching an artificial intelligence-powered website browser, heightening the company's competition with Google, the Alphabet-owned unit that has long dominated online search.",
      "The new browser, called ChatGPT Atlas, is for now only available on Apple laptops that run the company's Mac operating system. Access will soon expand to Apple's iOS, Microsoft Windows and Google's Android platforms, OpenAI said.",
      "In the company's launch\u00a0video, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman described Atlas as an AI-powered web browser built around ChatGPT that will allow people to converse with web pages. In a video presentation, he also expressed confidence that a chatbot interface will eventually supplant a traditional browser's URL bar.",
      "\"Tabs were great, but we haven't seen a lot of browser innovation since then,\" he said.",
      "What the Atlas browser can do",
      "Like other search engines, Atlas has a home page with a search bar where people can ask questions, similar to Google's landing page. Users can also toggle through different tabs across the top of the browser to find news stories, images and other content.",
      "But a few features set the browser apart, according to OpenAI. One is a ChatGPT side bar, which users can activate by clicking an \"Ask ChatGPT\" button in the upper right-hand corner of the browser.",
      "\"It's basically you inviting ChatGPT into your corner of the internet,\" said Ryan O'Rouke, the lead designer for Atlas, in OpenAI's video unveiling the browser.",
      "The technology functions like ChatGPT but takes into account what web page people are on. In practice, that means users can ask questions about whatever content they are looking at. Users can also call on the ChatGPT function while drafting emails. In the demo, O'Rouke shows how he uses it to ask for edits on an email.",
      "\"It's using the internet for you,\" Altman said.",
      "Atlas also has an \"agent mode\" that can take action on a person's behalf, armed with what it has learned from users' browsing history and what they are searching for. The agent also can help people complete a range of tasks, such as booking a flight, editing a document or ordering groceries. For now, agent mode is only available for plus and pro users, according to Altman.",
      "OpenAI has said ChatGPT has more than 800 million users, although the San Francisco-based company has yet to turn a profit. Google's Chrome browser has roughly 3 billion worldwide users and has been adding some AI features drawing on the company's Gemini AI technology."

    "summary": "Economists say the Trump administration's sweeping tariffs on imports are boosting consumer prices in the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "Trump administration tariffs imposed this year on dozens of nations and a range of industries are fueling inflation, especially for goods that are widely imported into the U.S., a recent\u00a0analysis\u00a0shows.",
      "Product categories seeing some of the biggest price hikes due to tariffs include\u00a0furniture, car parts, electronics and musical instruments, according to economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The findings are based on research models estimating tariff-related price hikes and drawing on Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) data, a widely used gauge of inflation.",
      "Importers bear the cost of tariffs, typically passing at least some of the added expenses to consumers, economic research shows.",
      "The St. Louis Fed researchers found that companies passed 35% of tariff costs onto consumers from May through July. Other research from Goldman Sachs suggests that businesses could eventually pass on as much as 55% of added tariff costs to consumers. Companies would swallow 22% of the extra costs, while foreign exporters would absorb 18% of the expenses, economists with the investment bank found.",
      "How much could inflation rise?",
      "Businesses are expected to continue experimenting with pricing based on how tariffs affect their own costs, according to Max Dvorkin, an economist and one of the authors the St. Louis Fed study.",
      "\"Even if you don't change tariffs anymore, the dynamics of prices will continue to evolve and affect consumers over the next few months,\" he said.",
      "The regional Fed bank found that tariffs account for a sizable share of recent inflation. Between June through August, the tariffs imposed by President Trump added 0.5 percentage points to the headline PCE rate, which averaged 2.85% during that period, according to the findings. The levies added 0.4 percentage points to core PCE, which excludes volatile energy and food prices and which hovered around 2.9% during that three-month period, the study found.",
      "\"Tariff measures are already exerting measurable upward pressure on consumer prices,\" the economists conclude.",
      "As of August, the Consumer Price Index was up 2.9% from a year ago after, remaining above the Federal Reserve's 2% annual target. Inflation as measured by the index had fallen in April to a low of 2.3%, but has flared during the second half of the year. The Labor Department is expected to release CPI data for September, which has been delayed by the government shutdown, on Friday.",
      "The St. Louis Fed study notes that tariffs haven't driven up consumer prices as sharply as some experts had predicted. That's chiefly because many businesses are waiting to see where tariff rates settle before they adjust their prices, according to the research.",
      "\"We believe the passthrough of tariff increases by U.S. businesses to consumers remains in the early stages, delayed by stop-and-go announcements, pauses and drawn-out implementation,\" anaysts with the Wells Fargo Investment Institute said in a report on Tuesday.",
      "The White House did not respond to CBS News' request for comment. President Trump has defended his administration's trade policy, saying that it will benefit the country's manufacturing sector and boost job growth over the long-term.",
      "Mr. Trump's wide-ranging tariffs will cost businesses in the U.S. an additional $1.2 trillion this year, with consumers shouldering most of those costs, according to S&P Global\u00a0analysts\u00a0who reviewed data from 9,000 companies.",
      "Companies have passed on roughly two-thirds of those tariff costs \u2014 $592 billion \u2014 to consumers in the form of higher prices, S&P said. The levies have reduced corporate earnings by a total of $315 billion."

      "The addition was originally planned to be 90,000 square feet, but that figure is likely to increase. The ballroom, which will be used for events that on occasion will include heads of state, is intended to hold 999 people, up from an initial estimate of 650.

      "Six in 10 U.S. workers say their jobs fall short of the standards for a \"quality\" position \u2014 one that offers basics such as fair pay, a steady schedule and career growth \u2014 according to new research from advocacy group Jobs for the Future.",
      "While government labor statistics track how many Americans are employed and how much they earn, the official data falls short of painting a complete picture of the state of the job market, researchers behind Jobs for the Future's new\u00a0The American Job Quality Study\u00a0said.",
      "A quality job is defined by five indicators, the researchers said:",
      "Financial well-being, such as fair pay and stable employmentWorkplace culture and safety, meaning the worker is free from discrimination or harassmentGrowth and development opportunities, allowing a worker to build skills and advance their careerAgency and voice, or the ability to influence decisions that impact one's jobWork structure and agency, including a stable, predictable schedule and a manageable workload",
      "Financial well-being, such as fair pay and stable employment",

      "Growth and development opportunities, allowing a worker to build skills and advance their career",
      "Agency and voice, or the ability to influence decisions that impact one's job",
      "Work structure and agency, including a stable, predictable schedule and a manageable workload",
      "By those measures, only 40% of the more than 18,000 workers surveyed by the group said they are employed in quality jobs, while the remaining 60% said their employment is falling short of those standards. For example, 62% of employees said they have unpredictable work schedules, while about one-third said they are struggling financially.",
      "\"We recognize that not only has the way we measure the economy not kept up with way work and the economy is changing, but it has never been sufficient in terms of letting us understand what's going on under hood of economy and across workforce, which is the engine of economic prosperity in the U.S.,\" said Molly Blankenship, director at Jobs for the Future.",
      "The group surveyed workers across industries and types of positions, in partnership with Gallup, the Families & Workers Fund, and the W.E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research.",
      "\"We suspected when we started this work that the majority of Americans were not in jobs that were helping them,\" Blankenship added. \"This date confirms what we suspected, which is that the majority of American workers are not in quality jobs.\"",
      "Dimensions of a quality job",
      "Pay is among a job's most important features because fair wages, stable employment and benefits can help an employee's sense of financial well-being, according to the study. But only 27% of those surveyed said they are financially comfortable, while nearly 3 in 10 described themselves as \"just getting by\" or \"finding it difficult to get by.\"",
      "But a job's pay alone doesn't indicate its overall quality. Workers also want to feel safe and respected in their jobs, the study noted.",
      "Providing a harassment-free workplace isn't just for workers' benefit: Research from consulting firm McKinsey & Co. shows that a firm's psychological safety and equitable treatment of workers can improve productivity and benefit business performance.",
      "Opportunities to grow and develop are another pillar of a quality job, yet one in four employees say they have no opportunities for promotion or advancement at work.",
      "Having agency and input into one's working conditions can help determine a worker's job satisfaction, according to the study's authors. But employees report gaps in their influence over key job attributes, with 70% of workers saying they should have more say over their compensation and benefits.",
      "Another 55% say their employers have too much say in how firms use new technology, like AI.",
      "\"There is tremendous concern over technology, how it's being adopted and how it will impact people's jobs in the future,\" Susan Houseman, a senior economist at the Upjohn Institute for Employment Research, who worked on the report, told CBS News. \"The research indicates that they lack input on these issues.\"",
      "The final determinant of job quality \u2014 the degree of autonomy a position offers workers \u2014 can shape an employee's daily routine and overall work-life balance. More than six in 10 employees said they lack control over their schedules, while more than half of workers said they often or sometimes work more than scheduled.",
      "Who works in quality jobs?",
      "Men are more likely than women to report holding high-quality jobs, the survey shows.",
      "The youngest employees, between the ages of 18 and 24, are the least likely to hold quality jobs. Race and ethnicity plays a part too, with Asian and White employees more likely than Black, multiracial, Hispanic or Middle Eastern/North African workers to hold high quality jobs, it found.",
      "Broken down by industry, more workers in professional services, financial activities and wholesale trade report holding high-quality jobs, while fewer workers in leisure and hospitality, retail, and warehousing say as much.",
      "Employees who have attained a bachelor's degree are also more likely to have quality jobs than those with less education, the report found."

      "\"I watched people treat her as if she were stupid because of her accent, and my mother never lost her dignity. In many ways, that kind of grit and resilience was deeply important. And it was when I really was challenged that I really had to dig inside and say, 'do I think I can do this?' And I think that's actually what made me feel, no, I think inside I know I can,\" she said."

The president did not say when the meeting would take place. He also previewed \"high level\" meetings between the U.S. and Russia, led by Rubio.",

      "The president has pushed for a ceasefire in Ukraine, and on Sunday, he called for an immediate halt in the war that would see Russia maintaining control of territory it invaded in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region.",
      "\"Let it be cut the way it is. It's cut up right now. I think 78% of the land is already taken by Russia.

      "Jeffries spoke at the Economic Club of New York on Monday.",
      "Moynihan was arraigned Tuesday and entered a plea of not guilty.",
      "According to a court filing by prosecutors in the New York state criminal case, Moynihan wrote, \"Hakeem Jeffries makes a speech in a few days in NYC I cannot allow this terrorist to live.\"",
      "Moynihan also allegedly stated: \"Even if I am hated, he must be eliminated, I will kill him for the future,\" the filing said.",
      "Moynihan faces a felony charge of making a terroristic threat, according to court filings shared by prosecutors.",
      "In a statement on Tuesday, Jeffries noted that Moynihan had been pardoned by Mr. Trump on his first day in office and that \"many of the criminals released have committed additional crimes throughout the country.\" But Jeffries added that \"threats of violence will not stop us from showing up, standing up and speaking up for the American people.\"",
      "Moynihan's father declined to comment on the case when reached by phone by CBS News on Monday. He said Moynihan has not yet been appointed a defense attorney.",
      "Dutchess County, New York district attorney Anthony Parisi said in a statement to CBS News that \"although my office was not contacted during the investigative stage of this matter, we are now reviewing the case for legal and factual sufficiency.\"",
      "Moynihan was pardoned by President Trump nine months ago, along with more than 1,500 other Capitol riot defendants who were granted clemency hours after Mr. Trump returned to the White House.",
      "Moynihan was found guilty in August 2022 of obstructing an official proceeding, and pleaded guilty to five misdemeanor charges. He was sentenced in February 2023 to 21 months in prison.",
      "Prosecutors described Moynihan as being among the first rioters to breach police barricades and enter the Capitol grounds on Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "Moynihan was also among a smaller group of riot defendants who were on the Senate floor during the siege. Prosecutors argued in Moynihan's sentencing memorandum: \"While inside, Moynihan rifled through a notebook on top of a Senator's desk, saying 'There's gotta be something in here we can f*cking use against these scumbags.'\"",
      "Prosecutors said Moynihan \"occupied the dais of the Senate, joining other rioters in shouts and chanting,\" and didn't leave the chamber until police made him leave.",
      "Moynihan's arrest for allegedly threatening Jeffries was made by New York State Police, according to a statement by the agency that was confirmed by a state official. The investigation was initiated by the FBI, according to state police.",
      "A state police statement said Moynihan was arraigned in local court in Clinton, a town in New York's Hudson Valley region. He was remanded to the Dutchess County Justice and Transition Center \"in lieu of $10,000 cash bail, a $30,000 bond, or an $80,000 partially secured bond.\"",
      "State police declined a request to immediately release a copy of the agency's incident report or a booking photo.",
      "Moynihan is not the first pardoned Capitol rioter to be arrested on new, separate charges. But he is the first to be charged with making a violent threat against a member of Congress.",
      "Critics of the president's blanket pardons of Jan. 6 defendants have warned about the risk of recidivism by rioters, many of whom remained defiant and unapologetic about their roles in the attack. The rioters have been defended and lionized publicly as \"hostages\" by Mr. Trump.",
      "In a March 2025 floor speech, Sen. Dick Durbin, a member of Senate Democratic leadership from Illinois, listed the names of accused rioters who had been arrested again. Durbin cited the case of Matthew Huttle, who was accused of \"raising a firearm at police\" in early 2025 and \"acknowledged he was a January 6th defendant who stormed the Capitol,\" according to Durbin. Huttle was fatally shot by police during the traffic stop.",
      "Zachary Alam, who was convicted of eight felonies for his role in the Capitol riot, was arrested weeks after his 2025 presidential pardon for allegedly breaking and entering a home near Richmond, Virginia.",
      "Other Jan. 6 defendants have since been arrested for other alleged criminal infractions that occurred before the siege or in the years between 2021 and the pardon.",
      "The alleged threat against Jeffries is also part of a fast-growing wave of threats against legislators. In a statement last month, Capitol Police said the number of threat investigations in 2025 had already eclipsed 14,000, more than the number of cases in all of 2024.",
      "The Capitol riot injured more than 140 police officers and caused millions of dollars of damage to the Capitol complex. It interrupted the certification of the electoral vote from the 2020 election and triggered the evacuation of Congress, with leadership sent to a secure, secret location.",
      "Some rioters chanted to hang then-Vice President Mike Pence, threatened to kill then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and beat police officers with dozens of makeshift weapons, including bats, sticks, poles, bear spray and beams. Some were accused of carrying guns, knives and handmade weapons."

      "A government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to approve funding for federal agencies. Before 1980, agencies largely continued operating during a lapse in funding with the assumption that Congress would act quickly. But in 1980 and 1981, then-Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti authored a series of legal opinions that found government agencies didn't have the authority to continue running during a gap in funding.",
      "President Ronald Reagan oversaw eight shutdowns during his time in office, the longest of which lasted three days. There were three funding gaps between 1990 and 1995, then none until 2013.",
      "The threat of a government shutdown has become more frequent over the past decade, as Congress has found itself engaged in funding fights that are ultimately resolved with massive, yearlong spending packages. The most recent lapse in government funding, in late 2018, caused $3 billion in permanent losses, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Hundreds of thousands of federal workers are expected to feel the impacts of a shutdown if a deal isn't reached this time around.",

The bill differed from a version passed in the House and funding technically lapsed at midnight, but since Nov. 21 fell on a Saturday, the effects weren't felt immediately. House and Senate negotiators worked over the weekend to reconcile their differences and passed identical bills on Sunday.",
      "On Monday, Reagan vetoed the plan and ordered the government to shut down, placing 250,000 federal employees on furlough. Later in the day, lawmakers passed a stopgap bill to keep the government funded and allow more time for talks on a deal. Workers returned the next day.",

      "As the shutdown stretched to become the longest in history and Democrats took control of the House, the president ended up signing a bill to reopen agencies for three weeks and did not include money for the border wall. Weeks later, Congress averted another shutdown by passing a measure that included $1.375 billion for the border wall, far less than the $5.7 billion Trump requested."

      "Although a short U.S. government shutdown would be unlikely to have much impact on air travel, a prolonged impasse could lead to disruptions for passengers and financial losses for businesses, according to travel experts and industry groups.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration and Transportation Security Administration define most of their employees as essential, requiring them to work even if the government closes and workers at other federal agencies are furloughed. That means airport screeners, air traffic controllers, federal air marshals, safety inspectors and other workers with the two agencies are expected to continue showing up on the job \u2014 without pay \u2014 even as lawmakers failed this week to strike a deal on federal funding.",
      "But things could get messy if a shutdown dragged on and government employees suddenly deprived of a paycheck come under financial pressure, Caleb Harmon-Marshall, a former TSA officer, told CBS News.",
      "\"TSA officers are expected to continue to report to work. But in the past, if a shutdown exceeds two weeks, officers start to get frantic, and they stop going to work,\" he said, adding that agency personnel may call in sick and even seek other job opportunities if a shutdown persists.",
      "Any ensuing labor shortages can lead to snarled lines at airport security. For example, roughly 10% of TSA workers called in sick during the 34-day government shutdown that started in December 2018 and extended into 2019, driving up screening times at major airports across the country.",
      "\"So if officers decide not to come to work, there is less personnel manning checkpoints, and wait times can potentially get longer,\" Harmon-Marshall said.",
      "A shutdown began at 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday, Oct. 1, after the Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded. If lawmakers passed a spending bill, TSA and FAA workers would be entitled to back pay for any time worked during a shutdown.",
      "$1 billion hit",
      "The U.S. Travel Association, a trade group, warned that a government shutdown could cost the economy $1 billion a week, while also inconveniencing passengers and hurting travel industry businesses.",
      "\"A shutdown exacerbates staffing shortages among Transportation Security Administration officers and air traffic controllers, threatening longer airport security lines, flight delays and cancellations,\" the group said in a Sept. 25 letter. \"It halts hiring and training of new air traffic controllers when we are already short more than 2,800 controllers nationwide, and restarting the process adds further delays even after funding is restored.\"",
      "The U.S. is already experiencing a shortage of air traffic controllers, and has launched an effort to hire more than 2,000 additional controllers by the end of the fiscal year.",
      "Neither the White House nor the Transportation Department responded to requests for comment about the impact of a potential government shutdown on travel in the U.S.",
      "By contrast, train travel is unlikely to be disrupted if the government closes this week, according to the Rail Passengers Association, which represents the nation's rail travelers. Although Amtrak receives some federal funding and could eventually be impacted if a shutdown dragged on, the rail service is financially healthy enough to pay workers in the near term and keep trains in operation, the group\u00a0said in a statement last week.",
      "Passport services are also deemed essential and would be expected to operate during a government shutdown."

    "published": "Tue, 21 Oct 2025 09:12:03 -0400",
    "summary": "The U.S. government shut down on Wednesday after Congress failed to approve funding for federal agencies. Here's how that could affect Social Security recipients.",
    "story": [
      "Even with a U.S. government shutdown beginning on Wednesday, Oct. 1, the 74 million Americans who collect Social Security will continue receiving their monthly checks, although some services could be disrupted due to a potential halt in federal activities, according to experts.",
      "Social Security benefits are covered by mandatory spending, which means that the funding for the program has already been approved by Congress without an expiration date. As a result, Social Security recipients, including retirees, disabled Americans and the dependents of deceased workers, wouldn't see an interruption in their monthly payments if the government shuts down.",
      "However, other Social Security services could be impacted by a shutdown, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare. The Social Security Administration's working budget requires approval from Congress. The Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded past Sept. 30.",
      "With no agreement having been reached, some Social Security services could be temporarily halted until the issue is resolved, according to both the Social Security Administration and experts on the retirement program.",
      "\"The system hasn't missed a payment in its entire 90-year history and won't start now,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare, said in an email. \"But customer service at the Social Security Administration (SSA) may be disrupted, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing, and replacing Medicare cards.\"",
      "In preparation for past shutdowns, each federal agency has created a contingency plan for its operations, with some employees expected to work without pay because they're considered to be providing essential services. In an email to CBS News, the SSA said beneficiaries would continue to receive payments even if the government closes.",
      "\"In the event of a lapse in appropriation, SSA will follow the contingency plan for continued activities, and Social Security beneficiaries would continue receiving their Social Security, Social Security Disability Insurance, and SSI payments,\" an agency spokesperson said.",
      "Which Social Security services could be impacted?",
      "That would depend on how many SSA employees are deemed to be essential, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare.",
      "In a Sept. 24 contingency plan\u00a0published\u00a0by the SSA, the agency said about 45,000 employees \u2014 almost 90% of its workforce \u2014 would stay on the job in case of a shutdown. Another roughly 6,200 workers would be furloughed, according to the planning document.",
      "\"We will continue activities critical to our direct-service operations and those needed to ensure accurate and timely payment of benefits,\" the plan states. \"We will cease activities not directly related to the accurate and timely payment of benefits or not critical to our direct-service operations.\"",
      "According to the new plan, the following are services that would be halted during a shutdown:",
      "Benefit verificationsEarnings record corrections and updates unrelated to the adjudication of benefitsPayee accountingsPrisoner activities \u2014 suspensionRequests from third parties for queriesFreedom of Information Act requestsIT enhancement activities, public relations and trainingReplacement Medicare cardsOverpayments processing",

      "Freedom of Information Act requests",
      "IT enhancement activities, public relations and training",
      "Replacement Medicare cards",
      "Overpayments processing",
      "Another aspect of Social Security could be delayed due to a shutdown: the Social Security Administration's annual announcement of the cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, to beneficiaries' monthly payments. The COLA is intended to ensure that people's benefits keep up with inflation and that the value of their Social Security income doesn't erode over time.",
      "The SSA announces the annual COLA each October when the Labor Department releases its Consumer Price Index data that month, which this year is scheduled for Oct. 15. But there could be a hitch this year if federal agencies shut down, according to the Labor Department.",
      "\"A delay of the CPI release during October of each year might have an impact on the Cost of Living Adjustment announcement by the Social Security Administration,\" the Labor Department said in issuing a\u00a0contingency plan that covers the impact of a possible shutdown on its operations.",
      "When is the next Social Security payment?",
      "Social Security payments would continue to go out as usual during a shutdown, with recipients of Supplemental Security Income \u2014 a program for low-income and disabled people \u2014 scheduled to receive their next checks on Oct. 1.",
      "Social Security recipients will receive their checks on their usual schedule, which is based on their birth date. Those born between the 1st to 10th of their birth month will receive payment on Oct. 8, while those born between the 11th to 20th days will receive their payment on Oct. 15. People born between the 21st and the last day of their birth month will get their check on Oct. 22.",
      "\"If you're a Social Security recipient, you're going to get your check, and that's obviously a good thing,\" Wayne Winegarden, a senior fellow in business and economics at the Pacific Research Institute, a think tank focused on free trade, told CBS News."

      "The storms' blistering winds and record-high water levels laid waste to several small communities on Oct. 12, displacing more than 2,000 people and requiring one of the most significant airlift operations in Alaska history. At least one person died, and two others are missing.",

Videos he shared Monday with The Associated Press conveyed the desperate scene as the waters rose inside his home and the flooding raged outside.",
      "At around 3 a.m. on Sunday, the water level rose to Anaver's knees in about 10 minutes. Shortly after, his home teetered, tilted and started floating.",
      "Plastic bags, boxes of blankets, a leather boot and furniture cushions floated in videos Anaver took from inside. The walls swayed like a ship's. Outside, the power had long since been out. Dark waters lapped the house just a few feet from the window as the home drifted away. Anaver heard loud booms, and frigid wind rushed through a hole that opened in one wall.",
      "\"This was a big challenge for my anxiety,\" he said. \"I kept calling my family.\"",
      "More booms shook the home as waves crashed it into other structures.",
      "\"Oh God,\" he wrote in a Facebook post around 5:30 a.m.",

      "A small hill with a board sticking out of it had stopped Anaver's home just feet from the river, which had dragged other houses much farther away.",
      "After 7 a.m., when the water had receded enough, two neighbors in waders came over and helped him out.",
      "Anaver's community was one of two Yup'ik communities that were hit hardest. In the other, Kipnuk, troopers said they rescued at least another 16 people from the catastrophic floods.",
      "State troopers estimated that at least eight homes in Kipnuk and Kwigillingok were pushed from their foundations as the villages were struck by \"strong winds and heavy flooding, which caused significant damage\" in both areas."

    "summary": "A lapse in funding due to the shutdown could have a devastating effect on the millions of Americans who rely on the federal food stamps program for groceries.",
    "story": [
      "States are warning struggling Americans who rely on food stamps to pay for groceries that they may miss out on benefits come November.",
      "\"Starting October 16, SNAP \u00a0[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program] benefits will not be paid until the federal government shutdown ends and funds are released to PA,\" reads a\u00a0notice from the Pennsylvania state website.",
      "New Jersey,\u00a0Maryland, New York and\u00a0Texas are among the other states that have issued similar notices.",
      "The wave of announcements come after the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees the federal food stamps program, issued a letter to state agencies on Oct. 10 saying that if the lapse in appropriations continues, there will be \"insufficient funds\" to pay full November SNAP benefits.",
      "Reached for comment, the White House referred CBS News to the USDA, which then shared the letter it sent to states. Both declined to comment on what a lapse in funding could mean for the millions of Americans who rely on the program. Advocates, meanwhile, have warned the effects could be devastating.",
      "\"These are, for the most part, working individuals who still are living paycheck to paycheck,\" said Gina Plata-Nino, interim director for SNAP at the Food Research & Action Center (FRAC), a nonprofit focused on ending hunger.",
      "How SNAP benefits are normally administered",
      "Over 40 million Americans are enrolled in SNAP. Recipients, on average, receive a payment of $187 (or roughly $6 per day) on prepaid cards that they can use\u00a0to buy produce, meat, dairy and other household food staples.",
      "While SNAP is a federally funded program run by the USDA, states are responsible for administering benefits and setting their own disbursement dates. As described by The Food Research and Action Center (FRAC) on its website, the program is a \"delicate partnership of public and private entities.\"",
      "To ensure benefits are available at the first of every month, states send electronic case files with information on SNAP recipients on a monthly basis to an electronic benefit transfer (EBT) vendor so they can process the data and load recipients' cards.",
      "\"EBT processors have to get all of this data in time,\" Plata-Nino explained. \"They need to be able to process the payment so when that person utilizes their card at that EBT retailer, the money will be there for the retailer to be able to swipe.\"",
      "The shutdown, however, has thrown a wrench in the process. In its letter to state agencies on Oct. 10, the USDA directed states to hold off on sending electronic files to EBT vendors \"until further notice.\" The pause opens the door to possible delays and disruptions in November benefits.",
      "\"Letting people go hungry is a choice, and it's not a good one,\" Deb Powers, a 66-year-old Massachusetts resident and SNAP recipient, told CBS News.",
      "Contingency funding",
      "One way for the USDA to cover SNAP costs, explained Plata-Nino, would be for the agency to tap into its contingency funds. According to FRAC, the reserve stood at $6 billion during the Biden administration.",
      "After Democrats and Republicans\u00a0failed to come to an agreement to extend government funding on Oct. 1, 2025, the USDA said in its Lapse of Funding\u00a0plan that the SNAP program has been provided for with multiyear contingency funds that could be used to cover state administrative expenses during a federal government shutdown.",
      "\"These multiyear contingency funds are also available to fund participant benefits in the event that a lapse occurs in the middle of the fiscal year,\" the plan states.",
      "However, it's unclear if the USDA plans to utilize those funds to ensure November SNAP benefits. The agency did not respond to CBS News' request for comment on whether that option is under consideration.",
      "During the government shutdowns in 2018 and 2019, the USDA disbursed SNAP funds early to prevent benefits from running out, Plata-Nino said.",
      "\"This administration didn't do any of that [this time], but they still have the contingency funding ...\" Plata-Nino said. \"They have the money, so it really is a policy choice.\"",
      "It's also possible states could attempt to free up money from their own budgets to bridge the gap, although approval would be an uphill battle given that it costs tens to hundreds of millions of dollars monthly to cover SNAP benefits. Whether states would get that money back is unclear.",
      "Peter Hadler, the deputy commissioner of Connecticut's Department of Social Services, told lawmakers in his state Thursday that he doesn't expect the federal government to ever reimburse states."

      "The findings come as American households continue to feel squeezed by rising prices, with inflation inching higher this year on everything from groceries to housing. The jump in health insurance costs are partly due to an aging workforce that's tapping more medical services, as well as increased demand for costly treatments such as the GLP-1 drugs used for weight loss, Mercer Chief Actuary Sunit Patel said.",

      "Americans pay double what residents in other developed nations pay for health care, even though outcomes in the U.S. are worse than those in other countries, the Peter G. Peterson Foundation noted in an August\u00a0analysis.",
      "In addition to an aging workforce and inflation, the complexity of the U.S. health care system is also driving those costs higher, noted Peterson. On top of that, growing consolidation amongst health insurers has made the market less competitive, resulting in higher costs, the U.S. Government Accountability Office said in a\u00a0December report.",
      "Higher health care costs could add to the financial squeeze felt by many families, who are already coping with higher grocery, utility and housing prices, noted Lindsay Owens, executive director of the Groundwork Collaborative, a liberal-leaning economic think tank.",
      "A KFF poll in July found that 4 in 10 insured adults under 65 years old worry about affording their monthly health insurance.",
      "\"You can't really go without health care, so something else will have to give,\" Owens said. That could mean cutting \"a family vacation, a family trip to a soccer game, or putting groceries on the credit card so you can clear the health care premiums.\"",
      "The Consumer Price Index, a basket of goods and services typically purchased by Americans, likely rose 3.1% on an annual basis in September, an uptick from August's 2.9% annual rate, according to economists polled by FactSet. The September inflation data will be released on Oct. 24."

    "summary": "The French crown jewels robbed from the Louvre museum in Paris are likely lost forever, an art crime expert tells CBS News, even if the thieves are caught.",
    "story": [
      "Paris \u2014\u00a0French authorities may well manage to track down and arrest the thieves who pulled off an audacious robbery of royal crown jewels from Paris' iconic Louvre museum, but they're unlikely to recover the national treasures, a criminologist told CBS News on Tuesday. The heist took place on Sunday, in broad daylight with tourists in the museum, but nobody was hurt.",
      "\"We will catch them,\" Alain Bauer, a professor of criminology at France's National Conservatory of Arts and Crafts, told CBS News.",
      "But he added: \"I don't think we will capture the jewels.\"",
      "See the jewels the Louvre thieves got away with \u2014 and one they didn't",
      "See the jewels the Louvre thieves got away with \u2014 and one they didn't",
      "Bauer said a lot of DNA was left at the scene by the robbers, including on the crown of the empress Eug\u00e9nie, which was left behind by the thieves as they made their getaway on motorcycles.",
      "French police also recovered a large crane lift used by the thieves to access an upper floor window of the 230-year-old museum, along with a power saw, gloves, a walkie-talkie and a can of gasoline. Authorities have said the criminals may have intended to use the gas to burn their tools, but they ran out of time.",
      "The criminals entered from the back side of the Louvre's main building on Sunday \u2014 away from the main entrance with its famous glass pyramid \u2014 before cutting their way through a window using the power lift and saw. They then made their way straight for the Galerie d'Apollon, the large hall that housed the crown jewels.",
      "If the thieves were professional criminals, they may well be known to the police, with information available on French law enforcement databases, Bauer told CBS News.",
      "But \"if they're amateur, or in the middle, under control or subcontracted by somebody else, it may be a little more complicated,\" he said.",
      "What are the jewels stolen from the Louvre worth?",
      "The stolen French crown jewels are priceless in historical terms, but Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau said Tuesday their estimated worth is 88 million euros, or $102 million.",
      "\"The wrongdoers who took these gems won't earn 88 million euros if they had the very bad idea of disassembling these jewels,\" Beccuau said in an interview with French broadcaster RTL. \"We can perhaps hope that they'll think about this and won't destroy these jewels without rhyme or reason.\"",
      "Experts have told CBS News the jewels would still be worth millions of dollars if broken up and sold on the black market.",
      "One of the stolen items is a tiara featuring 212 pearls and nearly 2,000 diamonds, commissioned by Emperor Napoleon III to celebrate his marriage to Eug\u00e9nie de Montijo in 1853. Also swiped: a sapphire-and-diamond tiara and necklace set, a large diamond brooch, and an emerald necklace and earrings that were originally a wedding gift from Napoleon to his second wife, Empress Marie-Louise of Austria, in 1810.",
      "The stunning theft was the most spectacular robbery at the Louvre museum since the Mona Lisa was stolen in 1911. The iconic painting by Leonardo da Vinci was located in Italy and returned to the Louvre several years later.",
      "Sunday's heist has been described as both a tragedy and a national embarrassment for France.",
      "\"You know, you think, in the Louvre, of all places, don't they have the best security on the planet?\" one stunned American tourist told the French news agency AFP soon after the robbery, calling it \"crazy.\"",
      "But security experts say the Louvre's security vulnerabilities were extensive. A recent security audit noted that 35% of the rooms in the Denon Wing, where the jewels were kept, have no security cameras, according to a Radio France report.",
      "France's Justice Minister Gerald Darmanin told reporters on Monday that the country had fundamentally failed to secure its national treasures.",
      "\"I know that we cannot secure totally all the sites. But what was sure was that we failed, because someone was capable of putting in a crane truck, in the open, in the streets of Paris, to have people walk up for a couple of minutes and take priceless jewels and give France a deplorable image,\" Darmanin lamented."

      "\"The Louvre museum's security apparatus did not fail, that is a fact,\" the minister, Rachida Dati, told lawmakers in the National Assembly. \"The Louvre museum's security apparatus worked.\"",
      "Dati said she launched an administrative inquiry that comes in addition to a police investigation to ensure full transparency into what happened. She did not offer any details about how the thieves managed to carry out their heist given that the cameras were working. But she described it as a painful blow for the nation.",
      "The robbery was \"a wound for all of us,\" she said. \"Why? Because the Louvre is far more than the world's largest museum. It's a showcase for our French culture and our shared patrimony.\"",
      "Interior Minister Laurent Nu\u00f1ez said Monday that the museum's alarm was triggered when the window of the Apollo Gallery was broken into.",
      "Police officers arrived on site two or three minutes after they were called by an individual that witnessed the scene, he said on LCI television. Officials said the heist lasted less than eight minutes in total, including less than four minutes inside the Louvre.",
      "Nu\u00f1ez did not disclose details about video surveillance cameras that may have filmed the thieves around and in the museum, pending a police investigation. \"There are cameras all around the Louvre,\" he said.",
      "The theft focused on the gilded Apollo Gallery, where the Crown Diamonds are displayed. Eight objects were taken, according to officials: a sapphire diadem, necklace and single earring from a matching set linked to 19th-century French queens Marie-Am\u00e9lie and Hortense; an emerald necklace and earrings from the matching set of Empress Marie-Louise, Napoleon Bonaparte's second wife; a reliquary brooch; and Empress Eug\u00e9nie's diadem and her large corsage-bow brooch, a prized 19th-century imperial ensemble.",

      "The jewels were not privately insured, the French Ministry of Culture said in a statement to the daily newspaper Le Parisien. French law prohibits entities like the Louvre from insuring its property, except when part of a collection is moved or loaned to another institution, Romain D\u00e9chelette, president of France-based Serex Assurances, a fine art insurer, told CBS News."

    "published": "Tue, 21 Oct 2025 13:56:49 -0400",
    "summary": "The brazen daylight robbery at the Louvre in Paris is reminding some of a notorious gang of European thieves.",
    "story": [
      "The thieves who stole priceless jewelry from the Louvre are reviving memories of an audacious gang that stole $500 million in valuables in a series of daring heists that took place over nearly two decades.",
      "The Pink Panthers targeted jewelry stores and museums in Europe and Asia and carried out some of the largest heists in history, raking in half a billion dollars worth of stolen goods between the early 1990s and mid-2010s.",
      "There is no evidence that the theft at the Louvre is connected to the Pink Panthers, but the brazen nature of the robbery was similar to those carried out by the gang.",
      "Who are the Pink Panthers?",
      "The Pink Panthers are a network of loosely organized teams, Interpol secretary general Ron Noble told \"60 Minutes\" in 2014. There are hundreds of gang members associated with the group. Most were from Eastern Europe, Noble said, and many fought in the Serbian Special Forces during the Bosnian Wars in the mid-1990s. The gang has no organized chain of command, Noble said, and uses experts in fields like safecracking, carjacking and more.",
      "The Pink Panthers bring military discipline and expert planning to their thefts, Noble said, often doing weeks of surveillance and preparation before hitting their target. The attacks are carried out by small teams, typically in under a minute, and have well-planned getaways, Noble said. Once on the run, the gang quickly crosses international borders, often using fake passports.",
      "One audacious robbery saw the Pink Panthers drive cars into a mall in Dubai before smashing into a jewelry store, stealing handfuls of diamonds and driving out \u2014 all in 45 seconds. They are responsible for the largest art robbery in Japanese history and the biggest jewel heist in Britain. In the latter incident, the thieves made off with $40 million of precious stones, including some hidden in a jar of cold cream. In San-Tropez, France, they escaped by speedboat after stealing $3 million worth of jewelry. In 2008, the Pink Panthers stole priceless paintings from an art museum in Zurich, Switzerland. The artworks were worth a combined $163 million, making it the largest art robbery in European history.",
      "Law enforcement has been chasing the gang for years, Noble said. Interpol has identified 800 members of the Pink Panthers using photos, fingerprints and DNA, Noble said. Several gang members have been taken into custody, including one arrest in 2024. Some of their stolen goods \u2014 including the paintings taken from Zurich \u2014 have been recovered. However, diamonds and jewelry are difficult to recover, since the gems can be recut or turned into different pieces.",
      "Robbery at the Louvre",
      "The thieves at the Louvre worked in broad daylight while tourists were already inside the famed museum. The thieves entered the museum with a crane-like lift, then smashed glass cases in the Apollon Gallery, home of the French crown jewels. They fled the scene on motorcycles, a museum spokesperson said.",
      "The museum was closed after the brazen heist, and no injuries were reported. French officials said the robbery was carried out in just four minutes, and referred to the thieves as \"professionals.\" Criminologist Alain Bauer told CBS News that the thieves left behind DNA, which could be matched to information in law enforcement databases if the robbers are known to police. French police said supplies including a power saw, gloves, a walkie-talkie and a can of gasoline were also found. Bauer said the evidence will help police with their investigation.",
      "\"We will catch them,\" said Bauer, who is a professor of criminology at France's National Conservatory of Arts and Crafts. \"I don't think we will capture the jewels.\"",
      "The thieves took nine pieces from the jewelry collection of Napoleon III. One item \u2014 the crown of Empress Eug\u00e9nie, made of gold, emerald and diamonds \u2014 was found apparently dropped outside the museum.",
      "The other pieces stolen include a pearl and diamond tiara with over 200 pearls and nearly 2,000 diamonds, a gold corsage bow-shaped brooch with thousands of stones, a set of sapphire jewelry that may have once belonged to Marie Antoinette, an emerald necklace and pair of earrings that Napoleon gave his second wife as a wedding gift, and a diamond-encrusted brooch.",
      "The jewels were of \"inestimable value,\" according to France's interior minister and the museum. Despite their value, the jewels were apparently not in reinforced cases, art historian and former Louvre worker David Chanteranne told CBS News correspondent Elizabeth Palmer. For purposes of \"historical accuracy,\" the jewels were presented in their original cases.",
      "Recent thefts across Europe",
      "There have been other notable heists at European museums in recent years. Thieves in Germany smashed into Dresden's Green Vault museum overnight in 2019 and stole over $120 million worth of jewels. The robbers said in court that they used an axe to smash the cases and a fire extinguisher to hide their DNA. Some of the pieces they stole were recovered, but were damaged. Others have never been found.",
      "Thousands of items were discovered to have been stolen from the British Museum in 2023. The small pieces were not on display and were largely used for research purposes. An employee was fired and the museum said they were seeking legal action against them. Some of the items have been recovered.",
      "In 2022, a group of men broke into Germany's Celtic and Roman Museum, in a heist that took place in just nine minutes. Cables were cut at a nearby telecommunications hub, leaving the area without communications networks. The thieves pried open the museum's door, then smashed into a display case to take hundreds of gold coins that dated back to 100 B.C. They left the museum without triggering any alarms.",
      "The men were arrested several months later. Three participants were convicted and handed prison sentences that ranged up to 11 years, while a fourth was acquitted of involvement in the theft but convicted on other charges. The treasure is still missing and appeared to have been at least partially melted down.",
      "In 2020, a Van Gogh painting was stolen from a Dutch museum that was closed to prevent the spread of coronavirus. The painting was recovered in 2023, according to the Smithsonian."

Vance, Kushner and U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff are in Israel this week as they try to\u00a0shore up the fragile ceasefire in Gaza.",
      "\"Look, I think that we are one week into President Trump's historic peace plan in the Middle East, and things are going frankly better than I expected that they were,\" Vance told reporters as he began his press conference in Israel.",
      "Vance insisted this is \"not the end\" of the peace plan, but rather, \"exactly how this is going to have to happen when you have people who hate each other, who have been fighting against each other for a very long time.\"",
      "\"We are doing very well,\" he said. \"We're in a very good place. We're going to have to keep working on it, but I think we have the team to do exactly that.\"",
      "But Vance urged a \"little bit of patience\" as Israel waits for the return of all of the hostages' remains from Hamas. Vance said there are \"difficulties\" in securing all the bodies.",
      "\"Some of these hostages are buried under thousands of pounds of rubble,\" he said. \"Some of the hostages nobody even knows where they are.\"",
      "Kushner said it's \"amazing to think it's only been a week\" since the peace agreement was signed.",
      "\"A lot of people are getting a little hysterical about different incursions one way or the other, but what we are seeing is that things are going in accordance,\" Kushner insisted. \"Both sides are transitioning from two years of very intense warfare to now a peacetime posture.\"",
      "Vance said the last week has given him \"great optimism\" the ceasefire is going to hold, adding that he'd come to Israel to \"see how things were going\" on the ground so he could report back to the president.",
      "The U.S. and Israel need to be \"a little bit flexible\" on the issue of Hamas' disarmament, he said.",
      "\"I'm not going to do what the president of the United States has thus far refused to do, which is put an explicit deadline on it, because a lot of this stuff is difficult,\" he said of Hamas' time to disarm. \"A lot of this stuff is unpredictable.\"",
      "As he answered reporters' questions, the vice president emphasized that no American troops would be deployed in Gaza to implement the peace plan.",
      "\"There are not going to be American boots on the ground in Gaza,\" Vance said. \"The president of the United States has made that very clear, all of our military leadership has made that very clear. What we can do is provide some useful coordination.\"",
      "Before Vance left for Israel, he said bumps in the road to peace were to be expected.",
      "\"There are going to be fits and starts,\" Vance told reporters. \"Hamas is gonna fire on Israel, Israel's gonna have to respond, of course.\"",
      "Hamas has denied responsibility for an alleged RPG attack that killed two Israeli soldiers over the weekend. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Monday that it was a Hamas attack, and that the Israeli military responded to the alleged ceasefire violation by dropping almost 169 tons of bombs in Gaza.",
      "\"One of our hands holds a weapon, the other hand is stretched out for peace,\" Netanyahu told lawmakers on Monday. \"You make peace with the strong, not the weak. Today Israel is stronger than ever before.\"",
      "The Israeli strikes killed at least 45 Palestinians, according to health officials in the Hamas-ruled territory.",
      "President Trump warned Hamas on Monday against breaching the deal that took months to negotiate.",
      "\"They're gonna behave, they're gonna be nice,\" he said. \"And if they're not, we're gonna go and eradicate them if we have to.\"",
      "Kushner and Witkoff met Monday with Netanyahu, and the Israeli leader's office said Vance would also meet him this week. The vice president and second lady Usha Vance were greeted upon their arrival Tuesday by U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee, Israeli Ambassador to the U.S. Yechiel Leiter and Israel's Minister of Justice Yariv Levin.",
      "Vance was scheduled to have a working lunch with Witkoff and Kushner on Tuesday before his meeting with Netanyahu.",
      "The peace process has taken incremental steps forward despite the weekend violence, with Israel returning the remains of 15 Palestinians to Gaza on Tuesday following the handover by Hamas on Monday evening of the body of another deceased hostage. As part of the peace deal, a total of 165 Palestinians' bodies have now been returned to Gaza, many of them former detainees, while all 20 living Israeli hostages have been released by Hamas, along with the remains of 13 deceased captives.",
      "But despite those steps, the long-term viability of Mr. Trump's peace plan, which he's said will end nearly eight decades of fighting between Israel and the Palestinians, remains less certain.",
      "Ex-Israeli official casts doubt on prospects for Trump's peace plan",
      "Some Israelis remain skeptical that the Israeli prime minister is genuinely interested in a lasting peace. Among them is fierce Netanyahu critic Alon Pinkas, who served as an advisor to four Israeli foreign ministers.",
      "He told CBS News that Netanyahu signed the peace deal brokered by Mr. Trump, but never really backed its core purpose, or Mr. Trump's stated goal of securing an enduring peace in the heart of the Middle East.",
      "\"This was an agreement he was bullied into,\" Pinkas said. \"This is an agreement he signed under duress, and now he is developing a new scheme to manipulate Trump.\"",
      "Pinkas credited Mr. Trump for doing \"something that his predecessors were disinclined or hesitant to do, and that is exert real pressure\" on Israel's leader.",
      "\"It worked, but it only worked for the first phase,\" Pinkas said, referring to the living Israeli hostages being released and the ceasefire coming into effect.",
      "He said after the weekend's violence that the deal had been \"ostensibly restored, but when Netanyahu says, 'I'm restoring the ceasefire,' it's only because there's a visit here of the vice president, JD Vance, and because the U.S. sent its envoy.\"",
      "Pinkas said he was certain Israeli forces would resume operations in Gaza within days, noting they remained deployed in about half of the Palestinian territory.",
      "\"The hostages are no longer in danger because they were freed, and Hamas was not decisively destroyed, as Mr. Netanyahu promised and boasted and bragged for two years, so I see a serious incentive for Mr. Netanyahu to resume\" an offensive against Hamas, Pinkas told CBS News. \"Maybe not on a huge scale, given the agreement, but I do see ... a local skirmish that becomes a wider flare-up, that then deteriorates or escalates into a full Israeli military operation.\"",
      "Hamas' top negotiator said Tuesday that the group remained committed to the ceasefire agreement. But President Trump's peace plan calls for the demilitarization of Gaza, and many analysts, including Pinkas, have doubts that Hamas will willingly hand over all its weapons.",
      "\"That's probably the biggest flaw in the agreement,\" said Pinkas. \"The agreement in and of itself is a good agreement, but in order for an agreement like that to work, it requires good faith, good will, and trust. None of these ingredients exist. In fact, both sides have a vested interest in not progressing beyond the ceasefire.\"",
      "\"Hamas wants to lure Israel inside [Gaza] into a de-facto occupation, and mount an insurgency and show to the Palestinians that they are the real resistance. And Netanyahu wants to go in because he knows that if everything stops now and there is progress into the next phases, that almost inevitably means that he will be deemed as the guy who failed to defeat Hamas.\"",
      "Pinkas said that while the past two years of war have left Hamas defeated militarily and degraded, \"Hamas is not done. Hamas are there, and you see those pictures every day. You show them on CBS \u2014   Hamas gangs walking around in battle fatigues, armed. That's not going to cut it politically for Mr. Netanyahu.\"",
      "Speaking in a recent interview with CBS News' Tony Dokoupil, Netanyahu said his government had agreed \"to give peace a chance,\" but he noted that the conditions of Mr. Trump's 20-point peace plan \"are very clear \u2014 it's not only that we get the hostages out without getting our military out, but that we would subsequently have both demilitarization and disarmament. They're not the same thing. First Hamas has to give up its arms. And second, you want to make sure that there are no weapons factories inside Gaza. There's no smuggling of weapons into Gaza.\"",
      "\"We also agreed: Okay, let's get the first part done. Now let's give a chance to do the second part peacefully, which is my hope,\" the Israeli leader told CBS News."

      "Indonesia has some of the world's toughest drug laws, but has moved to release half a dozen high-profile detainees in the last year \u2014 including a Filipina mother on death row and the last five members of the so-called \"Bali Nine\" drug ring.",
      "Lindsay Sandiford, now in her late 60s, was sentenced to death on the island of Bali in 2013 after she was convicted of trafficking drugs.",
      "Customs officers found cocaine worth an estimated $2.14 million hidden in a false bottom in Sandiford's suitcase when she arrived in Bali on a flight from Thailand in 2012.",
      "Sandiford admitted the offenses, but said she had agreed to carry the narcotics after a drug syndicate threatened to kill her son. In 2013 she lost an appeal against her death sentence.",
      "Convicted drug smugglers in Indonesia are sometimes executed by\u00a0firing squad.",
      "Senior law and human rights minister Yusril Ihza Mahendra said he had signed a deal with British foreign minister Yvette Cooper for the transfer of Sandiford and Shahab Shahabadi, a 35-year-old serving a life sentence for drug offenses after his arrest in 2014.",

      "Shahabadi was \"suffering from various serious illnesses, including mental health issues,\" he added.",
      "The minister identified Sandiford as 68 years old, though public information showed her to be 69.",
      "It was unclear if Sandiford would remain at Bali's overcrowded and most notorious prison, Kerobokan, or be moved to another facility before her transfer.",
      "Jennifer Fleetwood, a criminologist at the University of London, was part of Sandiford's appeal team in the initial case 12 years ago. She told BBC News that Sandiford endured harsh conditions.",
      "\"To undertake a prison sentence with the threat of execution, I can't fathom how difficult that would be,\" Fleetwood told BBC News. \"Having spent time doing research in prisons overseas, I know that it's really, really hard for people to serve a sentence abroad.\"",
      "Indonesia's immigration and corrections ministry said more than 90 foreigners were on death row, all on drug charges, as of early November.",
      "In June, three other British nationals accused of smuggling over two pounds of cocaine into Indonesia were charged in Bali. They face the death penalty under the country's strict drug laws.",
      "Lisa Stocker, 39, her husband Jon Collyer, 38, and Phineas Float, 31, all faced the death penalty, but in July, they were told by a judge that they would only serve a 12 month sentence, BBC News reported.",

      "Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto's administration has repatriated several high-profile inmates, all sentenced for drug offenses, since he took office a year ago.",
      "In December, Filipina inmate Mary Jane Veloso tearfully reunited with her family after nearly 15 years on death row.",
      "In February, French national Serge Atlaoui, 61, was returned home after 18 years on death row.",
      "Indonesia last carried out executions in 2016, killing one of its own citizens and three Nigerian drug convicts by firing squad.",

    "story": [
      "Tokyo \u2014 Japan's parliament elected ultraconservative Sanae Takaichi as the country's first female prime minister Tuesday, a day after her struggling party struck a coalition deal with a new partner expected to pull her governing bloc further to the right.",
      "Takaichi replaces Shigeru Ishiba, ending a three-month political vacuum and wrangling since the Liberal Democratic Party's disastrous election loss in July.",
      "Ishiba, who lasted only one year as prime minister, resigned with his Cabinet earlier in the day, paving the way for his successor.",
      "Takaichi won 237 votes \u2014   four more than a majority \u2014 compared to 149 won by Yoshikoko Noda, head of the largest opposition party, the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, in the lower house, which elects the prime minister.",
      "The LDP's off-the-cuff alliance with the Osaka-based rightwing Japan Innovation Party, or Ishin no Kai, ensured her premiership because the opposition isn't united.",
      "Takaichi's untested alliance is still short of a majority in both houses of parliament and will need to court other opposition groups to pass any legislation \u2014 a risk that could make her government unstable and short-lived.",
      "\"Political stability is essential right now,\" Takaichi said at Monday's signing ceremony with the JIP leader and Osaka Gov. Hirofumi Yoshimura. \"Without stability, we cannot push measures for a strong economy or diplomacy.\"",
      "Her win points Japan to the right, including on immigration and social issues.",
      "In addition, Takaichi faces public anger over rising prices after years of deflation. That's boosting backing for oppositions groups such as the far-right Sanseito party.",
      "Tackling rising prices and other economic measures are the top priority for the Takaichi government, LDP Secretary General Shunichi Suzuki told NHK public television as he apologized over the delay because of the party's internal power struggle since the July election. He said the new coalition will cooperate with other opposition parties to quickly tackle rising prices to \"live up to the expectations of the people.\"",
      "The two parties signed a coalition agreement on policies underscoring Takaichi's hawkish and nationalistic views.",
      "Their last-minute deal came after the Liberal Democrats lost its longtime partner, the Buddhist-backed Komeito, which has a more dovish and centrist stance. The breakup threatened a change of power for the LDP, which has governed Japan almost uninterrupted for decades.",
      "Later in the day, Takaichi, 64, will present a Cabinet with a number of allies of LDP's most powerful kingmaker, Taro Aso, and others who backed her in the party leadership vote.",
      "JIP will not hold ministerial posts in Takaichi's Cabinet until his party is confident about its partnership with the LDP, Yoshimura said.",
      "Takaichi is running on deadline \u2014 a major policy speech later this week, talks with President Trump and regional summits. She needs to quickly tackle rising prices and compile economy-boosting measures by late December to address public frustration.",
      "While she is the first woman serving as Japan's prime minister, she's in no rush to promote gender equality or diversity.",
      "Takaichi is among Japanese politicians who have stonewalled measures for women's advancement. Takaichi supports the imperial family's male-only succession and opposes same-sex marriage and allowing separate surnames for married couples.",
      "A protege of\u00a0assassinated former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and admirer of Britain's Margaret Thatcher, Takaichi is expected to emulate Abe's policies including a stronger military and economy, as well as revising Japan's pacifist constitution. With a potentially weak grip on power, it's unknown how much Takaichi will be able to achieve.",
      "When Komeito left the governing coalition, it cited the LDP's lax response to slush fund scandals that led to their consecutive election defeats.",
      "The centrist party also raised concern about Takaichi's revisionist view of Japan's wartime past and her regular prayers at Yasukuni Shrine despite protests from Beijing and Seoul, which see the visits as a lack of remorse about Japanese aggression, as well as her recent xenophobic remarks.",
      "Takaichi has toned down her hawkish rhetoric. On Friday, she sent a religious ornament instead of going to Yasukuni."

The top U.S. officials who helped negotiate the ceasefire and hostage release agreement \u2014   senior envoy Steve Witkoff and Mr. Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner \u2014 were back in Israel on Monday to help ensure it does not unravel.",
      "Israel struck multiple targets inside Gaza after a deadly attack on Israeli soldiers. Hamas has rejected Israel's claim that it was involved in that attack.",
      "On Monday, the skies over Gaza were quiet again in the wake of the gravest threat since the ceasefire there came into effect on Oct. 10. Hamas and Israel accused each other of violating the terms of Mr. Trump's peace plan over the weekend, but both sides recommitted to the process on Monday.",
      "For a couple tense days, however, war was back in Gaza. Local health officials in the Hamas-ruled Palestinian territory said 45 people were killed in Israeli strikes.",
      "Speaking Monday in Israel's parliament, the Knesset, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the military had dropped almost 169 tons of bombs in Gaza over the weekend.",
      "\"One of our hands holds a weapon, the other hand is stretched out for peace,\" he told lawmakers. \"You make peace with the strong, not the weak. Today Israel is stronger than ever before.\"",
      "The Israel Defense Forces said it launched the attack after two soldiers were killed when Hamas operatives opened fire with an RPG.",
      "As mediators raced to get the peace process back on track, President Trump said the situation would be \"handled toughly, but properly,\" and added that in his view, the ceasefire remained in effect.",
      "Over the weekend, Palestinian families had come out to enjoy a quiet moment at a seaside caf\u00e9 in Gaza, when cameras captured the moment that an Israeli strike shattered the peace.",
      "Many feared the blood-soaked scenes left in the wake of the explosions were a sign that two years of relentless violence had resumed after just a week.",
      "\"We were drinking tea,\" said Salih Salman, \"when suddenly people were bombed.\"",
      "Once again Gaza's crippled hospitals filled up with dozens of injured in the wake of multiple Israeli strikes.",
      "The IDF said it was targeting Hamas forces responsible for ceasefire violations, and it provided video purportedly showing armed Hamas fighters moving toward Israeli troops.",
      "A media center in central Gaza was among the locations bombed, with the strike killing a cameraman and an engineer, and wounding three other people.",
      "\"We are all journalists here,\" protested Ajeb Mohamed at the scene. \"No-one else can even enter here.\"",
      "More than 220 journalists and media workers have been killed in Gaza since the war started, according to the international advocacy group Reporters Without Borders.",
      "Amid the renewed fighting and accusations over the weekend, an Israeli official said all humanitarian aid deliveries into Gaza would be suspended. On Monday, however, COGAT, the Israeli government agency that handles affairs in the Palestinian territories, told CBS News that the Kerem Shalom border crossing was open for aid to transit.",
      "The United Nations and a number of humanitarian aid agencies have called repeatedly since the ceasefire came into effect for Israel to open all of the border crossings into Gaza to allow far more food, water, medicine, building materials and other essential items in.",
      "The ingress of aid \u2014 which under the U.S. peace plan should be maximized under the ceasefire \u2014   is likely to be among the key issues as Witkoff and Kushner meet with Israeli officials this week to ensure the process stays on track. Vice President JD Vance is also due in Israel this week, and set to meet with Netanyahu.",
      "Netanyahu met Monday with Witkoff and Kushner to discuss \"developments and updates in the region,\" Shosh Bedrosian, a spokeswoman for Netanyahu's office said Monday.",
      "She added that Vance and his wife were also expected in the country \"for a few days and will be meeting with the prime minister,\" but neither she nor the White House have confirmed the Vances' arrival date.",
      "Witkoff and Kushner were entrusted by Mr. Trump to broker the peace deal, and in an exclusive interview with 60 Minutes that aired on Sunday, they said an apology phone call from Netanyahu to Qatar's leader, about unprecedented airstrikes on the U.S. ally's capital, Doha, and a moment of personal connection between Witkoff and Hamas' top negotiator marked two key turning points that led to the ceasefire."

    "summary": "The Australian prime minister said the critical minerals deal takes the U.S.-Australia relationship \"to the next level.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese signed a critical minerals deal at the White House on Monday, as the U.S. eyes the country's rich rare earth resources while China is imposing tougher rules on exporting its own minerals abroad.",
      "Mr. Trump said the deal, which will entail up to $8.5 billion in projects, had been negotiated over several months. Albanese said the deal would take the U.S.-Australia relationship \"to the next level.\"",
      "\"In about a year from now we'll have so much critical mineral and rare earth that you won't know what to do with them,\" Mr. Trump said, seated alongside Albanese. \"They'll be worth $2.\"",
      "Critical minerals include some of the elements necessary for modern technology, including lithium and silicon. They also include rare earth elements, which are used to make magnets that are used in defense and aerospace technology.",
      "The White House says the U.S. and Australian governments intend to invest more than $3 billion in critical minerals projects in the next six months. But the framework released by the Australians says the two countries will invest $1 billion in the next six months. The framework the Australians released says the two countries will work together to accelerate the secure supply of critical minerals for defense manufacturing, streamline or deregulate the permitting process for critical minerals and rare earths, protect domestic critical minerals and rare earth markets from unfair trade and address gaps in key supply chains, among other things.",
      "The U.S.-Australia deal comes after Beijing announced it will require foreign companies to get approval from the Chinese government to export magnets containing even trace amounts of rare earth materials that originated from China or were produced with Chinese technology. The Trump administration says this gives China broad power over the global economy by controlling the tech supply chain. The move led Mr. Trump to threaten an additional 100% tariff on Chinese goods.",
      "The Trump administration and the president himself have been focused on securing rare earths deals, in part to find alternatives to China. Earlier this year, Mr. Trump struck a deal with Ukraine to\u00a0give the U.S. access to that country's minerals.",
      "Albanese said the critical minerals deal also signals the strong partnership between the U.S. and Australia.",
      "\"We are great friends and we're great allies,\" Albanese said Monday. \"And this is a relationship that's been forged in the battlefields of the world. We have stood side by side for freedom and democracy.\"",
      "The White House said Australia is also making new defense investments, including the purchase of $1.2 billion in unmanned underwater vehicles. Since February, the White House said Australia has contributed $1 billion to modernize the U.S. submarine industrial base. A trilateral security partnership called AUKUS involving the U.S., Australia and the United Kingdom \u2014 which was first struck during the Biden administration \u2014 aims to counter China in the Indo-Pacific, and producing submarines for that region is a key part of that security alliance.",
      "\"We have the best submarines in the world, anywhere in the world,\" Mr. Trump said Monday."

      "London \u2014 Sumo's biggest international showcase in history rocked London this week, spotlighting more than 40 wrestlers across 100 bouts with blistering palm thrusts, stunning face slaps and an unforgettable lightning-fast overarm throw. The final championship clash of the Grand Sumo Tournament was a battle of giants \u2014 a Goliath versus only a slightly smaller Goliath.",
      "Colliding with the force of a few tons and sending clay into the air, 330-pound Hoshoryu Tomokatsu seized the blue silk belt \u2014 the mawashi \u2014 of 420-pound Onosato Daiki. Momentum carried the heavier man to the edge of the ring, then Hoshoryu powered him out, sealing a perfect 5-0 record in just 10 seconds. The 5,000-strong crowd inside London's sold-out Royal Albert Hall erupted in cheers.",
      "\"I'm just glad to have got through the five days with no injuries,\" Hoshoryu said backstage after claiming the championship trophy.",
      "He hadn't planned a celebration, but told CBS News he's ready to go where his career takes him.",
      "\"If someone decides that we'll do this in America, of course I'll be there,\" said the 26-year-old.",
      "For young American boys watching and dreaming of entering sumo's sacred ring, his advice was rooted in self-discipline and perseverance.",
      "\"You must work hard to be a sumo wrestler if that is your dream. Everyone has dreams \u2014 but only you can achieve them,\" he said.",
      "Sumo is a life of devotion. Wrestlers typically begin training around age 15, the minimum age to join a heya, or stable, where they live communally and train full-time under a stablemaster, a retired wrestler. To outsiders, sumo may look like a sport but for its practitioners, it is a way of life shaped by 1,500 years of ritual and discipline, rooted in Shinto prayers for a bountiful harvest.",
      "London's Royal Albert Hall \u2014 better known for the echoes of The Beatles, Beyonc\u00e9 and Bruce Springsteen than the slaps and grunts of massive muscle men \u2014 was transformed into a place of reverence to reflect that.",
      "\"I've worked here 11 years, and this is one of the most exciting weeks I've ever been part of,\" said David Gamble, head of programming at the hall, who gave CBS News a special, behind-the-scenes tour.",
      "\"We've had teams, artisans in the U.K. create this 1.5 ton roof,\" he said, gesturing to the massive hanging roof over the ring reminiscent of a Shinto shrine. \"It is more than sport \u2026 we had a ring blessing ceremony where the Sumo Association blessed the ring in the same way that they would for all of their shows in Tokyo.\"",
      "He explained the few rows of red floor mats circling the ring were the most coveted \u2014 and the riskiest.",
      "\"You're really going to have to stay focused because at any moment there might be a 400 pound sumo wrestler bearing down on you, so no time to check your phone,\" Gamble said with a grin. These seats are \"the most expensive, the best and the most dangerous.\"",
      "Big wrestlers meant big logistics. The venue brought in 10 tons of clay to build the sacred ring \u2014 the dohy\u014d \u2014 and had to procure nearly a ton of rice. The athletes consume up to 10,000 calories a day, mostly in the form of a protein-rich stew, called chanko-nabe.",
      "The heaviest sumo wrestler ever recorded remains Konishiki Yasokichi, the Hawaiian-American who weighed 633 pounds at his peak. He competed at the Royal Albert Hall in 1991, when sumo first ventured beyond Japan's shores \u2014 the last time the hall hosted the sport until now.",
      "This week's event marked sumo's first overseas tournament in 34 years, and only its second in history. The more than 40 \"rishiki\" \u2014 not all from Japan but Mongolia and Ukraine too \u2014 stopped a lot of people in their tracks outside Buckingham Palace and Big Ben, crossing Abbey Road like The Beatles and at the \"Harry Potter\" Platform 9 3/4 attraction at King's Cross station.",
      "As Hoshoryu raised his championship trophy \u2014 the ornate Emperor's Cup, flown in from Tokyo \u2014 the moment symbolized more than victory. It was a celebration of an ancient Japanese tradition finding new life \u2014 and new fans \u2014 far from home."

Among the latest group honored was an attorney who at one point became a Satanic priest, before denouncing Satan and returning to his Christian faith.",
      "Bells rang out over St. Peter's Square for the ceremony on Sunday, which had an audience that the Vatican estimated at some 70,000 people. There, the pope canonized that ex-occultist priest, Bartolo Longo, alongside a lay catechist from Papua New Guinea, an archbishop killed in the Armenian genocide, a Venezuelan \"doctor of the poor\" and three nuns who dedicated their lives to the poor and sick.",

      "\"Let it be cut the way it is. It's cut up right now. I think 78% of the land is already taken by Russia. You leave it the way it is right now,\" Mr. Trump told reporters Sunday on Air Force One, apparently referring specifically to the Donbas region. \"They can negotiate something later on down the line. But I said cut and stop at the battle line. Go home. Stop fighting, stop killing people.\"",
      "The Donbas is a culturally and economically significant region, where many people speak Russian and have sympathies with Moscow. It is home to much of Ukraine's heavy industry and mining, accounting for about 16% of the country's GDP before the war started, according to The Associated Press.",
      "His remarks came two days after Mr. Trump met in person with Zelenskyy at the White House, which was a day after he spoke on the phone for two hours with Putin.",
      "Zelenskyy appeared to reiterate Kyiv's unwillingness to cede any territory for a ceasefire on Sunday, meanwhile, saying he had urged European leaders to apply \"the right kind of pressure\" on Russia.",
      "\"Almost every day now, we are communicating with leaders to ensure that we have a common position, all of us in Europe, on putting pressure on Russia \u2014 the right kind of pressure. We will grant the aggressor no gifts and forget nothing,\" Zelenskyy said in\u00a0a social media post.",
      "Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said Sunday that Ukraine should not be put under pressure to make concessions on its territory.",
      "\"None of us should put pressure on Zelenskyy when it comes to territorial concessions,\" he said in a\u00a0social media post. \"We should all put pressure on Russia to stop its aggression. Appeasement never was a road to a just and lasting peace.\"",
      "In\u00a0another social media post, Zelenskyy called his Friday Oval Office meeting with Mr. Trump a \"pointed conversation.\"",
      "The Financial Times newspaper reported Sunday that the meeting had descended into a shouting match on occasion, with Mr. Trump \"cursing all the time.\" Zelenskyy's delegation had brought in maps of the battlefield and Mr. Trump threw them to one side saying he was \"sick\" of seeing them, according to the FT report, which cited an official familiar with the matter.",
      "In response to a request for comment on the report of a second heated exchange between the leaders, the White House referred CBS News on Monday to Mr. Trump's remarks to reporters on Air Force One, without providing any additional description of the meeting. The Ukrainian president's office did not immediately reply to CBS News' request for comment for this story.",
      "Mr. Trump said in a post on his own Truth Social media platform that his meeting with the Ukrainian leader was \"very interesting, and cordial.\"",
      "Speaking with reporters on Sunday, in remarks that were embargoed until Monday, Zelenskyy said Ukraine shared \"President Trump's positive outlook if it leads to the end  of the war. After many rounds of discussion over more than two hours  with him and his team, his message, in my view, is positive \u2014 that we  stand where we stand on the line of contact, provided all sides  understand what is meant.\"",
      "\"I told him, as I likewise strongly suggested to President Putin, that it is time to stop the killing, and make a DEAL! Enough blood has been shed, with property lines being defined by War and Guts. They should stop where they are. Let both claim Victory, let History decide,\" Mr. Trump said Sunday.",
      "The White House meeting followed Mr. Trump and Zelenskyy's\u00a0incredibly tense encounter\u00a0in front of television cameras in February.",
      "The president had spoken on Thursday with Putin by phone. Following that lengthy discussion, the White House said Mr. Trump would hold a second bilateral summit with Putin in Hungary's capital, Budapest, at a still-to-be-confirmed date to discuss a possible ceasefire deal. Mr. Trump said it would likely happen within a couple weeks.",
      "It will be their second bilateral meeting this year, following in-person talks in Alaska in August. That diplomatic effort by Mr. Trump yielded no tangible results, as Moscow has continued to press its military campaign, taking more territory on the ground and bombarding Ukrainian cities from the air. Putin has also so far declined Mr. Trump's urging to hold a three-way meeting with Zelenskyy.",
      "U.S. and Ukrainian officials told CBS News that\u00a0Zelenskyy had hoped Mr. Trump would agree to a deal at Friday's meeting to supply Tomahawk missiles, but that has not yet materialized. Kyiv sees the long-range, guided cruise missiles as vital to give Ukraine's armed forces the ability to hit critical military, logistical and energy targets deep inside Russia.",
      "Ukraine has ramped up its attacks on key Russian energy infrastructure in recent months. The General Staff of the Armed Services, Ukraine's military headquarters, said Sunday in\u00a0a social media post that it had struck the Orenburg Gas plant in southern Russia, one of the country's largest natural gas processing plants.",

      "The U.S. military struck another alleged drug-carrying vessel on Friday, killing three people, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced on Sunday. It is the seventh known attack since last month.",
      "Hegseth said Friday's strike targeted a boat linked to Ej\u00e9rcito de Liberaci\u00f3n Nacional, a Colombian guerrilla group that the U.S. has considered a terrorist organization since the 1990s. He alleged in a post on X that the boat \"was traveling along a known narco-trafficking route, and was transporting substantial amounts of narcotics.\"",
      "The defense secretary said the strike took place in international waters and within the U.S. Southern Command's area of responsibility, which includes the Caribbean Sea.",
      "\"The United States military will treat these organizations like the terrorists they are\u2014they will be hunted, and killed, just like Al Qaeda,\" Hegseth wrote.",
      "At least 32 people have been killed in U.S. strikes on alleged drug boats. The Trump administration has said the U.S. is in a \"non-international armed conflict\" with drug cartels, arguing that the narcotics they smuggle kill tens of thousands of Americans every year, constituting an \"armed attack.\"",
      "\"When they're loaded up with drugs, they're fair game, and every one of those ships were,\" President Trump told reporters last week.",
      "The strikes have drawn some pushback from lawmakers who have pressed for more evidence that the boats were carrying drugs, and argue the administration hasn't made the case that the attacks are legally permitted.",
      "Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona told \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday that he believed the legal justification offered to members of Congress was \"very convoluted.\"",
      "\"They had a very hard time explaining to us ... the legal rationale for doing this and the constitutionality of doing it,\" Kelly said. \"The brief we got had a tremendous number of holes in it, and they had to go round and around to give us the legal rationale for doing this.\"",
      "The Venezuelan and Colombian governments have also criticized the strikes. This weekend, Colombian President Gustavo Petro accused the U.S. of hitting a fishing vessel in one of its strikes. Mr. Trump later called Petro an \"illegal drug leader\" and threatened to cut off U.S. aid to the South American country."

    "story": [
      "Royal author Andrew Lownie has written an explosive new book titled \"Entitled: The Rise and Fall of the House of York.\"",
      "This story discusses suicide. If you or someone you know is having thoughts of suicide, please contact the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline at 988 or 1-800-273-TALK (8255).",
      "Prince Andrew is facing another wave of humiliation due to his accuser Virginia Giuffre's upcoming posthumous memoir, \"Nobody\u2019s Girl: A Memoir of Surviving Abuse and Fighting for Justice.\"",
      "In the bombshell book, Giuffre \u2014 who died by suicide at the age of 41 earlier this year \u2014 recalled the multiple sexual encounters she allegedly had with the disgraced royal when she was just 17.",
      "She accused the prince of treating her as a \"birthright,\" described being trafficked for sex by Jeffrey Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell, and recounted an alleged group sex encounter and how she \"believed that I might die a sex slave.\"",
      "PRINCE ANDREW GIVES UP ROYAL TITLE WITH KING CHARLES' SUPPORT",
      "In addition to her explosive allegations, Giuffre made scathing remarks about Andrew's disastrous 2019 BBC \"Newsnight\" interview, reviving the conversation around the TV appearance that triggered the downfall of his public life.",
      "\"He said he had no recollection of ever meeting me\u2014\u2018None whatsoever.\u2019 Most outlandishly, he said he couldn\u2019t have danced sweatily with me at the Tramp nightclub, as I\u2019d described, because he\u2019d temporarily developed an inability to perspire after enduring \u2018an overdose of adrenaline in the Falklands War,'\u2014a bizarre reference to his military service nineteen years prior to our meeting,\" she wrote in a copy of the book, obtained by Fox News Digital.",
      "Prince Andrew is facing humiliation again as his late accuser Virginia Giuffre's memoir puts the spotlight back on his disastrous 2019 interview.\u00a0 (Karwai Tang/WireImage; Jeenah Moon/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "Andrew's interview centered on his friendship with convicted sex-offender Epstein and Giuffre's allegations that he had sex with her when she was underage. The royal agreed to the interview in order to clear his name and explain his relationship with Epstein.",
      "Instead, the interview became infamous due to Andrew\u2019s defensive and tone-deaf answers. After it aired on Nov. 16, 2019, the response was overwhelmingly negative.",
      "The interview was branded a \"car crash\" and a PR disaster, with widespread disbelief at Andrew\u2019s explanations and criticism of his lack of empathy along with other odd moments, including the references to not sweating.",
      "Media, politicians and the public widely viewed it as catastrophic for both his personal reputation and the monarchy\u2019s image. Within days, Buckingham Palace announced that Andrew would step back from public duties \"for the foreseeable future.\" He later lost his military titles and royal patronages, and corporate sponsors and charities cut ties with him and his initiatives.",
      "Meanwhile, Giuffre wrote, \"as devastating as this interview was for Prince Andrew, for my legal team it was like an injection of jet fuel.\"",
      "Giuffre, who died by suicide in April, detailed her alleged sexual encounters with Andrew in her posthumous memoir.\u00a0 (Steve Parsons/Getty Images)",
      "In 2021, Giuffre filed a sexual abuse lawsuit against Andrew, who has consistently denied her allegations. In her memoir, she recounted his alleged attempts to discredit and intimidate her as well as reinforce his statements that they had never met. Giuffre wrote that the royal's team \"went so far as to try to hire internet trolls to hassle me\" and claimed his protection officers attempted to \"dig up dirt\" on her.",
      "While speaking with Fox News Digital, royal expert Hilary Fordwich weighed in on the fallout from the book.",
      "PRINCE ANDREW'S IMAGE REMAINS A DANGER TO MONARCHY'S IMAGE AMID REPORTS OF BUCKINGHAM PALACE EVICTION: ROYAL EXPERT",
      "\"In addition to all we know, [Andrew] comes across even worse as unrepentant and manipulative. This is ghastly for the royal family,\" she said.",
      "\"The orgy with eight others is revolting,\" Fordwich continued. \"Her quote that he was having sex with her if having sex with me was his birthright is damning and all the cover-up attempts, which demonstrate deliberate actions and contradict his Newsnight interview where he stated he didn\u2019t even know Giuffre. If he didn\u2019t know her, then why was he trying to cover up?\"",
      "On Oct. 19, The Mail on Sunday published leaked emails suggesting Andrew passed Giuffre\u2019s date of birth and her Social Security number to his personal protection officer with instructions to investigate if she had a criminal record in the U.S. \u2014 a step that could be part of a smear-campaign strategy.",
      "The leaked emails were reportedly sent hours before the 2011 release of a now-infamous photo showing Andrew with an underage Giuffre. In a statement, London's Metropolitan Police told the Guardian, \"We are aware of media reporting and are actively looking into the claims made.\"",
      "Sources also told the BBC that the recent claims about Andrew are being treated by Buckingham Palace with \"very great concern and should be examined in the appropriate ways to the fullest extent.\"",
      "Andrew allegedly appears in this photograph with his arm around the waist of then-17-year-old Giuffre. Ghislaine Maxwell is standing to the right. (U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals)",
      "Fordwich noted that, \"Andrew\u2019s team attempting to hire online trolls in order to harass her so as to cast doubt regarding her credibility during her U.S. lawsuit in a smear campaign, which is now being investigated by British police is also horrendous. It indicates such hubris, moral blindness and entitlement.\"",
      "Royal commentator Richard Fitzwilliams explained that Giuffre's depiction of Andrew in the memoir and her revival of his 2019 interview could deepen the lasting damage to his reputation and future within the royal family.",
      "\"The portrait she paints of Andrew is of a bovine, entitled and supercilious individual, in some ways never out of the nursery,\" he told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"If his Newsnight interview did not exist, no one would have been able to invent it outside a spoof,\" Fitzwilliams continued. \"Yet he was a brave pilot before he succumbed to the lure of disastrous friendships like that of the deceased pedophile Epstein.\"",
      "In August 2019, four months before Andrew's interview, Epstein died in prison while facing federal sex trafficking and conspiracy charges.",
      "After a U.S. judge rejected Andrew's bid to dismiss Giuffre's civil lawsuit, the two sides reached an out-of-court settlement in February 2022.",
      "Royal commentator Amanda Matta told Fox News Digital that Andrew could potentially face legal consequences over the claims made in Giuffre's book and the newly resurfaced emails.",
      "\"While past civil litigation in the U.S. is concluded, the new memoir revives several potential areas of concern for Andrew,\" she explained. \"Even though he has not (as of yet) been criminally charged, the renewed scrutiny over possible misuse of police resources or attempt to gather personal information on a survivor could trigger regulatory or investigative action.\"",
      "\"If the monarchy faces any renewed questions about oversight, privilege, and accountability, that action might even be greenlit by palace agents,\" Matta added.",
      "Andrew is being investigated by the Metropolitan Police due to newly leaked emails.\u00a0 (AP Photo/Sang Tan, File)",
      "In addition to the emails published by the Mail on Sunday, other leaked correspondence could prove to be a liability for Andrew, according to Fitzwilliams.",
      "On Oct. 12, The Guardian published details of an email dated Feb. 28, 2011 from Andrew to Epstein, which contradicted the royal\u2019s prior claim that he cut contact with the disgraced financier in 2010.",
      "\"I\u2019m just as concerned for you! Don\u2019t worry about me! It would seem we are in this together and will have to rise above it,\" he allegedly wrote in an email sent to Epstein. \"Otherwise keep in close touch and we\u2019ll play some more soon!!!!\"",
      "Both Andrew and his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson currently reside at Royal Lodge, which is owned by the royal family and located in Windsor Great Park, about three miles south of Windsor Castle in Berkshire, England. (Chris Jackson/Getty Images)",
      "The leaked emails published by the Mail on Sunday emerged days after Andrew announced that he had relinquished his royal titles and honors due to the accusations connecting him with Epstein.",
      "\"In discussion with The King, and my immediate and wider family, we have concluded the continued accusations about me distract from the work of His Majesty and the Royal Family,\" Andrew's statement read. \"I have decided, as I always have, to put my duty to my family and country first.

      "\"No doubt the royals hoped that with Andrew voluntarily removing his titles that would be punishment enough, but more people are baying for blood with politicians seeking a legal resolve of title removals, Metropolitan police investigating the allegations of trying to use his security staff in establishing any scandals attached to Guiffre and the fact living in luxury in the 30 bedroom Royal Lodge at Windsor should still be allowed.\"",
      "Both Andrew and his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson currently reside at Royal Lodge, which is owned by the royal family and located in Windsor Great Park, about three miles south of Windsor Castle in Berkshire, England.",

      "Fitzwilliams pointed out that the accusations in the memoir will most likely further damage Andrew's already tarnished reputation and result in social exile for the prince and Ferguson.",
      "\"The quotes I have seen compound the insights we have already had into the character of Prince Andrew, who denies all the charges against him and has not been convicted of anything,\" Fitzwilliams said.",

Our goal is to cut through confusion and ensure everyone has access to clear information. Consumers want to know exactly what they are putting in and on their bodies. That is what we are working to achieve.\"",

      "Do rude prompts really get better answers? Short answer: sometimes. A 2025 arXiv study tested 50 questions rewritten in five tones and found that rude prompts slightly outperformed polite ones with ChatGPT-4o. Accuracy rose from 80.8% for very polite to 84.8% for very rude. The sample was small, yet the pattern was clear.",
      "But not so fast, this story has layers. A 2024 study that looked at multiple languages painted a different picture.

      "Rude prompts made ChatGPT more accurate. Polite ones scored lower. Tone changed the outcome. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why tone might change outcomes",
      "Large Language Models (LLMs) tend to mirror the wording they receive. When you sound direct or even a little blunt, you often give clearer instructions. That helps cut down on confusion and pushes the model to deliver sharper, more focused answers. A 2025 paper published on arXiv found that tone alone can shift accuracy by a few points, although more research is needed to confirm those results.",
      "In an earlier study led by researchers from Waseda University and RIKEN AIP, the team compared English, Chinese and Japanese prompts. They discovered that the ideal level of politeness varied by language, showing how cultural norms shape the way AI interprets human requests. In short, what works in one language might not land the same way in another.",

      "Nearly half of Americans say people should be polite to AI chatbots, according to an April 30, 2025, YouGov survey. Many users do it out of habit or courtesy.

      "Good manners may be polite, but they are not free. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said people saying\u00a0\"please\" and\u00a0\"thank you\" to ChatGPT costs the company millions of dollars each year. Every extra word adds tokens for the model to process, and those tokens require computing power and electricity.",
      "For a single user, that cost is tiny and hardly noticeable. Yet when millions of users do it all day, those small gestures turn into a major expense. In the end, even kindness comes with a price tag.",

      "Researchers tested three languages. Each reacted differently to politeness. Culture shaped every reply. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Rude prompts and ChatGPT accuracy in practice",
      "Here's where things get interesting. If you're writing math problems, multiple-choice questions or coding tasks, a short, no-nonsense tone might actually help. The 2025 study showed that when users dropped the polite fluff and went straight to the point, ChatGPT's accuracy ticked upward.",
      "Still, don't expect miracles. The difference wasn't huge; think a few percentage points, not a full upgrade. Rude or direct prompts can sharpen a model's focus, but they won't suddenly turn an average prompt into a perfect one. The trick is to treat tone as just one lever in your prompt-engineering toolbox. Clarity, structure and context matter more than attitude.",

Think of tone as the seasoning on a meal, not the main course. The real secret is this: good prompts are clear, confident and purposeful. Whether you choose a polite tone or a more direct one, what matters is explaining exactly what you need. That is how you get consistent, high-quality answers without resorting to rudeness. So before you send your next question, ask yourself this: Are you being too polite to get results, or just polite enough to be understood?",

      "In 2025, it feels like cybercriminals are winning while the world's biggest data hoarders are losing. One by one, global giants are admitting they've been breached, from tech powerhouses like Google to insurance leaders such as Allianz and Farmers and even luxury brands like Dior. The latest company to report a breach is Discord. The popular chat platform confirmed that hackers gained access to a third-party customer support provider, 5CA, exposing user data including names, email addresses, limited billing details and even government ID images.",

      "How the breach happened and what data was exposed",
      "The company confirmed that the breach, which occurred on September 20, did not involve a direct attack on Discord's servers. Instead, attackers gained unauthorized access to 5CA, one of Discord's third-party customer service providers. This allowed them to view information from users who had reached out to Discord's Customer Support or Trust & Safety teams.",
      "Discord is a chat app primarily used by gamers, but it has expanded to various other communities, enabling text messages, voice chats and video calls. Some even use it as a replacement for Slack. The platform currently has a monthly user base of over 200 million. The data exposed included Discord usernames, real names, emails, limited billing details such as payment type and the last four digits of credit cards, IP addresses and messages exchanged with customer service agents. In some cases, government ID images provided for age verification were also compromised. Discord estimates that around 70,000 users globally may have had government ID photos exposed.",
      "Reports suggest the attackers attempted to use this access to demand a ransom from Discord. Bleeping Computer reported that the Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters (SLH) threat group claimed responsibility for the attack earlier this month.

Since then, it has cut off the third-party support provider's access, launched an internal investigation with a digital forensics team and started informing affected users. It also clarified that any communication about the breach will come only from noreply@discord.com and that it will never contact users by phone regarding this incident. The company added that some data remained safe: full credit card numbers, CCV codes, account passwords and activity outside of customer support conversations were not exposed.",

Second, the numbers being shared are incorrect and part of an attempt to extort a payment from Discord.

      "If you think your details might have leaked in the Discord data breach, below are some steps you can take to stay protected.",
      "Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an extra verification step when logging in, making it much harder for attackers to access your account even if they have your password. Discord supports 2FA via authenticator apps or SMS. Once enabled, you'll receive a code each time you log in from a new device. This simple step can prevent account takeovers and gives you peace of mind.",
      "The less information available about you, the harder it is for attackers to target you. Review what personal details you've shared online, and remove unnecessary data from websites and apps. A personal data removal service can help scrub your information from data broker sites, making it more difficult for attackers to connect the dots and launch identity theft or phishing attacks.",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.",
      "Check out my top picks for data removal services and get a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web by visiting\u00a0Cyberguy.com.Get a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web:\u00a0Cyberguy.com",
      "Reusing passwords across platforms makes it easy for attackers to access multiple accounts if one password is compromised. A password manager can generate long, complex passwords and store them securely, so you don't have to remember them all. This not only protects your Discord account but also your email, banking and other online services.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager (see\u00a0Cyberguy.com) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords, and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com",
      "Even if you don't see immediate signs of compromise, attackers can try to exploit stolen data later. Regularly check your email and Discord login history for unusual sign-ins. Services like identity theft protection can scan the dark web for your credentials and alert you immediately if they appear, helping you react quickly before serious damage occurs.",
      "Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security Number (SSN), phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.\u00a0They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Phishing attacks often spike after breaches. Attackers may send messages that look like official notifications asking you to reset your password or provide personal information. Always verify the sender, avoid clicking unknown links, and never share sensitive info. Treat every unexpected message as suspicious, even if it appears to come from Discord or another trusted service.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",

      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "If the recent breaches are any indication, third-party services that companies rely on are often the weakest link in cybersecurity. Discord's steps to contain the situation are necessary, but they highlight a bigger problem. Many companies do not implement sufficient safeguards to protect sensitive user data. Weak oversight of third-party providers, delayed responses and inadequate security policies leave personal information exposed and vulnerable to attackers.",

A new survey from the Center for Democracy and Technology found that nearly one in five high school students in the United States say they or someone they know has used AI to have a romantic relationship. The results shocked researchers and raised big questions about how deeply AI tools are affecting young minds.

      "When AI becomes a \"friend\"",
      "Nearly half of the students said they use AI to talk about emotions, friendships or mental health. Many admit they feel more comfortable opening up to a chatbot than to a parent or friend. Even more alarming, two-thirds of parents said they have no idea how their kids are using AI. Experts warn that while AI can simulate empathy, it has no real understanding or care. According to researchers, students need to remember that they are not actually talking to a person. They are interacting with a programmed tool that has clear limitations and cannot truly understand human emotions.",
      "AI in schools: Help or harm?",
      "AI tools are everywhere in schools. About 85% of teachers and students said they used AI during the last school year. While schools introduce AI to boost learning, this exposure may have a downside. Students who use AI more often in class are also more likely to turn to it for emotional or personal reasons.

      "How the ShadowLeak attack worked",
      "Attackers embedded hidden instructions into an email using white-on-white text, tiny fonts or CSS layout tricks. The email looked completely harmless. But when a user later asked ChatGPT's Deep Research agent to analyze a Gmail inbox, the AI unknowingly executed the attacker's commands.",
      "The agent then used its built-in browser tools to exfiltrate sensitive data to an external server, all within OpenAI's own cloud environment, beyond the reach of antivirus or enterprise firewalls.",

      "The Deep Research agent was designed to perform multistep research and summarize online data, but its wide access to third-party apps like Gmail, Google Drive and Dropbox also opened the door to abuse.",
      "Radware researchers said the attack involved encoding personal data in Base64 and appending it to a malicious URL, disguised as a \"security measure.\" Once sent, the agent believed it was acting normally.",
      "The real danger lies in the fact that any connector could be exploited the same way if attackers manage to hide prompts in analyzed content.",
      "What security experts say",
      "\"The user never sees the prompt. The email looks normal, but the agent follows the hidden commands without question,\"\u00a0the researchers explained.",
      "In a separate experiment, security firm SPLX showed another weakness: ChatGPT agents could be tricked into solving CAPTCHAs by inheriting a manipulated conversation history.

    "story": [
      "Kurt 'CyberGuy' Knutsson joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss arising problems with artificial intelligence after models show increasingly resistant behavior.",
      "Artificial intelligence may be smarter than ever, but that power could be turned against us. Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt is sounding the alarm, warning that AI systems can be hacked and retrained in ways that make them dangerous.",
      "Speaking at the Sifted Summit 2025 in London, Schmidt explained that advanced AI models can have their safeguards removed.",
      "\"There's evidence that you can take models, closed or open, and you can hack them to remove their guardrails,\" he said.\u00a0\"In the course of their training, they learn a lot of things. A bad example would be they learn how to kill someone.\"",

      "When AI guardrails fail",
      "Schmidt praised major AI companies for blocking dangerous prompts:\u00a0\"All of the major companies make it impossible for those models to answer that question. Good decision. Everyone does this. They do it well, and they do it for the right reasons.\"",
      "But he warned that even strong defenses can be reversed.",
      "\"There's evidence that they can be reverse-engineered,\" he added, noting that hackers could exploit that weakness. Schmidt compared today's AI race to the early nuclear era, a powerful technology with few global controls.\u00a0\"We need a non-proliferation regime,\" he urged, so rogue actors can't abuse these systems.",
      "Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt warns that hacked AI could learn dangerous behaviors. (Eugene Gologursky/Getty Images)",
      "The rise of AI jailbreaks",
      "Schmidt's concern isn't theoretical. In 2023, a modified version of ChatGPT called DAN, short for \"Do Anything Now\", surfaced online. This \"jailbroken\" bot bypassed safety rules and answered nearly any prompt. Users had to \"threaten\" it with digital death if it refused, a bizarre demonstration of how fragile AI ethics can be once its code is manipulated. Schmidt warned that without enforcement, these rogue models could spread unchecked and be used for harm by bad actors.",
      "APOCALYPSE NOW? WHY THE MEDIA ARE SUDDENLY FREAKING OUT ABOUT AI",
      "Big Tech leaders share the same fear",
      "Schmidt isn't alone in his anxiety about artificial intelligence. In 2023, Elon Musk said there's a\u00a0\"non-zero chance of it going Terminator.\"",
      "\"It's not 0%,\" Musk told interviewers.\u00a0\"It's a small likelihood of annihilating humanity, but it's not zero. We want that probability to be as close to zero as possible.\"",
      "Schmidt has also spoken of AI as an\u00a0\"existential risk.\" He said at another event that, \"My concern with AI is actually existential, and existential risk is defined as many, many, many, many people harmed or killed.\" Yet he has also acknowledged AI's potential to benefit humanity if handled responsibly. At Axios' AI+ Summit, he remarked,\u00a0\"I defy you to argue that an AI doctor or an AI tutor is a negative. It's got to be good for the world.\"",

      "Microsoft is sounding the alarm, and this time, the warning hits home for everyday users. Hackers are now turning Microsoft Teams security threats into real-world dangers that go far beyond corporate networks. Using Teams, cybercriminals gather intel, pose as trusted contacts, trick people into sharing private data and even spread malware that can steal passwords or lock up personal files.",
      "What was once a simple video chat and collaboration tool has become a high-value target for cybercriminals and even state-backed hackers. Whether you use Teams for work, school or staying in touch, the risks are real and growing.\u00a0We'll break down how attackers abuse Teams, what Microsoft recommends and the simple steps you can take to protect yourself at home or on the job.",

      "Hackers are finding new ways to weaponize Microsoft Teams, turning everyday chats into dangerous entry points. (David Becker/Getty Images)",
      "Attackers start by probing Teams environments to find weak spots. They look for users with open settings, public profiles or external meeting links. Microsoft warns that \"anonymous participants, guests and external access users\" can give hackers a way in. If your Privacy Mode is off, they can see when you're online, send unwanted chats, or try to join meetings outside your group, even if you're just using a free account.",
      "Hackers often pretend to be someone you trust, like an IT admin, a coworker or even a Microsoft representative. They create fake profiles and logos that look convincing to trick you into clicking a link or sharing credentials. Microsoft says attackers \"take advantage of the same resources as legitimate organizations\" to pull off their scams.",
      "Once they've earned your trust, hackers send a chat or call that includes a malicious link or file. You might get a message saying,\u00a0\"Your Teams account needs verification\" or \"Update required for better security.\" It's all bait. These links can install spyware, steal logins or deliver ransomware that locks up your data, whether you're on a company laptop or your personal PC at home.",
      "MICROSOFT SHAREPOINT BUG PUTS CRITICAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AT RISK",
      "After breaking in, attackers try to stay hidden. They might add guest accounts, install shortcuts or change permissions so they can come back later. In some cases, they use the same Microsoft tools meant for admins to move across Teams, OneDrive or even your personal files stored in the cloud.",
      "Once inside, hackers can send commands through Teams messages or hide malware in shared links. They've even been known to send ransom demands directly through Teams chat. Microsoft says one group, Octo Tempest, used Teams to taunt victims and pressure them into paying up, showing how personal these attacks can get.",
      "Tips to stay protected",
      "You don't need to be a cybersecurity expert to stay safe on Microsoft Teams. A few smart tools and habits can go a long way in keeping hackers, scammers and snoops from taking advantage of your information.",
      "Keep your online presence private. Turn on Privacy Mode in Teams to stop strangers from seeing when you're active or trying to join meetings. It's a simple setting that makes it harder for hackers to target you or your company.",
      "If you share your Teams account with coworkers or family members, don't give everyone full control. Keep admin access limited to one trusted person. This reduces the chance of someone accidentally approving a scam link or letting malware spread.",
      "Hackers often rely on personal details found online to make their scams more convincing, things like your job title, workplace or even who you've video-chatted with. That information helps them build fake Teams profiles or send messages that look legitimate. Using a personal data removal service helps wipe your private details from data broker sites, cutting off one of the main sources hackers use to impersonate you. The less they can learn about you, the harder it is for them to trick you into trusting a fake message or clicking a malicious link.",

What makes these attacks so dangerous is their familiarity. Messages look normal, video calls seem real, and fake tech support chats can sound convincing. That's why awareness, not fear, is your strongest defense. With privacy settings enabled, antivirus protection running, and a reliable personal data removal service scrubbing your info from the web, you're already several steps ahead of scammers. Staying alert to phishing attempts and keeping your software up to date can turn Teams back into what it's meant to be: a safe, helpful way to stay connected.",

    "summary": "Google, Dior, Allianz and dozens of other companies lost sensitive customer data in Salesforce-related breaches affecting millions of records across multiple sectors.",
    "story": [
      "The CyberGuy explains steps you can take to protect yourself from scams.",
      "You might have noticed that in the past few months, many companies have disclosed data breaches, including Google, Dior and Allianz, and one name that appeared in most cases was Salesforce. Hackers did not breach company networks directly or exploit vulnerabilities in Salesforce's core software. Instead, they targeted the tools and people around it by tricking employees into granting access, compromising third-party apps and abusing overly broad permissions.",
      "Once inside, they siphoned sensitive data from Salesforce environments on an unprecedented scale. Nearly a billion records were stolen across dozens of organizations, and now cybercriminals are extorting victims by threatening to publish the data unless hefty ransoms are paid. Let's look at the recent Salesforce incidents in detail and why this is such a big deal.",

      "JEEP AND CHRYSLER PARENT STELLANTIS CONFIRMS DATA BREACH",
      "Hackers are weaponizing stolen Salesforce credentials to access company secrets. (REUTERS/Brendan McDermid)",
      "Why Salesforce is the perfect target",
      "Salesforce is not just another cloud platform. It is the backbone of how thousands of companies manage relationships with their customers. The platform powers everything from sales pipelines and marketing campaigns to support tickets and partner communications. Banks use it to track client accounts, airlines rely on it to manage frequent flyer programs, and retailers store customer purchase histories and loyalty data inside it. In many organizations, Salesforce sits at the center of daily operations, acting as a single system that touches sensitive information across departments.",
      "That is why the scale of these breaches is so significant. A successful attack on a Salesforce instance becomes a window into a company's customers, business strategy and internal processes. For cybercriminals, the potential payoff is enormous, and the recent incidents showed just how much damage they can cause without ever breaking into a company's primary network.",
      "The breaches hit companies across sectors, from Adidas and Allianz to Qantas, Google and Pandora Jewelry. Attackers often use voice-phishing calls or realistic fake apps to manipulate Salesforce administrators into installing malicious software. This allowed them to steal OAuth tokens and query data directly from CRM systems, a technique linked to groups like ShinyHunters.",
      "Other attacks originated in compromised third-party integrations. One of the most damaging involved a chatbot tool called Drift, where stolen tokens gave attackers access to Salesforce instances at hundreds of companies.",
      "The fallout was enormous. Coca-Cola's European division lost more than 23 million CRM records, while Farmers Insurance and Allianz Life reported breaches affecting over a million customers each. Even Google admitted that attackers accessed a Salesforce database used for advertising leads.",
      "TRANSUNION BECOMES LATEST VICTIM IN MAJOR WAVE OF SALESFORCE-LINKED CYBERATTACKS, 4.4M AMERICANS AFFECTED",
      "Major brands like Google, Dior and Allianz are among those caught in the data fallout. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Exploiting weak links in the ecosystem",
      "It's hard to break through firewalls or exploit technical vulnerabilities, but it's much easier to manipulate people. Attackers have figured this out, and they are now focusing their efforts on human behavior and the less-protected edges of cloud ecosystems. Employees with administrative privileges were often tricked into authorizing malicious apps, while default permission settings allowed those apps to operate undetected.",
      "Once they obtained the data, the hackers did not simply try to sell it. They used it as leverage. Earlier this month, a loosely organized cybercrime group known by names such as Lapsus$, Scattered Spider and ShinyHunters launched a dedicated data leak site on the dark web, threatening to publish sensitive information unless victims paid a ransom.",
      "As reported, the site is designed to pressure companies into paying to prevent their stolen data from being made public. \"Contact us to regain control of your data governance and prevent public disclosure,\" reads one message on the site. \"Do not be the next headline. All communications require strict verification and will be handled with discretion.\"",
      "The leak site lists several alleged victims, including FedEx, Hulu (owned by Disney) and Toyota Motors. It is also unclear whether some of the organizations known to have been breached but not listed on the site have paid ransoms to keep their data from being released.",
      "FARMERS INSURANCE DATA BREACH EXPOSES 1.1M AMERICANS",
      "Cybercriminals are now extorting victims online, threatening to leak billions of stolen records. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Salesforce's response",
      "Salesforce told Cyberguy that it is \"aware of recent extortion attempts by threat actors\" and will not engage with, negotiate with, or pay any extortion demands. A company spokesperson provided the following statement:",
      "\"We are aware of recent extortion attempts by threat actors, which we have investigated in partnership with external experts and authorities. Our findings indicate these attempts relate to past or unsubstantiated incidents, and we remain engaged with affected customers to provide support. At this time, there is no indication that the Salesforce platform has been compromised, nor is this activity related to any known vulnerability in our technology.\"",
      "6 steps you can take to protect your data",
      "You might think a breach like this is a company problem, something for IT teams and cybersecurity experts to deal with. However, when attackers gain access to platforms like Salesforce, the data they are after is usually not the company's. It is yours. Your contact details, purchase history, support tickets and even private conversations can end up in the wrong hands. And once that happens, the risks do not stay confined to one company. That is why it is worth taking a few proactive steps now, even if the company has not contacted you about an incident yet.",
      "If you have interacted with any of the companies mentioned in the breach, or suspect your data might be part of it, change your passwords for those services immediately. Better yet, use a password manager to generate strong, unique passwords for every site. A good tool will also alert you if any of your credentials appear in future data leaks.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Even if a password is stolen, two-factor authentication\u00a0(2FA) adds a crucial extra layer of security. Enable it for your email, banking apps, cloud storage and any service that offers it. It is one of the simplest ways to block attackers from hijacking your accounts with stolen credentials.",
      "Even if your data was part of a breach, you can still limit how much of it is floating around online. Personal data removal services scan and delete your personal information from data broker websites that sell or share your details without consent. These brokers often trade in names, addresses, phone numbers and even purchase histories, the same type of data leaked in Salesforce-related breaches.",
      "By removing your records from these public databases, you make it far harder for scammers, identity thieves and marketers to find or misuse your information. Many services, like Incogni, handle the entire opt-out process automatically and keep monitoring to ensure your data stays removed.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.

      "Attackers who have CRM data often know more about you than a typical scammer. They might reference past purchases, support cases, or other personal details to make their messages sound legitimate. Treat unexpected emails, texts, or phone calls with suspicion, especially if they involve links or requests for payment.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Data breaches do not always result in immediate damage. Sometimes, criminals sit on stolen data for months before using it. These services can continuously monitor the dark web for your personal information and notify you if your data appears in new leaks. That gives you time to act before problems snowball.",
      "Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number (SSN), phone number and email address, and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "If you think your data was exposed, companies are legally obligated in most regions to inform you. Do not hesitate to contact them directly and ask for details on what was stolen and what steps they are taking to protect affected customers. The more pressure users apply, the more likely companies are to tighten security practices.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Attackers can expose your personal data even if you are careful. They gain access to corporate cloud environments and can see customer names, emails, purchase histories and other sensitive details. For users, this means it is crucial to stay vigilant. Criminal groups use this stolen information to launch targeted phishing attacks, open fake accounts, or impersonate you elsewhere. Some even cross-reference leaked Salesforce data with information from previous breaches to build disturbingly complete profiles of their victims.",

      "Apple has officially launched iOS 26, and with it comes a fresh look and one standout new feature: the Preview app. If you've updated your iPhone and noticed a new icon that looks like it belongs on a Mac, you're not imagining things. Preview has finally arrived on iOS, and it's more useful than you might think. Many iPhone users have long wanted an easier way to edit, annotate and scan documents without relying on third-party tools. Now, Apple's built-in Preview app fills that gap, combining features from the Files app, Markup tools and the camera's document scanner into one streamlined experience.",

      "Road crews may soon get a major assist from artificial intelligence. Researchers at Germany's Fraunhofer Institute have developed a fabric embedded with sensors and AI algorithms that can monitor road conditions from beneath the surface. This smart material could make costly, disruptive road repairs far more efficient and sustainable.",
      "Right now, most resurfacing decisions are based on visible damage. But cracks and wear in the layers below the asphalt often go undetected until it's too late. That's where Fraunhofer's innovation comes in.",

      "How AI road sensors work to prevent costly repairs",
      "The system uses a fabric made from flax fibers interwoven with ultra-thin conductive wires. These wires detect minute changes in the asphalt base layer, signaling potential damage before it reaches the surface.",
      "THE ROAD TO PROSPERITY WILL BE PAVED BY\u00a0AUTONOMOUS\u00a0TRUCKING",
      "Fraunhofer researchers test AI sensors that detect road damage beneath the surface.\u00a0 (Fraunhofer Institute)",
      "Once the fabric is laid under the road, it continuously collects data. A connected unit on the roadside stores and transmits this data to an AI system that analyzes it for early warning signs. As vehicles pass over the road, the system measures changes in resistance within the fabric. These changes reveal how the base layer is performing and whether cracks or strain are forming beneath the surface.",
      "Why AI road monitoring matters for future maintenance",
      "Traditional road inspection methods rely on drilling or taking core samples, which are destructive, costly and only provide information for a small section of pavement. This AI-driven system eliminates the need for that kind of invasive testing.",
      "Instead of reacting to surface damage, transportation agencies could predict and prevent deterioration before it becomes expensive to fix. The approach could extend road life, cut down on traffic delays and help governments spend infrastructure funds more efficiently.",

      "The smart flax-fiber fabric measures stress changes in asphalt to spot cracks early. (Fraunhofer Institute)",
      "How AI and sensor data predict road damage early",
      "The real power comes from combining AI algorithms with continuous sensor feedback. Fraunhofer's machine-learning software can forecast how damage will spread, helping engineers prioritize which roads need maintenance first. Data from the sensors is displayed on a web-based dashboard, offering a clear visual of road health for local agencies and planners.",
      "The project, called SenAD2, is currently being tested in an industrial zone in Germany. Early results suggest the system can identify internal damage without disrupting traffic or damaging the road itself.",
      "What this means for you",
      "Smarter road monitoring could lead to fewer potholes, smoother commutes and less taxpayer money wasted on inefficient repairs. If adopted widely, cities could plan maintenance years in advance, avoiding the cycle of patchwork fixes that often make driving a daily headache.",

      "Why removing your data online reduces charity scam calls",
      "Here's something most people don't realize: many charity scams start with data brokers. These companies collect your personal details, such as age, phone number, donation history and even religious or political leanings, and sell them to anyone who asks. That means fraudsters can buy a ready-made list of \"generous retirees who donate to veterans' causes\" and start calling immediately. The more information out there about you, the more personalized and convincing scam calls become. That's why removing your data from broker sites is one of the most powerful defenses available to you.",
      "The easy way to do it",
      "Manually contacting hundreds of data brokers is a never-ending task. Each one has its own forms, emails and hoops to jump through, and many will re-add you months later. That's where a data removal service comes in. They automatically reach out to data brokers on your behalf, demand the removal of your personal info and keep following up so it doesn't creep back online.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Earlier this year, his office dropped an assault and kidnapping case against King when the victim failed to appear in court \u2014 a decision that allowed King to walk free on $200,000 bail, even though prosecutors had sought nearly $1 million because of the violent nature of the charges.",

What these claims have done, most importantly, is they have banned UNRWA, the largest humanitarian organization, from delivering food to hungry people.\"",

      "Conricus said that \"Ever since Hamas took power over the Gaza Strip in 2007, UNRWA has been a facilitator for Hamas\u2019s military buildup. By diverting international aid to provide for the civilian needs of Gaza\u2018s population per Hamas guidance, UNRWA enabled Hamas to divert the majority of their funds to military buildup in the shape of digging tunnels, producing rockets, acquiring drones and sophisticated missiles and paying and training a large force of Jihadi terrorists.\"",

It's that Hamas has to actually behave itself and that Hamas, while all the fighters can be given some sort of clemency, they're not going to be able to kill each other, and they're not going to be able to kill their fellow Palestinians,\" Vance said.",

      "As Britain marked the 100th anniversary of Margaret Thatcher\u2019s birth last week,\u00a0Japan made history of its own on Tuesday by electing its first female prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, a self-declared admirer of the \"Iron Lady.\"",
      "Takaichi, 64, who has long cited Thatcher as a personal and political inspiration, was chosen by Japan\u2019s ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), during an extraordinary session of the country's lower house, replacing former Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and ending several months of political turbulence that saw the party lose its upper-house majority in July.",
      "In remarks after her election, Takaichi said she felt \"the tough work starts here\" and promised to restore public confidence and strengthen Japan\u2019s security posture. Over the years, she has praised Thatcher\u2019s \"strength and womanly warmth\" as qualities she seeks to emulate. In 2013, shortly before Thatcher\u2019s death, Takaichi met her in London \u2014 a moment she later described as \"life-changing.\"",

      "Known for her hawkish stance\u00a0on China, Takaichi is expected to maintain Japan\u2019s close alignment with the United States. Chang said her election could bolster Washington\u2019s strategic position in Asia, especially as tensions with Beijing remain high.",

      "Markus had just\u00a0learned he was about to die. His oncologist broke the news to him and his family on the eighth floor cancer ward at British Columbia\u00a0Children's Hospital in Vancouver, Canada. They held each other, weeping.",
      "Weeks later, lying on his family\u2019s living room sofa, Markus dictated a letter to the Canadian Parliament\u2019s\u00a0Special Joint Committee on Medical Assistance in Dying, established to set guidelines on a federal law that allowed \"assisted suicide\" in Canada in 2016.",
      "Markus opposed lobbying efforts to expand the law to children under the age of 18.",

      "The letter closed, \"Life is worth living, even when we are dying.\"",
      "A month later, Markus died, surrounded by his family and friends, telling them, \"See you in paradise.\"",
      "Three years later, his parents, Mike and Jennifer Schouten, are carrying the torch for Markus in a mission to block efforts to allow \"mature minors\" the right to choose to die through assisted suicide. They now work alongside a global network of like-minded advocates, including disability rights groups, who argue the assisted-suicide industry targets vulnerable people who would benefit from assisted living services. Already, in Canada, the law is expected to expand to patients with severe psychiatric disorders, as early as 2027.",
      "But they are up against a powerful, well-funded machine. A Fox Digital investigation reveals the Schoutens and other opponents of euthanasia face a multimillion-dollar global lobby that could be called Assisted Suicide Inc., a sprawling network changing laws worldwide, developing euthanasia services for funeral parlors, selling \"suicide pods,\" promoting \"suicide tourism\" and even training \"doulas for death.\"",

According to a\u00a0database compiled by the Pearl Project, a nonprofit journalism initiative, at least 96 organizations worldwide are now part of this movement.",
      "The global lobby cloaks assisted suicide in the language of civil rights and human rights, using euphemisms in their names, such as \"assisted dying,\" \"medical assistance in dying,\" \"dying with dignity,\" \"choice,\" \"end of life,\" \"completed life,\" \"final exit,\" \"free exit\" and the \"right to die.\"",
      "These groups have a presence on every continent, but are predominately found in the West, which also faces alarmingly low birth rates. There are 41 groups in Europe; 31 groups in North America, with 25 of them in the United States, four in Canada and two in Mexico; 13 in Oceania, with most in Australia and one in New Zealand; and only five in Asia, two in Africa, and three in South America.",

      "The boundaries are shifting. Behind the push to extend these laws to children lies a legal Trojan horse: the \"mature minor doctrine.\"",
      "This concept, first established in a 1967 Washington Supreme Court case,\u00a0Smith v. Seibly,\u00a0once allowed limited medical discretion for minors. But over decades, it has metastasized into a sweeping jurisdiction for granting children autonomy \u2013 and\u00a0secrecy \u2013 over their medical decisions. Today, it lets minors make choices without parental involvement on gender pronouns, gender transitions, contraception and abortion. In 13 U.S. states and the District of Columbia, minors can even\u00a0obtain abortions without parental knowledge.",

      "Now, advocates are leveraging that same doctrine to argue that children should have the \"medical autonomy\" to choose death. The\u00a0\"National Youth Rights Association,\" a 501(c)(3) nonprofit based in Hyattsville, Md., uses the \"mature minors\" to die by physician-assisted suicide.",
      "Euthanasia is already legal for adults in Australia, Belgium, Colombia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain and 11 U.S. states. But three countries \u2013 the Netherlands, Belgium and Colombia \u2013 have gone further, allowing \"mature minors\" to die by physician-assisted suicide.",
      "In February 2023, despite the pleas of Marcus and his parents, Canada\u2019s Special Joint Committee on Medical Assistance in Dying\u00a0recommended extending the right to some youth, declaring that parents should be \"consulted\" but that the \"will of a minor\" with decision-making capacity \"ultimately takes priority.\"",
      "The same debate has now reached the United Kingdom, where a bill to allow adult euthanasia is\u00a0moving through the British Parliament. Earlier this year, the British House of Commons narrowly\u00a0voted 259 to 216 to bar physicians from discussing assisted suicide with youth, meaning nearly half of lawmakers supported discussing assisted suicide for youth.",

      "\"Assisted suicide will spread, full stop,\" she told Fox Digital. \"And the people allowed to do assisted suicide will grow, making it younger and younger.\"",
      "Birbalsingh argues that Western societies have fallen for the dangerous illusion that \"the child must lead,\" leading to thinking such as \"Oh, he wants to change his gender, or he wants to commit suicide.\"",
      "\"Once upon a time,\" she said, \"adults used to say, \u2018No, the child is not capable of leading, because he is a child.\u2018 In the West, we have forgotten that we\u2019re meant to be in charge as adults.\"",
      "\"There's just a million reasons why young people would want to choose death,\" said Birbalsingh, the founder of the Michaela Community School in London. \"You know, young people are compulsive, they make whimsical decisions.

      "\"That's why they need looking after,\" Birbalsingh added. \"That's why we need to look after them as adults. That's our job. It's our role in life, to keep and protect them, sometimes from themselves. The people making these decisions just don't understand young people.\" Lawmakers said there was a \"very real risk\" that proposed assisted suicide legislation, called the \"Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill,\" would be expanded to include children if they didn\u2019t vote for her amendment.",

    "story": [
      "TEL AVIV \u2014 Hamas has violently sought to reassert its authority over the Gaza Strip in the wake of the Israel military\u2019s partial withdrawal, but questions remain over the group\u2019s future and efforts to rebuild.",
      "Since the ceasefire came into effect a week ago, the militant group has deployed armed police officers on streets from where Israeli forces have withdrawn, clashed with rival clans, directly fired upon and killed Israeli troops in multiple incidents, and staged at least one public execution of suspected collaborators.",
      "As Hamas continues to demonstrate its presence, Israeli security officials and experts on Gaza agree it has been badly diminished but not thoroughly destroyed, and will count on new recruits propelled to join after tens of thousands of Palestinian civilians were killed by Israeli fire.",
      "Assessments of Hamas\u2019 strength are crucial to the negotiations around the group\u2019s disarmament \u2014 an important stipulation in the American-brokered ceasefire deal that halted the war. So far, the group has refused to give up its weapons.",
      "\u201cHamas was damaged very severely in its military capabilities, but I think it will be fair to say that it wasn\u2019t crushed,\u201d said Shalom Ben Hanan, a fellow at the International Institute for Counter-Terrorism at Israel\u2019s Reichman University and a nearly 30-year veteran of the Israeli Security Agency, also known as Shabak or Shin Bet. \u201cMaybe the threat isn\u2019t in the days to come or the nearest future. But their potential is still there.\u201d",
      "Hanan said the group still commands about 15,000 to 25,000 fighters \u2014 an estimate he said was based on his regular briefings from serving Israeli security officials.",
      "According to an Israeli military official, who asked for anonymity to speak openly about the Israeli military\u2019s internal assessment, about 10,000 to 20,000 commandos remain at Hamas\u2019 disposal.",
      "Giora Eiland, the former director of Israel\u2019s National Security Council and the former head of the planning department of the Israel Defense Forces, said Hamas lost about 20,000 fighters during two years of war \u2014 an estimate he also bases on conversations with serving security officials.",
      "But the group will have little trouble reconstituting its manpower, Eiland said, and security officials believe Hamas has been recruiting new fighters throughout the war even under fire.",
      "\u201cIt is easy for Hamas to regain power and it is very easy for them to recruit more and more people to replace those who were killed,\u201d Eiland said.",
      "Hamas wrested power from the more secular and internationally recognized Fatah party in 2007 after winning legislative elections the previous year. The Islamist group, which the United States, Israel and many other countries classify as a terrorist group, does not recognize Israel\u2019s right to exist and launched the Oct. 7, 2023,  attacks in part to stall normalization efforts in the Arab world.",
      "Israel\u2019s ensuing offensive has flattened much of the enclave, killed tens of thousands of civilians and engendered the kind of anger that could create thousands of potential recruits.",
      "\u201cAlthough we will be speaking about young people with less military experience, they still have no doubt lots of competence and enough personal weapons like small arms and RPGs,\u201d Eiland said, referring to rocket-propelled grenades.",
      "Tens of thousands of Palestinians have been killed and maimed in the war; a United Nations commission said in September that Israel is committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. Famine was officially declared in August in part of northern Gaza, including Gaza City, by the world\u2019s leading authority on hunger. The war has also inflicted significant damage on Hamas\u2019 supplies of its heaviest weapons and its weapons manufacturing capabilities, as well as on its senior leadership.",
      "The Israeli military official said that as many as 90% of the group\u2019s rockets have been destroyed, and Israel has succeeded in frustrating Hamas\u2019 ability to rebuild that lost heavy firepower.",
      "\u201cVery important is the manufacturing sites, the smuggling routes and so on,\u201d the military official said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just taking away the fish, it\u2019s taking away the rod.\u201d",
      "All of the experts agreed that Hamas\u2019 vast tunnel system remains its greatest strength and Israel\u2019s greatest challenge.",
      "Eiland estimated that 70% to 80% of Hamas\u2019 tunnels remain intact, with much of the surviving network unknown to Israel\u2019s military.",
      "In a statement last week, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said the IDF would turn its attention to destroying the remaining tunnel network as part of the process of disarming Hamas. The IDF said it had been working to dismantle a part of the tunnel network when some of its soldiers came under fire Sunday.",
      "The group\u2019s political power and popularity \u2014 key components in its ability to recruit, rebuild its weapons and suppress its rivals \u2014 have been badly damaged. Even if Gazans are enraged at Israel for killing nearly 70,000 Palestinians during the war, Hamas still takes part of the public blame.",
      "\u201cPolitically is where Hamas is really in shambles,\u201d said Ahmed Fouad Alkhatib, head of the Atlantic Council\u2019s Realign for Palestine project, whose family is from the Gaza Strip. \u201cThey don\u2019t really have a political program. They don\u2019t really have a compelling agenda in Gaza.\u201d",
      "But unlike the Islamic State terrorist group, or ISIS, and Al Qaeda \u2014 two terror groups whose power has been checked by the U.S.-led war on terror over the past quarter-century \u2014 Hamas presides over a true geographic constituency.",
      "\u201cIt is not a terrorist organization that came from nowhere and managed to take control over a certain area by spreading fear and terror,\u201d Eiland said. \u201cHamas is the authentic representative of the people of Gaza.\u201d",
      "Outside Gaza, Hamas also takes credit for turning global opinion against Israel, Alkhatib said.",
      "\u201cHamas feels that this shift is something that they alone brought about,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd Hamas ties that to its strategic picture on the ground.\u201d"

    "summary": "The Kremlin denied Tuesday that it was holding up President Donald Trump\u2019s push to end the war in Ukraine ahead of possible talks with Vladimir Putin.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s proposed summit with Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin in Budapest appears farther off than initially hoped, with talks toward planning such a sit-down now \u201con hold,\u201d a senior White House official told NBC News.",
      "After Trump was briefed on what the senior official described as a \u201cproductive\u201d call between Secretary of State Marco Rubio and his Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Monday, the president essentially pressed pause \u2014 believing that both sides in the Russia-Ukraine conflict were not ready to seriously talk peace, the official said.",
      "\u201cSecretary Rubio and Foreign Minister Lavrov had a productive call,\" a second White House official said. \"Therefore, an additional-in-person meeting between the Secretary and Foreign Minister is not necessary, and there are no plans for President Trump to meet with President Putin in the immediate future.\u201d",
      "Another phone call between Rubio and Lavrov is expected as soon as this week, a source familiar with the discussions told NBC News. The source did not rule out a future meeting, although no meeting is currently planned. The top U.S. and Russian diplomats are both expected to attend the Association of Southeast Asian Nations this weekend.",
      "Earlier, the Kremlin denied it was holding up Trump\u2019s latest push to end the war in Ukraine, and insisted it had not changed its demands ahead of possible talks.",
      "The president had announced that Russia and the United States\u2019 top diplomats would meet this week, with his own summit with Putin to follow in Hungary's capital Budapest. Russian officials have now said there was no date set for either meeting.",
      "\u201cWe cannot postpone what has not been agreed upon,\u201d Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told Russia's TASS state news agency early Tuesday.",
      "He was responding to a CNN report that the meeting between  Rubio and Lavrov had been put on hold indefinitely. Ryabkov said there had been no clear agreement on when or where such a meeting might take place.",
      "\"Everything is in progress, internal work is ongoing. As new information becomes available, we will keep you informed,\" he told state media journalists.",
      "Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov echoed Ryabkov's comments when talking about the summit in Budapest.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t postpone something that hasn\u2019t been agreed upon,\u201d Peskov said in his daily briefing. \u201cYou heard statements from both the American side and our side that this may take time. Therefore, no precise timeframe was initially set,\u201d he said.",
      "On Tuesday, Lavrov confirmed that he and Rubio had spoken and discussed how to prepare a \"framework for the next meeting\" between Putin and Russia.",
      "\u201cThe key point is not the venue or timing, but how we will proceed substantively on the tasks that were agreed upon and on which broad understanding was reached in Anchorage,\u201d he said, referring to Trump and Putin's meeting in Alaska in August.",
      "The two agreed to continue the telephone contacts on how to \"move forward in the right direction,\" he added.",
      "Lavrov said that the country\u2019s position remains consistent with understandings reached between Putin and Trump during the Anchorage talks.",
      "\u201cThose understandings are based on the agreement achieved at that time, which President Trump very succinctly formulated when he said that what is needed is a long-term, sustainable peace, not an immediate ceasefire that would lead nowhere,\u201d he said.",
      "On Sunday, after both a call last week with Putin and then a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Washington, Trump said he supported the immediate halt to fighting as called for by Kyiv and its European allies.",
      "For now, both sides should \u201cstop at the battle line \u2014 go home, stop fighting, stop killing people,\u201d he told reporters on board Air Force One. \u201cThey can negotiate something later on down the line,\u201d he said.",
      "Leaders of European nations, including Britain, France, Germany, Ukraine, and the European Union issued a joint statement Tuesday supporting Trump's efforts to end the fighting, and suggesting that Russia appeared unwilling to pursue a peace agreement at this stage.",
      "\u201cWe strongly support President Trump\u2019s position that the fighting should stop immediately, and that the current line of contact should be the starting point of negotiations,\u201d said the statement, published by the British government.",
      "\u201cWe must ramp up the pressure on Russia\u2019s economy and its defense industry, until Putin is ready to make peace,\u201d it said.",
      "In an interview with NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press\u201d taped Friday, Zelenskyy urged Trump to get tougher with Putin and said he was ready to join their summit in Budapest.",
      "Hungary\u2019s foreign minister, Peter Szijjarto, was in Washington on Tuesday. He posted on Facebook: \u201cWe have some serious days ahead.\u201d"

      "Combs was convicted in July on two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution, but was acquitted on more damning charges of racketeering and sex trafficking. On Oct. 3, a federal judge sentenced him to 50 months in prison, fined him $500,000 and ordered five years of supervised release.",
      "He pleaded not guilty and has maintained his innocence.",
      "On Aug. 1, Trump was asked about potentially pardoning Combs in an interview with Newsmax.",
      "\"You know, I was very friendly with him. I got along with him great and seemed like a nice guy. I didn\u2019t know him well,\" Trump said. \"But when I ran for office, he was very hostile.\"",
      "When asked if he was suggesting that he wouldn't pardon Combs, Trump said, \"I would say so.\"",
      "\"When you knew someone and you were fine, and then you run for office, and he made some terrible statements. So, I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s more difficult,\" Trump said. \"Makes it more \u2014 I\u2019m being honest, it makes it more difficult to do.\"",
      "Trump has issued several controversial pardons and commutations in his second term as president.",
      "In January, Trump pardoned roughly 1,500 criminal defendants in connection with the violent attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. In May, Trump pardoned the imprisoned reality television couple, Todd and Julie Chrisley.",
      "And last week, Trump commuted the sentence of former Rep. George Santos, R-N.Y., after the disgraced congressman pleaded guilty to charges of committing wire fraud and aggravated identity theft.",
      "Combs has asked to serve out his sentence at Federal Correctional Institution Fort Dix, a low-security federal prison in New Jersey, but the Bureau of Prisons has yet to approve the request.",
      "In addition to the 50-month sentence, the rapper faces strict conditions upon his supervised release, according to court documents filed in the weeks after his sentencing. Among the conditions is that he attends regular meetings with his probation officer and refrain from drug use, with a drug test taken within 15 days after his release and two periodic tests after that time frame, according to the seven-page filing.",
      "Combs must also participate in an outpatient program that includes testing, an outpatient mental health treatment program and an approved program for domestic violence, the filing states.",
      "Lawyers for Combs filed a notice of appeal in federal court on Monday, aiming to overturn the music mogul\u2019s conviction and sentence. A Justice Department representative did not immediately return a request for comment on the anticipated notice."

      "Warner Bros. Discovery shares surged on the news, rising more than 10%.",
      "The move comes as the media industry has continued a yearslong consolidation effort sparked in part by changes in consumer habits, most notably the rise of internet-based competitors such as Netflix and the decline in cable TV viewership.",
      "Any deal for part or all of the company would be a sizable one. As of Monday's close of trading, Warner Bros. Discovery had a market value of more than $45 billion. It also carries billions of dollars of debt on its balance sheet.",

      "In her posthumous memoir \u201cNobody\u2019s Girl\u201d released Tuesday, Giuffre, who died by suicide in April at age 41, said Andrew acted as though having sex with her \u201cwas his birthright.\u201d",
      "Andrew, who in February 2022 reached a legal settlement with Giuffre after she filed a civil case against him in a New York court, has repeatedly denied having met her.",
      "But the rolling scandal refuses to go away, and has the potential to inflict further damage on a monarchy whose popularity continues to dwindle after the death of the widely beloved Queen Elizabeth II in 2022.",
      "King Charles III has sought to insulate \u201cthe Firm\u201d from the cloud over his younger brother. Andrew said in a statement last week that with Charles\u2019 \u201cagreement,\u201d he would \"no longer use my title or the honours which have been conferred upon me,\u201d including  Duke of York.",
      "But there are still unanswered questions about what the palace knew, and when, with calls from lawmakers and others for the royals to oust Andrew entirely.",
      "\u201cThe deep and wide support for the queen meant the family was able to better weather all the controversies that could emerge \u2014 and this is a bad one,\u201d said Craig Prescott, who teaches law at Royal Holloway, University of London and specializes on the constitutional and political role of the monarchy.",
      "\u201cThese specific allegations are, of course, extraordinarily damaging in the first place, but they also run counter to some of the causes that members of the royal family take up,\u201d he said.",
      "Friday's agreement for Andrew to relinquish his titles came after emails published in documents for a court case not involving the prince showed he had been in contact with Epstein for longer than he previously admitted.",
      "That \u201cmakes him look, in black and white, a liar,\u201d NBC News' royal contributor Daisy McAndrew told \u201cTODAY\u201d on Sunday. \u201cAnd so how can you trust anything else he says?\u201d",
      "Then Sunday, London\u2019s Metropolitan Police said it was investigating reports that Andrew had asked one of its officers to dig up dirt on Giuffre. A Buckingham Palace official told NBC News these reports should be \u201cexamined in the appropriate way.\u201d",
      "Monday brought two further revelations: First that Andrew had not paid rent on his Royal Lodge residence for 20 years, revealed in a Freedom of Information request by The Times newspaper to the Crown Estate, which handles royal finances. Neither Andrew nor Buckingham Palace have responded to the report.",
      "Then came the publication of Giuffre\u2019s posthumous memoir.",
      "She wrote that she had sex with the prince on three occasions, including an \u201corgy\u201d involving \u201ceight other young girls\u201d who \u201cappeared to be under the age of 18 and didn\u2019t really speak English.\u201d",
      "She then suffered three weeks of \u201cirregular bleeding,\u201d before waking up in a \u201cpool of blood\u201d and being taken to hospital by Epstein, she wrote.",
      "Epstein, who died by suicide in jail in 2019 shortly after he was arrested on federal sex trafficking charges, later told her she had suffered a miscarriage, and she suspected him of conspiring with the doctor to keep it quiet, Giuffre said.",
      "On seeing a photo of Andrew and Epstein walking in New York's Central Park in 2010 \u2014 after Epstein was convicted of soliciting prostitution of someone under the age of 18 \u2014 Giuffre wrote she was  \u201crevolted to see two of my abusers together, out for a stroll.\u201d But \"mostly I was amazed that a member of the Royal Family would be stupid enough to appear in public with Epstein.\u201d",
      "Andrew has previously denied these allegations, saying that he has \u201cno recollection of ever meeting this lady, none whatsoever.\u201d In his statement announcing the relinquishment of his titles, he said, \u201cI vigorously deny the accusations against me.\u201d",
      "The civil sex abuse lawsuit brought by Giuffre against Andrew was settled out of court for an undisclosed sum.",
      "Though Buckingham Palace routinely says it does not speak for the prince, Andrew has enjoyed a prominent role at some recent royal events, including the queen's funeral.",
      "Some lawmakers are demanding that Andrew be formally stripped of his titles by an act of Parliament \u2014 a rare foray into regal matters by Britain\u2019s supposedly separate government.",
      "The last time this happened was in 1917, when Parliament used the Titles Deprivation Act to strip German members of the British royal family of their titles during World War I.",
      "That\u2019s not without risks, according to Prescott at Royal Holloway.",
      "\"If you have legislation removing the dukedom from Prince Andrew, might a cheeky MP want to table an amendment and remove the dukedom of Sussex from Prince Harry?\u201d he said.",
      "The government indicated it does not support this. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said Monday that while \u201cour thoughts have to be with the victims of Jeffrey Epstein, these \u201care matters for the royal family.\u201d",
      "The nuclear option would involve the king himself using something called \u201cLetters Patent\u201d to strip Andrew of his designation as prince.",
      "In doing so, the palace must weigh distancing itself from Andrew with ensuring the blowback from any further censure does not do even more damage to an institution that requires public buy-in.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s true that the monarchy isn\u2019t voted in,\u201d Prescott said. \u201cBut if the public mood shifted and people no longer wanted to have the monarchy, then you imagine that politics would follow.\u201d"

      "Cue \"Roundball Rock\" \u2014 the NBA is back.",
      "The 2025-26 season opens Tuesday with a doubleheader on NBC and Peacock \u2014 backed by the percussive theme song last heard in 2002, when NBC last had broadcast rights \u2014 from Oklahoma City, where the Thunder will receive their championship rings, and Los Angeles, before opening league-wide in the coming days.",
      "This season will be a collision between youth and experience. In June, the Thunder became the youngest team to win a title since the 1977 Portland Trail Blazers. To do it again, however, they will have to go through opponents led by veteran superstars including Denver's Nikola Joki\u0107, Houston's Kevin Durant, Golden State's Steph Curry, the Lakers' LeBron James, and Kawhi Leonard and James Harden of the Clippers.",
      "\u201cEverybody is saying \u2018defending,\u2019 but we\u2019re trying to be on the offensive as well,\u201d Oklahoma City star Jalen Williams said during preseason. \u201cSo we\u2019re coming in with more motivation to do that every year.\u201d",
      "NBC News reporters Rohan Nadkarni and Andrew Greif and three-time NBA champion Danny Green discuss what they are watching for as the season begins.",
      "Who is your MVP pick and why?",
      "Green: I\u2019m going to go with Nikola Joki\u0107. He had an unbelievable year last year, but they didn\u2019t want to give him his fourth one. This year he comes back on a tear and makes the league give him his fourth MVP. Denver has a really good squad this year, and I feel like they\u2019re going to be one of those teams at the top. The only thing that kind of hurt him last year was not being one of the top-seeded teams. They\u2019re going to be a top-three seed this year. They have really good squad, if they stay healthy. But I\u2019m seeing Joki\u0107 coming back with a vengeance, because people didn\u2019t want to give him his fourth.",
      "I remember playing him in San Antonio, even when I was in Toronto, he wasn\u2019t MVP Joki\u0107 just yet. But I remember those times when we didn\u2019t guard him with the double team like we should have. We had certain guys on him that probably shouldn\u2019t have guarded him. We had Kawhi [Leonard] guard him at one point. That\u2019s definitely a mismatch. Myself, I\u2019ve tried to guard him enough times. He was very good at drawing fouls, but his passing ability has been unbelievable since then. He was obviously a good passer, but he\u2019s become one of the best passers the game has seen. And then, of course, how he can score the ball.",
      "Nadkarni: Give me the player who has finished first or second in MVP voting in each of the last five seasons: Nikola Joki\u0107. The Joker arguably should have won the award in 2025, when he averaged 29.6 points, 12.7 rebounds and 10.2 assists per game while shooting 57.6% from the field. Voter fatigue, whether voters want to admit it or not, is certainly a factor here. But Joki\u0107\u2019s brilliance is undeniable, and after the Nuggets beefed up their rotation with a series of smart moves in the summer, Denver should have the team success to give a boost to Joki\u0107\u2019s case.",
      "Greif: Is there any player seemingly more intent on seeking revenge than the Lakers\u2019 Luka Don\u010di\u0107? After last season\u2019s stunning trade from Dallas, the Mavericks seemed intent on telling anyone who asked that his body wasn\u2019t right. Luka has since acknowledged that the out-of-nowhere nature of the trade left his head not in quite the right place, either. Now, he\u2019s entering his first full season with Los Angeles in much better shape and with the security of both a contract extension and the knowledge that the franchise is effectively building around him.",
      "Who is your championship pick?",
      "Green: OKC. You have to give them that respect. Getting everybody back and being the best team last year. What impressed me last year was how mature they were or how fast they grew up. Usually you got to take a year of getting your lumps. I still thought they were very green, and they needed some more maturity or another year of taking lumps before they could do it. But to see them grow up in real time and actually bounce back.",
      "And Shai [Gilgeous-Alexander] being the leader that he is for them, showing mental toughness through fatigue. I thought he ran out of gas in that Finals. There was a very pivotal game in Indiana where they needed to win to even the series. He had some big buckets toward the end of the game, but you can tell him from the start of the game \u2014 like he was off the ball. He was jogging, he was trying to conserve his energy. And he did, rightfully so. But that was a key, mature moment for him and for that group to get through that Game 4 and even out the series.",
      "Nadkarni: Well, if I\u2019m picking Joki\u0107 to win MVP, I\u2019m going to double down and pick the Nuggets to win the Finals. Is this partly wishful thinking? Perhaps. But it feels harder than ever to repeat in the NBA. And as much of a juggernaut the Thunder were last season, they were still pushed to seven games twice in the playoffs. (Oklahoma City also benefited from one of the most unfortunate injuries in recent league history when Tyrese Haliburton tore his Achilles in Game 7 of the Finals.)",
      "This isn\u2019t an anti-OKC case, though. It\u2019s more about what the Nuggets did in the offseason. Cam Johnson is a better fit than Michael Porter Jr. Jonas Valan\u010di\u016bnas is an actual, honest-to-God backup center. Bruce Brown is more steady than Russell Westbrook. In most playoff series, Denver should not only have the best player, but actual playable depth the team didn\u2019t have last year.",
      "Greif: The NBA hasn\u2019t had a repeat champion since 2018, a run of seven consecutive seasons with seven different winners. Given every major contributor returns from last season\u2019s title team, Oklahoma City appears as heavy a favorite as we have seen in some time. They\u2019re an incredible team that will be fortified by the confidence of knowing what it takes to win. But so does Denver, from 2023. The Nuggets gave the Thunder their hardest matchup of the postseason of any West team, then spent the offseason getting deeper. For as difficult a time as I had splitting hairs between these two teams, I had an even more difficult time arguing against Nikola Joki\u0107, and Denver\u2019s home-court advantage. Denver over New York for the title.",
      "What is one offseason acquisition you\u2019re most excited to see?",
      "Green: There\u2019s a couple guys I\u2019m biased to see I was teammates of. I\u2019m a Desmond Bane fan and his situation in Orlando. I\u2019m excited to see what some of my old teams can do this year. The San Antonio Spurs. I want to see Wemby and De\u2019Aaron Fox together, and then of course Dylan Harper, the new draftee.",
      "And even though Dallas is not a former team of mine, I want to see when Kyrie [Irving] comes back, what the Mavericks look like and with him and Anthony Davis.",
      "I\u2019m interested to see what Houston does with Kevin Durant, but I think Fred VanVleet was a big key to that. With him going down, that\u2019s tough for them.",
      "Nadkarni: Kevin Durant and the Houston Rockets are a match made in NBA nerd heaven. Giving the rough-and-tumble, defensively charged Rockets one of the greatest scorers of all time is going to be incredibly fun to watch. Coach Ime Udoka will get to play mad scientist during the regular season, figuring out the best lineup combinations to unleash his roster\u2019s unique blend of athleticism and size. Houston so clearly needed a half-court bucket getter in the playoffs last season, and it added someone who is going to the Hall of Fame because of that very trait. As a bonus, we may also get a chance to see Durant try to take down some of his old teammates and longtime rivals in a loaded West? I can\u2019t wait to see him give the Rockets an extra dose of swagger.",
      "Greif: Golden State is in the waning years of viable championship contention with Steph Curry now 37 and Draymond Green 35. Every season counts. How they attempt to maximize this one is particularly fascinating.",
      "Notable offseason signings include Al Horford, a 39-year-old forward who remains durable and effective. On this team of elders, one of the few young potential bright spots is Jonathan Kuminga, but the relationship has been strained between the 23-year-old who views himself as an All-Star-caliber piece and an organization and its coach who have been reluctant to give him big minutes in the past or money this offseason. A free-agency negotiation that dragged on for months and whose details became unusually public was only resolved before training camp, when Kuminga agreed to a deal that could be flipped into a trade.",
      "There is talent here, but the length of the dug-in negotiations hinted at tension. Getting another team to offer something significant in return for Kuminga will require him playing well. But if he gets such opportunities, how will he take advantage of them?",
      "What player should fans keep an eye on?",
      "Green: Cade Cunningham may be a household name now, but I feel like he\u2019s going to be one of those guys that could be in the All-NBA first team or MVP conversation. He\u2019s another mature kid. He\u2019s beyond his years. He\u2019s obviously an unbelievable talent, but the way that he\u2019s progressed in his first three or four years has been unbelievable.",
      "In the playoffs last season, he showed some maturity, but he also showed some signs of, \u2018I need to learn.\u2019 And I think he\u2019s going to take those things back to the drawing board and come back with a chip on his shoulder. That was a series that I felt like Detroit had a chance. Obviously, there was a missed call or so, but even with that, I feel like they had a chance. They\u2019ll come back different.",
      "Nadkarni: Once one of the most-hyped players entering the NBA, Lonzo Ball\u2019s career has been beset by injuries. After missing two straight regular seasons, Ball returned in 2024-25 to play in 35 games for the Chicago Bulls. In July, Ball was traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers, where he could be a perfect fit on a team with title aspirations.",
      "Before the injuries, Ball had blossomed into such a good player, hitting a good percentage of his outside shots on high volume, making plays for his teammates and defending multiple positions. With Darius Garland recovering from toe surgery, Ball could get a great opportunity to make an impact for the Cavs. If he can regain his previous form, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see him closing big games.",
      "Greif: When it comes to promising young NBA talents worth tracking, there are almost too many. But may we interest you in Toumani?",
      "Obsessive basketball fans have been noticing Toumani Camara\u2019s potential for two seasons, since he was a throw-in by Phoenix to a larger trade and sent to Portland, where he blossomed into a 6-foot-7 terror on the defensive end. He\u2019s one of the league\u2019s best and most versatile wings on that end, but there is still time to join the Trail Blazer wing\u2019s bandwagon, however. At only 25, Camara could make an offensive leap forward this season.",
      "Most likely to exceed expectations?",
      "Green: Indiana. Even with Haliburton being out, they\u2019re still going to be pretty solid. They still have some great point guards, with Andrew Nembhard and T.J. McConnell. I\u2019m very impressed with what Rick Carlisle has done throughout the years, to adapt and adjust, that\u2019s what makes him a basketball genius. He has a beautiful mind even outside the game. He\u2019s very much well respected throughout the league.",
      "Indiana has a really good team. They have some great guys who can hoop \u2014 Pascal Siakam is unbelievable \u2014 and a team camaraderie. There\u2019s a reason why Carlisle has been successful over so many years in different organizations and able to bring multiple groups to the Finals.",
      "Nadkarni: Caw-caw! The Atlanta Hawks had a great offseason, and I believe they have a great chance to play spoiler in the Eastern Conference. After acquiring Dyson Daniels before last season, the Hawks added Nickeil Alexander-Walker and Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is this summer, bringing in players with playoff experience who can play on both ends of the floor. Combine those guys with young forward Jalen Johnson (who was breaking out last year before an injury) and rising second-year player Zaccharie Risacher (the 2024 first overall pick who improved significantly after the All-Star break), Atlanta seems to have found the right talent to complement star guard Trae Young. If this team gels quickly, they could be as good as anyone in the East.",
      "Greif: Some oddsmakers have pegged Orlando with the third-best chance of making the Finals out of the East, a number that implies a certain amount of confidence in the Magic; the expectations are not low, in other words. But to fully turn the corner after two seasons of respectability into a full-blown contender ready to challenge Cleveland and New York, the Magic will have to stop being routinely limited by their offensive shortcomings. I think this is the season it happens, with Desmond Bane adding a threat for defenses that could create space for Paolo Banchero and Franz Wagner."

      "When the 2025-26 NBA season returns Tuesday, some things will not have changed in years.",
      "Though Golden State Warriors guard Steph Curry is now 37, and the Los Angeles Lakers\u2019 LeBron James 40 (and will begin the season sidelined by injury), the two superstars remain undisputed headliners a decade after the first of their four consecutive meetings in the NBA Finals. The sheer wattage of their stardom has barely dimmed, and it's why their teams will meet in one of Tuesday\u2019s opening-night matchups.",
      "But the other opening-night tipoff will take place in Oklahoma City, where the Thunder will receive the championship rings they earned by winning Game 7 of June\u2019s NBA Finals over Indiana. Though the league\u2019s old guard, led by Curry and James, remains formidable, the road to the championship trophy now runs through the uber-young Thunder, who spent the offseason signing their young core of stars to long-term deals.",
      "Haven\u2019t paid attention to the NBA since the Thunder\u2019s victory parade cruised through Oklahoma City in mid-June? Here\u2019s everything you may have missed to get you up to speed.",
      "Who are the title contenders?",
      "Recent history suggests the Thunder will not be lifting the trophy again next June: The league hasn't crowned a repeat champion in  seven seasons, with Golden State (2017-18) the last to repeat.",
      "Yet the Thunder have an extremely compelling case for being prepared to break that streak. They return every consequential member of their rotation from last season\u2019s playoff roster, including Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, the reigning most valuable player. That team won 68 games even though injuries sidelined big men Chet Holmgren and Isaiah Hartenstein for about half a season each. This year, they start healthy.",
      "By trading for Phoenix\u2019s Kevin Durant in June, Houston announced its intention to challenge Oklahoma City in the Western Conference. The Rockets remain a contender, but their case took a hit in the offseason after point guard Fred VanVleet suffered a knee injury that could sideline him the entire season.",
      "Denver, the 2023 champion, has superstar Nikola Jokic in his prime and has surrounded the virtuosic big man with the deepest roster in years.",
      "With so much uncertainty as to whether Philadelphia\u2019s star pairing of Joel Embiid and Paul George can stay healthy, and Boston superstar Jayson Tatum set to miss at least a significant chunk of the season after tearing an Achilles tendon in May, the New York Knicks and Cleveland Cavaliers enter as the East\u2019s top contenders.",
      "The Knicks have a new coach in Mike Brown, who will be tasked with finding a lineup that truly works. The Cavaliers won 64 games last season to earn the top seed in the East, but injuries contributed to their exit in just the second round of the playoffs. The team that knocked them out, the Indiana Pacers, is widely expected to take a step back after star guard Tyrese Haliburton tore his Achilles tendon during the finals.",
      "Key storylines",
      "Start in Los Angeles, where Luka Doncic is beginning his first full season with the Lakers following last season\u2019s shocking trade from Dallas. The Lakers are at a transition point in that their future will now be planned around the 26-year-old Doncic\u2019s timeline and prime years and not James, for the first time since he joined the team in 2018.",
      "The all-time scoring leader, and an NBA champion with three different franchises, James has done everything possible in his career. But his 23rd season will mark something new, too \u2014 the first time he will be playing on an expiring contract. Where that leaves James and the Lakers at the trade deadline, or offseason, remains the subject of intense speculation.",
      "In Dallas the first overall pick of June\u2019s draft, Cooper Flagg, will enter the season under high expectations. The 6-foot-9 Flagg averaged 19.2 points, 7.5 rebounds and 4.2 assists in his lone season at Duke while winning national honors for player of the year, and since entering the NBA has added a goatee and more ballhandling responsibilities, because Dallas will be without injured point guard Kyrie Irving until likely the late winter. Flagg won\u2019t turn 19 until Dec. 21.",
      "Another former No. 1 pick in Texas, Victor Wembanyama, has been cleared to play again after experiencing blood clots last season. Wembanyama, 21, enters his fourth season in San Antonio under rising expectations. The NBA\u2019s longest-tenured coach, Gregg Popovich, has moved into a front-office role, with former Spurs assistant Mitch Johnson his successor. Johnson knows Wembanyama is a one-man top-five defense, but how will the offense look as it blends Wembanyama, rookie Dylan Harper and veteran guard De\u2019Aaron Fox, once Fox returns from an injury?",
      "Injuries in Boston and Indiana and injury rehabilitation in Philadelphia have put the Knicks and Cavaliers seemingly on a glide course to the playoffs in the East, but Detroit, Atlanta and Orlando, which pulled off a huge offseason trade for Memphis sharpshooter Desmond Bane, are seen as up-and-coming threats potentially ready for a breakthrough.",
      "But the biggest story in the East centers on Milwaukee, where the Bucks are desperately trying to ensure that star Giannis Antetokounmpo wants to remain with the franchise. League insiders don\u2019t consider an Antetokounmpo trade imminent, but they do consider such a move as having the type of domino effect that could reshape the league and its contenders.",
      "New rule",
      "Players that fire a \u201cheave\u201d at the end of a quarter won\u2019t see their shooting percentage penalized.",
      "A new rule this season changes how some statistics are kept. Plays that begin in the backcourt and result in a shot taken in the final three seconds of the first three quarters, from at least 36 feet away, will count as a team attempt, not an individual shot.",
      "Investigation drama",
      "In an offseason report by the podcast \u201cPablo Torre Finds Out,\u201d former employees of a green-bank startup called Aspiration claimed the company\u2019s lucrative but previously undisclosed endorsement deal with Los Angeles Clippers star Kawhi Leonard was brokered as a means for the team to compensate Leonard while circumventing the league\u2019s salary cap \u2014 one of the NBA\u2019s most fiercely protected rules.",
      "The NBA has hired a law firm to investigation the claims, which if proven could result in a suspension of team owner Steve Ballmer, a team fine and even the voiding of Leonard\u2019s contract. The additional layer to the drama is that the NBA\u2019s All-Star game will be hosted as Ballmer\u2019s year-old arena, Intuit Dome, in February.",

      "Diane von Furstenberg is reacting to her husband, Barry Diller, sharing in his recent memoir that he had always been attracted to men before he met her.",
      "The 83-year-old Hollywood mogul, who has been married to von Furstenberg since 2001, released a memoir titled \u201cWho Knew\u201d in March in which he opened up about his sexuality. He wrote in the book, \u201cYes, I also liked guys, but that was not a conflict with my love for Diane.\u201d",
      "During a new interview with Variety, von Furstenberg, 78, responded to her husband\u2019s comments and discussed their marriage.",
      "When the reporter asked how she supported her husband after he publicly addressed his sexuality, she pushed back.",
      "\u201cSupporting him? What do you mean, supporting him?\u201d she replied in the interview published Oct. 16. \u201cPeople see it that way. For me, it\u2019s not that way. I don\u2019t know. Yes, I encouraged him to do that book, and yes, I encouraged him to do the Audible.\u201d",
      "She continued, \u201cBut for me, the book is not about that. It\u2019s about his life. And of course, with me, he opened immediately. For 50 years, I was the only person he opened to. Then he wrote the book.\u201d",
      "Von Furstenberg then seemed baffled after she was asked about being married to a gay man.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s the difference? I don\u2019t understand,\u201d she said.",
      "She further explained, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t change anything. I\u2019m sorry \u2014 it\u2019s a stupid question. I married two gay men, OK? I don\u2019t know why, but to me, they\u2019re not gay, so it doesn\u2019t make any difference.\u201d",
      "Before she tied the knot with Diller, von Furstenberg was previously married to Prince Egon von F\u00fcrstenberg, who died in 2004. The two officially divorced in 1983 after marrying in 1969.",
      "When asked about the start of her relationship with Diller, the Belgian fashion icon said their romance was unexpected. \u201cHe turned out to be my soulmate. I didn\u2019t think of it at first. He was a man about town,\u201d she recalled. Von Furstenberg said the two met at a party she threw for the late talent manager Sue Mengers.",
      "\u201cI never thought it would be anything else. Then it turned to passion. He was very insistent,\u201d the wrap dress creator shared.",
      "She said he called her the following day and the two had dinner. He later invited her to meet him in Los Angeles and picked her up in a limousine.",
      "Diller also reflected on their relationship in an excerpt from his book published by New York Magazine on May 6. He echoed the sentiment that his wife was initially dismissive of him before they met at the dinner party. \u201cI was instantly bathed in such attention and cozy warmth I couldn\u2019t believe it was the same woman I\u2019d been dismissed by a year earlier,\u201d he said.",
      "Diller added that they later had dinner at her apartment and \u201cafterward, on the same sofa as the night before, we wound around each other, making out like teenagers, something I hadn\u2019t done with a female since I was 16 years old.\u201d",
      "He recalled feeling pure excitement and was confused about what it meant.",
      "They went on to date for a few years before splitting in 1981. They reconciled after von Furstenberg had an affair with Richard Gere, Diller revealed in the memoir.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve lived for decades reading about Diane and me: about us being best friends rather than lovers,\u201d Diller said in his book. \u201cWe weren\u2019t just friends. We aren\u2019t just friends. Plain and simple, it was an explosion of passion that kept up for years. And, yes, I also liked guys, but that was not a conflict with my love for Diane.\u201d",
      "A couple weeks after the excerpt was released, Diller shared more details about the book during a CNBC interview that aired on TODAY on May 20.",
      "He rejected the notion that he had been in the closet for decades.",
      "\u201cAll this closet stuff, I mean, if I have been in a closet, it has been the most brightly lit closet with a glass door that you have ever seen,\u201d Diller said at the time. \u201cI understand, kind of, the catnip of media \u2014 but all this stuff about my sexuality at my frigging age just seems to me, well, it\u2019s kind of obvious and over the top.\u201d"

      "With Splain\u2019s guidance, actors could immerse themselves in law enforcement procedures through ride-alongs and in-depth training sessions.",
      "\u201cOn 'Mare,' we did some ride-arounds with cops where Kate and Evan Peters would go in the car with the cops and drive around the streets. Then on 'Task,' we did a number of training sessions where Dave would take them into empty houses and say, \u2018Listen, if there was a suspect inside, this is how you would hit the house. This is how you would split apart. This is who would cover this side. And this is how you would open a door.\u2019\u201d",

      "As part of the inaugural celebration, fans on the plaza Monday were given the opportunity to pose questions to some of the anchors: Savannah Guthrie, Craig Melvin, Sheinelle Jones, Carson Daly and Dylan Dreyer. And who better to moderate than Bravo host Andy Cohen?",
      "Here\u2019s what the TODAY anchors had been asked \u2014 and how they answered.",
      "For Savannah: Have Any Guests Made Her Starstruck?",
      "\u201cA lot of times I get very giddy like a schoolgirl,\u201d Savannah told two fans on the plaza from Rhode Island. There was one memorable star in particular, though.",
      "\u201cWhen Harrison Ford was on, I literally feel like the whole interview was me trying to flirt with him,\u201d she joked. \u201cHe was Han Solo! He is such a babe, and I just love him so much.\u201d",

      "For Craig: If Not on TODAY, What Other Career Path Would He Follow?",
      "Next up, a fan from Indianapolis wondered what other job Craig could see himself doing if he wasn\u2019t a TODAY anchor. His answer was illuminating \u2014 literally.",
      "\u201cProbably candle making,\u201d he revealed, much to the surprise of Cohen and the other anchors. \u201cI have found so much peace and solace over the last few years and, like, being in my garage pouring candles.\u201d",
      "\u201cI will say, I was not expecting that,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cYou never know what\u2019s going to happen at TODAY Fan Fest!\u201d",
      "For Carson: What Happens Off-Camera During Commercial Breaks?",
      "A New Jersey fan asked Carson about what goes on behind the scenes when the TODAY cameras cut away to a commercial break.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of FaceTiming kids,\u201d Carson revealed. \u201cThen there immediately is an argument about the studio temperature.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you could hang beef in Studio 1A, you would. Like a freezer,\u201d Carson said of Craig\u2019s well-known preference for keeping studio temps on the frigid side, even though Savannah prefers it warmer, thus the morning battles.",

      "Savannah replied by saying Craig, Al and Carson are the true fashionistas of the show, and she, like most people, stands in front of her closet in the mornings wondering what to wear.",
      "She also revealed that she buys all her own clothes and repeats outfits as necessary. And even though it appears as though she and Craig coordinate their on-air outfits ahead of time, they don\u2019t. If they match, it\u2019s a coincidence.",
      "\u201cSometimes it just works out,\u201d said Savannah.",
      "For the Group: What Is It Like Traveling Together?",
      "If you\u2019ve ever been curious what the TODAY family is like while traveling, a Connecticut fan asked about the team\u2019s respective travel personalities.",
      "\u201cJenna organizes everything and has a really fun itinerary laid out,\u201d answered Savannah, who continued by saying, \u201cI like to get to the airport early.\u201d",
      "According to Craig, Sheinelle is the one most likely to arrive late and Al dresses up, preferring to wear a sport coat to the airport. Carson said that he is the one most likely to be in the airport lounge with a bloody mary in his hand ahead of a flight.",
      "For the Group: What\u2019s An On-Air Blooper They\u2019ll Never Forget?",

      "\u201cI said \u2018Leonardo Di-Crap-io.\u2019 And to this day, when I see Leonardo\u2019s name in the prompter, my heartbeat starts to go,\u201d Carson said.",
      "For Sheinelle: What Piece of Advice Did She Receive That She Still Keeps Today?",
      "During the 3rd Hour of TODAY, a fan asked Sheinelle about the best career advice she\u2019s ever received and still refers to today.",
      "Sheinelle said someone gave words of wisdom while she was interning during her sophomore year in college: \u201cAsk for what you want, take what you get, and use what you get to get what you want.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd it\u2019s true,\u201d Sheinelle added. \u201cSometimes you take jobs you don\u2019t necessarily want, but you just use it to get where you want and you just keep on climbing, my friend.\u201d",
      "According to Dylan, her best advice came when she first arrived at TODAY.",
      "\u201cThey said, \u2018You\u2019re not Al Roker, so don\u2019t try to be Al Roker,\u201d she said with a laugh. \u201cBut the moral of the story is to be yourself. We already have an Al, we need a Dylan. Be yourself.\u201d",

      "The jeweler who designed Taylor Swift\u2019s engagement ring is spilling the tea about the reaction to the bauble and how her own life has changed.",
      "Swift and Kelce announced their engagement in a joint Instagram post on Aug. 26 that featured a series of photos, including a close-up of Swift\u2019s ring. The piece is an old mine brilliant cushion cut diamond set in a ring designed by Kindred Lubeck.",
      "Kelce designed the ring with Lubeck, who is the founder of Artifex Fine Jewelry.",
      "\u201cShe does all of her gold engraving by hand, and I just thought her stuff was so cool,\u201d Swift said in an interview with British radio show \u201cHeart Breakfast.\u201d",
      "\u201cSo I\u2019d shown him a video a year and a half ago, and he was just paying attention to everything, it turns out. When I saw the ring, I was like (gasps), \u2018I know who made that. I know who made that. I know who made that. And also, he listened to me!\u2019 He did amazing. It was like, you really know me. I didn\u2019t know what I would want, but he did somehow, and that\u2019s kind of a flex.\u201d",
      "Lubeck said getting called out by the \u201cFate of Ophelia\u201d hitmaker was a complete game changer.",
      "\u201cThe fact that she recognized my work, that is such an incredible honor,\u201d Lubeck said Oct. 17 on TODAY. \u201cShe said, \u2018I know who made that.\u2019 When I heard that, that was the most exciting thing.\u201d",
      "Lubeck, who now has a massive social media following, is still reveling in all the attention Swift has heaped on her.",
      "\u201cThis is something I think you only dream of happening to you, so it\u2019s incredibly surreal. Like, I have a \u2018pinch me\u2019 moment everyday. But, also, it\u2019s such an honor. I feel so, so honored,\u201d she said on TODAY.",
      "Jewelry is somewhat of a new career path for Lubeck, 30, who is originally from Jacksonville, Florida and graduated Florida State University with a degree in psychology. The daughter of a jeweler, Lubeck started making her own designs in 2019 at the age of 25, she shared in an Instagram reel.",
      "\u201cIt was the most natural thing in the world,\u201d Lubeck said about following in her father\u2019s footsteps on TODAY.",
      "Lubeck said her signature style, which involves hand-engraving gold, began when she took an engraving class in 2021 and became \u201ctotally hooked.\u201d She would stay after hours and come in weekends at her father\u2019s jewelry store honing her craft.",
      "\u201cI was just obsessed with it,\u201d she said.",

      "Old mine cuts are antique diamonds from a period when they were hand-cut and polished. Jeweler Hannah Florman previously told TODAY.com old mine diamonds \u201csend a signal that the wearer values individuality over mass-produced perfection.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis ring honors craftsmanship and subtle beauty that\u2019s not about trends,\u201d she said.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s proposed summit with Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin in Budapest appears farther off than initially hoped, with talks toward planning such a sit-down now \u201con hold,\u201d a senior White House official told NBC News.",
      "After Trump was briefed on what the senior official described as a \u201cproductive\u201d call between Secretary of State Marco Rubio and his Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Monday, the president essentially pressed pause \u2014 believing that both sides in the Russia-Ukraine conflict were not ready to seriously talk peace, the official said.",
      "\u201cSecretary Rubio and Foreign Minister Lavrov had a productive call,\" a second White House official said. \"Therefore, an additional-in-person meeting between the Secretary and Foreign Minister is not necessary, and there are no plans for President Trump to meet with President Putin in the immediate future.\u201d",
      "Another phone call between Rubio and Lavrov is expected as soon as this week, a source familiar with the discussions told NBC News. The source did not rule out a future meeting, although no meeting is currently planned. The top U.S. and Russian diplomats are both expected to attend the Association of Southeast Asian Nations this weekend.",
      "Earlier, the Kremlin denied it was holding up Trump\u2019s latest push to end the war in Ukraine, and insisted it had not changed its demands ahead of possible talks.",
      "The president had announced that Russia and the United States\u2019 top diplomats would meet this week, with his own summit with Putin to follow in Hungary's capital Budapest. Russian officials have now said there was no date set for either meeting.",
      "\u201cWe cannot postpone what has not been agreed upon,\u201d Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told Russia's TASS state news agency early Tuesday.",
      "He was responding to a CNN report that the meeting between  Rubio and Lavrov had been put on hold indefinitely. Ryabkov said there had been no clear agreement on when or where such a meeting might take place.",
      "\"Everything is in progress, internal work is ongoing. As new information becomes available, we will keep you informed,\" he told state media journalists.",

      "\u201cYou can\u2019t postpone something that hasn\u2019t been agreed upon,\u201d Peskov said in his daily briefing. \u201cYou heard statements from both the American side and our side that this may take time. Therefore, no precise timeframe was initially set,\u201d he said.",
      "On Tuesday, Lavrov confirmed that he and Rubio had spoken and discussed how to prepare a \"framework for the next meeting\" between Putin and Russia.",
      "\u201cThe key point is not the venue or timing, but how we will proceed substantively on the tasks that were agreed upon and on which broad understanding was reached in Anchorage,\u201d he said, referring to Trump and Putin's meeting in Alaska in August.",
      "The two agreed to continue the telephone contacts on how to \"move forward in the right direction,\" he added.",
      "Lavrov said that the country\u2019s position remains consistent with understandings reached between Putin and Trump during the Anchorage talks.",
      "\u201cThose understandings are based on the agreement achieved at that time, which President Trump very succinctly formulated when he said that what is needed is a long-term, sustainable peace, not an immediate ceasefire that would lead nowhere,\u201d he said.",
      "On Sunday, after both a call last week with Putin and then a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Washington, Trump said he supported the immediate halt to fighting as called for by Kyiv and its European allies.",
      "For now, both sides should \u201cstop at the battle line \u2014 go home, stop fighting, stop killing people,\u201d he told reporters on board Air Force One. \u201cThey can negotiate something later on down the line,\u201d he said.",
      "Leaders of European nations, including Britain, France, Germany, Ukraine, and the European Union issued a joint statement Tuesday supporting Trump's efforts to end the fighting, and suggesting that Russia appeared unwilling to pursue a peace agreement at this stage.",
      "\u201cWe strongly support President Trump\u2019s position that the fighting should stop immediately, and that the current line of contact should be the starting point of negotiations,\u201d said the statement, published by the British government.",
      "\u201cWe must ramp up the pressure on Russia\u2019s economy and its defense industry, until Putin is ready to make peace,\u201d it said.",
      "In an interview with NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press\u201d taped Friday, Zelenskyy urged Trump to get tougher with Putin and said he was ready to join their summit in Budapest.",

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 Prince Andrew may have given up his titles, but the questions about his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein haven\u2019t given up on him \u2014 or Britain\u2019s embattled royal family.",
      "Seemingly every day, damaging new reports emerge about Andrew, 65, his friendship with the late pedophile financier, and allegations the prince had sex with trafficked Epstein victim Virginia Roberts Giuffre when she was 17, which he denies.",
      "In her posthumous memoir \u201cNobody\u2019s Girl\u201d released Tuesday, Giuffre, who died by suicide in April at age 41, said Andrew acted as though having sex with her \u201cwas his birthright.\u201d",
      "Andrew, who in February 2022 reached a legal settlement with Giuffre after she filed a civil case against him in a New York court, has repeatedly denied having met her.",
      "But the rolling scandal refuses to go away, and has the potential to inflict further damage on a monarchy whose popularity continues to dwindle after the death of the widely beloved Queen Elizabeth II in 2022.",
      "King Charles III has sought to insulate \u201cthe Firm\u201d from the cloud over his younger brother. Andrew said in a statement last week that with Charles\u2019 \u201cagreement,\u201d he would \"no longer use my title or the honours which have been conferred upon me,\u201d including  Duke of York.",
      "But there are still unanswered questions about what the palace knew, and when, with calls from lawmakers and others for the royals to oust Andrew entirely.",
      "\u201cThe deep and wide support for the queen meant the family was able to better weather all the controversies that could emerge \u2014 and this is a bad one,\u201d said Craig Prescott, who teaches law at Royal Holloway, University of London and specializes on the constitutional and political role of the monarchy.",
      "\u201cThese specific allegations are, of course, extraordinarily damaging in the first place, but they also run counter to some of the causes that members of the royal family take up,\u201d he said.",
      "Friday's agreement for Andrew to relinquish his titles came after emails published in documents for a court case not involving the prince showed he had been in contact with Epstein for longer than he previously admitted.",
      "That \u201cmakes him look, in black and white, a liar,\u201d NBC News' royal contributor Daisy McAndrew told \u201cTODAY\u201d on Sunday. \u201cAnd so how can you trust anything else he says?\u201d",
      "Then Sunday, London\u2019s Metropolitan Police said it was investigating reports that Andrew had asked one of its officers to dig up dirt on Giuffre. A Buckingham Palace official told NBC News these reports should be \u201cexamined in the appropriate way.\u201d",
      "Monday brought two further revelations: First that Andrew had not paid rent on his Royal Lodge residence for 20 years, revealed in a Freedom of Information request by The Times newspaper to the Crown Estate, which handles royal finances. Neither Andrew nor Buckingham Palace have responded to the report.",
      "Then came the publication of Giuffre\u2019s posthumous memoir.",
      "She wrote that she had sex with the prince on three occasions, including an \u201corgy\u201d involving \u201ceight other young girls\u201d who \u201cappeared to be under the age of 18 and didn\u2019t really speak English.\u201d",
      "She then suffered three weeks of \u201cirregular bleeding,\u201d before waking up in a \u201cpool of blood\u201d and being taken to hospital by Epstein, she wrote.",
      "Epstein, who died by suicide in jail in 2019 shortly after he was arrested on federal sex trafficking charges, later told her she had suffered a miscarriage, and she suspected him of conspiring with the doctor to keep it quiet, Giuffre said.",
      "On seeing a photo of Andrew and Epstein walking in New York's Central Park in 2010 \u2014 after Epstein was convicted of soliciting prostitution of someone under the age of 18 \u2014 Giuffre wrote she was  \u201crevolted to see two of my abusers together, out for a stroll.\u201d But \"mostly I was amazed that a member of the Royal Family would be stupid enough to appear in public with Epstein.\u201d",
      "Andrew has previously denied these allegations, saying that he has \u201cno recollection of ever meeting this lady, none whatsoever.\u201d In his statement announcing the relinquishment of his titles, he said, \u201cI vigorously deny the accusations against me.\u201d",
      "The civil sex abuse lawsuit brought by Giuffre against Andrew was settled out of court for an undisclosed sum.",
      "Though Buckingham Palace routinely says it does not speak for the prince, Andrew has enjoyed a prominent role at some recent royal events, including the queen's funeral.",
      "Some lawmakers are demanding that Andrew be formally stripped of his titles by an act of Parliament \u2014 a rare foray into regal matters by Britain\u2019s supposedly separate government.",
      "The last time this happened was in 1917, when Parliament used the Titles Deprivation Act to strip German members of the British royal family of their titles during World War I.",
      "That\u2019s not without risks, according to Prescott at Royal Holloway.",
      "\"If you have legislation removing the dukedom from Prince Andrew, might a cheeky MP want to table an amendment and remove the dukedom of Sussex from Prince Harry?\u201d he said.",
      "The government indicated it does not support this. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said Monday that while \u201cour thoughts have to be with the victims of Jeffrey Epstein, these \u201care matters for the royal family.\u201d",
      "The nuclear option would involve the king himself using something called \u201cLetters Patent\u201d to strip Andrew of his designation as prince.",
      "In doing so, the palace must weigh distancing itself from Andrew with ensuring the blowback from any further censure does not do even more damage to an institution that requires public buy-in.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s true that the monarchy isn\u2019t voted in,\u201d Prescott said. \u201cBut if the public mood shifted and people no longer wanted to have the monarchy, then you imagine that politics would follow.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "TOKYO \u2014 Lawmakers in Japan elected hard-line conservative Sanae Takaichi as prime minister Tuesday, making her the first woman in modern times to lead the key U.S. ally.",
      "Takaichi, 64, the new leader of the governing Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), was elected by lawmakers in the lower house of parliament by a vote of 237-149 over her closest rival, Yoshihiko Noda, leader of the liberal opposition Constitutional Democratic Party. She was also elected by upper house lawmakers in a second vote of 125-46 after falling one vote shy of a majority in the first round.",
      "Though her election is a milestone in a country where women are severely underrepresented in government, Takaichi enters office with a fragile coalition and facing a number of pressing challenges, including a visit next week by President Donald Trump.",
      "Takaichi, who says her hero is former British conservative leader Margaret Thatcher, has appointed two other women to her Cabinet, the same as the previous government. They include Satsuki Katayama, Japan\u2019s first female finance minister.",
      "\u201cI place great importance on equal opportunity, equal chances. And also participation from people from all walks of life,\u201d Takaichi told a news conference Tuesday. \u201cI formed my cabinet with this idea in mind, bringing together the combined strength of all generations.\u201d",
      "But Takaichi\u2019s victory is not necessarily a victory for women in general, critics say, especially after she secured it by forming an alliance with an Osaka-based party that will pull her coalition even further to the right.",
      "\u201cOne would like to say this is a historic moment in Japan,\u201d Jeff Kingston, a professor of Asian studies and history at Temple University\u2019s Japan campus, told NBC News. \u201cBut it\u2019s really hard to make that case, given her rather poor track record on empowering women.\u201d",
      "Takaichi opposes same-sex marriage and favors keeping succession to men only in Japan\u2019s shrinking imperial family. She also opposes changing the rules to make it easier for married women to keep their maiden names in Japan, where married couples are required to have the same surname.",
      "Progress toward gender equality has been slow in Japan, where women are far outnumbered at the highest levels of business and government and bear a disproportionate responsibility for child care and household chores.",
      "Japan, the world\u2019s fourth-largest economy, ranked 118th out of 148 countries in the World Economic Forum\u2019s 2025 Global Gender Gap Report. It noted that women make up less than 16% of Japanese lawmakers in the lower house of parliament and 10% of government ministers.",
      "After Takaichi was elected leader of the LDP earlier this month, Japanese feminist author Chizuko Ueno said that the prospect of Japan getting its first female prime minister \u201cdoesn\u2019t make me happy.\u201d",
      "Takaichi \u201csees herself as the Japanese version of Thatcher,\u201d Ueno, 77, said in a post on X. \u201cBritish feminists, who inherited Thatcher, have no illusions about women in leadership positions.\u201d",
      "She noted Takaichi\u2019s opposition to allowing separate surnames for married couples even as she has kept her own maiden name. Though Takaichi changed her legal name in 2004 when she first married Taku Yamamoto, she continued to use her maiden name professionally until they divorced in 2017, in line with legislation she had proposed.",
      "When they remarried in 2021, Yamamoto, a former LDP lawmaker, changed his legal surname to Takaichi.",
      "Takaichi \u2014 who in her youth rode motorcycles and played the drums in a heavy metal band \u2014 has pushed for greater support for women\u2019s health. She has talked about her personal struggles with symptoms of menopause and the importance of raising awareness \u201cso that men can properly understand when women are struggling, whether at school or in the workplace.\u201d",
      "But her campaign was focused mainly on the economy and national defense.",
      "Takaichi is a veteran politician who has served as minister of economic security, internal affairs and gender equality. A protege of assassinated former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, she advocates tougher immigration policies, the revision of Japan\u2019s pacifist constitution and higher defense spending.",
      "Japan\u2019s Nikkei stock exchange closed at an all-time high for the second day in a row Tuesday, on hopes that Takaichi\u2019s policies might help jumpstart the economy.",
      "Earlier this month Takaichi was elected leader of the LDP, which has governed Japan almost uninterrupted since World War II, after running unsuccessfully in 2021 and 2024. In her victory speech, she underlined her commitment to the job.",
      "\u201cI myself will throw out the term \u2018work-life balance,\u2019\u201d Takaichi said. \u201cI will work and work and work and work and work.\u201d",
      "Her ascension to prime minister was thrown into doubt, however, after a crucial partner, the centrist party Komeito, left the LDP coalition.",
      "To ensure her victory, the LDP signed a deal Monday with the Japan Innovation Party, or Ishin, a far-right party based in Osaka.",
      "Even with the alliance, Takaichi faces an uphill battle in parliament, where she falls short of a majority in both houses after the LDP suffered major losses in recent elections amid voter anger over party corruption scandals and the rising cost of living. Her premiership could thus end up being short-lived \u2014 much like that of her predecessor, Shigeru Ishiba, who was in office for a year.",
      "\u201cShe emerges from this a diminished leader from the get-go,\u201d Kingston said.",
      "Takaichi also faces an early test next week with the arrival of Trump, who is making his first trip to Asia since returning to office. He is expected to visit Malaysia and Japan before continuing on to South Korea, which is hosting a major summit of Asia-Pacific economies.",
      "\u201cI will deepen the relationship of trust between us leaders through frank exchanges of views not only on bilateral issues but also on the challenges facing Japan and the United States, ranging from issues in the Indo-Pacific region to the situation in the Middle East, Europe, and Ukraine,\u201d Takaichi said at the news conference.",
      "But Kingston cautioned that she \u201cdoesn\u2019t have a whole lot of time to get ready for a slew of diplomatic activity,\u201d adding he thought \u201cjob one is the Japanese economy.\u201d",

      "In the space of just seven minutes in the casual daylight of Sunday morning, four suspects stole nine pieces of France\u2019s crown jewels from the Louvre. They robbed not just the most visited museum in the world, but also the French people themselves, the government said Monday.",
      "Officials are now scrambling to reassure the public about security at key cultural sites \u2014 and find the jewels stolen from the museum before they can be broken up and melted down.",
      "The thieves used a monte-meubles \u2014 a truck mounted with a basket lift, commonly used to hoist furniture into Paris' inaccessible apartment blocks.",
      "They parked it outside the sprawling renaissance palace, rode to the balcony outside the Galerie d\u2019Apollon, and sliced through the window with cutting tools, according to officials.",
      "Their daring heist pierced the nation\u2019s self-image, too.",
      "Threatening museum staff with their angle-grinders, the otherwise unarmed thieves then smashed through two display cases, taking necklaces, tiaras and brooches from France\u2019s now dispatched royal families, officials said.",
      "This all played out just after the museum had opened, with bystanders able to video one suspect in a high-visibility vest standing at one of the glass boxes housing historical treasures.",
      "Investigators say they are puzzled why the culprits left behind the colossal, 140-carat Regent diamond, which has been valued at $60 million. Had they wandered down that opulent corridor, they would have reached the Mona Lisa \u2014 itself infamously stolen more than a century ago.",
      "As it was, they made off on two scooters, but not before they dropped two items, including the Crown of Empress Eug\u00e9nie, empress to Napoleon III in the 19th century, which was found broken near the scene, officials said.",
      "That item alone is \"worth several tens of millions of euros,\" Alexandre Giquello, president of France's leading Drouot auction house, told the Reuters news agency. \"And it's not, in my opinion, the most important item\" taken by the burglars.",
      "Some experts have said that because the items are unique they cannot be sold, and so the thieves will likely try to melt down their metals and break up their emeralds, sapphires, diamonds and pearls. That means investigators might have less than a week before the jewels are lost forever.",
      "The incident saw the Louvre shuttered Sunday and again Monday morning, with bewildered crowds evacuated from the area just after the assailants had struck.",
      "For a nation whose character is defined by proud displays of history and culture, the incident is being seen in some quarters as a national humiliation.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron called it \u201can attack on a heritage that we cherish because it is our history.\u201d He vowed to \u201crecover the works and the perpetrators will be brought to justice,\u201d adding that \u201ceverything is being done, everywhere, to achieve this.\u201d",
      "The Culture and Interior ministries held an emergency meeting Monday and agreed to ask senior officials across France \u201cto immediately assess the existing security measures already in place around cultural institutions, and to strengthen them if necessary,\u201d the Interior Ministry said, according to Reuters.",
      "Justice Minister Gerard Darmanin said the heist gave a \u201cnegative\u201d and \u201cdeplorable\u201d image of France. \u201cWhat is certain is that we failed,\u201d he told the radio station France Inter. \u201cThe French people all feel like they\u2019ve been robbed.\u201d",
      "One of Macron\u2019s main political opponents, Jordan Bardella, the far-right leader who is favorite to replace him at the next presidential election in 2027, cast the crime as another example of \u201cthe disintegration of the state\u201d under Macron, and \u201can unbearable humiliation for our country.\u201d",
      "It is not the first time the Louvre has been targeted by thieves.",
      "In 1911, a museum decorator named Vincenzo Peruggia stole the Mona Lisa. And more recently French museums have been hit with a spate of thefts, including raw gold stolen from the National Museum of Natural History and porcelain works reportedly worth around $11 million taken from the Adrien Dubouche Museum in Limoges last month.",
      "After the theft at the Louvre, the union SUD Culture blamed \"destruction of jobs dedicated to security\" and funding shortfalls for security equipment.",
      "That hints at the wider disquiet percolating in France.",
      "Macron has seen multiple governments collapse as he tries to staunch the rise of Bardella\u2019s National Rally. Meanwhile hundreds of thousands of people have taken to the streets in protest at public spending cuts.",
      "Now, authorities have another crisis at their door.",
      "Paris Prosecutor Laure Beccuau said on BFM TV that if the heist was commissioned by a collector, then there is a chance of getting the items back in their original condition.",
      "However, if not, the leading Dutch art detective Arthur Brand told Sky News that the police \"have a week\" before the jewels vanish forever.",
      "\"These crown jewels are so famous, you just cannot sell them,\" he said. \"The only thing they can do is melt the silver and gold down, dismantle the diamonds, try to cut them. That's the way they will probably disappear forever.\"",
      "\"It's a race against time.\"",
      "Molly Hunter and Mo Abbas reported from Paris and Alexander Smith from London."

      "The palace did not comment on the reported email, which the newspapers say told Epstein \u201cwe are in this together\u201d and concluded \u201cplay some more soon.\u201d",
      "The email was especially damaging because it appeared to contradict his previous comments in a 2019 interview with the BBC, in which he said he had stopped communicating with Epstein after visiting him in New York in 2010, the year before.",
      "\u201cThat was the real last nail in the coffin for Andrew because it makes him look, in black and white, like a liar,\u201d said NBC News royal commentator Daisy McAndrew.",

      "LONDON \u2014 It's safe to say they're making their presence felt.",
      "Japan's top sumo wrestlers were wandering the streets of London earlier this week ahead of the sold-out Grand Sumo Tournament currently taking place at the Royal Albert Hall, the British capital's famous Victorian concert venue.",
      "Dressed in traditional Japanese clothing, the wrestlers known as rikishi, have been exploring the city in between rigorous training for what is just the second event of this type to be held outside Japan in 1,500 years.",
      "This time, the spotlight is on two highest-ranked wrestlers, known as yokozuna \u2014 Mongolian Hoshoryu Tomokatsu and Japan\u2019s Onosato Daiki. Onosato, 25, became the 75th fighter to earn that title in May, having risen to the rank in a record 13 tournaments.",
      "His rival, Hoshoryu, was the 74th man to attain the rank.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m happy that sumo is back after so many years,\u201d Onosato told Sky News, NBC News\u2019 broadcasting partner, on Wednesday. \u201cI hope I can show the U.K. fans how fantastic sumo is.\u201d",
      "\u201cBeing a yokozuna has a lot of responsibility,\u201d Hoshoryu said. \u201cMy uncle was a yokozuna \u2014 and I\u2019m happy to follow in his footsteps. But I came here to London as a yokozuna which he didn\u2019t, so I\u2019m even happier,\u201d he added.",
      "Stopping to pose for pictures with traditional souvenirs, the pair were among a group of sumo wrestlers who visited most of London's touristic landmarks, including Buckingham Palace and Westminster with its iconic Big Ben.",
      "But that didn't stop them from their rigorous training routine and their equally rigorous eating regime.",
      "Their carefully structured, high-calorie meals are vital for building the size and strength needed to compete at the highest level.",
      "\u201cWe are going through 70 kilos of rice a day,\u201d Donagh Collins, the CEO of Askonas Holt, an arts company which helped to organize the event, told Sky News. \u201cSomebody told me that the wholesaler for the noodles has run out of noodles,\u201d he added.",
      "But in a break from their traditional diet, some of the wrestlers were pictured enjoying London's street food and feeding each other hot dogs as they explored the city.",
      "While the tournament in London was completely sold out, back home Sumo has faced a series of scandals, including allegations of bullying, assault and sexism at stables where the wrestlers train. Allegations of illegal betting and links to organized crime have also cast a shadow over the image of Japan's national sport.",
      "But in London, Wednesday saw the first day of the five-day exhibition tournament \u2014 the first of its kind since one was hosted at the same venue some 34 years ago.",
      "The wrestlers, who weigh a combined six tons, slapped, gripped and lifted each other, as spectators reveled at the sight of the centuries-old Japanese sport.",
      "Around eleven tons of clay were brought into the hall to build the dohyo, the raised ring where the wrestlers compete, outlined with rice bales shaped and secured using beer bottles, according to Reuters.",
      "The two grand champions, Hoshoryu and Onosato, each secured victory in their bouts, closing the evening with weighty performances \u2014 literally."

      "\u201cThere are going to be moments where it looks like things aren\u2019t going particularly well,\u201d Vance added. \u201cCan I say with 100% certainty that it's going to work? No, but you don't do difficult things by only doing what's 100% certain. You do difficult things by trying. And that's what the president of the United States has asked us to do.\u201d",
      "Vance\u2019s trip to Israel comes at a fraught moment. The Israel-Hamas ceasefire negotiated this month by President Donald Trump has been followed by both sides accusing each other of  breaching the truce, Israeli strikes and a diminished Hamas attempting to reassert its authority over the enclave.",
      "Vance accused American media of overreacting to the setbacks.",
      "\u201cI want to say that there is this weird attitude I\u2019ve sensed in the American media and the Western media, where there\u2019s almost this desire to root for failure \u2014 that every time something bad happens, and every time there\u2019s an act of violence, there\u2019s this inclination to say, \u2018Oh, this is the end of the ceasefire, this is the end of the peace plan,\u2019\u201d Vance said. \u201cIt\u2019s not the end. It is, in fact, exactly how this is going to have to happen when you have people who hate each other, who have been fighting against each other for a very long time. We are doing very well. We are in a very good place.\u201d",
      "An enduring ceasefire is key to Trump\u2019s ambitions of winning the Nobel Peace Prize, making Vance\u2019s efforts this week to ease tensions and project confidence potentially consequential to the legacy of the man he will likely run to succeed in 2028. Hovering over the news conference was a Tuesday morning Truth Social post by Trump, who wrote that Middle East allies \u201cwould welcome the opportunity, at my request, to go into GAZA with a heavy force and \u2018straighten [out] Hamas\u2019 if Hamas continues to act badly, in violation of their agreement with us.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere is still hope that Hamas will do what is right,\u201d Trump added. \u201cIf they do not, an end to Hamas will be FAST, FURIOUS, & BRUTAL!\u201d",

      "\u201cBut I\u2019m not going to do what the president of the United States has thus far refused to do, which is put an explicit deadline on it, because a lot of this stuff is difficult,\u201d Vance said. \u201cSo my point is, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s actually advisable for us to say this has to be done in a week, because a lot of this work is very hard.\u201d",
      "Vance added that he believed Middle East allies, including \u201cour Israeli friends,\u201d are showing a \u201ccertain amount of impatience with Hamas.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut we\u2019re going to keep on working at this process,\u201d Vance said, \u201cand we\u2019re going to keep on trying to bring the deceased hostages home, but also make sure that all Gazans are able to live in a prosperous and safe place.\u201d",
      "Hamas returned the bodies of two more hostages via the Red Cross on Tuesday, according to the Israel Defense Forces.",
      "\u201cTwo coffins of deceased hostages, escorted by IDF troops, crossed the border into the State of Israel a short while ago and are on their way to the National Institute for Forensic Medicine, where identification procedures will be carried out,\u201d the IDF said on X.",
      "If the bodies returned by Hamas on Tuesday are confirmed to be  hostages, then the bodies of 13 deceased hostages still remain in Gaza.",
      "Vance was joined Tuesday by Steve Witkoff, Trump\u2019s special envoy to the Middle East, and Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law. Both played key roles in negotiating the ceasefire, while Vance has been dispatched to demonstrate the administration\u2019s commitment to it.",
      "\u201cI want to echo what the vice president said about how a lot of people are getting a little hysterical about different incursions one way or the other,\u201d Kushner said. \u201cBut what we are seeing is that things are going in accordance \u2026 both sides are transitioning from two years of very intense warfare to now a peacetime posture.\u201d",

      "Since the ceasefire came into effect a week ago, the militant group has deployed armed police officers on streets from where Israeli forces have withdrawn, clashed with rival clans, directly fired upon and killed Israeli troops in multiple incidents, and staged at least one public execution of suspected collaborators.",
      "As Hamas continues to demonstrate its presence, Israeli security officials and experts on Gaza agree it has been badly diminished but not thoroughly destroyed, and will count on new recruits propelled to join after tens of thousands of Palestinian civilians were killed by Israeli fire.",
      "Assessments of Hamas\u2019 strength are crucial to the negotiations around the group\u2019s disarmament \u2014 an important stipulation in the American-brokered ceasefire deal that halted the war. So far, the group has refused to give up its weapons.",
      "\u201cHamas was damaged very severely in its military capabilities, but I think it will be fair to say that it wasn\u2019t crushed,\u201d said Shalom Ben Hanan, a fellow at the International Institute for Counter-Terrorism at Israel\u2019s Reichman University and a nearly 30-year veteran of the Israeli Security Agency, also known as Shabak or Shin Bet. \u201cMaybe the threat isn\u2019t in the days to come or the nearest future. But their potential is still there.\u201d",
      "Hanan said the group still commands about 15,000 to 25,000 fighters \u2014 an estimate he said was based on his regular briefings from serving Israeli security officials.",
      "According to an Israeli military official, who asked for anonymity to speak openly about the Israeli military\u2019s internal assessment, about 10,000 to 20,000 commandos remain at Hamas\u2019 disposal.",
      "Giora Eiland, the former director of Israel\u2019s National Security Council and the former head of the planning department of the Israel Defense Forces, said Hamas lost about 20,000 fighters during two years of war \u2014 an estimate he also bases on conversations with serving security officials.",
      "But the group will have little trouble reconstituting its manpower, Eiland said, and security officials believe Hamas has been recruiting new fighters throughout the war even under fire.",
      "\u201cIt is easy for Hamas to regain power and it is very easy for them to recruit more and more people to replace those who were killed,\u201d Eiland said.",
      "Hamas wrested power from the more secular and internationally recognized Fatah party in 2007 after winning legislative elections the previous year. The Islamist group, which the United States, Israel and many other countries classify as a terrorist group, does not recognize Israel\u2019s right to exist and launched the Oct. 7, 2023,  attacks in part to stall normalization efforts in the Arab world.",
      "Israel\u2019s ensuing offensive has flattened much of the enclave, killed tens of thousands of civilians and engendered the kind of anger that could create thousands of potential recruits.",
      "\u201cAlthough we will be speaking about young people with less military experience, they still have no doubt lots of competence and enough personal weapons like small arms and RPGs,\u201d Eiland said, referring to rocket-propelled grenades.",
      "Tens of thousands of Palestinians have been killed and maimed in the war; a United Nations commission said in September that Israel is committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. Famine was officially declared in August in part of northern Gaza, including Gaza City, by the world\u2019s leading authority on hunger. The war has also inflicted significant damage on Hamas\u2019 supplies of its heaviest weapons and its weapons manufacturing capabilities, as well as on its senior leadership.",
      "The Israeli military official said that as many as 90% of the group\u2019s rockets have been destroyed, and Israel has succeeded in frustrating Hamas\u2019 ability to rebuild that lost heavy firepower.",
      "\u201cVery important is the manufacturing sites, the smuggling routes and so on,\u201d the military official said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just taking away the fish, it\u2019s taking away the rod.\u201d",
      "All of the experts agreed that Hamas\u2019 vast tunnel system remains its greatest strength and Israel\u2019s greatest challenge.",
      "Eiland estimated that 70% to 80% of Hamas\u2019 tunnels remain intact, with much of the surviving network unknown to Israel\u2019s military.",
      "In a statement last week, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said the IDF would turn its attention to destroying the remaining tunnel network as part of the process of disarming Hamas. The IDF said it had been working to dismantle a part of the tunnel network when some of its soldiers came under fire Sunday.",
      "The group\u2019s political power and popularity \u2014 key components in its ability to recruit, rebuild its weapons and suppress its rivals \u2014 have been badly damaged. Even if Gazans are enraged at Israel for killing nearly 70,000 Palestinians during the war, Hamas still takes part of the public blame.",
      "\u201cPolitically is where Hamas is really in shambles,\u201d said Ahmed Fouad Alkhatib, head of the Atlantic Council\u2019s Realign for Palestine project, whose family is from the Gaza Strip. \u201cThey don\u2019t really have a political program. They don\u2019t really have a compelling agenda in Gaza.\u201d",
      "But unlike the Islamic State terrorist group, or ISIS, and Al Qaeda \u2014 two terror groups whose power has been checked by the U.S.-led war on terror over the past quarter-century \u2014 Hamas presides over a true geographic constituency.",
      "\u201cIt is not a terrorist organization that came from nowhere and managed to take control over a certain area by spreading fear and terror,\u201d Eiland said. \u201cHamas is the authentic representative of the people of Gaza.\u201d",
      "Outside Gaza, Hamas also takes credit for turning global opinion against Israel, Alkhatib said.",

      "As fears grew in the region that the 10-day-old ceasefire agreement could collapse, Trump\u2019s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, and Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law, landed in Israel, where they met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, according to a spokesperson for his government.",
      "The spokesperson added that Vice President JD Vance and his wife, second lady Usha Vance, were also expected to make a trip to Israel.",
      "Hamas' failure to return all of the bodies of deceased hostages held in Gaza had already put a strain on talks to advance to a second stage of the deal.",
      "Hamas returned the body of one more hostage via the Red Cross on Monday, according to the IDF.",
      "\"The coffin of the deceased hostage, escorted by IDF troops, crossed the border into the State of Israel a short while ago and is on its way to the National Institute for Forensic Medicine, where identification procedures will be carried out,\" the IDF said on X.",
      "If the body returned by Hamas on Monday is confirmed to be one of the hostages, then the bodies of 15 deceased hostages still remain in Gaza.",
      "The difficulty of locating remains of deceased hostages amid the rubble of Gaza had been raised by both Hamas and the International Committee of the Red Cross, which has helped facilitate the release of hostages held in Gaza in exchange for Palestinian prisoners and detainees held by Israel.",
      "Israeli barriers to more aid entering Gaza, another key tenet of the agreement, have also been a point of contention. An Israeli security official said Monday that aid would enter the famine-stricken territory through the Kerem Shalom crossing, while the Rafah crossing remained closed.",
      "But after days of mounting tensions, Sunday's strikes posed a sudden and significant threat to the deal.",
      "A spokesperson for the Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza told NBC News on Sunday that at least 23 people had been killed in Israeli attacks that day.",
      "Hamas denied any involvement in the incident in Rafah and emphasized its commitment to the truce, while a senior official accused Israel of working to \u201cfabricate flimsy pretexts\u201d for its own assault.",
      "Hamas' government media office accused Israel of committing \"80 violations\" of the ceasefire since it began, which it said had killed dozens of people and wounded hundreds in just over a week."

    "story": [
      "A large chunk of suspected space debris has been found in a remote part of the Australian desert, the country\u2019s space agency confirmed Monday.",
      "The charred and smoldering object was found in the Pilbara region of Western Australia, according to the Australian Space Agency. It\u2019s not yet clear what the object is or where it came from, but officials said it\u2019s probably a spent rocket part.",
      "\u201cThe debris is likely a propellant tank or pressure vessel from a space launch vehicle,\u201d the Australian Space Agency wrote in a post on X.",
      "The agency did not provide details about the object\u2019s size or weight, but wrote that it is working with local authorities and other space agencies to investigate and determine \u201cthe exact nature of the debris and its origin.\u201d",
      "The agency did not immediately respond to NBC News' request for further information.",
      "The object was discovered Saturday on a remote access road by workers from a nearby mine, according to a report from Sky News, which said that local authorities did not think the debris posed any threat to public safety. NBC News has not independently confirmed these details. (Sky News is a division of Comcast, the parent company of NBC News.)",
      "Government space agencies and private space companies often let depleted or defunct rocket parts and satellites burn up in the atmosphere as a way to destroy them. Sometimes, however, pieces can survive the fiery process of atmospheric re-entry. Still, it\u2019s relatively rare for space debris to fall over land, given that the planet is mostly covered by oceans \u2014 and even more rare for pieces to fall over densely populated areas.",

      "People with a leading cause of blindness were able to read again thanks to a tiny wireless chip implanted in the back of the eye and specialized augmented glasses, according to study results published Monday in the New England Journal of Medicine.",
      "The trial involved 38 European patients, all of whom had an advanced stage of dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) known as geographic atrophy.",
      "There is no cure for AMD, which is driven by changes in a part of the retina called the macula and caused by inflammation and a build-up of waste. The photoreceptor cells in the macula are responsible for producing sharp, detailed and colored vision. When the disease has progressed to the geographic atrophy stage, the cells deteriorate and die, and people lose their central vision \u2014 meaning an object straight ahead may appear blurry or covered up with a dark blotch.",
      "Roughly 22 million people in the United States have AMD, and about 1 million have geographic atrophy, according to the American Macular Degeneration Foundation.",
      "In the study, the participants, who had an average age of 79, were fitted with the \u201cPRIMA device,\u201d a system meant to replicate vision. Patients wear augmented reality glasses embedded with a camera that captures their visual field. What the camera \u201csees\u201d is transmitted to the chip implanted in the eye in the form of infrared light. The chip converts the light into an electrical current, which stimulates the remaining healthy cells in the macula in a realistic way, enabling the brain to interpret signals the cells send as vision.",
      "An image processor, which users must carry, lets patients zoom in and magnify the images they see, which appear in black and white.",
      "With the help of the PRIMA device, 80% of the 32 patients who returned for reassessments one year after the chip implantation had achieved clinically meaningful visual improvements. Patients did experience side effects, predominantly related to the surgical procedure: The study reported that 26 serious adverse events occurred in 19 of the patients, ranging from elevated blood pressure in the eye to an accumulation of blood around the retina. The majority of the adverse events resolved within two months of the implantation.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the first ever therapeutic approach that has led to an improvement in visual function in this group of patients,\u201d said Dr. Frank Holz, the trial\u2019s lead investigator and chair of the department of ophthalmology at the University Hospital of Bonn in Germany. \u201cLate-stage age-related macular degeneration is a dismal disease. Patients are no longer capable of reading, driving a car, watching TV or even recognizing faces. So [these results] are a game changer in my mind.\u201d",
      "One patient, Sheila Irvine, 70, who was fitted with the PRIMA device at Moorfields Eye Hospital in London, said in a statement provided by the hospital that her life before she received the implant was akin to \u201chaving two black discs in my eyes, with the outside distorted.\u201d A self-described \u201cavid bookworm\u201d before she lost her vision, Irvine said she was now able to do crosswords and read prescriptions.",
      "Dr. Sunir Garg, professor of ophthalmology at the retina service of Wills Eye Hospital in Philadelphia, who was not involved in the study, said the results are a breakthrough for patients with geographic atrophy. All doctors have been able to offer, he said, are visual aids, like magnifiers, and emotional support.",
      "\u201cEven with new medical therapies, the best that we can do is slow it down,\u201d said Garg, who works with several drugmakers involved in treatments for AMD, including Apellis Pharmaceuticals, the maker of pegcetacoplan. The drug, which slows the progression of geographic atrophy, was recently approved in the United States and must be injected into the eye every one to two months. \u201cWe can\u2019t stop it, and we can\u2019t do anything to bring back lost vision.\u201d",
      "Dr. Demetrios Vavvas, director of the retina service at Mass Eye and Ear in Boston, who was also not involved in the study, said the PRIMA system is not without limitations.",
      "Vavvas noted that the surgery required to implant the chip in the eye requires a high level of surgical skill and is not without risk. \u201cYou have to lift the retina off its normal position to implant this device, which increases the atrophy,\u201d said Vavvas, who is a consultant to Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals, a company working on stem cell therapies for patients with other forms of vision loss.",
      "Vavvas said it was important to note that the device is not restoring normal vision, as patients were able to see only in black and white rather than color, and that the trial participants had to undergo a significant amount of training to learn how to see with the device. He also said it was not clear whether the enhancements in visual ability had significantly improved the patients\u2019 quality of life.",
      "But at the same time, Vavvas was also optimistic about its potential, describing the current iteration of PRIMA as a key steppingstone in the field of vision restoration.",
      "\u201cThink of this device as the pre-release iPhone,\u201d he said. \u201cThe limitations are clear. We shouldn\u2019t oversell that the quality of life really improved. But there were certain [visual] tasks at which the patients were clearly better. So it shows to us that there is potential in this approach. It is still, in some ways, a prototype. They\u2019re working on iterations of this device that will be better.\u201d",
      "New upgrades to the device could be coming in the next couple of years.",
      "The PRIMA system was invented by Stanford University ophthalmology professor Daniel Palanker and is being developed by the California-based neural engineering company Science Corp.",
      "Palanker said technical improvements are being made to increase the number of pixels in the chip from 400 to 10,000. The new chips have already been tested in rats, and the upgraded chips are being manufactured for future human trials. With the aid of the camera\u2019s zoom function, Palanker said, that could theoretically enable patients to achieve 20/20 visual resolution.",
      "\u201cWe are also working on next-generation software that will allow patients to perceive not just black-and-white text, but also gray-scale natural images, such as faces,\u201d Palanker said.",
      "Palanker suggested that the technology could be trialed in other retinal diseases that cause blindness, such as Stargardt disease, which has similar symptoms to age-related macular degeneration but is genetic and usually affects younger people.",
      "Garg and Vavvas are eager to see larger trials that provide more details about how the device improves patients\u2019 ability to function day to day. Vavvas suggested that future trials should include a control arm to understand the extent to which the device yields real-world benefits, for example compared with existing electronic magnifiers.",
      "\u201cIs it something that is good enough for patients to say, \u2018Well, I\u2019ve regained my independence because I can now do my credit card bills myself, stamp and address my envelopes myself, and look at grocery store labels\u2019?\u201d Garg said. \u201cThose kinds of practical things I would like to know more about.\u201d",
      "Vavvas  said: \u201cThis is a chronic disease that you will have for life, so we need more than one year of follow-up to see other risks, other problems. Does that signal of efficacy that we see at 12 months remain two years later?\u201d",
      "While Vavvas said he would not call the device a panacea for blindness, the study showed that brain-computer interfaces can represent an important approach to tackling different kinds of severe visual impairment. \u201cAs the iterations of this device become better and better, it could become a real solution for a cohort of patients,\u201d he said."

      "President Donald Trump and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese signed an agreement at the White House on Monday on rare-earth minerals, which could serve as a bargaining chip as the United States fights a trade war with China.",
      "They signed the agreement at the top of the meeting, which Trump told the media had \"been negotiated over a period of four or five months.\"",
      "\"We got it done just in time for the visit,\" Trump told reporters. \"And we work together very much on rare earths, critical minerals and lots of other things, and we\u2019ve had a very good relationship. We\u2019ve been working on that for quite a while.\"",
      "Albanese said Australia has a $8.5 billion pipeline \"ready to go\" for the deal.",
      "A White House official said that under the deal, the U.S. and Australian governments plan to invest more than $3 billion together in critical mineral projects in the next six months, with recoverable resources estimated to be worth over $50 billion.",
      "Asked whether the United States plans to lift tariffs on Australia, Trump touted his general trade policies and eventually said: \"I will say this, Australia pays very low tariffs, very, very low tariffs. Australia pays among the lowest tariffs.\"",
      "The two leaders are also expected to discuss defense cooperation, Indo-Pacific stability and the AUKUS nuclear submarine deal, Albanese\u2019s office said Sunday.",
      "Albanese, whose center-left government was re-elected in May for a second term, said he looked forward to a \u201cpositive and constructive\u201d meeting with Trump.",
      "Australia, a country of about 27 million people, hasn\u2019t figured prominently in the second Trump administration so far. Unlike many U.S. trading partners, it has a large trade deficit with the United States, earning it the minimum tariff rate of 10%.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think Australia is particularly high on Trump\u2019s agenda,\u201d said Emma Shortis, director of the Australia Institute\u2019s International and Security Affairs Program.",
      "But the rest of the world may be watching the meeting closely, she said, \u201cto see how Trump treats a traditional ally.\u201d",
      "For Albanese, the bar for success is that the meeting \u201cisn\u2019t a disaster,\u201d Shortis said, avoiding the kind of Oval Office dressing-downs Trump delivered to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa.",
      "Resource-rich Australia has sensed an opportunity in recent U.S.-China tensions over rare-earth minerals, which are critical components of advanced electronics and defense technologies. China, which has a near-monopoly on their production and processing, has announced a series of export controls viewed as threatening the global supply.",
      "\u201cWe know that American companies desperately need critical minerals, and Australia is very well placed to service that need,\u201d Australian Treasurer Jim Chalmers told reporters in Washington on Friday.",
      "There has been some uneasiness in Australia that it has taken nine months for Trump and Albanese to have an official meeting, though they met briefly last month on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York.",
      "But there is also uneasiness about Albanese\u2019s meeting with Trump at all.",
      "Australia, whose population closely follows U.S. politics, is among the countries most critical of Trump, with 77% of survey respondents telling the Pew Research Center in the first months of his current term that they had \u201cno confidence\u201d in Trump to do the right thing regarding world affairs.",
      "A poll released by the Australia Institute in May found that more than 54% of respondents preferred a more independent foreign policy over a closer alliance with the United States, an increase of 10 percentage points compared with the same poll two months earlier, shortly after Trump returned to office.",
      "Though Australian support for the U.S. alliance has historically been strong, \u201cif the United States is not seen as a democracy or a nation of laws, then the alliance with the United States will come into question,\u201d said Brendon O\u2019Connor, a professor of U.S. politics and U.S. foreign relations at the United States Studies Centre at the University of Sydney.",
      "Albanese broke with the United States last month by formally recognizing a Palestinian state. He has praised Trump over the ceasefire he brokered in the Israel-Hamas war but will be cautious not to be seen as too \u201cfawning\u201d to Trump on \u201cissues around democracy and authoritarianism and internal dissent,\u201d O\u2019Connor said.",
      "The relationship has also been tested over the future of AUKUS (which stands for Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States), a $240 billion trilateral security deal in which Australia would buy U.S. nuclear-powered submarines in 2032 and then build a new submarine class with Britain.",
      "Australian officials have expressed confidence that the deal will move forward, even though it is currently under review by the Trump administration amid concerns that the U.S. may not be able to produce enough submarines for both itself and its ally.",
      "Australian Defense Minister Pat Conroy said last week that Australia would \u201cshortly\u201d make its second of three billion-dollar payments to help accelerate U.S. nuclear submarine production.",
      "\u201cI think there\u2019s reasons to be pretty skeptical about whether those submarines will ever arrive,\u201d O\u2019Connor said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not just up to Trump. I mean, six months before delivering them in the 2030s the United States can decide it doesn\u2019t have enough submarines to sell Australia three or four.\u201d",
      "Some in Australia have suggested that Albanese could shore up Trump\u2019s support for AUKUS by offering a critical minerals deal.",
      "Shortis was skeptical, arguing that \u201cTrump\u2019s word on any issue like this is not particularly reliable and can change very quickly.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what you offer Trump,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s never going to be enough.\u201d"

      "Designed to reflect the grandeur of the Second French Empire, the crown which features a gold circlet topped with golden eagles, was created in 1855 by Alexandre-Gabriel Lemonnier, one of Paris' most famous goldsmiths at the time, two years after Eug\u00e9nie\u2019s marriage to Napoleon III.",
      "Alexandre Giquello, president of Paris' well known Drouot auction house, told Reuters it was worth tens of millions of dollars.",
      "Investigators found the crown near the Louvre after it was apparently dropped by the thieves as they made their escape. It was reportedly recovered broken.",
      "Still missing however, is a reliquary brooch set with 94 diamonds. Crafted in 1855, it holds a sacred relic as a symbol of the Empress' Catholic faith, according to the Louvre\u2019s website.",
      "A large corsage bow set with 2,438 diamonds and 196 rose-cut stones was also taken from her collection, along with a tiara containing 212 pearls and nearly 2,000 diamonds, investigators said.",
      "Emerald necklace and earrings",
      "A necklace and matching earrings, commissioned by Napoleon Bonaparte to mark his second marriage to Marie\u2011Louise in 1810, were also taken by the thieves.",
      "With a striking 13.75-carat oval emerald at its center, the gold necklace is decorated with another 32 emeralds and more than 1,000 diamonds, according to the Louvre's website.",
      "After the fall of Napoleon\u2019s empire, Marie\u2011Louise passed the set, including a tiara, to a relative, and it remained in her family for generations. The Louvre bought it in 2004.",

      "The necklace, earrings and tiara each feature natural Ceylon sapphires set in gold and surrounded by diamonds.",

    "story": [
      "Iranian director Jafar Panahi puts a lot on the line for his work.",
      "Authorities could again arrest him for speaking out against the country\u2019s hard-line regime. They could send him back to the notoriously cruel Evin Prison in Tehran, which houses many of Iran\u2019s political dissidents. He could again be placed on house arrest and barred from making films.",
      "But Panahi, now 65, has largely ignored these attempts at silencing him over the years, instead focusing on doing what he loves most: making films about his homeland.",
      "When he was imprisoned and charged with \u201cpropagandizing against the government,\u201d he went on a hunger strike until authorities released him on bail. His filmmaking ban \u2014 which was supposed to last for 20 years \u2014 ended up serving as creative inspiration, fueling critically acclaimed films such as \u201cThis Is Not a Film\u201d and \u201cTaxi.\u201d",
      "With his latest movie, \u201cIt Was Just an Accident,\u201d which was released in limited North American theaters over the weekend, Panahi once again defied the government\u2019s attempts to censor his art, though it has meant putting himself at risk.",
      "\u201cYou have to find a way around the system,\u201d Panahi said in a recent interview conducted in Farsi at a hotel in Santa Monica, California, and translated into English by NBC News. Panahi, known for the signature sunglasses that he sports at every event, was sitting in the lobby next to his translator after enjoying a smoke break outside.",
      "The filmmaker has had a busy few months traveling the world to promote his film, a buzzy Oscar contender that was picked up for distribution in North America by Neon. He has also faced several hurdles coming from Iran \u2014 including missing a New York Film Festival screening after his visa process was delayed, reportedly because of the U.S. government shutdown.",
      "While on the press tour, he has continued to champion his message of the importance of freedom of expression.",
      "\u201cIt Was Just an Accident,\u201d a revenge drama that is sprinkled with comedic moments, follows a group of Iranians who capture a man whom they suspect was their interrogator while they were in prison. They quarrel about the man they have put in the back of their van and whether he is in fact the guard, noting both have an artificial leg that makes a squeaking noise when walking. The group also grapples with the morality behind taking vengeance, and whether that makes them just as bad as those who oppressed them.",
      "Panahi reflected on how his own time in prison shaped \u201cIt Was Just an Accident,\u201d which was the first film he directed after  spending seven months in Evin from 2022 to 2023.",
      "\u201cWhen you are imprisoned, it does not matter which group, which category and which party you are. We are all living with each other. And then when you go out, you can\u2019t separate from it. These all remain in your mind,\u201d he said. \u201cThis experience stays in your brain, and after you leave \u2026 you feel like you have to do something to express this.\u201d",
      "The filmmaker has previously spoken about his time at the prison, recalling how he was placed in solitary confinement and blindfolded during his hourslong interrogations. He drew from his own experiences, as well as from fellow political prisoners he met there, in writing the film, making it one of his most personal endeavors to date.",
      "But authorities in Iran oversee the media, so filmmakers must get their scripts approved to get film permits. While Panahi is no longer banned from filmmaking, he chose to shoot in secret, filming in Iran over the course of several weeks without official permission from the government because of the film\u2019s sensitive subject matter.",
      "The crew shot scenes in a remote desert location, in a van and in the streets of Tehran. Expecting trouble from authorities, the crew also took precautionary steps while moving around the city. Panahi told Vulture that in the summer of 2024, the crew was stopped by police during filming. They were asked to turn everything over but they handed over an empty memory card from a camera, rather than the actual footage of the film.",
      "They then waited a few weeks to resume the project and ended up editing part of the movie in France for safety reasons after the cast and crew had a run-in with authorities.",
      "\u201cIf you want to make a movie in Iran, you have to accept that is not possible through a regular path, you have to find an alternative path, and you either have to find it yourself or use other people\u2019s experience in doing so,\u201d Panahi said.",
      "Despite his years of political dissent and the personal price he has paid, Panahi is humble. He explained that it\u2019s the people of Iran who deserve praise for continuing to stand up to the government in the aftermath of the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody, which triggered huge, monthslong public protests that were labeled the Women, Life, Freedom movement.",
      "\u201cThey are more brave than I am,\u201d he said, noting that he\u2019s someone who is \u201cwell known\u201d and because of that has \u201csome protections in place.\u201d The activists \u201care not known to anyone,\u201d he said. They took to the streets, were jailed and released, and still continue to protest in their own ways.",
      "For example, there are women in Iran who now refuse to wear the mandatory hijab, instead walking around with their hair flowing freely. It\u2019s a subtle act of defiance that Panahi captured in his film, which shows its two female stars without headscarves in public in several scenes.",
      "It was important to Panahi to depict a \u201ctruthful picture of Iran,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve reached a point in history where everything is measured by whether it happened before or after the Women, Life, Freedom movement. If it\u2019s before, and you were showing in your film that there was a woman without the headscarf covering, it would not be believable.\u201d",
      "Those who admire Panahi say his art serves as its own powerful form of activism, as he balances politics with a personal touch that helps breathe levity into heavier topics.",
      "At the 2025 Cannes Film Festival, Panahi won the prestigious Palme d\u2019Or after the film received a nearly eight-minute standing ovation.",
      "The win marked the second time an Iranian filmmaker took home the award (Abbas Kiarostami was the first, winning in 1997 for \u201cTaste of Cherry\u201d). Panahi has now received the top prize at all three major European film festivals, including Berlin\u2019s Golden Bear for \u201cTaxi\u201d in 2015 and the Golden Lion at Venice for \u201cThe Circle\u201d in 2000.",
      "Oscar-winning actor Juliette Binoche, who served as the 2025 Cannes jury president, said that \u201cIt Was Just an Accident\u201d \u201csprings from a feeling of resistance, survival, which is absolutely necessary today.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very human and political at the same time, because he comes from a complicated country,\u201d she said at the event, according to Deadline. \u201cWhen we watched the film, it stood out.\u201d",
      "At the New York Film Festival earlier this month, Oscar-winning director Martin Scorsese also praised Panahi and called on more streaming services to champion Iranian cinema.",
      "As the film continues to rack up positive reviews and vies for Oscar nods, Panahi plans to continue to promote it at events.",
      "Other Iranian filmmakers, including Panahi\u2019s friend and fellow director Mohammad Rasoulof, have fled Iran to avoid facing fierce punishment.",
      "But when asked whether he fears the Iranian government lashing out at him again, Panahi appeared undeterred.",
      "\u201cWhat are they going to do that they haven\u2019t done already?\u201d he said."

      "Putin has warned that supplying Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine would be a \u201cqualitatively new stage of escalation.\u201d Zelenskyy said that Putin is \u201cafraid that United States will deliver us Tomahawks. And I think that he [is] really afraid that we will use\u201d them.",

      "\u201cIf we really want to have just and lasting peace, we need both sides of this tragedy,\u201d he said. \u201cHow can there be some deals without us about us?\u201d",
      "Asked if he would push to go to Budapest, Zelenskyy said he had told Trump: \u201cI\u2019m ready.\u201d",

      "Zelenskyy\u2019s latest visit to the U.S. came as Russia hammered Ukraine\u2019s energy infrastructure with drones and missiles in the past week, leading to blackouts across the country. Ukraine has been carrying out its own campaign targeting Russia\u2019s energy supply in a bid to impose economic pain on the Kremlin.",
      "\u201cWe are not losing this war, and Putin is not winning,\u201d Zelenskyy said, adding that Russia was stepping up airstrikes across Ukraine because of its \u201cweak position\u201d on the battlefield.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s why he really escalates airstrikes,\u201d Zelenskyy added, saying Putin wants an \u201cenergy disaster this winter by attacking us.\u201d",
      "Trump said in a social media post after meeting with Zelenskyy that Ukraine and Russia \u201cshould stop where they are,\u201d and that it was time to \u201cstop the killing, and make a DEAL.\u201d",

      "Peace talks have to take place in quiet, he added. \u201cNot under missiles, not under drones.\u201d",
      "Asked whether Trump can end the war, Zelenskyy said: \u201cGod bless, yes.\u201d"
